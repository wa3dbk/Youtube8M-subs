00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.430
 found by all by Edward Ferrara 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.770
 we have now entered the semester 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.080
 most frequently featured by 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.820
 temporal on temporal Italy that a 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.010
 can sometimes be accompanied by 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.210
 hail a phenomenon so feared 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.289
 especially for the damage it can 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.029
 cause 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.050
 but let's see briefly how the 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.369
 hailstorm 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.740
 well inside the cumulonimbus 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.349
 or the thundercloud become active 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.630
 of upward currents due 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.610
 precisely to the heating of the soil in the 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.260
 low layers and therefore more warm air 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.120
 light just waits to rise creating 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.160
 turbulence within this 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.630
 there are turbulence, the droplets 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.890
 of water condensing in the cloud 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.080
 thunderstorm 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.460
 but to reach a certain altitude 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.020
 ice does not point starting to form 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.210
 the grain of hail that with of 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.030
 hail that just going up towards 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.860
 up to grow its own diameter 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.660
 thanks precisely to further freezing 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.910
 of the water particles that yes 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.800
 stick to the grain then of di 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.420
 get under their own weight but 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.790
 rise again under the push 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.770
 of updrafts when the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.990
 grain weight is quite sufficient 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.250
 just to win the push 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.950
 then the grain of 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.440
 Hail falls down and so much more 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.480
 the hot air and therefore the turbulence and the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.460
 powerful lift all the more so 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.830
 falling bean will be big 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.390
 and indeed there is no lack of cases in Italy 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.770
 where hail can reach 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.600
 truly remarkable dimensions in 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.210
 particular this image refers 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.850
 to the frightening hail of August 28th 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.159
 of 2003 that occurred in Padua 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.110
 remember that as summer 2003 was 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.510
 particularly warm and indeed the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.670
 greater danger we say for hail 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.220
 large is also due to those 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.380
 particularly hot and sultry days and 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.360
 therefore with a lot of air 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.250
 warm and rich in humidity that I am the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.470
 indispensable fuel for i 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.120
 temporal as well as factors 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.950
 synoptics that can come into play 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.950
 together creating phenomena precisely 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.570
 particularly intense and violent as 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.520
 hail is measured there is an instrument 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.530
 appositely called grilli m and ha 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.810
 formed by a polystyrene panel 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.700
 usually 20 x 40 in size 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.069
 centimeters covered with a sheet 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.409
 of aluminum and which is in fact exposed 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.239
 to the weather and when it falls to 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.430
 hail this aluminum sheet comes 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.160
 precisely marked and can be calculated 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.810
 not only 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.370
 the size of the hailstone but 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.920
 also the kinetic energy of the grain 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.140
 same this tool is used for 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.700
 try to map the areas of italy more 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.200
 especially hail risk 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.170
 in the most sensitive areas from the point of 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.270
 agricultural view and given that precisely the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.000
 Hail can create serious discomfort 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.740
 own to the crop sector and in 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.970
 particular this tool is used 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.980
 precisely in the Trentino Alto Adige region 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.840
 that we know is a very area 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.710
 sensitive to violent storms e 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.930
 hailstorms 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.740
 for now I'll stop here and wish you all 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.740
 a pleasant evening
