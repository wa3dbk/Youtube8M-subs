00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
about supplements which I haven't got

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.819 
about supplements which I haven't got
into<00:00:20.810> a<00:00:20.869> lot<00:00:21.020> but<00:00:21.230> I'm<00:00:21.320> going<00:00:21.439> to<00:00:21.470> show<00:00:21.590> you<00:00:21.650> my

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
into a lot but I'm going to show you my

into a lot but I'm going to show you my
personal<00:00:22.160> supplement<00:00:22.789> bar<00:00:22.970> what<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:23.599> take<00:00:24.050> for

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
personal supplement bar what I take for

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.869 
personal supplement bar what I take for
my<00:00:24.439> training<00:00:24.770> now<00:00:25.369> it's<00:00:25.550> going<00:00:25.669> to<00:00:25.700> seem

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:25.879 
my training now it's going to seem

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:27.280 
my training now it's going to seem
pretty<00:00:25.939> extreme<00:00:26.419> because<00:00:26.689> most<00:00:26.930> of<00:00:27.020> you<00:00:27.140> only

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
pretty extreme because most of you only

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.080 
pretty extreme because most of you only
take<00:00:27.439> a<00:00:27.469> protein<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.040> that's<00:00:28.129> it<00:00:28.399> but<00:00:28.820> I<00:00:28.879> take

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
take a protein and that's it but I take

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.179 
take a protein and that's it but I take
several<00:00:29.540> types<00:00:29.719> of<00:00:29.809> proteins<00:00:30.200> first<00:00:30.829> of<00:00:31.040> all

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
several types of proteins first of all

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.790 
several types of proteins first of all
I'd<00:00:31.789> like<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.239> take<00:00:34.149> 100%<00:00:35.149> whey<00:00:35.450> protein<00:00:35.899> it's

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
I'd like to take 100% whey protein it's

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.139 
I'd like to take 100% whey protein it's
one<00:00:36.980> of<00:00:37.039> the<00:00:37.129> best<00:00:37.280> sources<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.760> protein<00:00:38.059> you

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
one of the best sources of protein you

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.910 
one of the best sources of protein you
can<00:00:38.180> get<00:00:38.449> it's<00:00:38.600> easy<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.870> digest<00:00:39.020> it's<00:00:39.620> in<00:00:39.770> your

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
can get it's easy to digest it's in your

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.150 
can get it's easy to digest it's in your
system<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.399> it<00:00:40.550> works<00:00:40.730> well<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:41.300> mix<00:00:42.079> that<00:00:42.670> with

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
system and it works well I mix that with

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.280 
system and it works well I mix that with
arginine<00:00:46.300> arginines<00:00:47.300> good<00:00:47.480> for<00:00:47.630> pumping<00:00:47.930> it

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
arginine arginines good for pumping it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.080 
arginine arginines good for pumping it
really<00:00:48.770> expands<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.489> must<00:00:49.670> I'll<00:00:49.790> get<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.060> a

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
really expands the must I'll get you a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.400 
really expands the must I'll get you a
super<00:00:50.390> pump<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:50.720> put<00:00:50.870> that<00:00:50.960> in<00:00:51.110> before<00:00:51.380> I

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
super pump I put that in before I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.110 
super pump I put that in before I
workout<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.310> I<00:00:52.430> can<00:00:52.579> see<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:52.820> difference

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
workout and I can see the difference

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.819 
workout and I can see the difference
that's<00:00:53.210> like<00:00:53.420> nitric<00:00:53.840> oxide<00:00:54.230> it<00:00:54.350> really<00:00:54.590> it

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
that's like nitric oxide it really it

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.710 
that's like nitric oxide it really it
blows<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.160> muscle<00:00:55.460> up<00:00:55.579> I<00:00:55.820> also<00:00:56.329> put<00:00:56.540> in<00:00:56.630> my

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
blows the muscle up I also put in my

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.740 
blows the muscle up I also put in my
protein<00:00:57.020> after<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:57.290> work<00:00:57.500> out<00:00:58.239> glutamine<00:00:59.239> if

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
protein after I work out glutamine if

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.850 
protein after I work out glutamine if
you<00:00:59.899> can't<00:01:00.079> find<00:01:00.290> it<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:00.410> one<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.590> these<00:01:00.649> things

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
you can't find it in one of these things

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.799 
you can't find it in one of these things
you<00:01:00.980> take<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:01.280> separately<00:01:01.660> replenishes<00:01:02.660> and

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
you take it separately replenishes and

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.719 
you take it separately replenishes and
repairs<00:01:03.110> muscle<00:01:03.649> tissues<00:01:03.950> that<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.579> breaks

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
repairs muscle tissues that it breaks

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.520 
repairs muscle tissues that it breaks
down<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:05.000> build<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.360> back<00:01:05.479> up<00:01:05.540> another<00:01:06.320> thing

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
down to build it back up another thing

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.010 
down to build it back up another thing
that<00:01:06.649> you<00:01:06.710> might<00:01:06.829> want<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.100> take

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
that you might want to take

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.840 
that you might want to take
branched-chain<00:01:09.020> amino<00:01:09.369> amino<00:01:10.369> acids<00:01:10.729> it's

branched-chain amino amino acids it's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.730 
branched-chain amino amino acids it's
not<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.090> pills<00:01:11.299> it's<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.570> powder<00:01:11.780> put<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.649> in

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
can think of for replenishing muscle I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.660 
can think of for replenishing muscle I
don't<00:01:30.590> know<00:01:30.649> that<00:01:30.799> I<00:01:30.859> need<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.159> but<00:01:31.369> I<00:01:31.429> don't

know that I don't so I put it in there
anyway<00:01:33.079> because<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.679> can't<00:01:33.889> hurt<00:01:34.100> it's<00:01:34.279> like

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
anyway because you can't hurt it's like

anyway because you can't hurt it's like
eating<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.729> extra<00:01:34.939> bit<00:01:35.119> of<00:01:35.149> amino<00:01:35.420> acids<00:01:35.719> when

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
eating the extra bit of amino acids when

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.949 
eating the extra bit of amino acids when
you<00:01:35.899> want<00:01:36.109> them<00:01:37.119> then<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.240> went<00:01:38.389> back<00:01:38.569> to<00:01:38.599> old

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
you want them then I went back to old

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.169

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.089 
school thought and I got myself Nelkin
egg<00:01:41.329> protein<00:01:41.779> milk<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.409> egg<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.829> the

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
egg protein milk and egg is the

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.039 
egg protein milk and egg is the
lifeblood<00:01:43.279> of<00:01:43.459> muscle<00:01:43.880> from<00:01:43.969> the<00:01:44.060> 60s<00:01:44.509> 70s<00:01:44.689> on

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
lifeblood of muscle from the 60s 70s on

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.749 
lifeblood of muscle from the 60s 70s on
this<00:01:45.649> is<00:01:45.799> what<00:01:45.950> gave<00:01:46.069> us<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.279> best<00:01:46.490> gains

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
this is what gave us the best gains

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.550 
this is what gave us the best gains
possible<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.689> Elkin<00:01:47.929> egg<00:01:48.020> protein<00:01:48.380> comes

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
possible the Elkin egg protein comes

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.660 
possible the Elkin egg protein comes
from<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.770> elk<00:01:48.889> and<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:49.069> comes<00:01:49.219> from<00:01:49.249> the<00:01:49.399> eggs

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
from the elk and it comes from the eggs

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.370 
from the elk and it comes from the eggs
it's<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:49.880> pure<00:01:50.060> protein<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:51.020> really<00:01:51.200> does

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
it's a pure protein and it really does

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.230 
it's a pure protein and it really does
build<00:01:51.619> your<00:01:51.770> muscle<00:01:52.039> take<00:01:52.459> it<00:01:52.579> before<00:01:52.939> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
build your muscle take it before and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.809 
build your muscle take it before and
after<00:01:53.419> I<00:01:53.659> workout<00:01:54.169> I<00:01:54.439> take<00:01:54.859> it<00:01:55.009> midday<00:01:55.249> and<00:01:55.700> I

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
after I workout I take it midday and I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.580 
after I workout I take it midday and I
also<00:01:55.969> take<00:01:56.149> it<00:01:56.270> at<00:01:56.359> bedtime<00:01:56.539> that<00:01:57.319> time<00:01:57.469> is

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
also take it at bedtime that time is

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.870 
also take it at bedtime that time is
very<00:01:57.770> important<00:01:58.159> because<00:01:58.310> when<00:01:58.669> you<00:01:58.729> go<00:01:58.759> to

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
very important because when you go to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.789 
very important because when you go to
sleep<00:01:59.029> an<00:01:59.240> eyes<00:01:59.329> on<00:01:59.479> your<00:01:59.599> body<00:01:59.779> rest<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.380> you

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
sleep an eyes on your body rest and you

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.589 
sleep an eyes on your body rest and you
want<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.069> repair<00:02:01.490> itself<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:01.999> so<00:02:02.119> protein

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
want it to repair itself and so protein

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.229 
want it to repair itself and so protein
goes<00:02:02.749> in<00:02:02.899> there<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.049> helps<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.319> repair<00:02:03.560> it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
goes in there and helps you repair it

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:10.449 
goes in there and helps you repair it
also<00:02:05.239> wax<00:02:06.139> amazed<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.939> a<00:02:09.130> it's<00:02:10.130> kind<00:02:10.429> of

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
also wax amazed this is a it's kind of

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.339 
also wax amazed this is a it's kind of
like<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> sugar<00:02:11.090> but<00:02:11.270> it's<00:02:11.390> not<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.050> carries

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
like a sugar but it's not and it carries

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.630 
like a sugar but it's not and it carries
the<00:02:12.380> protein<00:02:12.800> into<00:02:12.950> your<00:02:13.010> muscle<00:02:13.310> after<00:02:13.580> you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the protein into your muscle after you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.460 
the protein into your muscle after you
train<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.450> pushes<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.900> through<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.290> helps

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
train and it pushes it through and helps

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.250 
train and it pushes it through and helps
your<00:02:15.560> muscle<00:02:15.830> repair<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.370> grow<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:17.110> they<00:02:18.110> all

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
your muscle repair and grow and they all

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.510 
your muscle repair and grow and they all
do<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.530> same<00:02:18.560> thing<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:18.980> mean<00:02:19.010> not<00:02:19.310> all<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
do the same thing I mean not all the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.070 
do the same thing I mean not all the
same<00:02:19.640> thing<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:19.820> they're<00:02:20.330> varied<00:02:20.720> ways<00:02:20.900> if

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
same thing but they're varied ways if

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.060 
same thing but they're varied ways if
they<00:02:21.110> do<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.590> put<00:02:21.770> them<00:02:21.830> all<00:02:21.950> together

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
they do it and I put them all together

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.720 
they do it and I put them all together
because<00:02:22.400> I

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
because I

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.309 
because I
you<00:02:22.909> just<00:02:23.120> can't<00:02:23.300> go<00:02:23.420> wrong<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.900> have<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.170> have

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319

morning I feel like I'm going through a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.199 
morning I feel like I'm going through a
chemistry<00:02:28.760> set

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
chemistry set

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.789
