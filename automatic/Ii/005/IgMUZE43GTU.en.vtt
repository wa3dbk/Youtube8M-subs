so you do this for six minutes and to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.630 
so you do this for six minutes and to
get<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> best<00:02:42.690> result<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.290> do<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:43.640> three

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
get the best result and do it three

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.229 
get the best result and do it three
times

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.820 

you<00:05:50.050> can<00:05:50.230> do<00:05:50.350> it<00:05:50.380> more<00:05:50.680> if<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:51.730> like<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:53.710> that

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
often you'll start to feel peaceful just

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:34.090

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.360
