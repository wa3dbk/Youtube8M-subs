00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
 yes 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.340
 and sandra who made the difference yesterday 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.650
 finished sixth and today he enters the 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.860
 podium then look I think the fact of 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.620
 be at home because if you are very excited 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.209
 and obviously the truth is I have to 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.890
 say to the woman we started with a little 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.960
 of anxiety we were like we were 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.089
 motivated but at the same time, like, 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.289
 we wanted and we wanted not today and we 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.179
 we raised we agreed 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.569
 we said you know we 're going to enjoy it 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.300
 shot by shot we had a lot of communication 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.640
 the truth we did very good we had very 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.820
 good connection to zedillo and I think that 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.780
 that took us to the medal 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.359
 very important also the support of the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.949
 public that did not stop encouraging the whole 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.719
 the time the truth is that they are 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.059
 I thank you very much for 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:49.449
 be here really that that support 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.309
 it did not really make the fact vibrate 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.170
 that you know you're going to throw away and you have 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.969
 someone good not someone to many 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.699
 people behind you who are going to 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.670
 celebrate your shots the truth is that 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.339
 good not priceless thousand thanks 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.080
 true for all that cheer and thanks to 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.140
 all the equipment 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.810
 we made a good team there and as it should 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.730
 of being is not good communication and good 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.990
 here is the result also confirms 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.410
 the hope that you had of 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.320
 get a metal I had the thorn and 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.460
 four years ago it was bronze and the truth 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.350
 is that I did not want to be left without 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.780
 couples medal I swear to you 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.090
 well I asked god give us give us 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.010
 patience because we really fight 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.710
 until the end and good was achieved and 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.480
 thank you because now it was silver and there would be 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.100
 what to mention do et also so that 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.070
 the public finds out that this medal is 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.100
 get in front of a great team like the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.260
 of the USA that are 100% professional 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.530
 that should be highlighted as well and that's how it is 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.570
 good usa how do you say it if they are the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.330
 professionals though and we go to all 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.130
 not today we go to the gold medal 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.229
 We started very down but we did everything 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.810
 possible to get to the top we were 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.370
 second place is how sandra says no 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.320
 it tastes like gold 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.960
 something was something unforgettable was it was a 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.960
 beautiful team we made a harmony a 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.580
 connecting a computer where a couple 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.650
 there was a result that was the medal not 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.050
 when did you feel about the game that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.400
 they already had the good medal as he did in 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.190
 the bowling this does not end until it 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.430
 finish then you can be 100 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.650
 pines of the second place and third but 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.080
 Now, yes, until it's over 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.690
 I ended up I wanted him at all times 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.060
 even though we were going up there one did not 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 You can let your guard down because it raises osa 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.350
 we climb so low by with a high line 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.110
 we go up with a low line as we go down 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.880
 then in no time we lost that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.700
 we want to win that medal however 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.530
 We went shot by shot shot after shot to 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.540
 get this medal the forecast 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.910
 for the individual as we go through 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.410
 on the podium is not what we want 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.530
 to do everything possible and we will be 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.530
 there
