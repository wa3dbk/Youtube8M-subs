 a double feeling she turns out to be 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.480
 renewal and yet it just doesn't work out 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.480
 to convince the jury 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.380
 az everything on everything wants just one thing 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.960

 in which she can show that she is the best 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.080

 we always practice first on the floor and

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.959
 jury no longer influences but I found 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:29.990
 this a carol doorway 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:31.410

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.060
 hare 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.380
 Laura and John of course not too 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.200
 we forget they are a great 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.700
 duo together it's all right what they do 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.250
 do it together you see that they are delicious 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.710
 they are used to trust each other and me 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.030
 have to say I let one moved often 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.030
 how pathetic 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.500
 that is motorbikes , she is frightened 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.450
 from the jury as she sat through beautifully 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.670
 tell from martinus 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.650
 yes laura i am first speech 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.180
 so I think you finally have it now 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.180
 show what I expect for you 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.230
 and to that I want to add that laura 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.940
 So now you have elements to show them 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.100
 that really in the art world 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.170
 mandatory elements and that what 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.970
 more difficult and that you now finally 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.970
 showing what I want to see from you 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.590
 yes I I'm you from now the point 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.970
 of course there are not yet any 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.820
 I think it can't be missed anymore 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.180
 behavior we are going to experience it 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.980
 marlies blue you are really born 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.590
 showgirl and after love you for it 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.780
 I still have a small blow because 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.550
 we were three landings with them 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.230
 so went perfectly perfect for now 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.230
 very well deserved 9 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.230
 patrice there was praising so yes I know 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.000
 if I land like that every day it won't 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.000
 erg and 10 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:04.279
 dear laar I know it all week 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.859
 about martine so i'm whole 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:10.279
 curious about her points 

00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:11.869
 martina ja laura i think this is one 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:15.159
 perfect cure is just as I have 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:15.159
 indicated you get a 10 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:26.569
 wow what we dream come true but 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:28.460
 well jodi goes in it we have a yes you 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.270
 your partner own so you skate with him 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.500
 two 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.110
 but you don't actually have your partner 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.969
 needed you can take your own one 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.969
 skating and 9 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.530
 being a beautiful are what an opening that 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.150
 mean average of 9 point five 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.460
 eliza of course the first to enter the style 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.930
 first, but the danger is 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.849
 must have high points that it does have a few 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.349
 once experienced that it wasn't really there 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:53.150
 is voted on and so it is 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.139
 importantly you want laura to continue 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.020
 to the final 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:01.310
 Then call 0909 one he left one 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.599
 or s miss laura to 4600 must be like this 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.050
 by 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.050
 thank you
