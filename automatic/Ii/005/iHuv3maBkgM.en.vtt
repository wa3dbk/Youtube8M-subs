road crawled out the passenger side
right<00:03:43.760> after<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.300> accident<00:03:44.570> this<00:03:45.500> clock

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
right after that accident this clock

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.190 
right after that accident this clock
came<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.220> be<00:03:46.370> because<00:03:47.210> i<00:03:47.450> realized<00:03:47.810> my<00:03:47.900> time

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
came to be because i realized my time

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.100 
came to be because i realized my time
was<00:03:48.380> not<00:03:48.500> endless<00:03:48.830> on<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:49.370> planet<00:03:49.640> and

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
was not endless on this planet and

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.630 
was not endless on this planet and
that's<00:03:51.110> what<00:03:51.440> endless<00:03:51.920> time<00:03:52.130> was<00:03:52.340> derived

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
that's what endless time was derived

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.370 
that's what endless time was derived
from<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.780> been<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.050> most<00:03:54.080> successful

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
from and it's been the most successful

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.590 
from and it's been the most successful
clock<00:03:54.980> I've<00:03:55.160> ever<00:03:55.310> designed

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.070 

you

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.540 

remember<00:04:03.080> seeing<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.500> movie<00:04:03.650> Edison<00:04:04.280> many

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
remember seeing the movie Edison many

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.670 
remember seeing the movie Edison many
years<00:04:04.819> ago<00:04:04.940> when<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.180> was<00:04:05.270> a<00:04:05.330> young<00:04:05.510> boy<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.050> I

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
years ago when I was a young boy and I

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.320 
years ago when I was a young boy and I
was<00:04:06.800> fascinated<00:04:07.069> with<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.640> fact<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:08.030> what<00:04:08.180> he

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
was fascinated with the fact of what he

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.210 
was fascinated with the fact of what he
could<00:04:08.510> do<00:04:08.660> as<00:04:08.810> an<00:04:08.900> inventor<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.560> what<00:04:09.860> he<00:04:10.010> went

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
could do as an inventor and what he went

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.600 
could do as an inventor and what he went
through<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.730> create<00:04:11.120> what<00:04:11.360> he<00:04:11.480> created<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.610> I

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
through to create what he created and I

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.060 
through to create what he created and I
and<00:04:14.060> boys<00:04:14.810> been<00:04:15.080> fascinated<00:04:15.530> with<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.770> kind

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
and boys been fascinated with that kind

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.610 
and boys been fascinated with that kind
of<00:04:16.160> approach<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.900> what<00:04:18.079> I'm<00:04:18.200> doing<00:04:18.230> is

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
of approach and so what I'm doing is

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.210 
of approach and so what I'm doing is
somewhat<00:04:19.010> scientific<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.540> in<00:04:20.840> dental<00:04:21.410> but<00:04:22.070> it

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
somewhat scientific and in dental but it

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.010 
somewhat scientific and in dental but it
also<00:04:22.430> is<00:04:22.640> artistic<00:04:23.300> because<00:04:23.480> it<00:04:23.600> has<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.750> flow

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
also is artistic because it has a flow

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.560 
also is artistic because it has a flow
to<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.290> as<00:04:24.680> well<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.760> think<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.150> more<00:04:26.360> you

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
to it as well and I think the more you

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.340 
to it as well and I think the more you
let<00:04:26.870> get<00:04:27.140> be<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:28.160> more<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.790> artistic<00:04:29.450> quality

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
let get be the more the artistic quality

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.310 
let get be the more the artistic quality
comes<00:04:30.590> out<00:04:30.880> by<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.120> i<00:04:32.150> mean<00:04:32.570> it's<00:04:32.900> difficult

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
comes out by that i mean it's difficult

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.670 
comes out by that i mean it's difficult
to<00:04:33.560> say<00:04:33.770> what<00:04:34.580> was<00:04:34.910> what<00:04:35.540> separates<00:04:36.500> the

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
to say what was what separates the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.460 
to say what was what separates the
artist<00:04:37.040> from<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.400> non<00:04:37.760> artists<00:04:38.150> i<00:04:38.450> think<00:04:39.290> what

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
artist from the non artists i think what

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.970 
artist from the non artists i think what
the<00:04:39.560> key<00:04:39.740> is<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.280> ability<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:41.980> see

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
the key is is the ability to see

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.159 
the key is is the ability to see
something<00:04:43.280> or<00:04:43.610> feel<00:04:43.880> something<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.540> have<00:04:45.140> it

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
something or feel something and have it

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.840 
something or feel something and have it
actually<00:04:45.880> happen<00:04:47.260> but<00:04:48.260> let<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.530> happen<00:04:48.850> it's

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
actually happen but let it happen it's

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.909 
actually happen but let it happen it's
not<00:04:50.060> something<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:50.450> can<00:04:50.540> force<00:04:53.650> this<00:04:54.650> piece

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
not something you can force this piece

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.180 
not something you can force this piece

I<00:05:19.520> think<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:19.820> that's<00:05:19.990> paramount<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:22.760> be

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
I think that that's paramount that to be

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.480 
I think that that's paramount that to be
in<00:05:23.150> tune<00:05:23.390> with<00:05:23.690> that<00:05:23.720> you<00:05:24.470> have<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.830> be<00:05:24.950> relaxed

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
in tune with that you have to be relaxed

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.310 
in tune with that you have to be relaxed
and<00:05:25.580> you<00:05:25.669> have<00:05:25.880> to<00:05:26.030> let<00:05:26.300> it<00:05:26.479> flow<00:05:26.900> through<00:05:27.200> you

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
and you have to let it flow through you

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.400 
and you have to let it flow through you
and<00:05:27.640> then<00:05:28.640> when<00:05:29.060> that<00:05:29.180> happens<00:05:29.600> you<00:05:29.930> truly<00:05:30.290> are

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
and then when that happens you truly are

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.980 
and then when that happens you truly are
an<00:05:30.530> artist<00:05:30.710> you<00:05:31.430> evolve<00:05:31.790> and<00:05:32.450> I<00:05:32.600> think<00:05:32.810> that's

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
an artist you evolve and I think that's

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.280 
an artist you evolve and I think that's
important<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:34.370> keep<00:05:34.610> your<00:05:34.820> enthusiasm<00:05:35.570> as<00:05:35.720> an

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
important to keep your enthusiasm as an

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.880 
important to keep your enthusiasm as an
artist<00:05:36.590> is<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:37.010> have<00:05:37.240> to<00:05:38.240> evolve<00:05:38.630> I<00:05:39.080> think

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
artist is to have to evolve I think

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.590 
artist is to have to evolve I think
that's<00:05:40.070> true<00:05:40.280> with<00:05:40.430> any<00:05:40.580> of<00:05:40.760> us<00:05:40.880> that<00:05:41.090> want<00:05:41.270> to

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
that's true with any of us that want to

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.110 
that's true with any of us that want to
be<00:05:42.380> successful<00:05:42.770> with<00:05:43.160> whatever<00:05:43.370> business<00:05:43.700> you

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
be successful with whatever business you

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.750 
be successful with whatever business you
are<00:05:44.330> in<00:05:44.450> if<00:05:44.930> you<00:05:45.740> evolve<00:05:46.130> you're<00:05:46.400> constantly

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
are in if you evolve you're constantly

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.400 
are in if you evolve you're constantly
evolving<00:05:47.270> your<00:05:47.570> excitement<00:05:47.930> Your<00:05:48.320> Enthusiasm

evolving your excitement Your Enthusiasm
stays<00:05:49.190> up<00:05:49.400> at<00:05:49.550> you<00:05:49.700> become<00:05:50.570> more<00:05:50.780> successful

stays up at you become more successful
I

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.750 

I<00:05:58.840> think<00:05:59.840> the<00:06:00.020> ones<00:06:00.260> of<00:06:00.530> a<00:06:00.770> kind<00:06:01.070> are<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.580> ones

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
I think the ones of a kind are the ones

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.750 
I think the ones of a kind are the ones
that<00:06:01.880> are<00:06:02.090> difficult<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.870> part<00:06:03.140> with<00:06:03.610> to<00:06:04.610> do

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
that are difficult to part with to do

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.930 
that are difficult to part with to do
that<00:06:04.970> twice<00:06:05.330> is<00:06:06.220> pretty<00:06:07.220> much<00:06:07.400> not<00:06:07.700> going<00:06:07.880> to

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
that twice is pretty much not going to

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.030 
that twice is pretty much not going to
happen<00:06:08.090> and<00:06:08.450> you<00:06:09.170> know<00:06:09.350> that<00:06:09.560> when<00:06:09.710> you<00:06:09.800> hand

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
happen and you know that when you hand

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.890 
happen and you know that when you hand
that<00:06:10.100> to<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:10.460> customer<00:06:13.150> so<00:06:14.150> I<00:06:14.480> think<00:06:14.570> it's

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
that to the customer so I think it's

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.320 
that to the customer so I think it's
important<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.950> if<00:06:16.070> you<00:06:16.220> can<00:06:16.460> replicate<00:06:16.730> a

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
important that if you can replicate a

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.110 
important that if you can replicate a
design<00:06:18.140> if<00:06:18.410> it<00:06:18.920> works<00:06:19.190> of<00:06:19.400> people<00:06:19.730> like<00:06:19.940> it

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
design if it works of people like it

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.920 
design if it works of people like it
that's<00:06:20.480> the<00:06:20.690> key<00:06:21.910> that's<00:06:22.910> good<00:06:23.150> that's<00:06:23.780> a<00:06:23.900> good

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
that's the key that's good that's a good

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.230 
that's the key that's good that's a good
thing<00:06:24.310> but<00:06:25.310> like<00:06:25.700> ones<00:06:26.090> of<00:06:26.240> a<00:06:26.300> kind<00:06:28.240> it's

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
thing but like ones of a kind it's

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.740 
thing but like ones of a kind it's
difficult<00:06:29.710> because<00:06:30.710> it<00:06:30.920> is<00:06:31.040> a<00:06:31.070> piece<00:06:31.340> of<00:06:31.370> you

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
difficult because it is a piece of you

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.110 
difficult because it is a piece of you
it's<00:06:32.750> a<00:06:32.930> time<00:06:33.280> when<00:06:34.280> you<00:06:34.400> gave<00:06:34.610> that<00:06:34.640> piece<00:06:35.090> of

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
it's a time when you gave that piece of

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.200 
it's a time when you gave that piece of
that<00:06:35.450> time<00:06:35.810> that<00:06:36.770> you<00:06:36.950> had<00:06:37.130> creating<00:06:38.090> that

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
that time that you had creating that

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.170 
that time that you had creating that
piece<00:06:38.480> to<00:06:38.930> someone<00:06:39.380> it's<00:06:40.190> almost<00:06:40.430> as<00:06:40.730> if<00:06:40.790> it's
