00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:10.360
 this death and we begin to care 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.190
 we started like this from nowhere so 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:26.860
 because we have to be with this camera 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:30.410
 no jodas wrote incredible but that 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:34.610
 we have to be in first person that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.260
 It is crazy I can not put into 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.810
 third person 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.210
 whatsapp fac incredible good we are 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.230
 here in the first game death of that 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.300
 I do and that is the beginning exactly the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:54.489
 chapter is called the beginning it cures me 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.489
 good but it's good 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.640
 and how is the beginning only five 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.870
 minutes the game already sees it and already sees it and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.870
 You see son of a bitch 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.990
 every minute fuck 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.979
 my years, my god because he has to 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:20.200
 fall face to face 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.390
 you also let me take you 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.240
 as well 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.500
 back in the back the bastard like that 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.270
 play 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.729
 low 100 targets but 5 posts 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.000
 minutes and if you want to configure the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.649
 games of madness we are first 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.969
 we are first and that is a merit 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.979
 in the first person it is a bit complicated 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.979
 but nothing is complicated for me 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.680
 thomas thomas is this low run 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 for for low gusts 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.080
 but that's incredible we're on a streak 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.080
 shit 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:12.539
 5 minutes but high high voltage 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.539
 tension takes all of that 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.490
 or lolo while no longer mentally 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.700

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.450
 game 90 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:33.780
 They resold them very late very late 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.780
 just as fast if you do not win 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.700
 that's taken care of but there's shit I told you 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:48.510
 from bursting I was blown up 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.510
 two minutes and if I first go 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.830

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:01.170

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.130

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.990
 I killed him I thought it was like that I know I'm going 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.740
 to remove the prey and I was going to put 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.740

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.290

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.520
