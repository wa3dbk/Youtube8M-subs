 all the other journalists that the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.540
 questions are going to this look at the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.850
 proposal is being made by a militant 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.960
 of psv the united socialist party of 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.940
 venezuela of which I am a militant 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.399
 the president of the republic the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.649
 mature nicholas president did the 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.860
 proposal I am an active militant of 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.040
 psv I was a mayor candidate in the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.390
 uracoa municipality of the monagas state in 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.409
 the 2008 then I was delegate of the party 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.770
 delegate to the congress functions 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.470
 founding party where I know where 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.960
 the statutes were established was established 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.580
 what about the red book then I went to some 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.470
 inside the National Assembly out 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.840
 elected by circuit 1 where he was 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.630
 alternate with the deputy then I think 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.920
 that the question is obvious I give back 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.330
 one question, who did you go to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 vote for the proposal you are making 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.960
 the president of which is also 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.360
 militant and a proposal that goes on 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.140
 benefit of the people of solano of the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.270
 most is a proposal that is going 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.920
 against going to stop to end up in 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.050
 against this scourge that is corruption 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.940
 that is a scourge that is ending for 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.250
 nobody a secret in fact there has already been 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.929
 several cases of the same government of people 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.899
 ongoing in corruption that is 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.890
 is attacking and good and is a is a 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.970
 proposal that the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.000
 President 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.560
 asking for an empowering power to 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.420
 go against usury and the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.220
 hoarding and economic war 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.500
 that we have at this moment 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.270
 circumstantial in the country then I 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.600
 I exhaust me wonder why I had to 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.600
 do what 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 look no further, speculation has been 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.250
 more has been the speculation and I invite 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.520
 to have speculated why I look at my 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.710
 House every Saturday and Sunday 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.630
 bought the national press the national 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.760
 universal tom all his period of last 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.770
 good news and I'm staying 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.320
 impressed as everyone did his 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.510
 analysis in its own way and in the morning 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.130
 help the town market where I 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.860
 I live and they told me you are important 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.700
 imagine that then they looked for 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.430
 way that as disqualifying 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.590
 I do not know with what intention I know with what 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.879
 intention to intimidate me that I 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.730
 go on air at the best now of 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.530
 mind and if you look at it came out then that's 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.290
 it was like more anger to go every day was worse 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.000
 more intense the disqualification that 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.470
 they gave a million dollars that helping 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.110
 an armored truck with a little 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.970
 escort that I had in strong tiuna that I 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.130
 I left the maturin house I do not live 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.319
 in maturín and I have almost in maturín my 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.150
 family does not live in maturín that my dad 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.430
 Even that was given by my dad who ran away 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.130
 of a depression for what it says and for a 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.530
 Asylum that I was always going to visit him 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.930
 my dad we are never in an insane asylum 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.799
 that came the only thing that the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.970
 true that I was an active militant 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.560
 had a political career in the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.349
 rajoy municipality that had lost the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.840
 mayoralty by 236 votes the only thing I saw 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.890
 a summary an analysis that made a 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.970
 Saturday in one of the newspapers 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.360
 national good this lies 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.440
 They have short legs. I did not stop him much. 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.440
 that's because it 's a lie 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.390
 for a long time 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.599
 they told us that they saw it recently 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:02.969
 I already said it right now I was the day of the 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.159
 The only truth is that I went to the mass that 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.599
 I go every year, sacredly, daily 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.120
 of San Carlos in my town that swears 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.340
 things and I was two Monday but everything 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.200
 normal I had in the mass to share with the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.750
 people and from there I went to visit a friend 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.370
 who lives who lives near and in the village and 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.250
 He invited me to his house because one day 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.139
 party a day was a day very very 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.389
 sacred to the people and is a 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.849
 custom that he and swears with this in that 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.600
 day all gathered there are shared of 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.150
 all 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.860
 she did not communicate with me 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.810
 first try I do not what happens that 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.970
 there is a confusion 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.200
 they have wanted to see me they have wanted to make see 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.710
 how I supported the governor 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.590
 briceño that's a thing so 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.770
 personal and political aspects of another because 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.780
 it is explained look I am a militant of psv 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.370
 I am not militant of the table the unit 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.230
 of no party the only party that 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.510
 is registered in the pcv then 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.300
 they wanted to confuse something like I did 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.550
 I respect your opinion and your position and 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.550
 I ask now that I am giving you this 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.130
 possibility to you that you will get to 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.230
 national level and I ask them to 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.690
 also respect my position 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.370
 everyone I consume I respect that of 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.560
 them but that respect my decision 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:27.770
 politics and staff and I respect you 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:27.770
 also the property 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.170
 but they are two things are two things 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.750
 completely different from the 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.150
 persecution that's a lie is part 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.730
 also of disqualification and what 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.710
 better to try to confuse people 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.980
 what about her because I was calm 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.240
 not the case of the good deputy she 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.760
 he said it even in the session on Tuesday 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.940
 that they already go to court to bring their 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.040
 I plead your evidence your documents that 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.400
 will have to refute of which they are 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.150
 accusing the immunity the 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.610
 trespassing 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.710
 is the legal way constitutionally for 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.900
 so that she can as a citizen 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.120
 normal to be investigated then not 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.510
 I understand others the rest I more than 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.360
 everything more than anything is the filling of a 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.740
 concert of disqualifications and of and of 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.740
 confusion that what really 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.479
 and said the deputy who votes I 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.739
 I said nice people went crazy 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.789
 militant the party 

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:34.569
 the proposal is being followed by 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.569
 president why 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.349
 because that knows that I was not in 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:44.300
 caracas look what they are like 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.220
 to - face yesterday a deputy told me 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.900
 I had a hotel nearby then it sounded me 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.879
 I came yesterday I was called by a journalist from 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.129
 Leader panorama newspaper let me know 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.659
 I incorporated that legally it only happened to 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:55.849
 be him the main deputy that you 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.340
 today the statement but and yesterday was that 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:01.389
 I came to the capital here and today I am 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.389
 attending my normal session 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:10.060
 yes because that was logical 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.550
 if it was the first moment to turn 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.199
 tell you look I'm going to accompany you I'm not going to 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.850

 to vote let's go
