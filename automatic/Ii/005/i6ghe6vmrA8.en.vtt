00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
I was asked this question in my all

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.550 
I was asked this question in my all
about<00:00:13.980> defusing<00:00:14.519> video<00:00:15.059> as<00:00:15.449> well<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:16.410> I've

about defusing video as well as I've

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.679 
about defusing video as well as I've
been<00:00:16.800> asked<00:00:17.099> this<00:00:17.189> question<00:00:17.730> multiple<00:00:18.150> times

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
been asked this question multiple times

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.189 
been asked this question multiple times
just<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.679> about<00:00:19.769> I<00:00:20.339> think<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.449> people

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
just out and about I think that people

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.300 
just out and about I think that people
think<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:23.300> certain<00:00:24.300> textures<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.140> hair<00:00:25.679> do

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
think that certain textures of hair do

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.999 
think that certain textures of hair do
not<00:00:26.609> do<00:00:27.150> protective<00:00:27.810> styling<00:00:28.999> however<00:00:29.999> I<00:00:30.300> do

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
not do protective styling however I do

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.040 
not do protective styling however I do
protective<00:00:32.009> styling<00:00:32.280> as<00:00:32.700> well<00:00:33.390> as<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.720> believe

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
protective styling as well as I believe

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.930 
protective styling as well as I believe
that<00:00:34.500> everyone<00:00:34.890> should<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.400> protective

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that everyone should do protective

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940 
that everyone should do protective
styling

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.740 

so<00:00:39.870> protective<00:00:40.870> styling<00:00:41.440> it<00:00:42.010> does<00:00:42.700> not<00:00:42.880> help

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
so protective styling it does not help

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.620 
so protective styling it does not help
your<00:00:44.020> hair<00:00:44.260> grow<00:00:44.290> it<00:00:44.770> is<00:00:44.890> not<00:00:45.480> making<00:00:46.480> your

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
your hair grow it is not making your

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.790 
your hair grow it is not making your
hair<00:00:46.900> grow<00:00:47.260> faster<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.310> should<00:00:48.640> say<00:00:48.880> it<00:00:49.120> is

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
hair grow faster I should say it is

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.540 
hair grow faster I should say it is
helping<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.820> not<00:00:52.030> have<00:00:53.020> breakage<00:00:53.920> in<00:00:54.280> your

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
excellent ways as far as people with

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.379 
excellent ways as far as people with
with<00:02:44.139> shorter<00:02:45.139> hair<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:46.190> for<00:02:46.639> example<00:02:46.760> if<00:02:47.269> you

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
with shorter hair so for example if you

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.610 
with shorter hair so for example if you
have<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:48.019> TWA<00:02:48.799> then<00:02:49.639> you<00:02:50.299> can<00:02:50.630> definitely<00:02:51.410> get
