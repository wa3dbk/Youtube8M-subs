00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
Ward like right there for something so i

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.990 
Ward like right there for something so i
could<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:38.910> him<00:02:39.000> coming<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.450> from<00:02:39.690> over<00:02:39.780> there

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.160 

obviously<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.239> was<00:02:45.390> actually<00:02:45.630> counted

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
obviously if I was actually counted

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.570 
obviously if I was actually counted
generally<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.590> believe<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> those<00:02:47.280> rates

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
generally I believe one of those rates

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.780 
generally I believe one of those rates
up<00:02:47.880> since<00:02:48.660> I'm<00:02:48.810> not<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.980> could<00:02:50.220> maybe<00:02:50.489> burn

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
up since I'm not and I could maybe burn

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.580 
up since I'm not and I could maybe burn
the<00:02:51.000> other<00:02:51.120> world<00:02:51.420> like<00:02:51.690> right<00:02:51.959> here<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the other world like right here and I

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.140 
the other world like right here and I
could<00:02:52.769> sit<00:02:53.010> here<00:02:53.040> away<00:02:53.370> from<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.790> red<00:02:53.970> buff

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
could sit here away from the do red buff

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.330 
could sit here away from the do red buff
and<00:02:54.510> then<00:02:55.170> while<00:02:55.350> he's<00:02:55.470> doing<00:02:55.590> red<00:02:55.799> buff<00:02:55.980> go<00:02:56.190> in

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
and then while he's doing red buff go in

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.640 
and then while he's doing red buff go in
like<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:57.049> but<00:02:58.049> obviously<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.530> wouldn't

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
like that but obviously that wouldn't

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.390 
like that but obviously that wouldn't
happen

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
happen

these games you know running snowball

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.580 
these games you know running snowball
running<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:49.870> why<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.049> probably<00:03:50.409> should

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
running this is why you probably should

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.220

take snowball at level 2 not look before

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.159 
take snowball at level 2 not look before
so<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.290> can<00:03:53.469> gank<00:03:53.709> earlier<00:03:54.540> but<00:03:55.540> other<00:03:56.049> than

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
so you can gank earlier but other than

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.459 
so you can gank earlier but other than
that<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.949> was<00:03:57.099> still<00:03:57.370> pretty<00:03:57.489> good<00:03:58.469> really

00:03:59.459 --> 00:03:59.469 
that it was still pretty good really

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.319 
that it was still pretty good really
fast<00:03:59.709> could<00:04:00.040> sustain<00:04:00.689> good<00:04:01.689> counter<00:04:02.079> jungling

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
fast could sustain good counter jungling

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.089 
fast could sustain good counter jungling
but<00:04:04.329> I<00:04:04.599> guess<00:04:04.840> there's<00:04:05.049> near<00:04:05.290> him<00:04:05.439> play<00:04:05.769> always

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099
