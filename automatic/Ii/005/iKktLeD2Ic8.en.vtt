00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
honestly not that strong unless of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.039 
honestly not that strong unless of
course<00:01:08.820> he<00:01:09.030> stuck<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> bunch<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.750> them<00:01:09.900> together

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
course he stuck a bunch of them together

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.380

targets<00:01:52.640> it's<00:01:53.640> honestly<00:01:54.180> doubt<00:01:54.990> ability<00:01:55.439> as

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
targets it's honestly doubt ability as

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.370 
targets it's honestly doubt ability as
well<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:56.040> know<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:57.090> slow

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
well you know it's it's it's slow

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.190 
well you know it's it's it's slow
it<00:01:59.189> they<00:01:59.729> ought<00:01:59.939> they<00:02:00.149> always<00:02:00.420> spread<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
it they ought they always spread out and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
it they ought they always spread out and
you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:01.890> weird<00:02:02.549> ways<00:02:02.820> when<00:02:03.149> they

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you know really weird ways when they

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.830 
you know really weird ways when they
land<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.180> spell<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.630> well

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
land I I just think that spell as well

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.729 
land I I just think that spell as well
as<00:02:07.079> really<00:02:07.649> crap<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.130> well<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.989> I<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.470> find<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
as really crap as well as I just find it

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.550 
as really crap as well as I just find it
to<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.979> very<00:02:11.069> unreliable<00:02:11.700> skill<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:13.440> know

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
to be a very unreliable skill you know

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.210 
to be a very unreliable skill you know
if<00:02:13.739> they<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.819> go<00:02:15.120> really<00:02:15.390> slow<00:02:15.980> kind<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.069> like

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
if they just go really slow kind of like

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.800 
if they just go really slow kind of like
orianna's<00:02:17.790> ball<00:02:17.970> even<00:02:18.239> slower<00:02:18.660> than

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
orianna's ball even slower than

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.320 
orianna's ball even slower than
orianna's<00:02:19.560> ball<00:02:19.769> perhaps<00:02:20.160> that's<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:21.090> my

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
orianna's ball perhaps that's just my

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.690 
orianna's ball perhaps that's just my
opinion<00:02:21.360> anyways<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.410> next<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.430> ability

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
opinion anyways I next is the ability

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
opinion anyways I next is the ability
where<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.300> dash<00:02:24.569> your<00:02:24.930> sand<00:02:25.200> soldiers

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
where you can dash your sand soldiers

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.830 
where you can dash your sand soldiers
that's<00:02:26.190> not<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> bad<00:02:26.819> skill<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.510> gives<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.810> a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
that's not a bad skill it gives you a

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.680 
that's not a bad skill it gives you a
shield<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.950> gives<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.430> up<00:02:29.670> United<00:02:30.180> Noxon

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
shield and it gives them up United Noxon

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.699 
shield and it gives them up United Noxon
as<00:02:30.870> well<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.080> think<00:02:31.319> when<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.980> bump<00:02:32.190> into<00:02:32.400> them

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
as well I think when you bump into them

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.220 
as well I think when you bump into them
so<00:02:34.709> it's<00:02:34.890> not<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.220> bad<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.239> even<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:36.720> you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
so it's not that bad but even then you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.979 
so it's not that bad but even then you
know<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.890> cast<00:02:38.130> two<00:02:38.700> spells<00:02:39.150> pretty

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
know you have to cast two spells pretty

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.600 
know you have to cast two spells pretty
much<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.620> want<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.890> use<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.130> spell

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
much if you want to use that spell

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.960 
much if you want to use that spell
efficiently<00:02:42.180> you've<00:02:42.420> got<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.599> go<00:02:42.660> wqe<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.970> for

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
efficiently you've got to go wqe and for

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.039 
efficiently you've got to go wqe and for
it<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.120> be<00:02:45.269> any<00:02:45.540> efficient<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:48.599> not<00:02:48.750> that

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
it to be any efficient so it's not that

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.750 
it to be any efficient so it's not that
bad<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.709> at<00:02:50.099> his<00:02:50.310> ultimate<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.209> found<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.319> be

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
bad and at his ultimate I found it to be

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.780 
bad and at his ultimate I found it to be
like<00:02:53.760> Huey<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.530> casts<00:02:56.280> really

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
like Huey it just it just casts really

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.789 
like Huey it just it just casts really
slow<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.630> opinion<00:02:57.959> like<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.590> knock-back

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
slow in my opinion like the knock-back

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.300 
slow in my opinion like the knock-back
by<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.700> time<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.360> cast<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.260> there<00:03:01.530> already<00:03:01.950> you

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
by the time I cast it there already you

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.920 
by the time I cast it there already you
know<00:03:02.400> you're<00:03:02.519> behind<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.209> wall<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.569> just<00:03:03.780> feel

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
know you're behind the wall I just feel

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.080 
know you're behind the wall I just feel
so<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.290> kind<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.590> slow<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.190> least<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.910> my

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
so it's kind of slow at least in my

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.349 
so it's kind of slow at least in my
opinion<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:07.760> honestly<00:03:08.760> haven't<00:03:08.940> found<00:03:09.150> his

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
opinion I honestly haven't found his

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.270 
opinion I honestly haven't found his
ultimate<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.989> be<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.440> particularly<00:03:10.980> useful

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
ultimate to be that particularly useful

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.599 
ultimate to be that particularly useful
and<00:03:12.079> last<00:03:13.079> but<00:03:13.170> not<00:03:13.380> least<00:03:13.440> his<00:03:13.859> passive<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
and last but not least his passive the

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.400 
and last but not least his passive the
one<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.940> summon<00:03:15.359> the<00:03:15.450> turrets<00:03:15.870> out<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.200> dead

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
one we summon the turrets out of a dead

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.289 
one we summon the turrets out of a dead
pirates<00:03:17.450> it's<00:03:18.450> ok<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.109> suppose<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.910> arms

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
pirates it's ok I suppose but it arms

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.750 
pirates it's ok I suppose but it arms
itself<00:03:21.600> really<00:03:22.170> really<00:03:22.650> slow<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.549> have

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
itself really really slow like you have

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.569 
itself really really slow like you have
to<00:03:23.790> be<00:03:24.000> pushing<00:03:24.299> or<00:03:25.230> kind<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.769> defending<00:03:26.400> to

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
to be pushing or kind of defending to

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.849 
to be pushing or kind of defending to
use<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.850> skill<00:03:27.000> properly<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:28.290> can't<00:03:28.530> use<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
use that skill properly you can't use it

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.860 
use that skill properly you can't use it
as<00:03:28.950> kind<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.280> an<00:03:29.519> offensive<00:03:30.090> kind<00:03:30.750> of

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
as kind of like an offensive kind of

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.110 
as kind of like an offensive kind of
thing<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.590> know<00:03:31.709> it's<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.130> very<00:03:32.340> defensive

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
thing you know it's a very defensive

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.500 
thing you know it's a very defensive
skill<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:35.400> know<00:03:35.489> if<00:03:35.639> you<00:03:36.000> want<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.299> summon

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
skill so you know if you want to summon

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.940 
skill so you know if you want to summon
turrets<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.170> stuff<00:03:37.350> like<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.560> honestly

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
turrets and stuff like that honestly

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.390 
turrets and stuff like that honestly
just<00:03:38.370> pick<00:03:38.579> heimerdinger<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.950> know<00:03:41.040> overall

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
just pick heimerdinger you know overall

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.309 
just pick heimerdinger you know overall
I<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:41.880> don't<00:03:42.120> think<00:03:42.389> as<00:03:42.510> zeros<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.959> grates

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
I just don't think as zeros that grates

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.280 
I just don't think as zeros that grates
maybe<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:43.889> my<00:03:44.069> opinion<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:45.120> know<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.600> know

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
maybe it's my opinion you know I know

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.750 
maybe it's my opinion you know I know
perhaps<00:03:46.410> I've<00:03:46.680> been<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:47.100> haven't<00:03:47.340> played<00:03:47.519> him

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
perhaps I've been I haven't played him

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.550 
perhaps I've been I haven't played him
enough<00:03:48.000> for<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.329> just<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.840> know<00:03:48.900> haven't<00:03:49.290> tried

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
enough for I just you know haven't tried
