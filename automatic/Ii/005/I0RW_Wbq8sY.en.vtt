purchasing ground coffee what happens is

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.780 
purchasing ground coffee what happens is
all<00:01:12.390> those<00:01:12.840> oils<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.560> already<00:01:14.070> almost<00:01:14.550> in<00:01:14.700> a

all those oils have already almost in a
sense<00:01:14.970> oxidized<00:01:15.870> in<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> way<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:16.680> you've

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
sense oxidized in a way because you've

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.820 
sense oxidized in a way because you've
ground<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> coffee<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.330> stored<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.680> it's
