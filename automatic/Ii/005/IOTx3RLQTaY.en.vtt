what<00:00:11.730> makes<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.210> engine<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:12.990> special<00:00:13.410> in

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
what makes this engine so special in

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.860 
what makes this engine so special in
your<00:00:13.679> view<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
your view so this this is the the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.900 
your view so this this is the the
largest<00:00:16.260> engine<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.010> we've<00:00:17.160> ever<00:00:17.340> done<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
largest engine that we've ever done and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.609 
largest engine that we've ever done and
as<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.270> said<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.630> world's<00:00:18.900> most<00:00:19.050> efficient

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
as you said the world's most efficient

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.550 
as you said the world's most efficient
engine<00:00:19.970> it's<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.449> biggest<00:00:21.869> diameter<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

impossible<00:01:53.470> but<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.100> way<00:01:54.250> we<00:01:54.460> achieve<00:01:54.549> that

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
impossible but the way we achieve that

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.529 
impossible but the way we achieve that
is<00:01:55.420> by<00:01:55.450> putting<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.170> very<00:01:56.610> thin<00:01:57.610> film<00:01:58.210> of

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
is by putting a very thin film of

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.690 
is by putting a very thin film of
cooling<00:01:59.110> air<00:01:59.289> around<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.070> blades<00:02:00.340> themselves

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
cooling air around the blades themselves

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.820 
cooling air around the blades themselves
that<00:02:01.299> just<00:02:01.479> flows<00:02:01.750> over<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.530> flows

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
that just flows over that just flows

that just flows over that just flows
over<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.340> blades<00:02:03.610> though<00:02:04.149> even<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.569> cooling

air itself is at nearly 800 degrees this
is<00:02:13.450> where<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.840> air<00:02:13.959> comes<00:02:14.170> out<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.830> core

all of the air that's come through here

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.390 
all of the air that's come through here
has<00:02:22.480> been<00:02:22.660> expanded<00:02:23.500> through<00:02:23.739> those<00:02:23.920> turbine

now I know that we're the first TV crew
allowed<00:02:56.769> in<00:02:57.010> here<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.700> see<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.120> engine<00:02:58.420> but

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
allowed in here to see this engine but

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.509 
allowed in here to see this engine but
I'm<00:02:58.900> sure<00:02:59.109> there's<00:02:59.350> all<00:02:59.470> kinds<00:02:59.829> of<00:02:59.950> secrets

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
I'm sure there's all kinds of secrets

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
highly competitive business isn't it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.080 
highly competitive business isn't it
we're<00:03:05.109> all<00:03:05.290> improving<00:03:06.010> by<00:03:06.190> about<00:03:06.400> one<00:03:06.670> percent

we're all improving by about one percent
a<00:03:07.209> year<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:08.680> huge<00:03:09.519> amounts<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.150> Technology

investments that goes into creating the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.379 
investments that goes into creating the
secrets<00:03:14.049> on<00:03:14.230> here<00:03:14.410> not<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:15.100> the

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
secrets on here not just in the

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.460 
secrets on here not just in the
individual<00:03:16.389> technologies<00:03:16.989> but<00:03:17.139> how<00:03:17.410> to

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
individual technologies but how to

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.160 
individual technologies but how to
manufacture<00:03:18.010> things<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.090> how<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.630> integrate

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
manufacture things and how to integrate

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.790 
manufacture things and how to integrate
them<00:03:20.620> all<00:03:20.799> how<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.190> model<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.970> engines

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
them all how to model the engines

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.490 
them all how to model the engines
engine<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.400> perfect<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.330> possibly<00:03:24.780> be

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
engine as perfect as it can possibly be

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500 
engine as perfect as it can possibly be
so<00:03:25.980> yes<00:03:26.160> there's<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.460> lot<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.820> secrets<00:03:27.270> buried

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
so yes there's a lot of secrets buried

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.940 
so yes there's a lot of secrets buried
away<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.020> here<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.380> we<00:03:28.500> wouldn't<00:03:28.740> like

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
away in here that we wouldn't like

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.330 
away in here that we wouldn't like
anyone<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.640> get<00:03:29.790> their<00:03:29.970> hands<00:03:30.240> on
