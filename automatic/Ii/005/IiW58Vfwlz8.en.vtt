headphones which are somewhat expensive

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.799 
headphones which are somewhat expensive

and I have to say for a soft case ty was

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.050 
and I have to say for a soft case ty was
impressed<00:00:26.689> now<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.740> wire<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
impressed now here is the wire that I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.030 
impressed now here is the wire that I
believe<00:00:30.869> isn't<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.769> non<00:00:32.309> tangle<00:00:32.880> wire<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:34.040> can't

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
believe isn't a non tangle wire I can't

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.209 
believe isn't a non tangle wire I can't
hold<00:00:35.250> me<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> i'm<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.120> sure<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.690> i

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
hold me to that i'm not sure but i

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.260 
hold me to that i'm not sure but i
haven't<00:00:38.219> had<00:00:38.280> any<00:00:38.520> problems<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
haven't had any problems with the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.680 
haven't had any problems with the
tangling<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.680> think<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> isn't<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> total

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
tangling so I I think it isn't a total

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.790 
tangling so I I think it isn't a total
water<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:46.200> headphones

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
water and now we have the headphones

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
water and now we have the headphones
with<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.789> folding<00:00:48.300> cup<00:00:48.480> decide<00:00:49.670> come<00:00:50.670> out

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
with the folding cup decide come out

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.590 
with the folding cup decide come out
like<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:52.460> as<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:53.879> these

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
like this and as you can see these

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.060 
like this and as you can see these
headphones<00:00:55.219> have<00:00:56.449> rotating<00:00:57.449> cups<00:00:57.690> that

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
headphones have rotating cups that

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.260

adjust<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.309> ear<00:00:59.640> very<00:01:00.390> very<00:01:00.629> nice<00:01:02.270> like

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
adjust to your ear very very nice like

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.630

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the Sol Republic's and the solos and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640 
the Sol Republic's and the solos and
which<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> other<00:01:06.780> two<00:01:06.869> headphones<00:01:07.500> in

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
which are the other two headphones in

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.429 
which are the other two headphones in
their<00:01:07.799> segments<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:09.810> leather<00:01:10.200> right

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
their segments and this leather right

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.700 
their segments and this leather right
here<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:11.090> think<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.360> pleather<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.350> may<00:01:13.650> be

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
here I think this is pleather it may be

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.960 
here I think this is pleather it may be
real<00:01:14.070> leather<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.580> hard<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.909> tell<00:01:15.439> but<00:01:16.970> that

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
real leather it's hard to tell but that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.190 
real leather it's hard to tell but that
kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> makes<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.530> um<00:01:20.720> these<00:01:21.720> aren't

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
kind of makes you think um these aren't

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.780 
kind of makes you think um these aren't
a<00:01:22.799> hundred<00:01:23.430> percent<00:01:24.229> best<00:01:25.229> build<00:01:25.500> quality<00:01:25.790> but

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a hundred percent best build quality but

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.760 
a hundred percent best build quality but
actually<00:01:27.570> when<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.750> put<00:01:28.049> them<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.590> feel

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
actually when you put them on they feel

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.160 
actually when you put them on they feel
extremely<00:01:29.340> comfortable<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.750> think<00:01:30.990> you'll

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
extremely comfortable and I think you'll

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.830 
extremely comfortable and I think you'll
enjoy<00:01:31.350> them<00:01:31.799> very<00:01:32.040> much<00:01:32.270> pleather<00:01:33.270> or<00:01:33.450> real

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
resistant I don't know why or why not it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.140 
resistant I don't know why or why not it
might<00:03:57.459> be<00:03:57.700> but<00:03:59.130> the<00:04:00.130> holding<00:04:00.580> earcup<00:04:01.060> design

to be like you lost a super expensive

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.369 
to be like you lost a super expensive
pair<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.300> headphones<00:04:48.509> even<00:04:49.020> though<00:04:49.110> they<00:04:49.259> are

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
pair of headphones even though they are

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.529 
quite expensive and it's they're pretty
durable<00:04:53.009> so<00:04:53.460> they're<00:04:53.789> not<00:04:53.940> likely<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.330> be

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
durable so they're not likely to be

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.480 
durable so they're not likely to be
broken<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.139> there's<00:04:55.590> still<00:04:55.800> style<00:04:56.129> is<00:04:56.310> so

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
broken and there's still style is so

into any any mobile device or computer I
think<00:06:01.589> this<00:06:01.860> is<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.190> real<00:06:02.400> deal<00:06:02.759> these<00:06:03.210> are

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
think this is the real deal these are

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.659 
think this is the real deal these are
not<00:06:03.449> a<00:06:03.659> spin-off<00:06:04.289> of<00:06:04.440> beats<00:06:04.830> if<00:06:05.099> they<00:06:05.610> were

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
not a spin-off of beats if they were

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.519 
not a spin-off of beats if they were
spin-off<00:06:06.240> of<00:06:06.270> beats<00:06:06.629> they<00:06:06.930> would<00:06:07.110> be<00:06:07.289> much

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:07.529 
spin-off of beats they would be much

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.700 
spin-off of beats they would be much
worse<00:06:07.770> these<00:06:08.129> are<00:06:08.339> much<00:06:08.550> better<00:06:08.819> and<00:06:09.710> overall

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
worse these are much better and overall

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.300 
worse these are much better and overall
