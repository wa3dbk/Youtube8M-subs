00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so this car is roughly based off of the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.950 
so this car is roughly based off of the
Mitsubishi<00:01:13.680> Evo<00:01:14.220> 10<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> believe<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
Mitsubishi Evo 10 I believe and when I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
Mitsubishi Evo 10 I believe and when I
say<00:01:16.200> roughly<00:01:16.590> based<00:01:16.740> off<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.729> basically

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
say roughly based off of it I basically

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810 
say roughly based off of it I basically
mean<00:01:18.720> exactly<00:01:19.439> based<00:01:19.740> off<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> mean

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
mean exactly based off of it I mean

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
mean exactly based off of it I mean
there<00:01:21.000> are<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.270> few<00:01:21.479> differences<00:01:21.990> correct

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
there are very few differences correct

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
there are very few differences correct
me<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.189> wrong<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
me if I'm wrong but I do think that is a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.590 
me if I'm wrong but I do think that is a
Mitsubishi<00:01:24.869> Evo<00:01:25.439> 10<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:26.640> my<00:01:26.970> memory<00:01:27.330> is

Mitsubishi Evo 10 if my memory is
correct<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.560> anyways<00:01:28.890> pulling<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
correct but anyways pulling out of the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.609 
correct but anyways pulling out of the
garage<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.509> handling<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.200> everything

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
garage here the handling and everything

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
garage here the handling and everything
is<00:01:31.860> pretty<00:01:32.130> good<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.640> about<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> would

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
is pretty good it's about what you would

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.149 
is pretty good it's about what you would
expect<00:01:33.659> from<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.960> sports<00:01:34.259> car<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.770> nothing

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
expect from a sports car it's nothing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
expect from a sports car it's nothing
ridiculous<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.240> super<00:01:36.659> fast<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
ridiculous it's not super fast but it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
ridiculous it's not super fast but it
definitely<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.119> hold<00:01:39.299> its<00:01:39.420> own

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
definitely you know it can hold its own

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.840 
definitely you know it can hold its own
it's<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.960> good<00:01:40.200> handling<00:01:40.770> sports<00:01:41.070> car<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's a good handling sports car and it's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
it's a good handling sports car and it's
relatively<00:01:42.299> quick<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.500> once<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.100> upgraded

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
relatively quick but once it's upgraded

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.730 
relatively quick but once it's upgraded
obviously<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.119> gets<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.360> lot<00:01:45.540> better<00:01:45.740> but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
obviously it gets a lot better but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.960 
obviously it gets a lot better but
there's<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.250> too<00:01:47.310> much<00:01:47.430> more<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> say

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
there's really not too much more to say

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.160 
there's really not too much more to say
about<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.450> why<00:01:48.570> don't<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.720> take<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> look<00:01:49.049> at

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
about it so why don't we take a look at

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.139

now<00:02:15.340> I'm<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.550> looking<00:02:15.640> at<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.910> color<00:02:16.120> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
now I'm just looking at the color I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.449 
now I'm just looking at the color I
decided<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.140> go<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.500> red<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.400> I

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
decided to go with the red and then I

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.890 
decided to go with the red and then I
was<00:02:18.550> looking<00:02:18.670> at<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.910> secondary<00:02:19.270> color<00:02:19.540> and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
was looking at the secondary color and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.110 
was looking at the secondary color and
nothing<00:02:20.739> was<00:02:20.830> changing<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.700> then<00:02:21.819> I<00:02:21.849> realized

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
nothing was changing so then I realized

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.670 
nothing was changing so then I realized
that<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.510> didn't<00:02:22.750> add<00:02:22.930> any<00:02:22.959> parts<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:23.650> a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
that I didn't add any parts with a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.559 
that I didn't add any parts with a
secondary<00:02:24.160> color<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.849> now<00:02:24.880> I'm<00:02:25.120> adding<00:02:25.330> the

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
secondary color so now I'm adding the

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.440 
secondary color so now I'm adding the
secondary<00:02:26.290> street<00:02:26.620> skirt<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.910> secondary

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
secondary street skirt the secondary

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.420 
secondary street skirt the secondary
spoiler<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.530> way<00:02:29.680> it'll<00:02:29.830> change<00:02:30.069> colors

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
spoiler so that way it'll change colors

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.880 
spoiler so that way it'll change colors
with<00:02:30.640> my<00:02:30.760> secondary<00:02:31.150> color<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.110> then<00:02:32.410> also<00:02:32.680> I

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
with my secondary color and then also I

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.390 
with my secondary color and then also I
believe<00:02:33.040> after<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:34.060> we're<00:02:34.720> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.400> change

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
believe after that we're going to change

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.040 
believe after that we're going to change
the<00:02:36.670> bumper<00:02:37.000> yeah<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:37.450> changed<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.780> bumper

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the bumper yeah so we changed the bumper

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.750 
the bumper yeah so we changed the bumper
there<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.380> secondary<00:02:38.800> color<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.310> then<00:02:39.730> I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
there to a secondary color and then I

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.790 
there to a secondary color and then I
accidentally<00:02:40.450> left<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> garage<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.470> was<00:02:41.650> an

inside<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.870> front<00:02:56.110> bumper<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.709> those

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
inside the front bumper and those

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.009 
inside the front bumper and those
splitters<00:02:57.250> on<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.580> side<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:58.269> there's<00:02:58.510> not<00:02:58.690> too

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
splitters on the side so there's not too

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.870 
splitters on the side so there's not too
much<00:02:59.260> but<00:02:59.890> it's<00:03:00.040> definitely<00:03:00.160> pretty<00:03:00.489> solid

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
much but it's definitely pretty solid

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.789 
much but it's definitely pretty solid
I'm<00:03:00.970> not<00:03:01.150> complaining<00:03:01.690> at<00:03:01.780> all<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.500> then<00:03:02.620> when

I'm not complaining at all but then when

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.199 
I'm not complaining at all but then when
we<00:03:02.920> pull<00:03:03.069> out<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.310> leave<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.760> think<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.090> looks

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
we pull out and leave I think it looks

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.330 
we pull out and leave I think it looks
pretty<00:03:04.420> darn<00:03:04.630> good<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:05.110> really<00:03:05.709> like<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.130> fact

lot of weight it has got a lot of mass a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.069 
lot of weight it has got a lot of mass a
lot<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.760> energy<00:03:22.120> once<00:03:22.359> it<00:03:22.480> gets<00:03:22.630> up<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.930> good

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
lot of energy once it gets up to a good

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.720 
lot of energy once it gets up to a good
rolling<00:03:23.470> speed<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.310> doesn't<00:03:24.579> take<00:03:24.700> much

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
rolling speed and it doesn't take much

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.670 
rolling speed and it doesn't take much
damage<00:03:25.299> because<00:03:25.510> well<00:03:25.900> of<00:03:26.079> course<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.530> is

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
damage because well of course it is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.890 
damage because well of course it is
armored<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.670> despite<00:03:28.209> all<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.750> heavy

armor is still managed it manages to be
a<00:03:30.940> fast<00:03:31.299> car<00:03:31.600> it's<00:03:31.870> definitely<00:03:32.380> nimble<00:03:32.769> good

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
a fast car it's definitely nimble good

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
handling it's not a boat like I expected

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680 
handling it's not a boat like I expected
it<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.859> be<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.400> overall<00:03:36.850> it's<00:03:37.090> really<00:03:37.180> easy

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690

and fun to drive now as for

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.559 
and fun to drive now as for
customization<00:03:39.730> upgrades

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
customization upgrades

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.680 
customization upgrades
it's<00:03:40.750> basically<00:03:41.380> identical<00:03:42.280> as<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.910> the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
it's basically identical as the the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.360 
it's basically identical as the the
regular<00:03:44.049> version<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.560> karin<00:03:44.859> kuruma<00:03:44.980> with

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
regular version of the karin kuruma with

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.069 
regular version of the karin kuruma with
a<00:03:45.400> few<00:03:45.639> exceptions<00:03:46.239> one<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.959> only

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
a few exceptions one of the only

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.660 
a few exceptions one of the only
exceptions<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.920> fact<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.370> cannot

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
exceptions is the fact that you cannot

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.129 
exceptions is the fact that you cannot
put<00:03:48.819> a<00:03:48.880> roll<00:03:49.090> cage<00:03:49.120> on<00:03:49.569> it<00:03:49.720> because<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.019> think

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
put a roll cage on it because I think

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.500 
put a roll cage on it because I think
it's<00:03:50.410> already<00:03:50.590> reinforced<00:03:51.250> with<00:03:51.400> one<00:03:51.639> but<00:03:52.329> you

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
it's already reinforced with one but you

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.420 
it's already reinforced with one but you
can't<00:03:52.690> really<00:03:52.870> see<00:03:53.109> it<00:03:53.139> anyways<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:54.160> can<00:03:54.280> kind

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
can't really see it anyways you can kind

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.620 
can't really see it anyways you can kind
of<00:03:54.459> see<00:03:54.579> in<00:03:54.639> the<00:03:54.730> back<00:03:54.880> there<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.150> yeah<00:03:55.420> it

basically<00:04:21.729> exactly<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.690> same<00:04:22.810> as<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.320> other

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
basically exactly the same as the other

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.110 
basically exactly the same as the other
one<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:24.130> just<00:04:24.430> kind<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.640> switched<00:04:24.849> up<00:04:25.000> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
one so I just kind of switched up the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.060 
one so I just kind of switched up the
color<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.390> little<00:04:25.599> bit

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
color a little bit

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.730 
color a little bit
and<00:04:26.570> just<00:04:27.570> did<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.930> like<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.470> then<00:04:28.620> we

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
and just did it like that so then we

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.200 
and just did it like that so then we
drive<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.100> around<00:04:29.160> here<00:04:29.490> at<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.730> end<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:30.030> little

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
drive it around here at the end a little

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.080 
drive it around here at the end a little
bit<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:31.110> overall<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.070> rate<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.580> car<00:04:32.790> very

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
bit and overall I rate this car very

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.180 
bit and overall I rate this car very
high<00:04:33.360> it's<00:04:33.690> unlike<00:04:34.200> anything<00:04:34.470> we<00:04:34.710> have<00:04:34.740> in

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
high it's unlike anything we have in

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.010 
high it's unlike anything we have in
Grand<00:04:35.430> Theft<00:04:35.490> Auto<00:04:35.700> up<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.180> point<00:04:36.420> it's
