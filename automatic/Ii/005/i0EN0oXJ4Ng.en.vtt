not<00:02:28.490> very<00:02:28.640> well<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.000> short<00:02:29.210> time<00:02:29.680> that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
not very well in a short time that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.280 
not very well in a short time that
really<00:02:30.950> was<00:02:31.070> an<00:02:31.190> ambitious<00:02:31.670> quick<00:02:32.600> step<00:02:32.870> very

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
really was an ambitious quick step very

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.640 
really was an ambitious quick step very
very<00:02:33.650> fast<00:02:34.030> quick<00:02:35.030> around<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.570> rink<00:02:36.170> used

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
very fast quick around the rink used

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.040 
very fast quick around the rink used
every<00:02:37.070> inch<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.490> ice<00:02:37.610> surface<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.330> some

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
every inch of the ice surface and some

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.940 
every inch of the ice surface and some
very<00:02:39.440> very<00:02:39.710> fast<00:02:40.100> difficult<00:02:40.610> turns<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.090> there

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
very very fast difficult turns in there

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.560 
very very fast difficult turns in there
and<00:02:42.950> throughout<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.460> whole<00:02:43.700> routine<00:02:44.390> they

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
and throughout the whole routine they

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.780 
and throughout the whole routine they
kept<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.840> same<00:02:45.020> speed<00:02:45.500> across<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:46.010> ice

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:05.220 

very<00:02:49.790> very<00:02:50.270> cleanly<00:02:50.720> skated<00:02:51.230> indeed

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.259 

a<00:03:05.290> good<00:03:06.069> example<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.550> some<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.819> those<00:03:06.909> quick

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
a good example of some of those quick

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:16.850 
a good example of some of those quick
turns

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.560 

just<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:17.980> front<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.700> Swiss<00:03:19.060> couple<00:03:19.360> going

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
just in front of the Swiss couple going

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.270 
just in front of the Swiss couple going
sure<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.990> mr.<00:03:20.290> Lumm<00:03:20.590> off<00:03:20.740> and<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:20.920> think<00:03:21.130> those

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
sure and mr. Lumm off and I think those

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.050 
sure and mr. Lumm off and I think those
marks<00:03:21.610> will<00:03:21.790> keep<00:03:21.970> them<00:03:22.150> there<00:03:23.760> again

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
marks will keep them there again

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.720 
marks will keep them there again
quite<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.630> difference<00:03:27.050> in<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.260> marks<00:03:27.590> from<00:03:27.800> 4.5

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
quite a difference in the marks from 4.5

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.690 
quite a difference in the marks from 4.5
from<00:03:29.180> Courtney<00:03:29.959> Jones<00:03:30.110> up<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.500> 5.1<00:03:31.100> from<00:03:31.520> the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
better rush in absolutely all over but

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.990 
better rush in absolutely all over but
there's<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.920> important<00:03:37.310> statistic<00:03:37.700> first

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
there's the important statistic first
