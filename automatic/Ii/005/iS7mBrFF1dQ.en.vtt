this<00:00:02.060> is<00:00:02.239> to<00:00:02.389> show<00:00:02.419> some<00:00:03.019> of<00:00:03.139> the<00:00:03.199> features<00:00:03.409> of

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:03.649 
this is to show some of the features of

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.910 
this is to show some of the features of
the<00:00:04.250> minitek<00:00:04.760> ipad<00:00:05.270> case<00:00:05.720> plus<00:00:06.080> keyboard<00:00:06.650> and

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:06.920 
the minitek ipad case plus keyboard and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.759 
the minitek ipad case plus keyboard and
also<00:00:07.370> how<00:00:07.550> to<00:00:07.610> use<00:00:08.090> it<00:00:08.299> as<00:00:08.480> you<00:00:09.200> can<00:00:09.349> see<00:00:09.589> it<00:00:09.679> has

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
also how to use it as you can see it has

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.359 
also how to use it as you can see it has
a<00:00:09.829> fairly<00:00:10.280> small<00:00:10.339> profile<00:00:11.120> which<00:00:11.450> is<00:00:11.599> good<00:00:12.019> for

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:12.369 
a fairly small profile which is good for

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.270 
a fairly small profile which is good for
carrying<00:00:13.369> it<00:00:13.459> around<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:15.230> reason<00:00:15.740> for<00:00:16.070> the

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.280 
carrying it around the reason for the

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.460 
carrying it around the reason for the
smaller<00:00:16.550> profile<00:00:17.030> is<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.450> fact<00:00:17.990> that<00:00:18.050> uses<00:00:18.440> a

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
smaller profile is the fact that uses a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.390 
smaller profile is the fact that uses a
snap-on<00:00:19.220> case<00:00:19.580> compared<00:00:20.270> to<00:00:20.720> a<00:00:21.470> slide<00:00:21.980> in<00:00:22.010> case

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
snap-on case compared to a slide in case

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.800 
snap-on case compared to a slide in case
that<00:00:22.640> many<00:00:22.910> other<00:00:23.150> products<00:00:23.600> on<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.750> market

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
that many other products on the market

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.330 
that many other products on the market
use<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.780> one<00:00:26.780> other<00:00:26.870> benefit<00:00:27.830> also<00:00:28.070> of

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
use and so one other benefit also of

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.540 
use and so one other benefit also of
this<00:00:28.720> product<00:00:29.720> is<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.289> there<00:00:30.860> is<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.160> gap

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
this product is that there is a gap

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.870 
this product is that there is a gap
between<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.300> keyboard<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.710> iPad<00:00:34.190> which

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
between the keyboard and the iPad which

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.730 
between the keyboard and the iPad which
means<00:00:35.120> iPads<00:00:35.600> not<00:00:35.930> touching<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.530> keyboard

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
means iPads not touching the keyboard

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.370 
means iPads not touching the keyboard
when<00:00:37.190> it's<00:00:37.340> in<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.579> case<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.260> reduces<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
when it's in the case and reduces the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.880 
when it's in the case and reduces the
chance<00:00:39.650> of<00:00:39.800> scratching<00:00:41.260> to<00:00:42.260> use<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.710> you'd

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
chance of scratching to use it you'd

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.370 
chance of scratching to use it you'd
pull<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.370> tab<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:44.680> then<00:00:45.680> lift<00:00:46.160> unlock<00:00:46.760> the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
pull the tab and then lift unlock the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.200 
pull the tab and then lift unlock the
metal<00:00:48.380> stand<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:49.610> then<00:00:49.820> lift<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.300> up<00:00:50.710> as<00:00:52.210> you

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
metal stand and then lift it up as you

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.049 
metal stand and then lift it up as you
can<00:00:53.390> see<00:00:53.750> it's<00:00:54.140> fairly<00:00:54.620> stable<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:55.610> turning

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
can see it's fairly stable and turning

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.060 
can see it's fairly stable and turning
it<00:00:56.149> around<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.750> it's<00:00:56.870> not<00:00:57.050> falling<00:00:57.559> down<00:00:57.770> or

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
it around and it's not falling down or

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.030 
it around and it's not falling down or
tilting<00:00:58.520> back<00:00:59.140> the<00:01:00.140> main<00:01:00.410> reason<00:01:00.770> is<00:01:00.980> for

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
tilting back the main reason is for

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.820 
tilting back the main reason is for
because<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.000> metal<00:01:02.270> stand<00:01:05.560> I'm<00:01:06.560> also

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
because of the metal stand I'm also

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.180 
because of the metal stand I'm also
tapping<00:01:07.729> on<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:07.940> screen<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.810> it's<00:01:09.740> not<00:01:09.950> going

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
tapping on the screen and it's not going

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.880 
tapping on the screen and it's not going
anywhere<00:01:12.010> it's<00:01:13.010> very<00:01:13.370> stable<00:01:13.790> in<00:01:14.150> that<00:01:14.420> sense

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
anywhere it's very stable in that sense

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.850 
anywhere it's very stable in that sense
there's<00:01:15.890> also<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:17.290> area<00:01:18.290> right<00:01:18.560> under<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
there's also a area right under the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.910 
there's also a area right under the
keyboard<00:01:19.150> which<00:01:20.150> is<00:01:20.299> very<00:01:20.540> good<00:01:20.810> for<00:01:21.290> resting

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
while typing one of the other benefits

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.950 
while typing one of the other benefits
is<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:36.350> has<00:01:36.860> an<00:01:37.369> easily<00:01:37.820> accessible

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
be taken out it's easy to do that you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.170 
be taken out it's easy to do that you
just<00:01:54.380> pull<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.920> elastic<00:01:55.430> string<00:01:55.790> over

just pull on the elastic string over
here<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:56.810> slide<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:57.829> out<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:59.600> does<00:02:00.200> take<00:02:00.530> just

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
here and slide it out it does take just

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.580 
here and slide it out it does take just
a<00:02:00.979> little<00:02:01.009> bit<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.640> an<00:02:01.759> effort<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.560> a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
a little bit of an effort but that is a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.370 
a little bit of an effort but that is a
good<00:02:03.950> thing<00:02:04.159> because<00:02:04.900> you<00:02:05.900> don't<00:02:06.079> want<00:02:06.140> it

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
good thing because you don't want it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.380 
good thing because you don't want it
falling<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.920> while<00:02:07.250> you're<00:02:07.400> using<00:02:07.579> it<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.270> it

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
falling out while you're using it so it

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.730 
falling out while you're using it so it
does<00:02:08.569> stay<00:02:08.899> securely<00:02:09.619> in<00:02:09.979> place

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
does stay securely in place

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.030 
does stay securely in place
to<00:02:11.740> put<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.070> back<00:02:12.280> in<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:13.690> would<00:02:13.990> just<00:02:14.560> slide

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
to put it back in you would just slide

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.600 
to put it back in you would just slide
it<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:16.380> then<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.650> take<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.420> strap<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610

wrap<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.180> around<00:02:26.400> also<00:02:27.400> by<00:02:27.610> taking<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.180> the

keyboard you press the f5 f5 button

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.560 
keyboard you press the f5 f5 button
again<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.730> goes<00:04:16.940> away<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.290> makes<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.680> fairly

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
again it goes away so it makes it fairly

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.110 
again it goes away so it makes it fairly
easy<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.780> use<00:04:21.139> either<00:04:21.410> option<00:04:24.669> one<00:04:25.669> other<00:04:25.850> way

easy to use either option one other way

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.820 
easy to use either option one other way
to<00:04:26.180> use<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.660> is<00:04:27.310> without<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.520> keyboard<00:04:29.830> you

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
to use it is without the keyboard you

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.280 
to use it is without the keyboard you
can<00:04:30.950> just<00:04:31.130> take<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.790> tab<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.540> put<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:33.020> into

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
can just take that tab and put it into

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.420 
can just take that tab and put it into
itself<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:34.340> leave<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.840> case<00:04:36.650> really<00:04:37.040> secure

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
itself and leave the case really secure

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.590 
itself and leave the case really secure
so<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:37.610> doesn't<00:04:37.850> flop<00:04:38.630> open<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.310> then<00:04:40.310> on<00:04:40.669> the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
so it doesn't flop open and then on the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.140 
so it doesn't flop open and then on the
other<00:04:41.630> side<00:04:42.169> you've<00:04:42.440> got<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:42.860> groove<00:04:43.340> right

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
other side you've got this groove right

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.930 
other side you've got this groove right
over<00:04:44.360> here<00:04:44.570> which<00:04:45.350> makes<00:04:45.530> it<00:04:46.040> easier<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.700> hold

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
over here which makes it easier to hold

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.760 
over here which makes it easier to hold
on<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.820> case<00:04:50.150> otherwise<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:51.470> can

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
on to the to the case otherwise it can

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.060 
on to the to the case otherwise it can
be<00:04:52.010> a<00:04:52.040> little<00:04:52.190> bit<00:04:52.370> difficult<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.910> hold<00:04:53.090> on<00:04:53.300> to

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
be a little bit difficult to hold on to

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.800 
be a little bit difficult to hold on to
so<00:04:55.070> with<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.430> groove<00:04:55.669> it<00:04:56.240> does<00:04:56.450> provide<00:04:56.750> a

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
so with the groove it does provide a

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.680 
so with the groove it does provide a
little<00:04:57.080> bit<00:04:57.200> extra<00:04:57.440> support<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.540> then<00:04:59.540> you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
little bit extra support and then you

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.510 
little bit extra support and then you
can<00:04:59.810> also<00:04:59.990> take<00:05:00.380> out<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.800> keyboard<00:05:01.010> if<00:05:01.370> you

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
can also take out the keyboard if you

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.300 
can also take out the keyboard if you
want<00:05:01.790> because<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:03.050> does<00:05:03.229> light<00:05:03.530> in<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:04.010> case<00:05:04.280> a

want because it does light in the case a
little<00:05:04.729> bit<00:05:04.910> so<00:05:05.180> if<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.419> does<00:05:05.600> start<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:05.900> get

little bit so if it does start to get
