looking<00:01:34.770> damn<00:01:35.630> sucks<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.439> always<00:01:40.619> get

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
looking damn sucks and I always get

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.550 
looking damn sucks and I always get
really<00:01:40.950> particular<00:01:41.280> about<00:01:41.810> like<00:01:42.810> angles<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
really particular about like angles and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.350 
really particular about like angles and
stuff<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.549> glad<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.850> got<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.240> on

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
stuff so I was really glad I got that on

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.420 
stuff so I was really glad I got that on
the<00:01:45.450> first<00:01:45.689> try<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.829> we're<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> be

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the first try and now we're going to be

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.060 
the first try and now we're going to be
moving<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> bullet<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.979> you're<00:01:49.979> gonna

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
moving to the bullet and you're gonna

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.380 
moving to the bullet and you're gonna
notice<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> change<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> colors

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
notice I'm going to change the colors

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.580 
notice I'm going to change the colors
around<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.659> lot<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.170> had<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> white

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
around a lot like I just had a white

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.190 
around a lot like I just had a white
there<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:54.090> tell<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:54.840> doing

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there so I can tell what I'm doing

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
there so I can tell what I'm doing
because<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> hard<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> put<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
because it's kind of hard to put the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.760 
because it's kind of hard to put the
same<00:01:56.909> color<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.110> move<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.350> around<00:01:58.500> my

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
same color on it and move it around my

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.620 
same color on it and move it around my
supposed<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.219> color<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.700> this<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:01.130> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
supposed to be that color so this is the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.899 
supposed to be that color so this is the
portion<00:02:03.409> of<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.620> bullet<00:02:03.800> I<00:02:04.159> am<00:02:04.460> he's<00:02:04.610> trying

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
portion of the bullet I am he's trying

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.540 
portion of the bullet I am he's trying
to<00:02:05.060> Center<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.659> right<00:02:05.690> now<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.229> just<00:02:07.190> make<00:02:07.430> it

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
to Center it right now and just make it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:16.440 
to Center it right now and just make it
look<00:02:07.670> exactly<00:02:08.000> like<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.360> picture

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.210 

all<00:02:17.450> right<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.780> put<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.410> bullet<00:02:18.710> shading

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
all right so I put the bullet shading

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.980 
all right so I put the bullet shading
back<00:02:19.430> there<00:02:19.700> too<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.360> had<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> free-form

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
back there too and I had a free-form

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.510 
back there too and I had a free-form
that<00:02:21.170> around<00:02:21.470> when<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.010> whenever<00:02:22.370> you're

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
that around when you whenever you're

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.700 
that around when you whenever you're
doing<00:02:22.580> shading<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.360> would<00:02:23.870> suggest<00:02:24.080> being<00:02:24.500> in

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
doing shading I would suggest being in

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.740 
doing shading I would suggest being in
freeform<00:02:25.310> instead<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.880> fixed<00:02:26.240> set<00:02:26.420> because

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
freeform instead of fixed set because

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.170 
freeform instead of fixed set because
fix<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.290> usually<00:02:27.950> will<00:02:28.910> only<00:02:30.430> extend<00:02:31.430> your

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
fix that usually will only extend your

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.450 
fix that usually will only extend your
shape<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.290> particular<00:02:33.560> direction<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.280> won't

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
shape in a particular direction it won't

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.450 
shape in a particular direction it won't
extend<00:02:34.820> around<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.420> shape<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.840> will<00:02:35.930> extend

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
extend around the shape it will extend

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.820 
extend around the shape it will extend
kind<00:02:37.460> of<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:37.760> up<00:02:38.420> or<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.470> one

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
kind of like up or just like in one

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.400 
kind of like up or just like in one
direction<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:40.570> freeform<00:02:41.570> is<00:02:41.900> what<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.110> use<00:02:42.380> for

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
direction so freeform is what I use for

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.930 
direction so freeform is what I use for
a<00:02:42.709> lot<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:43.040> shading<00:02:43.430> if<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:43.610> don't<00:02:43.760> see

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
a lot of this shading if you don't see

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.150 
a lot of this shading if you don't see
me<00:02:44.060> click<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.360> RS<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.170> tutorial<00:02:45.980> really

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
me click the RS in the tutorial really

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.980 
me click the RS in the tutorial really
quickly<00:02:46.520> but<00:02:46.760> that's<00:02:47.030> what<00:02:47.330> I'm<00:02:47.420> doing<00:02:47.780> for

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
quickly but that's what I'm doing for

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.300 
quickly but that's what I'm doing for
these<00:02:48.140> back<00:02:48.410> shades

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.580 

and<00:02:52.730> for<00:02:52.969> these<00:02:53.090> right<00:02:53.329> here<00:02:53.840> these<00:02:54.230> are<00:02:54.409> like

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
and for these right here these are like

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.869 
and for these right here these are like
the<00:02:54.769> kind<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.099> really<00:02:55.849> thin<00:02:56.420> line<00:02:56.659> glares<00:02:57.260> on

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
the kind of really thin line glares on

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.610 
the kind of really thin line glares on
the<00:02:58.879> bullet<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.329> picked<00:02:59.599> the<00:02:59.900> eye<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.079> because

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
the bullet I picked the eye just because

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.470 
the bullet I picked the eye just because
the<00:03:00.769> it's<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.310> thinner<00:03:01.519> line<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.879> start<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.329> it's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
the it's a thinner line to start so it's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.119 
the it's a thinner line to start so it's
less<00:03:02.629> free-forming<00:03:03.319> but<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:03.890> to

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
less free-forming but you have to

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.209 
less free-forming but you have to
obviously<00:03:05.030> like<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.659> said<00:03:05.870> over<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:06.859> over<00:03:06.950> use

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219 
obviously like I said over and over use

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.580 
obviously like I said over and over use
free-forming<00:03:07.939> to<00:03:08.480> make<00:03:08.659> it<00:03:08.750> really<00:03:08.930> thin<00:03:09.230> and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
free-forming to make it really thin and

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.099 
free-forming to make it really thin and
just<00:03:10.189> go<00:03:10.909> right<00:03:11.239> off<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.480> picture<00:03:11.780> right<00:03:11.989> off

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
just go right off the picture right off

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.710 
just go right off the picture right off
my<00:03:12.260> tutorial<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.069> put<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.879> in<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.090> spots<00:03:14.359> that

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
my tutorial and put it in the spots that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.410 
my tutorial and put it in the spots that
it's<00:03:15.079> in<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.920> have<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.159> really<00:03:17.030> hit<00:03:17.239> the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
it's in and you have to really hit the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.750 
it's in and you have to really hit the
LT<00:03:17.750> arty<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.500> adjust<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.099> if<00:03:19.340> you're<00:03:19.730> a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
LT arty to adjust it if you're a

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.280 
LT arty to adjust it if you're a
perfectionist<00:03:20.329> like<00:03:20.659> me<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.930> make<00:03:21.079> sure<00:03:21.109> the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
perfectionist like me to make sure the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.990 
perfectionist like me to make sure the
lines<00:03:21.500> are<00:03:21.680> straight<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.099> this<00:03:22.609> shape<00:03:22.819> right

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
lines are straight and this shape right

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.369 
lines are straight and this shape right
here<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.510> called<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.349> monolith<00:03:24.889> it<00:03:25.159> is<00:03:26.379> going

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
here is called the monolith it is going

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.879 
here is called the monolith it is going
to<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.829> what<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.879> upward<00:03:29.659> curving<00:03:30.379> part<00:03:30.650> of

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
to be what is the upward curving part of

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.099 
to be what is the upward curving part of
the<00:03:31.129> tip<00:03:31.639> of<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.849> bullet<00:03:31.939> and<00:03:32.299> there's<00:03:32.959> no

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
the tip of the bullet and there's no

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.750 
the tip of the bullet and there's no
visually<00:03:33.500> there's<00:03:33.859> like<00:03:34.010> no<00:03:34.159> like<00:03:34.400> upward

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
visually there's like no like upward

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.819 
visually there's like no like upward
curving<00:03:35.209> bullet<00:03:35.840> tip<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.349> kind<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.709> have

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
curving bullet tip so you kind of have

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.860 
curving bullet tip so you kind of have
to<00:03:36.859> use<00:03:36.950> two<00:03:37.220> shapes<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.730> use<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.419> monolith

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
to use two shapes I use the monolith

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.569 
to use two shapes I use the monolith
here<00:03:39.230> I'm<00:03:39.379> putting<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.709> shading<00:03:40.069> on<00:03:40.159> and<00:03:40.489> then

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
here I'm putting the shading on and then

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.409 
here I'm putting the shading on and then
I'm<00:03:41.150> just<00:03:41.209> going<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.659> well<00:03:42.409> actually<00:03:42.650> that's

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
I'm just going to well actually that's

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.360 
I'm just going to well actually that's
the<00:03:44.419> inside<00:03:44.900> portion<00:03:45.169> and<00:03:45.470> then<00:03:45.560> I'm<00:03:46.040> going<00:03:46.310> to

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
the inside portion and then I'm going to

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.710 
the inside portion and then I'm going to
have<00:03:46.489> another<00:03:46.700> amount<00:03:46.879> of<00:03:47.030> lift<00:03:47.209> for<00:03:47.359> shading

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
have another amount of lift for shading

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.909 
have another amount of lift for shading
right<00:03:48.349> here<00:03:48.650> but<00:03:49.930> then<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.109> put<00:03:51.379> a<00:03:51.409> triangle

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
right here but then you put a triangle

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.839 
right here but then you put a triangle
on<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:53.120> tip<00:03:53.720> as<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.799> will<00:03:54.919> see<00:03:55.159> me<00:03:55.370> kind<00:03:55.730> of

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
on the tip as you will see me kind of

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.849 
on the tip as you will see me kind of
shape<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.209> around<00:03:56.419> and<00:03:56.599> move<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.780> around<00:03:56.900> to

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
shape it around and move it around to

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.390 
shape it around and move it around to
have<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.459> sharp<00:03:58.699> part<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.120> bullet<00:03:59.419> so

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
have the sharp part of the bullet so

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.330 
have the sharp part of the bullet so
that's<00:04:01.400> kind<00:04:01.669> of<00:04:01.699> what<00:04:01.819> I'm<00:04:01.909> we<00:04:02.030> doing<00:04:02.329> after<00:04:02.510> I

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
that's kind of what I'm we doing after I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:12.680 
that's kind of what I'm we doing after I
perfect<00:04:04.340> my<00:04:04.639> monoliths<00:04:05.419> shading

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.090 

and<00:04:13.690> if<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:13.900> do<00:04:14.050> notice<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.500> do<00:04:14.560> have<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.950> do<00:04:15.070> a

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
and if you do notice I do have to do a

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.009 
and if you do notice I do have to do a
fair<00:04:15.370> bit<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.670> free<00:04:15.910> farming<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.420> this<00:04:16.570> just

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
fair bit of free farming to this just

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.099 
fair bit of free farming to this just
because<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.820> want<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.940> blend<00:04:19.600> really<00:04:19.959> well

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
because I want it to blend really well

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.810 
because I want it to blend really well
with<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.799> background<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.370> look<00:04:21.519> like<00:04:21.670> I

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
with the background and look like I

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.020 
with the background and look like I
didn't<00:04:22.060> put<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.540> on<00:04:22.720> there<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.170> start<00:04:23.880> like<00:04:24.880> it

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
didn't put it on there to start like it

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:46.870 
didn't put it on there to start like it
was<00:04:25.210> already<00:04:25.390> part<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.900> bullet

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.090 

all<00:04:47.390> right<00:04:47.570> now<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.720> put<00:04:48.020> those<00:04:48.140> parts<00:04:48.440> on<00:04:48.740> I

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
all right now I put those parts on I

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.480 
all right now I put those parts on I
wanted<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.520> do<00:04:49.730> one<00:04:50.060> final<00:04:50.300> shade<00:04:50.810> because

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
wanted to do one final shade because

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.450 
wanted to do one final shade because
there's<00:04:52.490> like<00:04:52.730> a<00:04:52.760> tip<00:04:53.090> shade<00:04:53.480> on<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:55.100> top<00:04:55.280> of

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
there's like a tip shade on the top of

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.860 
there's like a tip shade on the top of
the<00:04:55.520> bullet<00:04:55.850> that<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:56.090> didn't<00:04:56.330> really<00:04:56.420> do<00:04:56.660> it's

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
the bullet that I didn't really do it's

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.050 
the bullet that I didn't really do it's
not<00:04:56.960> really<00:04:57.170> necessary<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.740> feel<00:04:57.950> like<00:04:58.100> you

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
not really necessary I feel like you

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.700 
not really necessary I feel like you
could<00:04:59.270> do<00:04:59.420> it<00:04:59.540> without<00:04:59.630> this<00:04:59.990> tip<00:05:00.200> shade<00:05:00.470> but

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
could do it without this tip shade but

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.640 
could do it without this tip shade but
if<00:05:00.980> you<00:05:01.400> do<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:02.060> right<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.570> angle<00:05:03.350> it<00:05:03.440> right<00:05:03.620> I

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
if you do it right and angle it right I

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.190 
if you do it right and angle it right I
think<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:04.070> looks<00:05:04.190> really<00:05:04.250> cool<00:05:04.610> on<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.200> what

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
think it looks really cool on it so what

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.480 
think it looks really cool on it so what
I<00:05:06.230> did<00:05:06.350> took<00:05:07.190> another<00:05:07.430> thin<00:05:07.820> eye<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:10.280> kind

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
I did took another thin eye and you kind

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.670 
I did took another thin eye and you kind
of<00:05:10.550> have<00:05:10.670> to<00:05:10.700> curve<00:05:11.090> it<00:05:11.240> because<00:05:11.420> it's<00:05:11.680> like

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
of have to curve it because it's like

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.670 
of have to curve it because it's like
the<00:05:13.280> shade<00:05:13.910> on<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.480> bullet<00:05:14.810> curves<00:05:15.170> upwards

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
the shade on the bullet curves upwards

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.030 
the shade on the bullet curves upwards
so<00:05:16.130> what<00:05:17.120> you<00:05:17.210> can<00:05:17.420> you<00:05:17.690> can<00:05:17.840> just<00:05:17.990> take<00:05:18.200> two

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
so what you can you can just take two

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.220 
so what you can you can just take two
eyes<00:05:19.250> like<00:05:19.490> I<00:05:19.640> did<00:05:19.790> since<00:05:19.970> it's<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:20.210> small<00:05:20.600> it

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
eyes like I did since it's so small it

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.510 
eyes like I did since it's so small it
really<00:05:21.290> doesn't<00:05:21.770> matter<00:05:21.890> that<00:05:22.190> it's<00:05:22.310> not<00:05:22.490> a

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
really doesn't matter that it's not a

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.220 
really doesn't matter that it's not a
perfect<00:05:22.940> circle<00:05:23.090> like<00:05:23.840> you're<00:05:23.990> not<00:05:24.080> really

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
perfect circle like you're not really

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.380 
perfect circle like you're not really
going<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.410> be<00:05:24.470> able<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.680> see<00:05:24.980> and<00:05:25.250> just<00:05:25.820> angle

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
going to be able to see and just angle

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.630 
going to be able to see and just angle
them<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:26.840> I<00:05:27.230> made<00:05:27.620> a<00:05:27.650> lighter<00:05:27.950> color<00:05:28.250> on<00:05:28.370> it

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
them and I made a lighter color on it

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.070 
them and I made a lighter color on it
because<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:29.030> looks<00:05:29.330> like<00:05:29.480> a<00:05:29.510> lighter<00:05:29.690> color<00:05:29.930> in

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
because it looks like a lighter color in

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.570 
because it looks like a lighter color in
the<00:05:30.140> picture<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:30.590> that's<00:05:31.190> about<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.550> guys
