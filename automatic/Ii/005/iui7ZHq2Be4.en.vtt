00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:18.820
 I don't know what to tell me really three minutes 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.270
 to our most difficult challenge 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.270
 everything is professionally decided today 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:34.239
 now we resurrect as a team or 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.390
 we will give one centimeter at a time one 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.510
 scheme after another until defeat 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.920
 we are in hell of my lords 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.650
 believe me and we can stay there 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.510
 slap 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.370
 or to open the way fighting to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.310
 the light 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.420
 we can climb the walls of hell 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.420
 an inch at a time 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.420
 you know many things with age with time 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.530
 they are removed but this is part of the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.080
 life 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.080
 but you only learn it when those 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.650
 things start to lose and you find out that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.790
 life is a game of centimeters is like that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.770
 is the future 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.790
 because in both these games life 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.570
 the football 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.550
 very low margin of error 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.040
 take half a step done a little 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.620
 late in advance and you ca n't make it 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.290
 half a second too fast or too much 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.420
 slow and miss the grip but the centimeters 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.300
 what we need are everywhere are 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.180
 around us there are in every break 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.100
 of the game every minute at each 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.920
 second in this team we fight 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.380
 for an inch the war in this one 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.600
 team of fatigue we ourselves 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.900
 and all those around us for a 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.259
 centimeter we defend ourselves with nails and 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.390
 with teeth for an inch because 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.820
 we know that look we're going to add up 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.280
 all those centimeters the total then 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.569
 will make the difference between victory and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.090
 defeat 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.090
 the difference between living and dying 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.510
 I want to tell you one thing in every fight is 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.810
 the one who is willing to die that 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.180
 will gain an inch and I know if 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.099
 I will be able to have a paying existence will be 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.549
 because I am still willing to fight 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.970
 and to die for that inch 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.830
 our life is all there in this way 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.120
 is in those ten centimeters in front of the 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.580
 face 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.049
 but I can't force you to fight 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.150
 you have to look at the companion you have 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.769
 next look into his eyes 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.260
 I bet you will see a man there 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.959
 determined to gain ground with you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.970
 that you see a man who does 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.579
 will willingly sacrifice for this 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.660
 team aware that when 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.140
 it will be time 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.019
 you will do the same for him this 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.769
 be a gentlemen my team 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:11.030
 therefore I have we are like now 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.030
 collective or we will be annihilated 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.030
 individually 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.700
 that's all 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.980
 then maicon 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.980
 what do you want to do
