um Tonya q-tips these are us this is a
small<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.860> think<00:02:56.069> they<00:02:56.250> come<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.640> few

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
small one I think they come in a few

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.640 
small one I think they come in a few
different<00:02:56.880> sizes<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> small<00:02:58.500> one

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
different sizes but this is a small one

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.199 
different sizes but this is a small one
and<00:02:58.890> they've<00:02:59.700> got<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.849> pointy<00:03:00.299> tip<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:02.209> I've

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
and they've got a pointy tip and I've

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.520 
and they've got a pointy tip and I've
seen<00:03:03.480> some<00:03:04.010> how-to<00:03:05.010> videos<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:06.000> YouTube<00:03:06.530> they

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.509 
seen some how-to videos on YouTube they
use<00:03:07.769> toothpicks<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:10.530> have<00:03:10.950> found<00:03:11.190> that

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
use toothpicks but I have found that

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.720 
use toothpicks but I have found that
this<00:03:11.849> works<00:03:12.150> very<00:03:12.720> well<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:14.010> all<00:03:14.250> I've<00:03:14.430> used

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730

this works very well it's all I've used
haven't<00:03:15.030> used<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.329> toothpick<00:03:15.510> at<00:03:15.900> all<00:03:15.989> them<00:03:16.170> on

haven't used a toothpick at all them on

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.750 
haven't used a toothpick at all them on
and<00:03:17.450> yeah<00:03:18.530> because<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.920> got<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.160> pointy<00:03:20.519> end

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
and yeah because it's got the pointy end

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.030 
and yeah because it's got the pointy end
you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.150> rub<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.569> bare<00:03:22.200> metal<00:03:22.410> fall<00:03:22.739> right

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
you can rub the bare metal fall right

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.289 
you can rub the bare metal fall right
into<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.489> parts<00:03:26.120> as<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.660> see<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:29.120> pop<00:03:30.120> but

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
into the parts as you can see it pop but

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.289 
into the parts as you can see it pop but
I've<00:03:30.389> done<00:03:30.599> here<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:30.989> quite<00:03:31.560> small<00:03:32.090> it's<00:03:33.090> quite

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
I've done here is quite small it's quite

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.390 
I've done here is quite small it's quite
detailed<00:03:33.780> sort<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.349> but<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.700> yeah<00:03:37.160> very<00:03:38.160> easy
