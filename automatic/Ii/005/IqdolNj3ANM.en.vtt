long walks on the beach that kind of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.930 
long walks on the beach that kind of
stuff

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.860 

well<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.200> design<00:01:18.710> team<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:18.980> mostly<00:01:19.870> balancing

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
well the design team is mostly balancing

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.770 
well the design team is mostly balancing
on<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.740> more<00:01:22.340> systems<00:01:22.760> orient<00:01:23.120> inside<00:01:23.450> so

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
on the more systems orient inside so

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.510 
on the more systems orient inside so
like<00:01:24.110> we're<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:24.380> passing<00:01:24.830> through<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.220> just

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
like we're just passing through and just

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.090 
like we're just passing through and just
going<00:01:26.030> over<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:27.230> when<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.470> make<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.680> game<00:01:27.920> you

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
going over and when you make a game you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.610 
going over and when you make a game you
don't<00:01:28.220> really<00:01:29.120> fine-tune<00:01:29.990> balance<00:01:30.410> while

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
don't really fine-tune balance while

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.560 
don't really fine-tune balance while
you're<00:01:30.830> going<00:01:31.160> it<00:01:31.310> just<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:31.790> know<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:32.120> system

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
you're going it just you know a system

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.610 
you're going it just you know a system
will<00:01:32.690> change<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.140> they'll<00:01:33.290> throw<00:01:33.320> all<00:01:33.590> your

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
will change and they'll throw all your

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.050 
will change and they'll throw all your
balance<00:01:34.040> numbers<00:01:34.310> out<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:34.640> it's<00:01:34.760> just<00:01:34.820> kind<00:01:34.970> of

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
balance numbers out so it's just kind of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.180 
balance numbers out so it's just kind of
wasted<00:01:35.420> time<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:35.870> we're<00:01:36.500> locked<00:01:36.650> down<00:01:36.830> enough

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
wasted time so we're locked down enough

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.290 
wasted time so we're locked down enough
now<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.340> we're<00:01:37.670> going<00:01:37.820> through<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.240> just

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
now that we're going through and just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.030 
now that we're going through and just
balancing<00:01:38.870> from<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.110> ground<00:01:39.320> up<00:01:39.530> it's<00:01:39.830> all

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
balancing from the ground up it's all

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.470 
balancing from the ground up it's all
all<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.460> quests<00:01:40.760> are<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:40.910> place<00:01:41.120> all<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
all the quests are in place all the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.330 
all the quests are in place all the
areas<00:01:41.750> we're<00:01:41.900> gonna<00:01:41.990> go<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:42.530> some<00:01:43.220> of<00:01:43.280> the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
areas we're gonna go but some of the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.310 
areas we're gonna go but some of the
quests<00:01:43.580> are<00:01:43.640> confusing<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.570> some<00:01:45.020> areas

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
quests are confusing and some areas

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.990 
quests are confusing and some areas
don't<00:01:45.470> have<00:01:45.590> enough<00:01:45.800> advance<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:46.700> they're

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
don't have enough advance and so they're

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.850 
don't have enough advance and so they're
they're<00:01:47.360> still<00:01:47.660> kind<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.020> creating<00:01:48.470> content

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
they're still kind of creating content

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.790 
they're still kind of creating content
and<00:01:49.130> then<00:01:49.280> um<00:01:50.050> yeah<00:01:51.050> I<00:01:51.080> don't<00:01:51.380> know<00:01:51.500> what<00:01:51.710> the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
and then um yeah I don't know what the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.130 
and then um yeah I don't know what the

our goal is to get it out by the end of

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.730 
our goal is to get it out by the end of
2011<00:03:13.100> right<00:03:13.520> now<00:03:13.760> we're<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.210> spring<00:03:15.020> we're

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
2011 right now we're in spring we're

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.540 
2011 right now we're in spring we're
right<00:03:16.040> around<00:03:16.190> our<00:03:16.790> second<00:03:17.390> alpha<00:03:17.690> and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
right around our second alpha and

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.910 
right around our second alpha and
pushing<00:03:19.550> towards<00:03:19.970> an<00:03:20.180> internal<00:03:20.810> beta<00:03:21.050> we<00:03:21.470> we

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
pushing towards an internal beta we we

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.400 
pushing towards an internal beta we we
completely<00:03:22.280> overhauled<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.210> way<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.810> we<00:03:23.930> we

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
completely overhauled the way that we we

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.470 
completely overhauled the way that we we
offer<00:03:24.650> all<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.250> skills<00:03:25.520> that<00:03:25.880> meant<00:03:26.420> that

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
offer all of the skills that meant that

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.060 
offer all of the skills that meant that
we<00:03:26.660> pretty<00:03:26.840> much<00:03:26.930> started<00:03:27.710> over<00:03:27.950> on

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
we pretty much started over on

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.620 
we pretty much started over on
everything<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:28.610> read<00:03:28.850> redid<00:03:29.210> it<00:03:29.240> all<00:03:29.450> from

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
everything and read redid it all from

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.140 
everything and read redid it all from
scratch<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.380> for<00:03:30.890> us<00:03:30.980> now<00:03:31.160> it's<00:03:31.430> really<00:03:31.940> just

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
scratch so for us now it's really just

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.000 
scratch so for us now it's really just
making<00:03:32.450> sure<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.140> looks<00:03:33.470> as<00:03:33.650> good<00:03:33.680> as<00:03:33.920> we

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
making sure that it looks as good as we

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.110 
making sure that it looks as good as we
possibly<00:03:34.160> can<00:03:34.400> make<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.700> within<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.970> time

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
possibly can make it within the time

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.090 
possibly can make it within the time
frame<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.450> have<00:03:35.630> squeezed<00:03:36.500> in<00:03:36.620> every<00:03:36.860> little

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
roped into it I think out of the entire

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.699 
roped into it I think out of the entire
group<00:03:48.180> i'm<00:03:48.390> actually<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.780> only<00:03:48.930> one<00:03:49.290> who's

group i'm actually the only one who's

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.619 
group i'm actually the only one who's
probably<00:03:49.920> not<00:03:50.340> really<00:03:50.609> good<00:03:50.819> at<00:03:50.939> going<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.390> and

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
probably not really good at going on and
