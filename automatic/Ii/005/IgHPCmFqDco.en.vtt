00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Two friends welcome to a new 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.649
 video on this occasion we are going to make a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.380
 new sector of my play area 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.059
 good by here is to be appearing in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.289
 this previous top that I did pretty much 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.850
 about 34 months like four months or 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.189
 the brass that are no longer I remember well 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.270
 but a concept that right now I do not know 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.859
 even why he has so many 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.260
 reproductions and I if I stayed like 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.400
 flipando nothing and when it a little bit like that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.400
 because it has other reproductions 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.860
 but in the end let's start with some 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.230
 new things that I have been acquiring 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.579
 in the last months I do something 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.750
 necessary if you knew the things 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.720
 with which I will start recording 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.580
 the things that we do not have things with 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.290
 many times things shut up already stupid 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.150
 test in the end things at two 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.010
 articles that I have here when you wait 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.829
 I'm going to start recording the next ones 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.829
 gameplays in the coming weeks 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.479
 by meticulous useful but in the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.610
 next days they will have anyway 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.799
 some of us always know about pc with some 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.110
 little games 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 random because I do not have the capture yet 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.580
 with which to record the gameplays of 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.810
 xbox then in asia playing types and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.880
 so let's go to it with the new 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.850
 well here we have the most 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.740
 important with which I will start to 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.770
 record the gameplays soon this 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.229
 it would be the beautiful xbox 360 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.000
 well you can not buy the water but here 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.039
 there is the 360 and the truth that presents it 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.500
 it still has quite incredible games the 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.539
 which I will teach in a few minutes 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.909
 just let me go through the things 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.229
 essentials and the main things this 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.060
 it would obviously be the most main thing 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.030
 here are two controls which 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.780
 they came with the console itself and finally 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.880
 to the console is the version and it is with the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.709
 design of the xbox boom and the truth is that 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.049
 I liked it a lot more than the slim and 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.360
 well obviously more than the brand that 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.649
 It was an incredible partition but in short 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.170
 this would be one of the essential things 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.929
 so let's move on with the other thing that 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.370
 I hope you're going to like that too 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.640
 it's pretty 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.700
 and we are going to go in order here we will be with 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.610
 the little screen of 20 miserable inches 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.530
 but it's the one I wanted because then 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.690
 as you can account written 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.320
 it's not big enough either, so it was 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.440
 the one I wanted is a brand because I do not know 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.140
 if it is known cubián I do not believe but here 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.490
 is with what I am playing in fact 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.920
 I started playing here in some all 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.390
 I would have that extra and some others that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.250
 they're down there but good anyway now 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.920
 we will go through with that part right now we are 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.930
 with the part of the species I say of the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.330
 screen of the little screen in 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.210
 order has the essential connections that 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.910
 would be the vejan and would also have the 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.590
 hdmi connection also has a connection 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.460
 usb that the truth I do not know to be 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.650
 but well finally the TV does not reach 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.600
 1080 only goes up to 720 but the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.460
 truth is that it is enough for me 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.830
 because if there's enough good you'll see 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.590
 like this nothing else a few programs the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.319
 which is here hanging a little bit 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.120
 it would be the xbox 360 headband 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.430
 there are states and it does not have much science 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.019
 nothing else used it once to speak 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.359
 with one of my cousins ​​that we're 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.280
 playing the gears of war 3 and up there or 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.139
 be nothing more and annoy some gringos 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.209
 When I'm playing a game, I'm going to 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.409
 say finally let's move on with something else that 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.030
 you know each other but I think it is 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.290
 essential also for the simple so 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.569
 let's move on 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.209
 well here would be this beauty that 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.730
 has lasted more than a year that would be my 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.689
 lovely laptop that as I already do 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.730
 I said is in the previous setup one thing 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.829
 new one that has this good thing this 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.689
 laptop would only be the salmon mouse 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.730
 I had to buy a new one because the 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.379
 that I had before the truth is that I already 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.329
 was giving a little AIDS led to 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.639
 same time so I said better 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.750
 I buy a new one and here is one 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.449
 wireless and the truth is that it is 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.790
 much better than the previous one and both 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.069
 So much city has some bad things 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.139
 but well anyway, here is the 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.389
 make fashions for the people you want and 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.459
 finally we will go with the next thing 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.169
 that you already know here 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.460
 it would be what a hearing aid would be 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.770
 sony 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.030
 with which I can listen there is a 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.770
 which I forgot to tell you about the 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.870
 screen that is here next is that 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.160
 could connect those white headphones 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.140
 here to the television and so to be able 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.240
 hear much better the sound of 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.280
 game which will greatly favor 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.900
 the clean ones in order here would be these 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.200
 these hearing aids that are pretty 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.960
 good so those for them for 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.550
 that I use idiot is pretty good 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.170
 here we will have an antenna that does not have 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.690
 much joke brigantine there is in case 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:45.480
 they want truth also here would be the 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:49.940
 road town where telmex with 10 megabytes 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:52.980
 of his life as one of descent without 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.660
 problem but here would be these things 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.100
 that are the most essential things good 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.950
 in short the horns that are already in the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.620
 previous sector and here this would be I do not know 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.430
 thus would let me look like this 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.020
 in a wider view game view 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.910
 Now let's move on with some things 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.620
 important that would also be the 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.780
 videogames with which we will start 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.970
 to record where we are going to see the box very 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.200
 well that would be more or less the sector 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.840
 so let's move on to another important thing 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.030
 what are the little games so we're going to 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.800
 it and good now we pass with other 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.630
 important things that would be the 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.210
 videogames from the game to me 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.470
 love is the virus or war 3 what is 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.330
 is seeing well the truth that we have 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.250
 he is taking the camera but he wants 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.540
 be taking moderately here stadiums 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.490
 a vote of 6 playing and playing 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.990
 pretty good I really like the 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.240
 multiplayer that's why I play it 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.800
 here will be the was the game itself is 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.870
 totally original as well as 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.610
 we have in the xbox 360 our year of 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.290
 fun towards our web membership of 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.610
 two months then let's play it without 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.980
 no problem and the truth is that I 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.850
 I love a game 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.720
 since just yesterday I lorente in 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.720
 blockbuster 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:07.200
 a game that I just want to play a 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.970
 little what would be your campaign and is it 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.010
 what am I doing in the last hours 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.720
 I've been playing a bit and the truth is 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.240
 that does have an atmosphere of fear 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.580
 quite incredible and the truth is that 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.220
 fun is a game that will 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.690
 be more than a year and here on the channel 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.690
 In the next weeks 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:31.560
 call of duty advanced word of the sea 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.090
 incredible fire fascinates me is 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.430
 very complicated, the truth 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.840
 It is that it is very difficult to play is 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.000
 precious the game is very complicated 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.740
 playing it because they have movements 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.850
 new if you're used to them with 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.410
 you saw them earlier if you're going to 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.270
 complicate a lot in testing it at 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.810
 but I was playing it 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.060
 quite and then I'm going to bring you a 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.380
 game by squad my first game 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.700
 in the next few weeks I hope that already 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.110
 has the capture of the shirt leaving 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.840
 in the whore right now I'm going to take to pérez 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.030
 to claim the flop that would be all for 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.040
 the sector and I hope you liked it 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.050
