 the secret is rubén omen 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.890

 vitamins mineral elements and other nutrients that are lost 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.700
 normally during cooking 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.590
 we call it the veto or kitchen with a minimum of water it's about besieging the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.649
 moisture inside the utensil 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.929
 using the natural juices of food 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.779
 what results in meals that look better taste better 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.309
 and they are better 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:25.859
 the secret of the cooking system with a minimum of weber mine water is 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.469
 the design and manufacture of kitchenware 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.799
 it's something so special that we call them room the triples the system 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.540
 kitchen with a minimum of good tub water is ideal to prepare any 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.949
 food and to show the life three very special people 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:47.969
 jorge casillas the professional trainer hi Jorge because also in 1994 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.809
 received the title of Mr. 6 theatrical avenue so now that 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:56.919
 they must leave despite being professional in the famous hotel volatile wisconsin and with 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.059
 a good job 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.279
 tagline that there is almost nothing better than a greater cohesion inside in the 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.109
 presale tickets to act last April gladly thank you for coming 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.549
 so good 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.349
 three of the next minutes we will show you that to cook with the 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.699
 will power products 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:15.429
 If they do not have food styles the best tastes better and they are more intensive so 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.429
 that it was not like that we finally started 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.809
 more than a hundred mind elisenda public must move key piece to 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.029
 a controlled production and for that 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.369
 maybe the difference is not so apparent just by looking carefully 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.369
 I attended I managed to demonstrate what I want to say 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.679
 here you have been given that a pan of a decade 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.489
 the type of man that most households find 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.680
 more hopefully find in the background that principle I want ninth lap adicae 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 claimed then we will fail 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.039
 so 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.449
 the proof 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:53.989
 in turn they were 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.419
 no doubt the pan in the head 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.650
 It is heated unevenly so the food can be taken into account 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:00.780
 Macías age 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.780
 medal now what happened is the same with what is called 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.119
 it is not needed evenly 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.329
 your utensils are manufactured with a compound center 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.320
 of an alloy of metals that spread very well the heat surrounded by the steel 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.849
 surgical stainless 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.319
 of the best quality 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.919
 these utensils conduct the heat 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:22.910
 as well 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.300
 what is possible or neal 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.590
 up a cake on the stove 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.880
 the kitchen utensils should go to see not only allows cooking the 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.499
 food in a similar way 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:35.949
 but they also help to retain the nutritional elements of most 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:36.770
 the same 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.440
 today after your coach let me ask you what happens with the elements 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.949
 nutritious of the vegetables as we serve it I know what you are trying to 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.580
 tell me and believe me when I tell you that it is one of the things that bothers me the most 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.320
 the problem is that most vitamins 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.740
 and the nutritious elements escape from the vegetables and end in the ring 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.860
 So what happens is that the best of the vegetables is lost by the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.479
 sink 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.430
 so is 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.410
 it's ridiculous I can demonstrate quickly here I have carrot 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.410
 criminal paelladas we are going to put them in the work 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.039
 in a water supermarket I put April 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.639
 they transported what happens 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.150
 without well the water mediately sykes acta-agreement color orange 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:23.650
 to the dads creating 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.790
 that something espeta carotene an antioxidant is super important 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.620
 we are going now 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.620
 ernesto gasco 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.219
 -m orange 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.219
 it was the carrot is 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.479
 here you have habana carrots 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.569
 Mineral vitamins and nutrients 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.990
 of the zone open you reduce with water and it is even worse when I took it 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.940
 because you are demonstrating perfectly what you are already trying 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.800
 to explain 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.380
 what do you think of a method to cook the carrots with any other 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.379
 food that wants to retain the vital nutrients 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.419
 Well, note that these are precisely the cooking utensils of Villaguay 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.290
 you just have to do for you 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.560
 if such an important part of a healthy diet thanks is the system of 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.740
 kitchen with minimal wine water web 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.170
 better nutrition results in more flavor and food does not reduce the 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.200
 secret is in the design of precision of the caps observe as 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.979
 that food is cooked 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.330
 the moisture of the same ones as the caps are condensed 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.110
 then fall back into the pan 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.169
 becoming a vapor 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.650
 and moistens the food 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.159
 the good thing about this decade 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.629
 is that part of the moisture gathers around the lid and forms a seal of 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:47.240
 Water 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.520
 sealing the flavors and nutrients in the pan 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.059
 the August cheese 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:59.059
 the lid rotates on a thin layer of natural moisture 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:00.919
 he was seriously formed 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.389
 and if the temperature drops to form the water seal 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.689
 a half-empty is formed so they do not escape favors have to compete 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:13.329
 so for the kitchen difference the vegetables in which chile came down 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:16.360
 Let's see what you think if we cook 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.520
 he proposes 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.680
 I saw red and yellow peppers 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.550
 we put a little water 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.949
 never high hit 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.580
 we try 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.849
 making sure that the hole in the lid is open 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.210
 the kitchen we will do at medium temperature 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.210
 let medium temperature cook until they are ready 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.910
 only until the orfis whistle blows south 

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.729
 warning him that the water ceo was formed 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.629
 once the whistle blows we close the hole 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:49.629
 we turn the lid quickly and lower the temperature jammedia nothing 

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:52.629
 we continue cooking for 10 to 12 minutes 

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:55.599
 we will try the results there is that rich
