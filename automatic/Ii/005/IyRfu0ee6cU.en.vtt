the<00:04:58.120> grandpa<00:04:58.570> plot<00:04:58.870> was<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.140> little<00:04:59.590> bit<00:04:59.770> you

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
the grandpa plot was a little bit you

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.350 
the grandpa plot was a little bit you
know<00:05:00.160> where<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.430> was<00:05:00.490> getting<00:05:00.670> kind<00:05:00.970> of<00:05:01.090> iffy

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
know where it was getting kind of iffy

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.180 
know where it was getting kind of iffy
where<00:05:01.510> we<00:05:01.600> maybe<00:05:02.110> would<00:05:02.380> have<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.650> replant<00:05:03.040> it

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
where we maybe would have to replant it

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
but we think we're going to be fine just

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.960 
but we think we're going to be fine just
to<00:05:04.960> spray<00:05:05.200> it<00:05:05.380> this<00:05:05.860> is<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.160> apple<00:05:06.520> tree<00:05:06.730> plot

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
to spray it this is the apple tree plot

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.940 
to spray it this is the apple tree plot
and<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.240> is<00:05:07.390> where<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:07.690> saw<00:05:07.900> I<00:05:07.930> took<00:05:08.260> my
