I'm going to compare the Conair flat

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.980 
I'm going to compare the Conair flat
iron<00:00:26.579> and<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.509> Qi<00:00:28.259> air<00:00:28.529> flat<00:00:29.430> iron<00:00:29.840> now<00:00:30.840> I've

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
iron and the Qi air flat iron now I've

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.080 
iron and the Qi air flat iron now I've
had<00:00:31.169> this<00:00:31.380> con<00:00:31.740> air<00:00:31.980> flat<00:00:32.340> iron<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.879> about<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
had this con air flat iron for about a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.950 
had this con air flat iron for about a
year<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.699> it<00:00:35.699> was<00:00:35.910> pretty<00:00:36.120> cheap<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.750> was

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
year and it was pretty cheap it was

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.579 
year and it was pretty cheap it was
around<00:00:37.230> twenty<00:00:37.800> dollars<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.110> not

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
around twenty dollars and I have not

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.390 
around twenty dollars and I have not
been<00:00:40.620> happy<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.860> heats<00:00:44.190> up

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
been happy with this at all it heats up

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.910 
been happy with this at all it heats up
just<00:00:44.730> fine<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.540> what<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> don't<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:46.589> it

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
just fine but what I don't like about it

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.630 
just fine but what I don't like about it
is<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.760> ceramic<00:00:48.449> plates<00:00:49.430> they<00:00:50.430> are

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
is these ceramic plates they are

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.390 
is these ceramic plates they are
permanently<00:00:51.269> in<00:00:51.659> place<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:53.570> what<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> mean<00:00:54.900> is

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
permanently in place and what I mean is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.689 
permanently in place and what I mean is
these<00:00:56.400> two<00:00:56.850> ceramic<00:00:57.269> plates<00:00:57.920> do<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.430> any

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
these two ceramic plates do not have any

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.369 
these two ceramic plates do not have any
give<00:01:00.119> they<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:01.489> locked<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.059> good

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
give they are locked on there for good

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.550 
give they are locked on there for good
so<00:01:04.379> when<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> closes<00:01:05.159> down<00:01:06.200> you're<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
so when it closes down you're going to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.420 
so when it closes down you're going to
see<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:09.630> attaches<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.619> lot<00:01:11.010> tighter<00:01:11.280> over

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
see that it attaches a lot tighter over

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.420 
see that it attaches a lot tighter over
here<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.180> there's<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.170> groove<00:01:14.130> over

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
here and there's actually a groove over

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.450 
here and there's actually a groove over
here<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.000> gap<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.229> even<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> push<00:01:17.430> down

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
here a gap and even when I push down

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.560 
here a gap and even when I push down
very<00:01:18.210> hard<00:01:18.560> there's<00:01:19.560> still<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> gap<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.580> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
very hard there's still a gap there so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.620 
very hard there's still a gap there so
when<00:01:22.350> you're<00:01:22.580> pulling<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.790> down<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.150> hair<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
when you're pulling it down your hair it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
when you're pulling it down your hair it
grabs<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.830> hair<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.520> end<00:01:26.760> of<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.460> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
grabs your hair on this end of it and it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.010 
grabs your hair on this end of it and it
actually<00:01:29.760> pulled<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.120> some<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:30.450> hairs<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
actually pulled out some of my hairs and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200 
actually pulled out some of my hairs and
then<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> hair<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.370> goes<00:01:32.520> through<00:01:32.760> this<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
then the hair that goes through this and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.200 
then the hair that goes through this and
it<00:01:33.510> doesn't<00:01:33.720> flatten<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> way<00:01:34.680> so

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
it doesn't flatten it all the way so

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.610 
it doesn't flatten it all the way so
you're<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.390> gonna<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:37.080> frizz<00:01:38.510> so

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
you're actually gonna get some frizz so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.649 
you're actually gonna get some frizz so

this is cordis nine feet long and I
tried<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.700> today<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.210> first<00:02:03.390> time<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.960> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
tried it today for the first time and I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.869 
tried it today for the first time and I
love<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:07.200> heats<00:02:07.830> up<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.190> lot<00:02:08.399> hotter<00:02:08.729> than

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
love it it heats up a lot hotter than

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.930 
love it it heats up a lot hotter than
the<00:02:09.149> con<00:02:09.390> air<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> love<00:02:10.979> about<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.610> flat

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the con air what I love about this flat

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.009 
the con air what I love about this flat
iron<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.510> these<00:02:13.349> ceramic<00:02:14.040> plates<00:02:14.989> have<00:02:15.989> a

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
iron is these ceramic plates have a

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.130 
iron is these ceramic plates have a
spring<00:02:16.620> behind<00:02:16.860> them<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:18.629> don't<00:02:18.810> know<00:02:18.930> why

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
spring behind them and I don't know why

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.140 
spring behind them and I don't know why
they<00:02:19.409> don't<00:02:19.590> talk<00:02:19.830> about<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.459> box<00:02:20.700> I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
they don't talk about it on the box I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.449 
they don't talk about it on the box I
think<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> very<00:02:22.769> important<00:02:23.280> feature

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
think this is a very important feature

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.119 
think this is a very important feature
what<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.390> mean<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.989> these<00:02:25.680> plates<00:02:26.189> you<00:02:26.999> can<00:02:27.029> see

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
what I mean is these plates you can see

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.100 
what I mean is these plates you can see
actually<00:02:29.129> Bend<00:02:29.810> when<00:02:30.810> you

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
actually Bend when you

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.530 
actually Bend when you
shun<00:02:31.380> them<00:02:31.590> both<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.520> them<00:02:32.550> both<00:02:33.060> sides<00:02:34.130> so

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
shun them both of them both sides so

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.040 
shun them both of them both sides so
what<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.660> get<00:02:36.840> from<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:38.930> when<00:02:39.930> you're

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
what you get from that is when you're

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.260 
what you get from that is when you're
pushing<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.470> down<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.860> your<00:02:40.980> hair<00:02:41.280> those

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
pushing this down on your hair those

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.360 
pushing this down on your hair those
Springs<00:02:42.780> are<00:02:42.960> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> give<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.770> you're

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
Springs are going to give and you're

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.990 
Springs are going to give and you're
going<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:44.850> an<00:02:44.970> even<00:02:46.640> connection<00:02:47.640> here

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
going to get an even connection here
