00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
did go ahead and bump this fuse up from

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.260 
did go ahead and bump this fuse up from
a<00:01:21.689> 3m<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> 5<00:01:22.560> amp<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.700> said<00:01:23.909> I'm<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
a 3m to a 5 amp like I said I'm going to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.789 
a 3m to a 5 amp like I said I'm going to
get<00:01:24.360> yelled<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.439> called<00:01:25.650> an

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
get yelled at I'm going to get called an
idiot<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:27.090> you're<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.450> supposed<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.840> do

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
idiot I know you're not supposed to do

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
idiot I know you're not supposed to do
that<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.380> did<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.100> deal<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.509> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that but I did so deal with it so I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.539 
that but I did so deal with it so I
bumped<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> fuse<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.530> thinking<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.340> might

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
bumped that fuse up thinking that might

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.390 
bumped that fuse up thinking that might
fix<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.869> didn't<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.680> fuse<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
fix it it didn't the fuse was not the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.749 
fix it it didn't the fuse was not the
problem<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.880> even<00:01:36.060> tried<00:01:36.600> bypassing<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.500> uh

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
problem I even tried bypassing this uh

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
problem I even tried bypassing this uh
flows<00:01:38.759> wish<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.329> these<00:01:39.810> two<00:01:39.990> black<00:01:40.259> wires

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
flows wish this these two black wires

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.429 
flows wish this these two black wires
here<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.040> yours<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.430> similar<00:01:42.079> you'll<00:01:43.079> notice

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
here if yours is similar you'll notice

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.219 
here if yours is similar you'll notice
are<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:44.180> indicates<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> tank<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.810> full

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
are what indicates that the tank is full

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.539 
are what indicates that the tank is full
I<00:01:46.259> still<00:01:46.590> haven't<00:01:46.740> exactly<00:01:47.009> figured<00:01:47.189> out

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
I still haven't exactly figured out

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
I still haven't exactly figured out
whether<00:01:47.670> there's<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.030> mechanism<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.689> here

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
whether there's a mechanism down here

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.069 
whether there's a mechanism down here
that<00:01:49.890> picks<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> weight<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.720> sends

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that picks up on the weight and sends

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.469 
that picks up on the weight and sends
the<00:01:52.140> voltage<00:01:52.500> back<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.640> how<00:01:53.880> exactly

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the voltage back up here how exactly

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.870 
the voltage back up here how exactly
that<00:01:54.930> indicates<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.829> full<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.700> when<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
that indicates that it's full but when I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.209 
that indicates that it's full but when I
bypassed<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:59.570> and<00:02:00.570> basically<00:02:01.350> created<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
bypassed it and and basically created a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.190 
bypassed it and and basically created a
loop<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.610> did<00:02:03.000> indicate<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:03.630> full<00:02:03.960> on

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
loop it did indicate that it was full on

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.419 
loop it did indicate that it was full on
the<00:02:05.210> indicator<00:02:06.210> inside<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.810> cap<00:02:07.020> hamper<00:02:07.890> so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the indicator inside the cap hamper so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729 
the indicator inside the cap hamper so
the<00:02:09.030> two<00:02:09.209> black<00:02:09.450> wires<00:02:09.660> are<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.379> indicate<00:02:10.679> that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the two black wires are to indicate that

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.860 
the two black wires are to indicate that
it's<00:02:11.009> full<00:02:11.220> those<00:02:11.730> worked<00:02:12.030> however<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.750> was

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's full those worked however it was

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's full those worked however it was
still<00:02:13.140> not<00:02:13.260> flushing

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
still not flushing

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.380 
still not flushing
so<00:02:14.590> I'm<00:02:14.920> going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.430> put<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.670> cassette<00:02:15.819> back<00:02:16.150> in

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
so I'm going to put the cassette back in

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.839

set your handle down this it was a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.809

first I guess since I've done it a few

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.849 
first I guess since I've done it a few
times<00:02:53.470> now<00:02:53.680> it's<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.700> little<00:02:54.970> easier<00:02:55.859> you'll

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859

little<00:04:04.120> needle<00:04:04.540> nose<00:04:04.810> pliers<00:04:05.139> I<00:04:05.489> rotated<00:04:06.989> the

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
little needle nose pliers I rotated the

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.500 
little needle nose pliers I rotated the
impeller<00:04:08.319> around<00:04:08.829> both<00:04:09.609> ways<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:09.879> couple<00:04:10.299> times

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
impeller around both ways a couple times

what do you know when I'm doing a little

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.279 
what do you know when I'm doing a little
circuit<00:04:17.680> board<00:04:17.709> over<00:04:18.070> here<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.729> listen

probably what you were experiencing
however<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:43.699> noticed<00:04:44.060> if<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.300> let<00:04:44.810> up<00:04:45.050> ever<00:04:45.349> so

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
however I noticed if I let up ever so

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.790 
however I noticed if I let up ever so
slightly<00:04:46.960> try<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.020> get<00:04:48.169> this<00:04:48.289> in<00:04:48.500> some<00:04:48.680> better

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
slightly try to get this in some better

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.189 
slightly try to get this in some better
light<00:04:49.069> here<00:04:49.340> if<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.610> let<00:04:49.910> up<00:04:50.090> ever<00:04:50.419> so<00:04:50.870> slightly

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
light here if I let up ever so slightly

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.430 
light here if I let up ever so slightly
on<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:52.430> switch<00:04:52.849> I<00:04:53.210> would<00:04:53.930> hear<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.139> clicking

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
on that switch I would hear a clicking

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.620 
on that switch I would hear a clicking
noise<00:04:54.620> somewhere<00:04:55.120> down<00:04:56.120> in<00:04:56.240> here<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.389> it<00:04:56.479> was

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
noise somewhere down in here I it was

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.409 
noise somewhere down in here I it was
very<00:04:56.870> faint<00:04:57.169> but<00:04:57.979> I<00:04:58.039> could<00:04:58.190> hear<00:04:58.370> that's<00:04:59.150> when

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
very faint but I could hear that's when

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.330 
very faint but I could hear that's when
I<00:04:59.449> realized<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.199> my<00:05:00.320> problem<00:05:00.830> was<00:05:00.979> not<00:05:01.160> the

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
I realized that my problem was not the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.689 
I realized that my problem was not the
board

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
board

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.640 
board
it<00:05:01.910> wasn't<00:05:02.330> my<00:05:02.389> connections<00:05:02.900> that<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.410> motor

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
it wasn't my connections that the motor

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.839 
it wasn't my connections that the motor
was<00:05:03.889> getting<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.310> signal

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
was getting a signal

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.870 
was getting a signal
but<00:05:05.330> maybe<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:06.680> motor<00:05:06.889> was<00:05:07.130> seized<00:05:07.400> up<00:05:07.669> and

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
but maybe the motor was seized up and

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.649 
but maybe the motor was seized up and
that's<00:05:08.180> what<00:05:08.449> led<00:05:08.660> me<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.979> pull<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.099> motor<00:05:10.280> out

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
that's what led me to pull the motor out

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.360 
that's what led me to pull the motor out
and<00:05:11.659> find<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.229> move<00:05:12.620> around<00:05:12.830> those<00:05:13.009> impellers

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
and find and move around those impellers

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.580 
and find and move around those impellers
and<00:05:13.900> basically<00:05:14.900> then<00:05:15.590> when<00:05:16.159> I<00:05:16.190> hit<00:05:16.370> switch<00:05:16.699> I

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
and basically then when I hit switch I

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.339 
and basically then when I hit switch I
have<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.620> working<00:05:18.979> pump<00:05:19.159> again<00:05:19.550> and<00:05:20.080> if<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.199> can

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
have a working pump again and if I can

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.350 
have a working pump again and if I can
real<00:05:21.560> quickly<00:05:21.800> shove<00:05:22.220> this<00:05:22.400> back<00:05:22.729> down<00:05:23.030> in

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
real quickly shove this back down in

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.800 
real quickly shove this back down in
here<00:05:24.849> little<00:05:25.849> bit<00:05:26.000> of<00:05:26.060> a<00:05:26.120> pain<00:05:26.360> in<00:05:26.479> the<00:05:26.570> butt

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
here little bit of a pain in the butt

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.409 
here little bit of a pain in the butt
and<00:05:27.110> you're<00:05:27.800> gonna<00:05:27.889> get<00:05:28.039> your<00:05:28.220> hands<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:29.150> blue

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
and you're gonna get your hands a blue

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.070 
and you're gonna get your hands a blue
if<00:05:29.599> you<00:05:29.630> have<00:05:29.840> some<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.460> blue<00:05:31.780> tank<00:05:32.780> water

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
if you have some of the blue tank water

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.629 
if you have some of the blue tank water
so<00:05:33.409> once<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:35.229> shove<00:05:36.229> that<00:05:36.469> back<00:05:36.710> down<00:05:36.919> in<00:05:37.190> there
