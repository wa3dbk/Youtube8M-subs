00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.710
 a lover of life I love people 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.730
 nature the great outdoors 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.390
 I said to myself one day I will make a 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.800
 profession closer to the human 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.189
 I help people regain self-confidence 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.050
 I see them I see nothing changed 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 than registering with me and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.160
 regain self-confidence are more 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.560
 flourished and are already going more easily 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.290
 towards the other our first appointment 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.829
 it's always a beautiful encounter are 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.880
 people who want to share 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.020
 I have the impression to start a new 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.579
 book whenever I meet 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.129
 someone 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.370
 I consider myself more like a 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.140
 heart hunter of a mission that I 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.489
 have to accomplish I was way of 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.809
 head hunter but a hunter 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.609
 heart seeon lions but also in 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.839
 the whole Rhone-Alpes region because I 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.250
 moves me to people's homes 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:03.189
 it's possible lions it's central 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.330
 these practices I am 1h50 from paris 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:09.310
 for example me I do not think we 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.470
 meet people by chance that's what 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.049
 moment we had to meet 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.560
 I facilitate the ramp I allow that 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:22.869
 two people meet with the 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.940
 same magic as a spontaneous encounter and 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.509
 when I'm told valerie you knew 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.250

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.640

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.640
