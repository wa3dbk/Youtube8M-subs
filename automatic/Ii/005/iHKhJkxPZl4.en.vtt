00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.739
 nuclear this is people is I consider it 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.050
 double because as we all know in this 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:28.210
 game when you grab the nuclear this 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.189
 run of 30 because the only thing that you 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.320
 It shows is a medal and on the screen 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.020
 that says nuclear what they are seeing in 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.760

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.119
 thousand subscribers so the road to fire 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.220

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.750

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.590
 I will be remembering that we are going to 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.259

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.509

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.330
 playstation 3 subscribers and also 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.790
 of the xbox 360 so that they are the majority 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.739
 possible not because then they make angels 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.750
 you feel that you have to live that he only 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.209
 does in 13 it is known that but I'm going to 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.980
 do in both systems so you do not 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.650
 feel nobody for what 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.480
 so that nobody cries not so then 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.760
 good I'll be 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.950

 playing with all of you we will be 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.670
 playing this game mode that I 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.040
 love last the only one that I like 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.620
 play lately not the extreme mode not 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.230
 because there is then it is there if they kill you is 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.450
 for an error you do not handle is the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.000
 map well that you do not know how to cover yourself not no 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.950
 kill for nonsense that not your bullets 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.019
 or that decides not me that this one is very weird 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.379
 that they kill you because your bullets do not give 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.390
 nothing, and this is what it shows 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.829
 really how do you know navigate the map and 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.000
 all that roll so that's what we're going to 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.920
 be playing people let's make a 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.420
 duck stamping many of you who have 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.970

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.470
 they have realized how much fun it is 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.730
 this game mode not when you grab a 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.370
 bingo in the vi when they do not come out 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.900

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.069

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.540
 short I have not done well short the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.660
 days of the daily video that we have had 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.940
 yesterday 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.160
 I had a video scheduled to be 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.620
 go up in the morning and youtube like 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.540
 I always do not know what would happen to those monkeys 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.150
 what of those who for youtube when 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.890
 everything goes wrong those monkeys that drive 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.760
 youtube I do not know what happened to them that no 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.770
 they uploaded my video and they left me if 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.110
 they left them without video this is there but 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.730
 here I bring you this game this double 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.170
 We are going to call him nuclear and do not tell me 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.940
 which is not because it is a double place 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.130
 final they will see that this shows 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.750
 around 36 hits 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.790
 Now the game is over 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.130
 I'm going to show you also and they look at each other 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.430
 much more beautiful the 36 hits and 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.740
 markets that say two nuclear just 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.810
 there I who know but that's the way it is and 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.270
 I like to continue the streak because 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.130
 when you enter your area and return to 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.680
 start that roll of the nuclear ea is a 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.080
 little angry or but then we will be 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.820

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.800
