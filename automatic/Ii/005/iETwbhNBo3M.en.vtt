a<00:00:25.730> sleight<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> hand<00:00:27.000> pro<00:00:27.289> stopping<00:00:28.289> power<00:00:28.439> pro

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
a sleight of hand pro stopping power pro

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.700 
a sleight of hand pro stopping power pro
and<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.550> ninja<00:00:29.970> pro<00:00:30.210> i<00:00:30.510> use<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> lot<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> hand

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and the ninja pro i use a lot of hand

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.260 
and the ninja pro i use a lot of hand
because<00:00:32.329> this<00:00:33.329> gun<00:00:33.600> takes<00:00:34.550> freaking<00:00:35.550> ages<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
because this gun takes freaking ages to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.610 
because this gun takes freaking ages to
reload<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:38.360> then<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> reload<00:00:39.780> faster<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
reload and then it's reload faster and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.979 
reload and then it's reload faster and
you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.010> aim<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> site<00:00:41.790> much<00:00:42.090> faster<00:00:42.780> too

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you can aim in the site much faster too

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.279 
you can aim in the site much faster too
so<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.620> awesome<00:00:44.719> stopping<00:00:45.719> power<00:00:45.870> probe

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
so that's awesome stopping power probe

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.819 
so that's awesome stopping power probe
it<00:00:47.250> gives<00:00:47.610> extra<00:00:48.030> bullet<00:00:48.390> damage<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:49.079> which

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
it gives extra bullet damage which which

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.340 
it gives extra bullet damage which which
always<00:00:50.489> good<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.270> those<00:00:51.420> close<00:00:51.960> quarter

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
always good in those close quarter

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.840 
always good in those close quarter
situations<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.800> ninja<00:00:56.160> pro<00:00:56.399> because<00:00:56.699> i

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
situations and the ninja pro because i

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.770 
situations and the ninja pro because i
don't<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> hear<00:00:57.420> my<00:00:57.539> own<00:00:57.570> footsteps<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
don't want to hear my own footsteps and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.540 
don't want to hear my own footsteps and
I<00:01:00.780> don't<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> headset<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.250> game

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I don't have a headset on in this game

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.429 
I don't have a headset on in this game
so<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.930> pretty<00:01:04.920> unnecessary<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.820> anyways

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
so it was pretty unnecessary but anyways

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.550 
so it was pretty unnecessary but anyways
this<00:01:07.439> match<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.950> go<00:01:08.220> 30<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> 10<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.290> i<00:01:10.500> think

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
this match I go 30 and 10 which i think

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320 
this match I go 30 and 10 which i think
is<00:01:10.799> pretty<00:01:11.010> good<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.520> light<00:01:11.729> machine<00:01:12.090> gun

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
is pretty good for a light machine gun

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.039 
is pretty good for a light machine gun
on<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.650> map<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.820> which<00:01:15.479> response

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
on a little map like this which response

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:26.870 
on a little map like this which response
is<00:01:17.180> effing<00:01:18.259> if<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:23.930> well<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.520> think<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
is effing if up and well I think it's a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.719 
is effing if up and well I think it's a
pretty<00:01:27.060> hard<00:01:27.330> map<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.979> actually<00:01:28.979> win<00:01:29.520> on

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
pretty hard map to actually win on

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.170 
pretty hard map to actually win on
because<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.960> small<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.909> bond

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
because it's so small and it's this bond

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.950 
because it's so small and it's this bond
sore<00:01:33.420> everywhere<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:35.070> i<00:01:35.250> should<00:01:35.900> say<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
sore everywhere but if i should say you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.760 
sore everywhere but if i should say you
a<00:01:37.079> tip<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.799> something<00:01:37.829> i<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.820> probably<00:01:39.360> say

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
a tip or something i would probably say

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.719 
a tip or something i would probably say
stick<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> sides<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> map<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:43.079> outer

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
stick to the sides of the map the outer

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.520 
stick to the sides of the map the outer
sides<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> map<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.540> you'll<00:01:45.930> probably

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sides of the map and you'll probably

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.020 
sides of the map and you'll probably
survive<00:01:46.829> shake<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.079> corners<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.229> everything

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
survive shake the corners and everything

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.480 
survive shake the corners and everything
because

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
because

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.580 
because
there's<00:01:53.150> always<00:01:53.540> someone<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:54.049> camping<00:01:54.500> in

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
there's always someone in camping in

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.660 
there's always someone in camping in
those<00:01:54.740> corners<00:01:55.310> like<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:55.939> do<00:01:56.000> right<00:01:56.119> now<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.670> in

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
those corners like I do right now and in

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.810 
those corners like I do right now and in
my<00:01:58.820> last<00:01:59.000> commentary<00:01:59.509> I<00:01:59.720> said<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:00.830> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
my last commentary I said I this the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.249 
my last commentary I said I this the
other<00:02:01.970> commentary<00:02:02.479> would<00:02:02.659> be<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.869> shout<00:02:03.229> out

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
other commentary would be a shout out

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.550 
other commentary would be a shout out
commentary<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.189> some<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.610> my<00:02:04.640> friends<00:02:04.759> and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
commentary to some of my friends and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.120 
commentary to some of my friends and
other<00:02:06.560> commentators<00:02:07.009> but<00:02:08.890> not<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.069> time

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
other commentators but not this time

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.000 
other commentators but not this time
I'll<00:02:10.610> do<00:02:10.789> it<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.959> other<00:02:12.110> time<00:02:12.380> because<00:02:12.739> then<00:02:12.980> I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
I'll do it the other time because then I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.030 
I'll do it the other time because then I
have<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.280> free-for-all<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.440> Skid<00:02:15.440> Row<00:02:15.470> using
