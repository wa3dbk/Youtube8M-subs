00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
somewhere else you can just tilt your

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
somewhere else you can just tilt your
transducer<00:01:07.950> right<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> water<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
transducer right out of the water and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.210 
transducer right out of the water and
lock<00:01:09.750> her<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.110> nice<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.710> steady

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
lock her and nice and steady

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.820 
lock her and nice and steady
boom<00:01:12.210> she's<00:01:12.659> locked<00:01:13.430> just<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
boom she's locked just like that so of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.080 
boom she's locked just like that so of
course<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> fish<00:01:17.340> finder<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.790> reading

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
course the fish finder is not reading

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700 
course the fish finder is not reading
anything<00:01:18.299> anymore<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
anything anymore because it's out of the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.440 
anything anymore because it's out of the
water

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450

transducer but swivel it back in quickly

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:34.730 
transducer but swivel it back in quickly
here<00:01:26.570> pop<00:01:27.570> her<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.420> lock<00:01:33.659> her<00:01:33.810> down<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
here pop her in and lock her down you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.319 
here pop her in and lock her down you
can<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:34.979> I'm<00:01:35.070> pushing<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> pretty<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
can see I'm pushing on it pretty good to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:45.050 
can see I'm pushing on it pretty good to
to<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.610> her<00:01:40.130> locked<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.369> good<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.549> here

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
to to get her locked in good so here

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.920 
to to get her locked in good so here
we'll<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.329> moving<00:01:45.540> again

and you guys can see cut through the
water<00:02:03.610> here<00:02:03.940> you<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.990> see<00:02:05.140> we're<00:02:05.290> at<00:02:05.380> nine

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
water here you can see we're at nine

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.490 
water here you can see we're at nine
point<00:02:07.210> five<00:02:07.480> feet<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:07.990> we're<00:02:08.110> getting<00:02:08.200> kind<00:02:08.440> of

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
point five feet so we're getting kind of

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.160 
point five feet so we're getting kind of
shallow<00:02:08.710> so<00:02:09.190> I'll<00:02:09.250> just<00:02:09.430> call<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:10.930> end<00:02:11.080> of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
shallow so I'll just call it the end of

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.770 
shallow so I'll just call it the end of
the<00:02:11.230> video<00:02:11.440> here<00:02:11.770> so<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.550> maneuver<00:02:13.210> myself

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
the video here so I can maneuver myself

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.850 
the video here so I can maneuver myself
into<00:02:14.200> fishing<00:02:14.440> zone<00:02:14.830> over<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.550> shoal
