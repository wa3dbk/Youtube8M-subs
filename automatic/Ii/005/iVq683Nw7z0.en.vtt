00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 of ideas 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.590
 so finally that is what 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.460
 within this office just as you are 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.260
 starting is what can best reflect 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.620
 not so much who you are but rather how 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.170
 you think 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:34.270
 how you approach advertising also happens 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.490
 that we make a creative young book 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.620
 new student 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.390
 the way most of the time is a 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.240
 student book I do not want to say 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.750
 Therefore, of course, this is a trade that 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.760
 although schools do not train 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.340
 pretty to the advertising activity you 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.600
 can give you tools with which 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.620
 many have not counted when 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.800
 starting this is fine 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.040
 on the other hand not 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.390
 the schools do not teach you the trade if 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.610
 they can not give you clues that they put 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.860
 tools can give you very bases 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.980
 good but it is a trade that is learned 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.640
 doing 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.440
 in the end 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.470
 in fact for that reason also because it is a 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.020
 fiction that 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.290
 let's import a little bit over the years 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.000
 matters little for the training that has 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.730
 had the people if they have been titled but 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.980
 graduates studied 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.470
 at the end of what it is about is what 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.900
 what catches my attention are 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.270
 you can see ideas and those ideas can be 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.290
 advertising for me as they may not be 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.840
 advertising 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.539
 I have hired people 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.579
 that came almost without creative ship 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.560
 advertise it 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:51.259
 but what should be I marvel because a 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.710
 case for example he wrote that he had a 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.759
 Blog of very dark humor cartoons very 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.679
 acid and I marvel that humor I do not know what 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.679
 good to be able to have someone 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.869
 that has this acidity not at the time 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.969
 to describe I did not know how to write 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.349
 advertising does not know how to write ads 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.720
 there and then he was learning the trade 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.590
 little by little and now from this goal 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.390
 not then 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.870
 what I'm going to do is that it's about 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.319
 really try to put together 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.239
 a document a book some something that you 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.450
 may be that he is teaching the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.180
 Lavender that can interview you 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.720
 with something else your mind how you think 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.720
 what 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.630
 let's say let's all look 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.940
 inspiration in the end in everything 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.430
 what we do and it's true that just 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.530
 brings a lot of hope when you're 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.790
 seeing in a presentation a book of a 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.260
 young that maybe because you're 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.450
 showing a way of thinking a 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.700
 way of writing what you sign the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.040
 position that you have with distraction or hey 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.040
 It would be wonderful between being my team 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.140
 with this kind of talent because in the end 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.760
 that's what advertising is inside 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.799
 also agglutinate all kinds of 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.510
 Inspiration comes from all kinds of arts 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.540
 mobile 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.060
 disciplines then what is it about 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.610
 is to be able to arm first then that 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:26.850
 personal sample of how you see 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:29.340
 if you like how you write and then the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.450
 stage that is sure to be more 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.629
 difficult for that to be able to access 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.770
 creative lord a creative director who 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.070
 I can give you the opportunity 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.060
 and in the end that is more about today in 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.650
 day that we are all connected 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.770
 hyperconnected is so easy to not access 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.210
 to him the email address of treats 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.910
 people their profiles in social networks 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.940
 they do not do that it can be all very 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.320
 easily then clear as the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.320
 accessibility is easier 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.890
 so much band that can have that 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.900
 same environment an objective dialect 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.290
 possibly send you a means other than the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:17.170
 better way to get attention or yes 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.170
 yes the sml is a wonder 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.449
 but it's about everything, is that you're 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.660
 looking for the way how he called the 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.720
 attention to those people who with the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.919
 committees to contact and there I think it is 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.380
 where they intervene a lot 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.110
 constant creativity of each and of 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.620
 know not to get in the ways 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.830
 found what's going to be called I'm going to 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.430
 give him a package when I know his 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.650
 office that I will go 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.830
 I will see where it is said that the 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.230
 gym goes and I'm going to put it 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.740
 a towel there is with a message with 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.740
 a kitchen 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.490
 is a genius activity and so for example 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.050
 to say something 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.539
 advertising on milk 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.759
 or almost everything has been seen and is very 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.430
 hard not to find a new avenue for 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.949
 here it's about the same there are hundreds of 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.009
 guys wanted to enter this every year to 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.599
 the agencies and then in the end is when 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.759
 everyone to the competition is done 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.250
 naturally and the selection is made 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.720
 also as to who is who 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.720
 is getting attention 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.449
 all right 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.290
