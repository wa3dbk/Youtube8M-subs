start a clan right away I started a war
right<00:00:47.610> away<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.510> had<00:00:48.660> about<00:00:48.870> 10<00:00:49.170> people

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
right away when we had about 10 people

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.189 
right away when we had about 10 people
but<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.070> lot<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.399> them<00:00:50.550> weren't<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.690> we're

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
but a lot of them weren't as good we're

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.799 
but a lot of them weren't as good we're
all<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:52.770> weren't<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.309> good<00:00:53.489> players

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
all of them weren't really good players

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.150 
all of them weren't really good players
lot<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:55.050> were<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.230> Town<00:00:55.590> Hall<00:00:55.800> fives

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
lot of them were like Town Hall fives

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.939 
lot of them were like Town Hall fives
and<00:00:56.640> we're<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.090> level<00:00:57.510> 40<00:00:57.899> or<00:00:58.079> level<00:00:58.379> 30<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and we're like level 40 or level 30 and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
and we're like level 40 or level 30 and
I<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.609> didn't<00:01:00.000> want<00:01:00.120> them<00:01:00.239> inclined<00:01:00.539> cuz<00:01:00.690> i

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
I just didn't want them inclined cuz i

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
I just didn't want them inclined cuz i
really<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:01.710> strong<00:01:01.859> clown

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
really want a really really strong clown

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.310 
really want a really really strong clown
so<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> kicked<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.719> knowing<00:01:03.960> they're<00:01:04.199> in

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so I kicked them not knowing they're in

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.350 
so I kicked them not knowing they're in
the<00:01:04.409> war<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.460> we're<00:01:05.729> losing<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> war<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the war and now we're losing the war so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850 
the war and now we're losing the war so
I<00:01:06.390> guess<00:01:06.600> that's<00:01:06.780> karma<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.409> kicking<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.830> i

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I guess that's karma for kicking them i

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
I guess that's karma for kicking them i
guess<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.280> next<00:01:08.549> war<00:01:08.729> we're<00:01:09.180> definitely

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
guess but next war we're definitely

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
guess but next war we're definitely
gonna<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.290> about<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.799> min<00:01:11.189> 26

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
gonna do well we have about a a min 26

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.570 
gonna do well we have about a a min 26
seconds<00:01:12.210> left<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.770> might<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
seconds left and I think we might do the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.960 
seconds left and I think we might do the
live<00:01:15.090> warrior<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.869> live<00:01:16.700> set<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
live warrior like a live set up of the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.539 
live warrior like a live set up of the

I<00:04:39.060> guess<00:04:39.740> yeah<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.070> pre<00:04:41.280> this<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.580> a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
I guess yeah this is a pre this is a

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.250 
I guess yeah this is a pre this is a
pretty<00:04:41.970> strong<00:04:42.060> war<00:04:42.510> team<00:04:42.720> if<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.900> have<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.110> say

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
pretty strong war team if I have to say

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.020 
pretty strong war team if I have to say
