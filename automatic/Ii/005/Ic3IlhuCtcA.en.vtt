 Ah ah ah ah ah 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.180
 Welcome Welcome to 14 m Topics 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.170
 Healing is l10 lonely at the Vortex station. 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.710
 Ttaeyo future gonna be something you like to charge, I lecture on the tree and Leo 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:46.960
 Thank you. 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.220
 Yes, we are actively working with a researcher in 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.769
 It's done. 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.180
 Leo What you learn in this lecture gatdeondeyo my call wontusseuri foreign 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:59.829
 It is based on the contents. 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.250
 If you would like to listen to the contents of Avra renting hard, 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:08.470
 But you will experience my own breathing . 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:14.350
 Atoserum expect me to ask you a lot of questions as I face this web lecture 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.119
 I saw it. Let's go back. I wonder what time it is. 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.920
 He did it the most . 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.850
 I've had a bond around the end of the month, but a little unfamiliar with the rack every month 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.000
 You do. 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:32.890
 You can see that your knees are healthy when you are on your knees . 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.360
 I am healthy. 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.830
 When I say health, I usually have four to eight healthy, 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.979
 I'm talking. 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.040
 My law says I'm just sorry about health. 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:50.650
 We should not only be king, but an invisible mind . 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:54.850
 Something in mind to something healthy just a map of the features you have energy 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:59.950
 He says he's healthy when he can use 100% money. 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.270
 It's not something I'm attracted to now. Something is wisdom in your heart. 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.830
 It is health that tells history 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.819
 Give me the strength g Another example comes to hear the most common questions 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.380
 The question is, can you recognize the sprite and the sparring by doing so ? 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.470
 I will 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.090
 Yes, of course, if you go into the lung 20 , 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.319
 Supply Open 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:30.270
 Dreams, of course , do not have the ability to judge 20's because of four people. 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:36.239
 20 I do not live because I do not give oxygen to the call with relief. 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.440
 To give to give stimulus to be sold by its enabled status, so every 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.030
 I'll throw it out right away. 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:46.830
 There's enough oxygen to share when you activate something. 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:51.330
 Curl xi It's going to be very active Bow 8 Supplying oxygen 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:56.910
 The supply of oxygen may be similar. 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:03:02.549
 I've been bribing you with you so far. 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:07.019
 For now I will have time to get close to spicy Kaito give you the flow of 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:10.260
 I'll give you a few features and let me introduce you. 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:16.170
 Let's see this convergence. 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:22.049
 Machine slip of the men, but gotta have it pulled ground 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:26.700
 You are born to be born of the brain . 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:31.079
 The genetic map that is being made must be taken as soon as it opens the 21st century. 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.609
 In developed countries, development and research activities for children are still active. 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.859
 It's going on. 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:42.120
 We know it's important, but we hardly need to get a hand. 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:45.480
 I do not think it's important because I do not see it. 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.609
 I just need to get the position within . 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.180
 I can see how important it is 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:55.049
 As our heart encircles the iPhone, 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.160
 He 's surrounded by a hard skull . 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.810
 You 're still being watched . Hungary is so full that it 's hard. 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.160
 It was shown. 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.950
 But even that would be seen as a solid pick two months chiefs wife 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.440
 It serves as a buffer against tentacles . 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:18.870
 Have I need you to do vdc skull acts as a buffer to the spinal cord nuclear 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.419
 If you think that he is floating in a special lamp, 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.810
 Part 4 20 o'clock. 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.990
 I'm trying to make Mary feel his hands and stars . 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.690
 So, the first 10 rooms with a room 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:37.020
 It is called an optional 10a 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.920
 Now when you do itjyo known possibilities. What about the five characters And there Bangle school 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.000
 Please let me know. 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:47.880
 This one is even sleep yoreotge home, the home is divided on either side over 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.840
 There are a lot of these various functions that we create, perceive and reflect on. 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.210
 I do. 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:58.290
 Left 4 What grace does is different Let's try to make one child fall 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:03.600
 A little here and there would go do something because under sh 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.160
 Yes, this is my hand in spring . 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.300
 That's what it is. 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:14.550
 Now , the damage on the back of the back is on both sides . 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:21.480
 This Sony will be able to maintain peaceful health when operating a balanced sense on top of it. 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:24.960
 Then, unexpectedly with you, it is so small in half. 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:30.000
 There's something to look at here. 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:32.970
 Stan d country is soft, and before we left hemisphere of the information provided by OMI 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.250
 The information worked well. 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.800
 As well hasimyeonseo a day of clouds and a stiff debris Information Information vow 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.050
 The interchange is not getting done well 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.120
 I'll tell you a little bit about my rape . 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.860
 You'll have time. 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:59.520
 Let's go all the way inside Freedom Week. 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:06:05.000
 Inside the inside of the alcove inside the entrance to the inside, 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:11.129
 It's Juaze , and we connect it to Danny. 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.349
 It 's not the cerebral limb that controls emotions. 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:19.800
 Then let's put it on. Let's put together a raw 4 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:24.870
 The leek's brain comes out. 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:28.319
 And here you are again. It's a fortress. 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:32.580
 Now right tomorrow with up to nine levels Beast 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:36.199
 Anyway, if you are in training or spinal cord, 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.199
 It is the other half 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:44.230
 How do you feel about my South home homey Cassie 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:49.000
 When you practice your body, you can imagine me 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:53.590
 What is my ansseuge important because you personally that I should do 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.720
 I thought it would be difficult to imagine that by purchasing everything I wash my hair in the way now, 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.410
 I showed it to you guys. 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:06.400
 Internal notes, but this one is at a loss, rather than the brain 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:10.390
 It 's closer to approaching the side from the evolutionary evolution. 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.120
 Through genetic brain we'll see what it once 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.900
 I'll see the chart 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:21.550
 4 In terms of the past, I am better 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:25.449
 Now we can divide into three levels like the National Assembly and the new title. 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:30.610
 First, labor and management goals as you can see in reptiles 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:33.360
 The heart governs life activities to maintain life on the axis of life 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.360
 Then launch
