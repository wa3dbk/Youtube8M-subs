this<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.600> looking<00:00:59.840> rather<00:00:59.989> similar<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.560> what

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
this is looking rather similar to what

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.110 
this is looking rather similar to what
happened<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:00.980> first<00:01:01.130> go-around<00:01:01.370> yeah<00:01:01.790> it

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
happened the first go-around yeah it

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.570 
happened the first go-around yeah it
actually<00:01:02.330> is<00:01:02.980> except<00:01:03.980> I<00:01:04.100> have<00:01:04.220> less<00:01:04.430> of<00:01:04.460> a

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
actually is except I have less of a

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.110 
actually is except I have less of a
chance<00:01:04.790> that<00:01:04.880> I<00:01:05.000> did<00:01:05.210> then<00:01:09.850> you're<00:01:10.850> gonna<00:01:10.970> need

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
chance that I did then you're gonna need

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.930 
chance that I did then you're gonna need
a<00:01:11.180> modern-day<00:01:11.510> miracle<00:01:15.580> I'll<00:01:16.580> mark<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.820> with

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
a modern-day miracle I'll mark it with

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.400 
a modern-day miracle I'll mark it with

best-case<00:02:16.430> scenario<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.819> would<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.120> tied

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
best-case scenario you would have tied

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
holes and by default I think that I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.140 
holes and by default I think that I
would<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:21.650> taken<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:22.010> win<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.640> because<00:02:22.850> of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
would have taken the win just because of

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.820 
would have taken the win just because of
his<00:02:23.239> major<00:02:23.660> meltdown<00:02:23.989> on<00:02:24.260> deleting<00:02:24.769> the

his major meltdown on deleting the
previous<00:02:25.220> video<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.880> agree<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.480> also<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:26.959> to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
previous video I agree and also like to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.479 
previous video I agree and also like to
think<00:02:27.260> tailor-made<00:02:27.739> for<00:02:27.769> powering<00:02:28.220> me<00:02:28.400> to

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
think tailor-made for powering me to
