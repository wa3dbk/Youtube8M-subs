defenders but he is very weak at the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
defenders but he is very weak at the
same<00:00:44.670> time<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.270> yeah<00:00:45.930> he<00:00:46.200> might<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> bit

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
same time now for yeah he might be a bit

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
same time now for yeah he might be a bit
strong<00:00:47.250> sometimes<00:00:47.550> he<00:00:48.180> might<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.510> able<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
strong sometimes he might be able to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
complete midfielder rather than a sense

attacking midfielder if you know I mean

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
attacking midfielder if you know I mean
like<00:01:25.950> he<00:01:26.159> seems<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.640> Bieber<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> central

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
like he seems to Bieber as a central

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.800 
like he seems to Bieber as a central
midfielder<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.759> not<00:01:29.759> moving<00:01:30.000> him<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
midfielder and not moving him up as a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.569 
midfielder and not moving him up as a
sense<00:01:31.079> attacking<00:01:31.439> midfielder<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.340> his

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
sense attacking midfielder so his

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
sense attacking midfielder so his
shooting<00:01:32.970> isn't<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.479> great<00:01:33.750> his<00:01:34.079> finishing

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
shooting isn't that great his finishing

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
shooting isn't that great his finishing
in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.619> penalty<00:01:34.890> area<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.700> will<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
in the penalty area you will see a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
in the penalty area you will see a
couple<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.509> times<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:37.079> should<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
couple of times they should be going in

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.310 
couple of times they should be going in
I<00:01:38.400> mean<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.939> those<00:01:39.240> positions<00:01:39.509> they<00:01:39.930> should<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
I mean in those positions they should be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
I mean in those positions they should be
sitters<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:41.250> no<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:41.670> don't<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
sitters but no they don't go in the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.480 
sitters but no they don't go in the
goalkeeper<00:01:42.899> saves<00:01:43.079> most<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.040> them<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.340> guy

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
goalkeeper saves most of them this guy

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.160 
goalkeeper saves most of them this guy
has<00:01:44.670> full<00:01:44.850> stall<00:01:45.090> skills<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.570> star<00:01:45.780> weak<00:01:45.960> foot

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
has full stall skills for star weak foot

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.499 
has full stall skills for star weak foot
really<00:01:46.890> good<00:01:47.070> finesse<00:01:47.369> shot<00:01:47.399> outside<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
really good finesse shot outside the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
really good finesse shot outside the
penalty<00:01:48.630> area<00:01:48.869> or<00:01:49.229> even<00:01:49.590> inside<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> can

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
penalty area or even inside if you can

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.730 
penalty area or even inside if you can
get<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> game<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.960> position<00:01:52.320> where<00:01:52.350> he<00:01:52.590> just

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
get a game in the position where he just

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.440 
get a game in the position where he just
finesse<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.460> should<00:01:53.700> most<00:01:53.939> likely<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
finesse it it should most likely be a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
finesse it it should most likely be a
goal<00:01:54.780> now<00:01:55.200> he's<00:01:55.380> shooting<00:01:55.920> long<00:01:56.219> shots<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
goal now he's shooting long shots and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.420 
goal now he's shooting long shots and
shrub<00:01:57.030> power<00:01:57.270> wasn't<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.409> great<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.920> well<00:01:58.950> so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
shrub power wasn't that great as well so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
shrub power wasn't that great as well so
that<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.820> why<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> felt<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.689> he<00:02:00.960> should<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that is why I felt that he should be a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.350 
that is why I felt that he should be a
central<00:02:01.770> midfielder<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.520> opinion<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
central midfielder in my opinion and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.810 
central midfielder in my opinion and
also<00:02:03.689> maybe<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.469> could<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.579> like

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
also maybe you could if you don't like

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.399 
also maybe you could if you don't like
him<00:02:06.060> being<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.390> central<00:02:06.750> attacking<00:02:06.869> midfielder

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
him being a central attacking midfielder

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.440 
him being a central attacking midfielder
if<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.860> don't<00:02:08.039> think<00:02:08.250> he<00:02:08.429> suits<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.910> central

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
if you don't think he suits a central

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.270 
if you don't think he suits a central
role<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.989> could<00:02:10.140> play<00:02:10.319> him<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> four<00:02:10.920> triple

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
role you could play him in a four triple

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.979 
role you could play him in a four triple
to<00:02:11.430> formation<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.090> payment<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.780> scent

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
to formation and payment as the scent

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
to formation and payment as the scent
attacking<00:02:13.349> midfield

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
attacking midfield

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
attacking midfield
on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.250> right-hand<00:02:14.460> side<00:02:14.730> who<00:02:15.120> basically<00:02:15.630> act

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
on the right-hand side who basically act

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.470 
on the right-hand side who basically act
as<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> Wingull<00:02:17.010> he<00:02:17.430> did<00:02:17.670> feel<00:02:17.880> quite<00:02:18.210> weak

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
as a Wingull he did feel quite weak

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.380 
as a Wingull he did feel quite weak
sometimes<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.410> said<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.280> overall<00:02:20.820> he<00:02:21.210> was

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
sometimes like I said but overall he was

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.600 
sometimes like I said but overall he was
a<00:02:21.420> decent<00:02:21.750> player<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.320> play<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.710> but<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.400> he<00:02:23.580> a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
a decent player to play with but is he a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.760 
a decent player to play with but is he a
ham<00:02:23.940> shake<00:02:24.180> replace<00:02:24.570> or<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:25.740> i

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
ham shake replace or not really i

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.680 
ham shake replace or not really i
thought<00:02:26.070> hampshire<00:02:26.490> goes<00:02:26.640> well<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.210> i

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
thought hampshire goes well because i

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.990 
thought hampshire goes well because i
just<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:28.170> someone<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:29.010> has<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.310> very<00:02:29.700> good

powerful shown them in that position and
