annoying<00:02:40.269> moves<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.690> guess<00:02:40.870> that's<00:02:41.049> pretty

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
annoying moves I guess that's pretty

decent

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.080 
decent
so<00:02:42.220> agility<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.760> gonna<00:02:45.880> have<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
speed boost ability as well so that's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.970
