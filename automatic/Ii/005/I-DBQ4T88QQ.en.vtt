00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
drying lotion I just dip my q-tip in

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.150 
drying lotion I just dip my q-tip in
there<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.110> directions<00:04:38.560> say<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.800> not

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
there and the directions say to not

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.159 
there and the directions say to not
shake<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.669> thing<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.660> feel<00:04:40.840> that<00:04:40.960> this

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
shake this thing and I feel that this

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.320 
shake this thing and I feel that this
works<00:04:41.410> best<00:04:41.710> on<00:04:41.949> a<00:04:41.979> pimple<00:04:42.340> that's<00:04:42.520> fresh<00:04:43.030> and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
works best on a pimple that's fresh and

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.210 
works best on a pimple that's fresh and
still<00:04:43.600> small<00:04:44.020> because<00:04:44.350> it<00:04:44.500> just<00:04:44.590> prevents<00:04:45.130> it

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
still small because it just prevents it

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.159 
still small because it just prevents it
from<00:04:45.340> getting<00:04:45.520> bigger<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.510> sometimes<00:04:46.750> it

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
from getting bigger and sometimes it

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.120 
from getting bigger and sometimes it
just<00:04:47.350> goes<00:04:47.530> away<00:04:47.680> overnight<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.949> the<00:04:50.949> last

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
just goes away overnight and the last

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.770 
just goes away overnight and the last
thing<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.370> do<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:51.580> apply<00:04:51.699> my<00:04:51.880> chapstick<00:04:52.539> and

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
thing I do is apply my chapstick and

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.390 
thing I do is apply my chapstick and
