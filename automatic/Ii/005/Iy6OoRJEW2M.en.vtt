00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.979
 very good welcome to a new one 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.889
 boxing of the geek trucker channel 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.870
 this time we have a hard disk of 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.670
 500gb of the tauro brand 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.240
 it does not sound like anything to me this brand what 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 I bought in average markt in cost I think that 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 46 euros 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.750
 I wanted one that was digital western but 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.699
 there were not exactly they did not have them but 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 well the seller told me to catch 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 this one that was exactly the same and you 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 it was manufactured even by the same 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.660
 digital webster manufacturers as it puts 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.660
 behind 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.610
 or come back up here so just like 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.040
 I did not want anything special a record 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.680
 hard just to save my photos 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.530
 and my music and so I got it up to date 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:59.730
 the same did not even reach 50 euros and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:03.060
 500 GB this is a 3.0 usb hard drive with 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.290
 system to make the backup seems 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.560
 this is the measure you have 14 5 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.560
 millimeters 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.760
 and here back but what you put is easy 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.710
 Simplicity Lujan plan on connecting and seen 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.200
 soft shell with texture for a 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.360
 superb appearance 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.500
 but formatted for easy PC 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.490
 format for mac usb interface 3.0 not 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.490
 need power cable 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.780
 here they put you for what systems 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.100
 operative is compatible 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.970
 a windows xp windows vista 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.940
 windows 7 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.430
 I suppose windows 8 imagine that 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.790
 I also imagine that it will also have 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.030
 driver already and for mac users then to 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.610
 from 10.5 to think it is leo 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.950
 childbirth leo part snow leopard lyon montan 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.360
 lion we will see if in my montan lion 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.130
 works 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.630
 and a little more 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.630
 in other languages ​​I think 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.109
 well let's open it 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.490
 i 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.170
 the first time I have a disk 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.490
 hard of these I have mega mine but if 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.800
 one of these little ones had never 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.180
 had none 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.219
 what 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.219
 I do not know how to survive packed 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.410
 with the rate 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.410
 Hahaha 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.799
 if you are out 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.540
 comes the cable on one side to connect 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.620
 to the hard disk 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.020
 and on the other as a normal usb imagine 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.090
 which will be usb 3.0 not for what they say 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.060
 and I have more ship and I think it has no 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.920
 usb 3.0 but good I can not 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.849
 squeeze the most I imagine 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.220
 and then comes with the paper this lauro 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.660
 clock loud backup that will be like 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.760
 you can make backups in the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.910
 cloud imagine doing an account or something 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.920
 so in the I also has this in the 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.110
 I do not know what I have, and the truth is that 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.110
 I do not use it 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.920
 we have the little paper here and this 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.920
 will imagine the instructions 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.200
 this looks like the instructions of a 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.980
 I think drug not read that no 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.980
 know how to use it 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.519
 and this is him 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.519
 the 500gb hard drive 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.080
 normal plastic texture 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.620
 it does not weigh much 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.620
 more or less weighs 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.160
 what would be said as the tsja or my 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.160
 hand minus 140 grams approximately 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.200
 here is connected established this 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.540
 since our computer would be connected 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.600
 and then there is a test that works and 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.600
 it works so luxury 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.750
 we disconnected and this has been the look 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.470
 boxing 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.970
 of the hard drive town I hope you have 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.760
 liked 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.490
 I checked in half markt for 46 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.240
 euros that seems like those that have 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.979
 windows or mac 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.650
 if you are interested in a hard drive 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.990
 I'll go by saying if I'm doing badly 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.639
 or all that is worth nothing I hope that you 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.460
 have liked it if it has served you something 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.949
 of the video or entertaining dadle light 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.350
 finger up and subscribe to the channel 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.350
