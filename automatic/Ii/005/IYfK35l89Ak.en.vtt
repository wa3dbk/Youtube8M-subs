the<00:01:52.360> other<00:01:52.510> key<00:01:52.690> products<00:01:53.020> we're<00:01:53.110> going<00:01:53.230> to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
the other key products we're going to

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.200 
the other key products we're going to
talk<00:01:53.440> about<00:01:53.620> our<00:01:53.920> two<00:01:54.220> headsets<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.850> we<00:01:55.030> have

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
talk about our two headsets that we have

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.780 
talk about our two headsets that we have
so<00:01:55.800> we<00:01:56.800> wanted<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.070> take<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.250> little<00:01:57.460> bit<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:57.670> a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
so we wanted to take a little bit of a

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.520 
so we wanted to take a little bit of a
different<00:01:57.820> direction<00:01:58.210> on<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.750> headsets<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
different direction on the headsets the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.230 
different direction on the headsets the
headsets<00:01:59.920> have<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.250> same<00:02:00.460> audio<00:02:00.850> goodness

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
headsets have that same audio goodness

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.490 
headsets have that same audio goodness
that<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.450> bar<00:02:01.660> has<00:02:01.870> with<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.200> different

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
that the bar has with the different

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.860 
that the bar has with the different
modes<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.820> we<00:02:03.940> wanted<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.210> create<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.480> headset

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
modes but we wanted to create a headset

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.190 
modes but we wanted to create a headset
that<00:02:05.050> was<00:02:05.430> felt<00:02:06.430> less<00:02:06.820> toy<00:02:07.390> like<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:07.960> little

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
that was felt less toy like and a little

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.990 
that was felt less toy like and a little
more<00:02:08.290> sophisticated<00:02:08.950> you'll<00:02:09.490> notice<00:02:09.820> there's

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
more sophisticated you'll notice there's

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.630 
more sophisticated you'll notice there's
no<00:02:10.240> big<00:02:10.630> boom<00:02:10.899> mic<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.380> these<00:02:11.530> headsets<00:02:11.950> what

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
no big boom mic on these headsets what

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.150 
no big boom mic on these headsets what
we<00:02:12.760> did<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> higher<00:02:13.600> fidelity

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
we did is we have a higher fidelity

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.470 
we did is we have a higher fidelity
directional<00:02:15.160> mic<00:02:15.370> here<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.850> actually<00:02:16.000> tucks

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
directional mic here that actually tucks

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.990 
directional mic here that actually tucks
up<00:02:16.690> into<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.110> into<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.590> body<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:18.880> you

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
up into the into the body and so you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.430 
up into the into the body and so you
know<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.210> like<00:02:19.330> when<00:02:19.600> you're<00:02:19.720> playing<00:02:19.930> halo

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
know it's like when you're playing halo

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.960 
know it's like when you're playing halo
for<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.770> long<00:02:20.950> time<00:02:21.190> we're<00:02:21.700> gonna<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.940> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
for a long time we're gonna have a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.550 
for a long time we're gonna have a
little<00:02:22.030> red<00:02:22.360> bull<00:02:22.570> will<00:02:22.930> mount<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.260> do<00:02:23.380> with

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
little red bull will mount and do with

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.960 
little red bull will mount and do with
you<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.920> don't<00:02:24.040> want<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.220> glue<00:02:24.400> Mike<00:02:24.640> getting

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
you you don't want to glue Mike getting

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.540 
you you don't want to glue Mike getting
in<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> way<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.750> also<00:02:25.990> don't<00:02:26.080> want<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.320> feel

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
in the way you also don't want to feel

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.070 
in the way you also don't want to feel
dorky<00:02:27.550> right<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.570> makes<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> feel<00:02:29.050> a

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
dorky right so this just makes it feel a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.420 
dorky right so this just makes it feel a
little<00:02:29.230> sleeker<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.890> little<00:02:30.310> more

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
little sleeker a little more

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.460 
little sleeker a little more
sophisticated<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:31.900> when<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.110> deploy

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
sophisticated and then when you deploy

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.520 
sophisticated and then when you deploy
this<00:02:32.680> Mike<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.660> unmute<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.840> system<00:02:35.200> when<00:02:35.440> you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
this Mike it unmute the system when you

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.050 
this Mike it unmute the system when you
tuck<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.890> mic<00:02:36.040> back<00:02:36.220> into<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.580> headset<00:02:36.910> it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
tuck the mic back into the headset it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.550 
tuck the mic back into the headset it
actually<00:02:37.390> activates<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.930> mute<00:02:38.080> button<00:02:38.110> so

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
actually activates the mute button so

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.080 
actually activates the mute button so
your<00:02:38.830> mute<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> whole<00:02:39.280> system<00:02:39.490> which<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.910> kind

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
your mute the whole system which is kind

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.780 
your mute the whole system which is kind
of<00:02:40.150> cool<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:41.410> headsets<00:02:41.860> are<00:02:42.010> extremely<00:02:42.550> light

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
of cool the headsets are extremely light

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.550 
of cool the headsets are extremely light
and<00:02:43.060> they<00:02:43.420> stay<00:02:43.600> really<00:02:43.930> close<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.320> head

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
and they stay really close to the head

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.780
