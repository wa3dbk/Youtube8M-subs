00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.660
 to the euro it also accurately measures the sounds of Macs with installed ten points 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.969
 This may give you a more up to date with justice 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.950
 But to get that information you have to go deep into Apple's documents 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:15.959
 collar 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.169

 Classrooms or Design Studio 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.210

 For the new Mac Mini Server Epple said a Mac Mini specifically as a server 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.960
 designed and preinstalled on the Mac OS x Snow Leopard server

 the way is known for its ease of use and you get it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.760
 Of course they also with the Mac Mini Mitsuo Leopard Server 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.590
 it is ideal for those who have never used a server or for 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.850
 Overworked Haiti department 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.999
 Water was assistant 40 step 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.180
 by step through the configuration 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.770
 our way is connected to an existing network and hardly any water 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.860
 Strom a Gesteck test starts already 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.350
 and let's try the Administration Strutz of the Willow CD 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.440
 to install 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.290

 Help from the Installation Wizard Local or with the Server Assistant program 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.070
 via the network on the server computer will be installed a PDF on 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.690
 The CD Administration Fouls once again provides an overview of the servers 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.880
 Administration Program a 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.619
 the programs require Mac OS x in version 10 point 5 or newer despite that 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.000
 installed 10% 5 on the test computer she will install with the hint 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.350
 to a required version 10 point 6 denied by anyone so take a look 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.259
 on the too big pages of Apple 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.259
 under Mac Mini, there are no indications of the server variant 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.460
 that was some search also find the too high surgery but sport sites 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.770
 in English 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.110

 is required 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.520
 older version so do not work and secondly all programs actually 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.299
 only under ten point 6 run 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.889
 with some effort can be so fully functional as gravel and 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:19.239
 create high-quality podcasts and automatically back up all 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.629
 make important data within a network 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.730
 a Veiel mail 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.340

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.129

 Who does not have his company network up to date and none? 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.639
 intel-mac with ten goals six owns the Mac Mini without additional 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.090
 Hardware like an external the front of it without gate the nature and mouse not 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.869
 use 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:14.149
 especially in smaller agencies and offices, this system requirement is lost 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:16.619
 Circumstances past the reality 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:18.709
 By the way, it works the other way round 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.769
 Zink 5 servers can be limited with 10 6 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.669
