micro links is basically small little

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.770 
micro links is basically small little
metal<00:00:39.260> tube<00:00:39.470> that<00:00:39.800> you<00:00:40.790> clamp<00:00:41.329> between<00:00:41.690> the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
metal tube that you clamp between the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
extension here and that was just poking

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.340 
extension here and that was just poking
my<00:00:46.370> head<00:00:46.399> all<00:00:46.700> night<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:47.180> was<00:00:47.390> extremely<00:00:47.899> heavy

the<00:00:48.559> next<00:00:48.829> day<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.219> felt<00:00:49.550> like<00:00:49.790> I<00:00:50.030> had<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
the next day and it felt like I had a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.720 
the next day and it felt like I had a
giant<00:00:50.840> wig<00:00:51.230> on<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:52.040> actually<00:00:52.250> ended<00:00:52.520> up

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
giant wig on so I actually ended up

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.299 
giant wig on so I actually ended up
uninstalling<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.840> next<00:00:54.530> day<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.100> that

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
uninstalling that the next day so that

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.510 
uninstalling that the next day so that
was<00:00:55.550> maybe<00:00:56.410> six<00:00:57.410> hours<00:00:57.710> we're<00:00:58.010> not<00:00:58.340> even

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
was maybe six hours we're not even

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.639 
was maybe six hours we're not even
anyways<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.690> started<00:01:00.020> researching<00:01:00.140> different

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
anyways I started researching different

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.340 
anyways I started researching different
methods<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.280> came<00:01:01.430> across<00:01:01.520> main<00:01:01.910> max<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.450> the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
methods and came across main max and the

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.139 
methods and came across main max and the
reason<00:01:03.530> why<00:01:03.829> I<00:01:03.860> really<00:01:04.460> want<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.699> try<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:04.939> main

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
reason why I really want to try the main

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.990 
reason why I really want to try the main
method<00:01:05.630> was<00:01:05.960> just<00:01:06.140> because<00:01:06.500> it's<00:01:07.340> it's<00:01:07.820> non

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
method was just because it's it's non

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.210 
method was just because it's it's non
damaging<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.720> your<00:01:08.810> hair<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:09.619> with<00:01:09.740> fusion

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
method its you have to use acetone to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.969 
method its you have to use acetone to
remove<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.390> that's<00:01:14.630> really<00:01:15.049> damaging<00:01:15.860> to

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
remove it and that's really damaging to

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.100 
remove it and that's really damaging to
your<00:01:16.070> hair<00:01:16.250> especially<00:01:16.790> if<00:01:17.150> it's<00:01:17.299> fine<00:01:17.690> or

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
thin or brittle so with the main max

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.870 
thin or brittle so with the main max
it's<00:01:20.720> basically<00:01:21.049> just<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.890> hard<00:01:22.250> wax<00:01:22.490> and

layers aren't as blend as they should be

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.920
