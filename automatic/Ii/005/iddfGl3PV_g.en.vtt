there<00:02:41.569> was<00:02:41.629> a<00:02:42.140> hard<00:02:42.500> case<00:02:43.239> there<00:02:44.239> isn't<00:02:44.599> so<00:02:44.959> be

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
there was a hard case there isn't so be

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050 
there was a hard case there isn't so be
it<00:02:45.319> but<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.280> nice<00:02:46.430> thing<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.640> they're<00:02:46.910> pretty

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
they have a rather unusual teardrop

shape there is the plastic right here

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.220 
shape there is the plastic right here
and<00:03:08.900> then<00:03:09.110> you've<00:03:09.319> got<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:10.690> nice<00:03:11.690> padding

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
and then you've got this nice padding

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.099 
and then you've got this nice padding
right<00:03:12.470> there<00:03:12.739> they<00:03:13.280> do<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.519> just<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:16.870> nice<00:03:17.870> way

right there they do a just in a nice way

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.569 
right there they do a just in a nice way
that<00:03:18.319> actually<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.769> comes<00:03:18.980> around<00:03:19.220> in<00:03:19.310> curves

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
that actually it comes around in curves

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.629 
that actually it comes around in curves
so<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.150> put<00:03:20.359> them<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:20.989> can

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
so that you can put them on and you can

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.300 
so that you can put them on and you can
adjust<00:03:22.639> them<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:22.970> be<00:03:23.090> fit<00:03:23.600> your<00:03:24.109> ears<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.769> to

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
adjust them to be fit your ears and to

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.680 
adjust them to be fit your ears and to
get<00:03:25.489> them<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:26.000> be<00:03:26.120> really<00:03:26.239> really<00:03:26.389> comfortable

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
get them to be really really comfortable

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.420 
get them to be really really comfortable
they<00:03:27.019> are<00:03:27.260> speaking<00:03:27.920> of<00:03:28.069> that<00:03:28.190> really

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
they are speaking of that really

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.220 
they are speaking of that really
comfortable<00:03:28.910> that's<00:03:29.389> in<00:03:29.599> part<00:03:29.840> due<00:03:30.049> to<00:03:30.079> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
comfortable that's in part due to the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.559 
comfortable that's in part due to the
nice<00:03:30.500> angle<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.370> headphones<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.359> part

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
nice angle of the headphones and in part

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.089 
nice angle of the headphones and in part
I<00:03:32.660> think<00:03:32.690> due<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.139> fact<00:03:33.319> it's<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.590> good

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
I think due to the fact it's a good

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.400 
I think due to the fact it's a good
amount<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.459> padding<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:34.940> an<00:03:35.540> unusual<00:03:36.200> shape

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
amount of padding and an unusual shape

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.830 
amount of padding and an unusual shape
to<00:03:36.620> this<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.980> actually<00:03:37.599> conforms<00:03:38.599> in<00:03:38.720> these

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
to this that actually conforms in these

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.680 
to this that actually conforms in these
two<00:03:39.019> minors<00:03:39.349> really<00:03:39.799> really<00:03:40.010> well<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:40.690> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
two minors really really well so the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.990 
two minors really really well so the
headphones<00:03:42.109> have<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.650> 3.5<00:03:43.220> millimeter<00:03:43.489> port

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
headphones have a 3.5 millimeter port

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.460 
headphones have a 3.5 millimeter port
here<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.510> another<00:03:44.690> one<00:03:44.870> here<00:03:45.109> which<00:03:45.139> means

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
here and another one here which means

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.550 
here and another one here which means
you<00:03:45.560> can<00:03:45.709> plug<00:03:45.919> in<00:03:46.069> here<00:03:46.959> or<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:47.989> can<00:03:48.260> plug<00:03:48.440> it

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
you can plug in here or you can plug it

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.089 
you can plug in here or you can plug it
over<00:03:48.739> here

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
over here

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.409 
over here
which<00:03:49.489> is<00:03:49.639> really<00:03:49.880> nice<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.150> means<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:50.299> can

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
which is really nice and means you can

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:51.759 
which is really nice and means you can
have<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.569> cable<00:03:50.870> coming<00:03:51.019> off<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.349> left<00:03:51.560> ear

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
have the cable coming off the left ear

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.530 
have the cable coming off the left ear
or<00:03:52.220> coming<00:03:52.669> off<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.940> right<00:03:53.060> ear<00:03:53.209> depending

or coming off the right ear depending

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.270 
or coming off the right ear depending
upon<00:03:53.599> where<00:03:53.900> your<00:03:54.019> audio<00:03:54.260> sources<00:03:54.620> that's

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
upon where your audio sources that's

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.180 
upon where your audio sources that's
important<00:03:55.790> because<00:03:55.880> these<00:03:56.239> are<00:03:57.040> designed<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
important because these are designed to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.339 
important because these are designed to
be<00:03:58.370> used<00:03:58.579> with<00:03:58.849> one<00:03:59.060> ear<00:03:59.450> cup<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.959> left<00:04:00.169> and

percent<00:04:36.889> of<00:04:36.949> ambient<00:04:37.340> sound<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.729> found<00:04:38.180> that

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
percent of ambient sound I found that

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.029 
percent of ambient sound I found that
these<00:04:38.449> did<00:04:38.719> pretty<00:04:38.960> much<00:04:39.110> as<00:04:39.259> good<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.710> job<00:04:39.800> as

these did pretty much as good a job as

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.189 
these did pretty much as good a job as

that's<00:05:13.819> really<00:05:14.030> annoying<00:05:14.240> this<00:05:15.020> is<00:05:15.199> more<00:05:15.409> like

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
noise machine that's pretty much what

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.830 
noise machine that's pretty much what
this<00:05:19.190> is<00:05:19.340> like<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.090> does<00:05:20.210> a<00:05:20.240> really<00:05:20.389> nice

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
this is like and it does a really nice

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.600 
this is like and it does a really nice
job<00:05:20.900> of<00:05:21.289> blocking<00:05:21.529> the<00:05:21.800> sound<00:05:21.979> both<00:05:22.219> between

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
job of blocking the sound both between

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.050 
job of blocking the sound both between
the<00:05:23.240> cushions<00:05:23.719> that<00:05:23.810> block<00:05:24.259> out<00:05:24.469> the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
the cushions that block out the

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.580 
the cushions that block out the
surrounding<00:05:26.060> sound<00:05:26.300> passively<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.110> the

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
surrounding sound passively and the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.869 
surrounding sound passively and the
active<00:05:27.919> noise<00:05:28.039> cancellation

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.010 

now<00:05:31.879> there's<00:05:32.060> another<00:05:32.180> feature<00:05:32.629> of<00:05:32.840> these

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
now there's another feature of these

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.990 
now there's another feature of these
which<00:05:33.199> I<00:05:33.289> really<00:05:33.590> really<00:05:33.620> like<00:05:33.860> if<00:05:34.279> you<00:05:34.699> notice

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
which I really really like if you notice

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.029 
which I really really like if you notice
there's<00:05:35.210> this<00:05:35.270> Bella<00:05:35.750> dine<00:05:36.020> emblem<00:05:36.860> right

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
there's this Bella dine emblem right

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.950 
there's this Bella dine emblem right
here<00:05:37.310> this<00:05:37.699> one<00:05:38.000> on<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.449> right<00:05:38.569> ear<00:05:38.719> doesn't

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
here this one on the right ear doesn't

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.869 
here this one on the right ear doesn't
do<00:05:39.139> anything<00:05:39.500> but<00:05:40.009> this<00:05:40.190> one<00:05:40.370> on<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.550> left<00:05:40.729> ear

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
do anything but this one on the left ear

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.119 
do anything but this one on the left ear
actually<00:05:41.270> is<00:05:41.659> a<00:05:41.690> button<00:05:42.110> and<00:05:42.620> when<00:05:42.740> you<00:05:42.860> push

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129 
actually is a button and when you push

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.610 
actually is a button and when you push
and<00:05:43.279> hold<00:05:43.520> it<00:05:43.669> it<00:05:43.849> actually<00:05:44.150> allows<00:05:44.779> outside

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
and hold it it actually allows outside

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.010 
and hold it it actually allows outside
sound<00:05:46.009> to<00:05:46.250> come<00:05:46.460> in<00:05:46.639> so<00:05:47.240> for<00:05:47.449> example<00:05:47.810> if<00:05:47.930> you

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
sound to come in so for example if you

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.740 
sound to come in so for example if you
have<00:05:48.259> the<00:05:48.440> headphones<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:49.009> as<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:50.180> do<00:05:50.240> now<00:05:50.509> and

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
have the headphones on as I do now and

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.769 
have the headphones on as I do now and
you<00:05:50.830> push<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:52.039> button<00:05:52.339> it<00:05:52.909> turns<00:05:53.330> off<00:05:53.629> the

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 
you push the button it turns off the

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.899 
you push the button it turns off the
noise<00:05:53.960> cancellation<00:05:54.529> allows<00:05:55.460> more<00:05:55.759> of<00:05:55.819> the

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
noise cancellation allows more of the

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:56.980 
noise cancellation allows more of the
sound<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.300> come<00:05:56.419> in<00:05:56.539> so<00:05:56.629> you<00:05:56.719> can<00:05:56.839> have<00:05:56.960> a

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
sound to come in so you can have a

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.230 
sound to come in so you can have a
conversation<00:05:57.370> when<00:05:58.370> you're<00:05:58.490> done<00:05:58.759> and<00:05:59.089> you

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
conversation when you're done and you

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.550 
conversation when you're done and you
want<00:05:59.419> to<00:05:59.479> go<00:05:59.569> back<00:05:59.750> to<00:05:59.960> having<00:06:00.139> a<00:06:00.289> little<00:06:00.409> bit

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
want to go back to having a little bit

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.559 
want to go back to having a little bit
of<00:06:00.680> peace<00:06:00.860> just<00:06:01.699> let<00:06:01.849> go<00:06:01.969> and<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.210> active

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
of peace just let go and the active

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.779 
of peace just let go and the active
noise<00:06:02.750> cancellation<00:06:03.259> kicks<00:06:03.650> right<00:06:04.069> in<00:06:04.310> after

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
noise cancellation kicks right in after

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.659 
noise cancellation kicks right in after
that<00:06:05.319> overall<00:06:06.319> I'm<00:06:06.589> really<00:06:07.250> impressed<00:06:07.460> with

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
that overall I'm really impressed with

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.850 
that overall I'm really impressed with
the<00:06:07.879> sound<00:06:08.180> that<00:06:08.419> these<00:06:08.599> put<00:06:08.810> out<00:06:08.960> it<00:06:09.710> is<00:06:09.830> a

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
the sound that these put out it is a

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.420 
the sound that these put out it is a
very<00:06:10.339> nice<00:06:10.550> sound<00:06:10.819> it's<00:06:11.150> not<00:06:11.830> it's<00:06:12.830> not<00:06:13.069> too

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
very nice sound it's not it's not too

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.249 
very nice sound it's not it's not too
bassy<00:06:13.699> but<00:06:14.150> it's<00:06:14.270> got<00:06:14.419> plenty<00:06:14.629> of<00:06:14.870> fullness

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
bassy but it's got plenty of fullness

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.680 
bassy but it's got plenty of fullness
and<00:06:15.620> richness<00:06:15.680> things<00:06:16.669> were<00:06:16.819> very<00:06:16.879> very<00:06:17.180> clear

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
and richness things were very very clear

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.290 
and richness things were very very clear
as<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.169> music<00:06:18.500> was<00:06:18.680> flowing<00:06:18.979> and<00:06:19.250> that<00:06:20.000> was

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
as the music was flowing and that was

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.790 
as the music was flowing and that was
especially<00:06:20.599> so<00:06:20.990> when<00:06:21.139> the<00:06:21.289> active<00:06:21.589> noise

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
especially so when the active noise

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.769 
especially so when the active noise
cancellation<00:06:22.219> was<00:06:22.520> turned<00:06:22.759> on<00:06:22.909> the<00:06:23.419> battery

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:23.779 
cancellation was turned on the battery

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:25.480 
cancellation was turned on the battery
life<00:06:23.930> I<00:06:24.050> can't<00:06:24.349> give<00:06:24.529> you<00:06:24.560> an<00:06:24.740> exact<00:06:25.069> number

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
life I can't give you an exact number

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.800 
life I can't give you an exact number
for<00:06:25.520> how<00:06:25.909> long<00:06:26.089> they're<00:06:26.270> going<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.449> run<00:06:26.599> but

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
for how long they're going to run but

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.019 
for how long they're going to run but
I'm<00:06:26.900> finding<00:06:27.169> they're<00:06:27.409> running<00:06:27.770> for<00:06:28.129> 10<00:06:29.000> hours

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 
I'm finding they're running for 10 hours

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.600 
I'm finding they're running for 10 hours
plus<00:06:29.599> without<00:06:30.169> a<00:06:30.199> problem<00:06:30.770> they<00:06:31.219> seem<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:31.520> be

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
plus without a problem they seem to be

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.119 
plus without a problem they seem to be
very<00:06:31.879> very<00:06:32.240> efficient<00:06:32.960> as<00:06:33.289> far<00:06:33.349> as<00:06:33.680> the<00:06:33.800> use<00:06:33.949> of

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129 
very very efficient as far as the use of

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:37.029 
very very efficient as far as the use of
the<00:06:34.250> battery<00:06:34.810> battery<00:06:35.810> life<00:06:35.990> and<00:06:36.229> the<00:06:36.800> fact

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
the battery battery life and the fact

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.790 
the battery battery life and the fact
that<00:06:37.190> they<00:06:37.490> don't<00:06:37.759> use<00:06:38.409> standard<00:06:39.409> batteries

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
that they don't use standard batteries

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.940 
that they don't use standard batteries
but<00:06:39.979> having<00:06:40.279> a

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
but having a

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.880 
but having a
rechargeable<00:06:41.670> battery<00:06:42.450> inside<00:06:42.900> means<00:06:43.650> that

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
rechargeable battery inside means that

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.590 
rechargeable battery inside means that
you<00:06:44.010> can<00:06:44.190> quickly<00:06:44.520> plug<00:06:45.210> in<00:06:45.420> an<00:06:45.540> external

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
you can quickly plug in an external

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.570 
you can quickly plug in an external
battery<00:06:46.050> give<00:06:46.620> them<00:06:46.770> a<00:06:46.830> little<00:06:46.950> more<00:06:47.130> juice<00:06:47.400> if

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
battery give them a little more juice if

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.000 
battery give them a little more juice if
you<00:06:47.670> run<00:06:47.850> out<00:06:47.880> and<00:06:48.240> keep<00:06:48.450> going<00:06:48.900> so<00:06:49.410> they<00:06:49.800> work

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
you run out and keep going so they work

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.500 
you run out and keep going so they work
really<00:06:50.280> really<00:06:50.400> well<00:06:50.640> in<00:06:50.880> that<00:06:50.910> regard

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
really really well in that regard

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.850 
really really well in that regard
they<00:06:51.810> are<00:06:53.840> they're<00:06:54.840> expensive<00:06:55.200> for<00:06:55.590> what<00:06:55.710> they

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
they are they're expensive for what they

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.240 
they are they're expensive for what they
are<00:06:56.010> but<00:06:56.520> but<00:06:57.240> they're<00:06:57.840> good<00:06:58.500> quality<00:06:58.770> and

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
are but but they're good quality and

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.040 
are but but they're good quality and
they<00:06:59.430> do<00:06:59.670> a<00:06:59.700> good<00:06:59.940> job<00:07:00.000> of<00:07:00.300> canceling<00:07:00.930> out

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
they do a good job of canceling out

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.170 
they do a good job of canceling out
sound<00:07:01.380> actively<00:07:01.890> and<00:07:02.130> most<00:07:02.640> of<00:07:02.820> the<00:07:02.880> active

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
sound actively and most of the active
