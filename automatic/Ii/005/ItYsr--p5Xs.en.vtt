00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.469
 Now we will tell you how the inspection is done. 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.660
 nests between first you need to get but 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.030
 I have different removable boxes 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.769
 queen cells shrink but doors 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.369
 ordinary inspection case for the second or third 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.340
 day and but this is me 1 testing females 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.470
 Well here is why some kids her 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.760
 you can see that it is visible that well in the majority 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.730
 cases of enough milk 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.320
 notes to 2 bottom that drags it too well 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.720
 let's see further as always the female 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.180
 will lead and what we inspect will see 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.559
 general vitality of babies as they are themselves 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.309
 lead now and feel the heat 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.809
 hands and but see they are a little hungry 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.190
 when examining the dead or alive i 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.989
 always do through fluff that is 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.110
 I feel it is sensitive 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.400
 they are felt by all stillborn even 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.500
 if the first day is needed of course 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.850
 do not leave clean but usually those 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.530
 who are stillborn they are all 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.360
 are around not building with these 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.739
 babes because they are cold babes 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.960
 trying to push away from yourself 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.970
 so they are all on the periphery 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.059
 let's say so from the center or if you 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.810
 from the hut goes the house they are on 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.079
 back wall 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.969
 On these babies they were born on 5 number 4 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.000
 of the day that is, they already have a little bit 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:18.140
 pubescence can be seen that the radio does not inspect 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.060
 usually 2 3 in 1 i try not to climb even 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.369
 if in the summer someone is dead there was born 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.740
 still strong enough there 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.079
 smell of decomposition will not be on the second 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.950
 day and what we did not wait for we do when 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.679
 the first inspection 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.249
 but especially if you can pick a burdock at home 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:36.170
 fluff from the mother but in principle let's say 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.179
 talquistina fluff good mother for fluff 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.369
 quite a lot to tear even some 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.619
 females Muto snarled and then fluff because 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.829
 that the cold weather was not naku 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.659
 hodorov more topping up the bed they 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.689
 the female will shelter herself as well 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.130
 they are covered with cleaning cleaning but in neve 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.340
 should be pure female should not be here 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.380
 walking in a big bad female who 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.969
 walks in a big way it can also be like marriage 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.950
 clean up because well, not sdo 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.939
 the kids will be polluted too 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.389
 stomach upset 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:09.140
 they will have problems with this 

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:11.569
 but the litter here I do not fit in 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.219
 warm season in principle but 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.090
 so I feed polnoratsionny feed 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:18.170
 he doesnâ€™t buy much for it 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.730
 since I have it here less 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.430
 closed all around on here 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.819
 the temperature is warm even in winter 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.209
 manure is almost not removed and in winter 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:34.480
 at -10 me here sing furniture to her 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.480
 it works fine
