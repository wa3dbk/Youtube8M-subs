00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.640
So what we're going to test in this video is the dangerous electromagnetic frequencies from tablets

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.300
as well as laptop computers now what we
have here is an EMF detector

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.690
what this detects is three different
types of radiation.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.990
We're going to test it with magnetic, that's
most dangerous. Now the range is from 0 to 100

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.810
here

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.830
the SEC has decided that after 3 is where it becomes dangerous and what does that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.920
mean after three

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.710
It can mess with your sleep cycles, give you fatigue, depression,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.470
lower sperm count as we get past
three

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.510
and you know up into the high rate, we're talking about the possibly of

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.710
cancer, tumors and many other things. So what we have here is a typical

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.120
tablet, and just to measure this

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.510
you can see here the range - this is on -

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.579
range goes up to...see there,

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.199
bang! Right up to 100, now just to show
you something I know a lot of parents are use to

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.230
here Carter, you want to watch a movie here?

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.230
okay go wash it where you normally
watch it. So as you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.130
can see here

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.840
the dangerous part about this is where
he keeps it is right on top of his

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.100
reproductive organs

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.900
so Carter, is it okay for me to just put a
case on it?

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.760
yeah

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.880
I'll give this back to you in a second buddy. What we're going to do is put

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.900
on a pong research case.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.340
And the case, defers a lot of the radiation

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.530
over eighty percent of it to the back of
the device

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.140
do you no longer have to worry about it
coming onto the front

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.869
because it has just as much radiation coming that way, so you still don't want to use it on your

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.000
lap, because it's just deflecting it over the course of the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.970
back, but because there is an antenia in this case

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.990
it actually increases

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.000
wifi and cell service and gives
you more battery power

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.630
because it's no longer searching for
signal. It's a smart on and off case, so it will go on

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.850
and off, when you close it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.909
but more importantly it has

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.039
this, what they call case origomi what
this does is allow you to make a stand

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.489
so that you can rest it either in that
direction or the other direction

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.040
There's many different options, you can set it up so that it is like a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.140
typical typewriter

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.640
but I like this case for many reasons, and it's a hard case on both sides

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.680
and it clicks in when you're actually using the right one

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.200
so that's one of the options with this but
most importantly you don't want to keep this on

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.799
your lap

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.970
now as far as laptops go, just to show you
how

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.049
much more radiation than a tablet
is, as soon as I put it near the

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:40.540
back

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.870
it goes right up past 100, and this only
goes to 100, who knows how far it would go.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.510
this is as bad as the microwave

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.560
Now, for this reason this, companies no longer call these laptops,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.769
they call them personal computers

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.079
because they recognize that it's very
dangerous you put this on your lap

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.739
so what are some options for you to
protect yourself against this? To begin

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.430
with

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.620
desktops are always safer than laptops

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.709
so if you can use that, great. if you can't, what you want to do is hook up a keyboard

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.000
that will give you the distance, so this is pushed away from you, as well as you're not touching it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.739
directly

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.180
now some other options are a defender pad, which I'll include a link below for

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.630
this

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.730
as well as for the pong case, and anything
else I talk about, because it deflects

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.799
99.9 percent the radiation, and the
three main types

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.409
going onto your lap, if you absolutely must use this on your lap, or if you have a child

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.569
that does that sort of thing. Some other options are, you can

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.790
get a radiation cover to protect yourself

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.920
that way, it also works for desktop and something else that is very important is not

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.280
plugging it into electricity while you're working on it, because it tests higher

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.470
for electro magnetic frequencies while it's plugged into the the electric.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.470
and you would want to plug in your wifi. and in the next video I'm going to show you the dangerous effects

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.170
of wifi and the Solutions to it, to prevent from getting radiation

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.540
in that direction, but other options on this are...Nasa

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.140
did a test and showed that cactus absorbed radiation in the air

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.680
as well as if you've ever seen those salt lamps and they work very well

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.830
also some other things from the inside
out is to

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.470
eat foods that are anitoxidant rich
or rich in vitamin A and C. Were talking

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.859
about carrots, tomatoes, and apples, that sort of thing.

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.239
But the best of all is my favorite supplement called Astaxanthin and

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.789
that actually stops raditation going into
your body as well as Zinc.

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.810
Other options are to buy and earthing mat because if you're touching the mat

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.380
it won't allow your body to absorb it
because your in connection with the earth

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.090
also have a a link below in my in my
blog

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.990
at www.TheArtofUnity.com for that. In the next video we talk about the dangerous effects of wifi.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.190
and how you can protect yourself from
that hope this works well

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.760
for you, good Luck!...So another thing to do from the inside out is take antioxidants such as

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.090
vitamin A&amp;C.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.760
Can you test my Piggy bank? Sure! lets see

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.070
Piggy Banks are okay. You're safe

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.659
Carter, haha.
