00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.309
 welcome i am thin stripe frames for 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.380
 draw well dotcom in this video 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.510
 I want to introduce you to the concept of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.840
 mask and to use the tools of 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.270
 fundamental selection 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.670
 I introduce you to the frame and next to them 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.340
 elementary photoshop tools 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.490
 to make selections 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.369
 this is the m key frame on your keyboard 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.040
 if you click and drag, a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.160
 dotted dotted line of size 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.010
 that you choose with a square shape 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.880
 if you press the shift key while doing 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.190
 is the frame you will make a perfect square 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.360
 if you click on the selection area 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 You can move it wherever you want , that's 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.510
 if you click outside the area 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.480
 selection will disappear 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.829
 7 is click and you keep on its icon in 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.960
 toolbar 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.390
 you will see a submenu that offers you 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.170
 other frame possibilities like the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.490
 circular or elliptical frame 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.130
 the other options forgotten moment 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.990
 just like it happened before without pressing the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.810
 shift key in this case you will make a 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.880
 perfect circle 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.299
 if I go with the brush over the selection 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.460
 I only color the selected area 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.350
 outside is on the sidelines but it is not 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.990
 a mask is the frame tool 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.750
 which is still active ok with the selection 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.020
 done if we press the alt key observes 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.340
 how the less- tiny symbol appears 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.200
 that means that we have subtract 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.799
 selection surface on which already 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.729
 we had a look if what you want is 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.140
 add surface press the shift key 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.730
 will appear a little one where before 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.700
 there was one less 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.040
 if you press the control key and click 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.960
 by dragging out of the area you will move the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.510
 selection on the wind as if 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.150
 moviese is the layer if you press and drag 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.510
 about the selection you will cut the layer with 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.090
 the form of the selection you have 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.300
 with a selection made if you press the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.160
 alt key + control key will appear a 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.950
 little black arrow superimposed on a 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.320
 white by clicking and dragging 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.640
 duplicate to sessa selection in it 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.040
 cap 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.860
 if you do the same but if the selection 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.740
 activated will duplicate is the content of 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.740
 that layer in another just below that 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.030
 now let's go for the loop this 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.880
 tool allows you to make selections 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.930
 like the frame but with something more than 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.060
 versatility 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.430
 the normal bow is very good for drawing 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.049
 freehand the type of area of 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.650
 selection with the form that you can 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.769
 interest so when you let go , the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.810
 selection for the loop the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.889
 same keys as for the elections 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.319
 with the alt alttrae shift frame add and 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.330
 the control key allows you to move and 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.870
 cut 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.840
 the polygonal tie goes by points or by 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.030
 dot point nodes generates a line 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.950
 total straight is going very well to do 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.470
 selections of geometric areas and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.680
 straight once you've finished the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.450
 selection double click or try to do 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.930
 match the final end with the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.930
 beginning 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.500
 we also have the magnetic loop that 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.690
 It is usually used more in photography 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.569
 that the drawing basically suits the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.420
 outline of the forms but it goes 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.849
 that way and I never use it 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.230
 well now you know how to do 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.520
 selections with these two tools 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.370
 let's go for the most expensive ones 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.730
 look at this illustration if I have a 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.770
 selection made on it and pulse here 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.730
 in this button that is below in the 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.800
 Layers window generated a mask 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.950
 observe how the outside area is hidden 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.070
 it's masked it's still there but it's not 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.430
 go and I can only draw on the part 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.180
 visible 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.950
 realize that this new element has 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.469
 appeared to the right in our layer 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.139
 a canvas with the same size but with 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:19.989
 a blank area and in black 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.419
 the one in black is the area that remains hidden 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.240
 and white is the canvas that can 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.620
 keep using 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.039
 that's the active area make sure 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.069
 select the layer on the left if 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.030
 not the different virtual mask that already 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.030
 I'll explain later 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.610
 an important fact you can do 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.190
 any kind of selection and then 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.200
 Get used to go looking mask 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.900
 appear these mask layers next to 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.550
 your normal layers from now on 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.770
 will become something everyday 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.770
 If you want to advance in digital art 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.450
 try to remember this black is where not 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.440
 you can paint and white the area that is 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:12.380
 active but only if you select the layer 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.450
 of the drawing the one on the left side 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.710
 knowing and using masks well is 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.960
 essential to draw with 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.320
 photoshop allows you to have control 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.940
 almost absolute about many factors to the 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.460
 time to make your illustrations 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.430
 you'll see practical applications in videos 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.410
 successive do not miss them subscribe to 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.450
 the web to be aware of any 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.020
 novelty and do not forget to do the 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.020
 exercises 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.410
 thanks for drawing well
