recommend not using a spaghetti or any
noodles<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.240> because<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.600> easier<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.990> eat

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
noodles just because it's easier to eat

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.779

especially if you're having a picnic or
something<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.750> I've<00:00:24.840> cooked<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
something like that so I've cooked it to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.650 
something like that so I've cooked it to
the<00:00:25.760> specifications<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.300> back<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the specifications on the back of the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.050 
the specifications on the back of the
packet<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.109> I've<00:00:29.039> rinsed<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.640> cold<00:00:29.820> water

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
packet and I've rinsed it in cold water

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.089 
packet and I've rinsed it in cold water
to<00:00:30.150> stop<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> cooking<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> drizzled

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to stop the cooking and then I drizzled

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.530

gonna help the spinach break down a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.830 
gonna help the spinach break down a
little<00:01:57.479> bit<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> acid<00:01:59.000> and<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
little bit because of the acid and I

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.749 
little bit because of the acid and I
I've<00:02:01.710> heard<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.130> people<00:02:02.399> say<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.700> they

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
I've heard a lot of people say that they

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.639 
I've heard a lot of people say that they
don't<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:02.969> seeds<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.450> tomatoes<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.079> prefer

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
don't like seeds and tomatoes I prefer

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.109 
don't like seeds and tomatoes I prefer
them<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.890> think<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.189> seeds<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:05.729> contain

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
them I think the seeds actually contain

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.960 
them I think the seeds actually contain
most<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> flavor<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.979> don't<00:02:08.640> feed<00:02:08.849> your

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
most of the flavor so don't feed your

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.190 
most of the flavor so don't feed your
Tomatoes<00:02:09.300> especially<00:02:09.810> when<00:02:09.929> they're<00:02:10.050> like

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
Tomatoes especially when they're like

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.839 
Tomatoes especially when they're like
this<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:10.979> you'll<00:02:11.099> lose<00:02:11.280> all<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> juice

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
this because you'll lose all the juice

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.040 
this because you'll lose all the juice
from<00:02:12.599> step<00:02:12.870> though

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
from step though

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.200 
from step though
in<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:13.320> as<00:02:13.440> well<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.370> next<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.970> little

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
in there as well the next just a little

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.310 
in there as well the next just a little
little<00:02:15.660> clove<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.020> garlic<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.870> gonna<00:02:19.080> mince

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
little clove of garlic just gonna mince

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.760 
little clove of garlic just gonna mince
that<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:20.090> raw<00:02:21.090> garlic<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.720> very<00:02:21.750> punchy<00:02:22.410> in

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
that up raw garlic is very punchy in

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.010 
that up raw garlic is very punchy in
flavor<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.820> can<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.180> very<00:02:24.300> off-putting<00:02:24.570> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
flavor and it can be very off-putting to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.770 
flavor and it can be very off-putting to
some<00:02:25.170> people<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.280> always<00:02:27.180> recommend<00:02:27.270> never

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
some people so I always recommend never

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.450 
some people so I always recommend never
using<00:02:28.140> more<00:02:28.350> than<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> clove<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:29.010> little<00:02:29.280> goes<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
using more than a clove a little goes a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.240 
using more than a clove a little goes a
long<00:02:29.580> way<00:02:29.940> especially<00:02:30.410> when<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.590> raw<00:02:31.800> it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
long way especially when it's raw it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.430 
long way especially when it's raw it
loses<00:02:33.090> its<00:02:33.270> flavor<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.960> becomes<00:02:34.200> more

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
loses its flavor and it becomes more

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.560 
loses its flavor and it becomes more
mellow<00:02:34.740> as<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.340> cook<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.420> use

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
mellow as you cook it so you can use

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.320 
mellow as you cook it so you can use
more<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.200> you're<00:02:37.920> heating<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.090> just

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
more if you're heating it up so just

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.350 
more if you're heating it up so just
throw<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.620> then<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.850> have<00:02:42.000> some

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
throw that in there and then I have some

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.800 
throw that in there and then I have some
zest<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.990> lemon<00:02:43.020> but<00:02:43.650> I've<00:02:43.740> already<00:02:43.950> done

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
zest of a lemon but I've already done

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.150 
zest of a lemon but I've already done
throw<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.140> there<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.440> gives<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.950> it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
throw that in there it gives it that it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.100 
throw that in there it gives it that it
just<00:02:47.370> gives<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.670> really<00:02:47.940> crisp<00:02:48.390> citrusy

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
just gives it a really crisp citrusy

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.870 
just gives it a really crisp citrusy
flavor<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.680> goes<00:02:49.800> really<00:02:50.070> nicely<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.640> this

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
flavor that goes really nicely with this

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.870 
flavor that goes really nicely with this
salad<00:02:51.270> with<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> tomatoes<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.700> actually

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.760 
want some lemon juice as well so I'm
just<00:02:55.800> gonna<00:02:56.010> segment<00:02:56.610> my<00:02:56.730> lemon<00:02:57.350> if<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.530> cut

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770

it<00:02:58.860> like<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.190> where<00:02:59.460> you<00:02:59.580> alternate<00:03:00.150> sides

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
it like this where you alternate sides

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.470 
it like this where you alternate sides
you<00:03:01.470> actually<00:03:01.920> don't<00:03:02.280> get<00:03:02.460> all<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.700> seeds<00:03:03.000> so

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480

pasta<00:03:24.390> water<00:03:24.780> because<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.770> try<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> keep<00:03:26.370> my

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
pasta water because I try to keep my

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.610 
pasta water because I try to keep my
sodium<00:03:26.880> levels<00:03:27.180> down<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:28.050> find<00:03:28.260> if<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.440> use

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
sodium levels down and I find if you use

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.650 
sodium levels down and I find if you use
a<00:03:28.650> really<00:03:28.950> salty<00:03:29.310> salt<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.090> know<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.390> sounds

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
a really salty salt I know that sounds

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.199 
a really salty salt I know that sounds
funny<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:31.680> sea<00:03:31.890> salt<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.340> actually<00:03:32.459> saltier

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
funny but sea salt is actually saltier

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.180 
funny but sea salt is actually saltier
than<00:03:33.270> table<00:03:33.810> salt<00:03:33.989> because<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.980> bigger

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
than table salt because of the bigger

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.699 
than table salt because of the bigger
pieces<00:03:35.720> if<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:37.020> season<00:03:37.290> at<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.470> last

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
pieces if you just season at the last

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.699 
pieces if you just season at the last
minute<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:39.390> get<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.750> same<00:03:40.020> effect<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
minute you get the same effect of the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.830 
minute you get the same effect of the
salt<00:03:40.980> but<00:03:41.250> not<00:03:41.310> with<00:03:41.820> all<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.209> sodium<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.780> you

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
salt but not with all the sodium so you

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.870 
salt but not with all the sodium so you
kind<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.110> cheat<00:03:43.440> your<00:03:43.620> sodium<00:03:44.040> levels<00:03:44.340> which<00:03:44.550> I

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
kind of cheat your sodium levels which I

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.900 
kind of cheat your sodium levels which I
like<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:45.870> I'm<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> salt<00:03:46.410> bean<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.160> then

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
like because I'm a salt bean and then

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.449 
like because I'm a salt bean and then
finally<00:03:48.480> we're<00:03:48.660> just<00:03:48.840> gonna<00:03:48.959> add<00:03:49.050> some<00:03:49.770> shaved

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
finally we're just gonna add some shaved

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.470
