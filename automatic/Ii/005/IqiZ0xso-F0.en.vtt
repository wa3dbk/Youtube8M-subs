airplane the key and inside there was

basically the real bottleneck when

basically the real bottleneck when
boarding<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> plane<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.560> actually<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
boarding the plane was not actually the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.580 
boarding the plane was not actually the
speed<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:33.030> passengers<00:00:33.570> walked<00:00:33.809> rather

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.080

the<00:00:34.829> speed<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.219> could<00:00:35.370> manipulate<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the speed that they could manipulate and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.450 
the speed that they could manipulate and
walk<00:00:36.450> through<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.920> realized<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.010> in

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
walk through and I realized that in

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
walk through and I realized that in
order<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.879> model<00:00:39.239> accurately<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:40.350> needed<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
order to model accurately we needed a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.000 
order to model accurately we needed a
good<00:00:41.600> sense<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> different<00:00:43.770> delays

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
good sense of what the different delays

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.119 
good sense of what the different delays
on<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.480> different<00:00:45.899> delays<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.500> relative

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
on how the different delays are relative

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.119 
on how the different delays are relative
to<00:00:47.340> each<00:00:47.489> other<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.420> set<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.350> only<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.890> half

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to each other so we set up only one half

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.930 
to each other so we set up only one half
of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> plane<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.539> were<00:00:51.750> concerned

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
of the plane because we were concerned

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.959 
of the plane because we were concerned
with<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.300> taken<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> window

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
with the time taken to get to the window

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.729 
with the time taken to get to the window
or<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.539> store<00:00:57.750> baggage<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.620> weren't

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
or to store baggage and we weren't

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
or to store baggage and we weren't
really<00:00:58.890> concerned<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.489> what<00:01:00.030> was<00:01:00.180> happening

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
really concerned with what was happening

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.990 
really concerned with what was happening
and<00:01:00.629> happening<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> other<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.430> result

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and happening at the other so the result

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.359 
and happening at the other so the result
of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> result<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.920> physical

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
of the result of this this physical

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.240 
of the result of this this physical
simulation<00:01:08.850> gives<00:01:09.060> us<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.570> set<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.470> raw<00:01:10.860> numbers

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
simulation gives us a set of raw numbers

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820 
simulation gives us a set of raw numbers
so<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.420> example<00:01:12.780> we'll<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> number<00:01:13.680> about

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
so for example we'll have a number about

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.980 
so for example we'll have a number about
how<00:01:13.890> long<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> takes<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.760> pass<00:01:15.509> over<00:01:15.720> another

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
how long it takes to pass over another

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.600 
how long it takes to pass over another
passenger<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:16.920> long<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> takes<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> store

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
passenger how long it takes the store

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.460 
passenger how long it takes the store
baggage<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.420> how<00:01:18.509> long<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.840> takes<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> pass

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
baggage and how long it takes to pass

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.850 
baggage and how long it takes to pass
through<00:01:20.070> an<00:01:20.159> aisle<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> input<00:01:22.650> into

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
through an aisle and this is input into

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.609 
through an aisle and this is input into
a<00:01:22.890> computer<00:01:23.189> model<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.840> based<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> these

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
a computer model and based on the these

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.170 
a computer model and based on the these
parameters<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> computer<00:01:26.610> model<00:01:26.850> gives<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
parameters the computer model gives you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.600 
parameters the computer model gives you
a<00:01:27.210> simulation<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.290> tells<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.950> long<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
a simulation it tells you how long the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
a simulation it tells you how long the
entire<00:01:29.729> plane<00:01:30.270> would<00:01:30.420> take<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> board<00:01:30.840> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
entire plane would take the board so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.130 
entire plane would take the board so
what<00:01:31.710> happens<00:01:32.070> was<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.850> simulate

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
what happens was that you would simulate

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.109 
what happens was that you would simulate
a<00:01:34.140> preference<00:01:34.829> model<00:01:35.189> several<00:01:35.909> several

a preference model several several
several<00:01:36.570> times<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.340> hundreds<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.030> times<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
several times so hundreds of times and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.660 
several times so hundreds of times and
then<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.560> simulate<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.040> other<00:01:41.220> models

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
then we will simulate the other models

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.399 
then we will simulate the other models
several<00:01:42.180> hundreds<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.509> times<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.380> were

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
several hundreds of times and they were

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.219 
several hundreds of times and they were
companions<00:01:44.570> after<00:01:45.570> determining<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
companions after determining the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.530 
companions after determining the
relative<00:01:46.740> efficiency<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.549> existing<00:01:47.729> boarding

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

the<00:02:07.099> passengers<00:02:08.099> board<00:02:08.340> window<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.970> middle

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the passengers board window the middle

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.210 
the passengers board window the middle
of<00:02:09.300> an<00:02:09.390> aisle<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.110> families<00:02:10.500> are<00:02:10.619> split<00:02:10.860> up<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
of an aisle so families are split up so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.260 
of an aisle so families are split up so
a<00:02:11.700> combination<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> two<00:02:12.599> actually<00:02:12.900> was

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
a combination of the two actually was

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.540 
a combination of the two actually was
in<00:02:13.420> an<00:02:13.510> algorithm<00:02:13.990> where<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.950> could<00:02:15.310> board

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
in an algorithm where you could board

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.950 
in an algorithm where you could board
from<00:02:15.730> window<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.060> aisle<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.540> still<00:02:16.750> be<00:02:16.870> very

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
from window to aisle and still be very

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.690 
from window to aisle and still be very
efficient<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:17.860> families<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.460> go<00:02:18.580> together

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
efficient but families can go together

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.610 
efficient but families can go together
and<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.690> isn't<00:02:19.840> really<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.230> very<00:02:20.380> good

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and this isn't really a very good

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.100 
and this isn't really a very good
solution<00:02:21.010> because<00:02:21.430> it's<00:02:21.700> practical<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.330> fast

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
solution because it's practical and fast

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.890 
solution because it's practical and fast
we<00:02:23.950> approach<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.550> problem<00:02:24.940> together<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.870> a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
we approach the problem together like a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.780 
we approach the problem together like a
lot<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.230> teams<00:02:26.470> went<00:02:26.740> out<00:02:26.980> what<00:02:27.430> they<00:02:27.550> end<00:02:27.700> up

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
lot of teams went out what they end up

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.120 
lot of teams went out what they end up
doing<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.270> each<00:02:28.660> individual<00:02:29.290> works<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.070> a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
doing is each individual works of a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.040 
doing is each individual works of a
separate<00:02:30.490> model<00:02:30.760> by<00:02:30.880> themselves<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:31.960> were

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
separate model by themselves but we were

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.780 
separate model by themselves but we were
looking<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.380> make<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.650> more<00:02:32.920> cohesive<00:02:33.280> model

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
looking to make a more cohesive model

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.700 
looking to make a more cohesive model
then<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.180> know<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.540> included<00:02:35.140> all<00:02:35.350> our

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
then you know that included all our

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.450 
then you know that included all our
different<00:02:36.100> views<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:38.200> mathematical<00:02:39.070> modeling

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
different views of mathematical modeling

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.400 
different views of mathematical modeling
this<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:39.970> great<00:02:40.150> I'm<00:02:40.540> ganna<00:02:40.810> dry<00:02:40.960> working<00:02:41.290> with

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
this is great I'm ganna dry working with

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.140 
this is great I'm ganna dry working with
these<00:02:41.500> people<00:02:41.710> in<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.430> friends<00:02:42.790> outside<00:02:42.970> of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
these people in my friends outside of

these people in my friends outside of
class<00:02:43.390> we<00:02:43.540> hang<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:43.780> all<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.960> time<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.380> it

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
class we hang out all the time and it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.440 
class we hang out all the time and it
also<00:02:44.980> takes<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.370> tragic<00:02:45.670> turn<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.940> level<00:02:46.210> it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
also takes a tragic turn on level it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.150 
also takes a tragic turn on level it
allows<00:02:46.780> us<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.380> come<00:02:47.860> out<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
allows us to come out on the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.860 
allows us to come out on the
intellectual<00:02:48.700> level<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.210> in<00:02:49.660> very

experiential level on working on

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.310 
experiential level on working on
something<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:52.030> we<00:02:52.120> feel<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.660> joint
