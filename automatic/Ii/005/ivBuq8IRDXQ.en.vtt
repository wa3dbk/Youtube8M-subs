really transported back in time to when
the<00:00:06.870> last<00:00:07.080> time<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.319> you're<00:00:07.589> running<00:00:07.890> like<00:00:08.670> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
the last time that you're running like a

a child run barefoot we flying across
the<00:00:13.740> grass<00:00:14.009> usually<00:00:14.700> with<00:00:14.820> somebody<00:00:15.210> behind

them put on your shoes the last time
that<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.900> ever<00:00:19.050> run<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.470> way<00:00:19.590> when<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.520> go

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that they ever run that way when we go

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.730 
that they ever run that way when we go
fully<00:00:20.970> barefoot<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.570> feel<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.410> child

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
fully barefoot we feel like that child

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.599 
fully barefoot we feel like that child
again<00:00:23.359> something<00:00:24.359> else<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.410> -<00:00:25.619> it's

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
again something else is going on - it's

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.339 
again something else is going on - it's
almost<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.150> we're<00:00:27.480> draining<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> way<00:00:28.199> in

something<00:00:31.160> chemically<00:00:32.160> feels<00:00:32.730> different<00:00:33.239> now

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
something chemically feels different now

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.360 
something chemically feels different now
there's<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> universal<00:00:34.739> feeling<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> end

there's a universal feeling at the end

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.340 
there's a universal feeling at the end
of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> day<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.270> wanting<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.719> walk<00:00:36.989> barefoot

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
of the day of wanting to walk barefoot

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.740 
of the day of wanting to walk barefoot
through<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> grass<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.540> get<00:00:39.629> our

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
through the grass or go out and get our

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.990 
through the grass or go out and get our
feet<00:00:39.960> wet<00:00:40.020> wet<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.129> walk<00:00:41.399> barefoot<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.969> the

sand right at the water's edge and that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.729 
sand right at the water's edge and that
has<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.149> what's<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.440> on

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
has to do with what's going on

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
has to do with what's going on
electrically<00:00:47.309> between<00:00:47.789> our<00:00:47.940> bodies<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
ground you see we don't really think

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
ground you see we don't really think
about<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.910> much<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.840> planet<00:00:52.320> is

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
about it much but the planet is

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.850 
about it much but the planet is
basically<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.430> giant<00:00:53.820> car<00:00:54.090> batter<00:00:54.379> when<00:00:55.379> five

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
basically a giant car batter when five

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.970 
grab onto and destroy and it's a good
thing<00:03:25.690> that's<00:03:25.810> how<00:03:25.989> our<00:03:26.140> immune<00:03:26.320> system<00:03:26.800> works

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
thing that's how our immune system works

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.010 
thing that's how our immune system works
but<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.090> our<00:03:28.180> immune<00:03:28.450> systems<00:03:28.900> just

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
but I like it our immune systems just

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.570 
but I like it our immune systems just
filling<00:03:29.320> up<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.470> bathtub<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:30.010> go<00:03:30.100> take<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> bath

and<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:30.970> clean<00:03:31.360> off<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.720> dirt<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:32.680> turn<00:03:32.920> on

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
and and clean off the dirt you turn on

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.790 
and and clean off the dirt you turn on
the<00:03:33.250> water<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.760> bathtub<00:03:34.050> close<00:03:35.050> it<00:03:35.290> start

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
the water in the bathtub close it start

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.940 
filling up the tub to clean off the dirt
that's<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.450> good<00:03:37.570> thing<00:03:37.810> but<00:03:38.470> if<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.650> then

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
that's a good thing but if you then

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.280 
that's a good thing but if you then
forget<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.489> shut<00:03:39.730> off<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.880> tub<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.840> forget<00:03:41.170> to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
forget to shut off the tub and forget to

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.940 
forget to shut off the tub and forget to
train<00:03:41.590> it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
train it

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
floors can fall through and you can

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.190 
floors can fall through and you can
create<00:03:51.430> walk<00:03:51.760> throughout<00:03:52.030> your<00:03:52.180> house<00:03:52.360> well

them out through the floor then we have

them out through the floor then we have

a problem too and the great thing is

a problem too and the great thing is

staring on the ground barefoot we drain

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.059 
staring on the ground barefoot we drain
that<00:04:12.060> charge<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:13.350> is<00:04:13.650> one<00:04:13.890> of<00:04:13.920> the

that charge and that is one of the

that charge and that is one of the

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
reasons it feels so good and it feels

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.250 
reasons it feels so good and it feels

like that all the pressure and stress
and<00:04:22.710> everything<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.520> just<00:04:23.580> draining<00:04:24.000> away

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
and everything is just draining away

he's<00:04:25.139> literally<00:04:25.850> stuff<00:04:26.930> draining<00:04:27.930> away<00:04:28.350> we

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
he's literally stuff draining away we

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.280 
he's literally stuff draining away we

just got so disconnected from

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
going on here with ovens hocus-pocus

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.520 
going on here with ovens hocus-pocus
stuff<00:04:38.190> no<00:04:39.030> it's<00:04:39.240> actually<00:04:39.389> draining<00:04:39.870> away<00:04:40.050> you

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
stuff no it's actually draining away you

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.170 
stuff no it's actually draining away you
reduce<00:04:40.860> your<00:04:41.040> cortisol<00:04:41.580> levels<00:04:41.639> there

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
reduce your cortisol levels there

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.670 
reduce your cortisol levels there
studies<00:04:42.480> have<00:04:42.600> shown<00:04:42.780> reduce<00:04:43.140> cortisol

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
studies have shown reduce cortisol

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.420 
studies have shown reduce cortisol
levels<00:04:44.010> reduce<00:04:44.669> blood<00:04:45.030> pressure<00:04:46.430> reduced

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
levels reduce blood pressure reduced

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.250 
levels reduce blood pressure reduced
thinning<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.510> blood<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.020> less

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
thinning of the blood so less

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.740 
thinning of the blood so less
cardiovascular<00:04:50.220> problems<00:04:50.640> better<00:04:51.360> breathing

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
cardiovascular problems better breathing

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.590 
cardiovascular problems better breathing
reduce<00:04:52.620> tension<00:04:53.190> better<00:04:53.669> sleeping<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.480> so

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
reduce tension better sleeping and so

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600 
reduce tension better sleeping and so
much<00:04:54.780> more<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.919> way<00:04:56.100> that<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.340> earth

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
much more and the the way that the earth

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.450 
much more and the the way that the earth
works<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.960> vibrates<00:04:58.470> more<00:04:58.710> on<00:04:58.890> one<00:04:59.100> side<00:04:59.340> at

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
works is it vibrates more on one side at

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.190 
works is it vibrates more on one side at
one<00:04:59.610> point<00:04:59.790> if<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.240> think<00:05:00.450> of<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:00.660> as<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.870> giant

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
one point if you think of it as a giant

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.110 
one point if you think of it as a giant
vibrating<00:05:01.890> electrical<00:05:02.370> signal<00:05:02.729> it's

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
side and that's constantly changing and

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.260 
side and that's constantly changing and
what<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:10.830> is<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.040> rhythm<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.610> 24-hour

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
what that is is a rhythm a 24-hour

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.900 
what that is is a rhythm a 24-hour
rhythm<00:05:12.780> or<00:05:13.200> pattern<00:05:13.590> of<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.919> planet<00:05:14.280> just<00:05:14.790> as

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
rhythm or pattern of the planet just as

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.790 
rhythm or pattern of the planet just as
we<00:05:15.060> have<00:05:15.240> our<00:05:15.270> circadian<00:05:15.720> rhythm<00:05:16.200> that's<00:05:16.590> the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
we have our circadian rhythm that's the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.830 
we have our circadian rhythm that's the
rhythm<00:05:16.950> of<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.370> planet<00:05:17.760> as<00:05:17.910> well<00:05:18.150> so<00:05:18.630> for

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
rhythm of the planet as well so for

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.960 
rhythm of the planet as well so for
instance<00:05:19.229> if<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.470> get<00:05:19.590> jet<00:05:19.830> lag<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.700> get<00:05:20.820> off

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
instance if you get jet lag you get off

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.280 
instance if you get jet lag you get off
of<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.180> plane<00:05:21.300> someplace<00:05:21.840> you're<00:05:22.020> feeling

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
of the plane someplace you're feeling

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.770 
of the plane someplace you're feeling
jet<00:05:22.440> lag<00:05:22.620> go<00:05:23.160> barefoot<00:05:23.580> sit<00:05:23.910> on<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.120> ground<00:05:24.300> or

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
jet lag go barefoot sit on the ground or

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.450 
jet lag go barefoot sit on the ground or
go<00:05:24.930> barefoot<00:05:25.350> for<00:05:25.530> about<00:05:25.680> 15<00:05:26.070> to<00:05:26.190> 20<00:05:26.430> minutes

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
go barefoot for about 15 to 20 minutes

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.150 
go barefoot for about 15 to 20 minutes
and<00:05:26.910> suddenly<00:05:27.780> you<00:05:28.020> feel<00:05:28.260> so<00:05:28.710> much<00:05:28.860> better

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
and suddenly you feel so much better

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.640 
and suddenly you feel so much better
because<00:05:29.700> now<00:05:30.030> you're<00:05:30.539> back<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.750> vibrating<00:05:31.470> at

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
because now you're back to vibrating at

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.020 
because now you're back to vibrating at
the<00:05:31.740> frequency<00:05:32.220> of<00:05:32.370> what's<00:05:32.610> beneath<00:05:32.880> you

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
the frequency of what's beneath you

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.870 
the frequency of what's beneath you
rather<00:05:33.570> than<00:05:33.780> some<00:05:34.020> place<00:05:34.200> 5<00:05:34.560> 6<00:05:34.890> 8<00:05:35.100> 12<00:05:35.400> hours

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
rather than some place 5 6 8 12 hours

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.290 
rather than some place 5 6 8 12 hours
away<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.570> if<00:05:37.380> you<00:05:37.590> do<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:38.070> once<00:05:38.760> or<00:05:39.060> twice<00:05:39.240> a

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
away and if you do that once or twice a

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.200 
away and if you do that once or twice a
day<00:05:39.630> people<00:05:40.200> who<00:05:40.440> have<00:05:40.530> trouble<00:05:40.770> sleeping

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
day people who have trouble sleeping

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.020 
day people who have trouble sleeping
sleep<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:42.840> much<00:05:43.410> better<00:05:44.100> when<00:05:44.669> they're<00:05:44.850> not

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
sleep so much better when they're not

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.969 
sleep so much better when they're not
insulated<00:05:45.690> because<00:05:46.110> during<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:46.560> day<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.740> get

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
insulated because during the day you get

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.230 
insulated because during the day you get
wound<00:05:47.250> up<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:47.610> wound<00:05:47.820> up

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
wound up and wound up

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.730 
wound up and wound up
that<00:05:48.449> we<00:05:48.569> know<00:05:48.690> that<00:05:48.840> turn<00:05:49.020> well<00:05:49.530> that's

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
that we know that turn well that's

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.439 
that we know that turn well that's
actually<00:05:49.949> us<00:05:50.400> vibrating<00:05:50.910> faster<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.330> faster

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
actually us vibrating faster and faster

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.330 
actually us vibrating faster and faster
and<00:05:51.720> faster<00:05:51.780> we're<00:05:52.650> carrying<00:05:52.889> this<00:05:53.069> charge

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
and faster we're carrying this charge

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.740 
and faster we're carrying this charge
we're<00:05:53.550> vibrating<00:05:53.970> faster<00:05:54.120> as<00:05:54.419> soon<00:05:54.569> as<00:05:54.660> we

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
we're vibrating faster as soon as we

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.230 
we're vibrating faster as soon as we
sink<00:05:55.050> we<00:05:55.410> dream<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.069> charge<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.910> we<00:05:57.000> go<00:05:57.120> back

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
sink we dream that charge and we go back

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.700 
sink we dream that charge and we go back
to<00:05:57.449> vibrating<00:05:57.930> at<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.110> frequency<00:05:58.560> of<00:05:58.620> the

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
to vibrating at the frequency of the

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.620 
to vibrating at the frequency of the
earth<00:05:58.770> it's<00:05:59.610> as<00:05:59.789> if<00:05:59.940> we're<00:06:00.090> plugged<00:06:00.330> into<00:06:00.509> a

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
earth it's as if we're plugged into a

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.059 
earth it's as if we're plugged into a
program<00:06:01.020> that's<00:06:01.199> telling<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.530> okay

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
program that's telling you okay

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.100 
program that's telling you okay
now<00:06:02.460> that's<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.699> time<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:02.970> sleeves<00:06:03.210> and

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
now that's the time the sleeves and

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.140 
now that's the time the sleeves and

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
later at the time to wake so with that

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.360 
later at the time to wake so with that
said<00:06:06.389> want<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.780> jump<00:06:07.020> into<00:06:07.349> recovery<00:06:08.099> right

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370
