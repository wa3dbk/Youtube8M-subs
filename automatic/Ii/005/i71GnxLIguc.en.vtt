00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.000 
I don't think it's one guy otherwise
they<00:02:02.050> would<00:02:02.170> have<00:02:02.200> been<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.409> very<00:02:02.710> different

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
they would have been a very different

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.080 
they would have been a very different
something<00:02:03.130> called<00:02:03.400> last<00:02:03.610> year<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:03.940> they<00:02:04.030> were

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
something called last year and they were

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.780 
something called last year and they were
not

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
not

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.440 
not
but<00:02:05.940> I<00:02:06.120> just<00:02:06.540> think<00:02:06.890> they've<00:02:07.890> all<00:02:08.130> bought<00:02:08.399> into

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
but I just think they've all bought into

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
but I just think they've all bought into
you<00:02:09.450> know<00:02:09.540> listen<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.020> want<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.290> win<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.740> have

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you know listen you want to win you have

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.040 
you know listen you want to win you have
to<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.730> both<00:02:11.910> ends<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.600> think<00:02:12.840> that's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
to do it on both ends and I think that's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.930 
to do it on both ends and I think that's
where<00:02:13.230> woody<00:02:13.470> has<00:02:13.680> got<00:02:13.950> an<00:02:14.220> understanding

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
where woody has got an understanding

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.450 
where woody has got an understanding
