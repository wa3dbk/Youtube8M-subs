we<00:00:21.810> will<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:22.200> using<00:00:22.470> two<00:00:23.009> 100<00:00:23.730> watt<00:00:23.880> panels

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
we will be using two 100 watt panels

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.689 
we will be using two 100 watt panels
we're<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.770> to<00:00:25.829> begin<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> parallel

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
we're going to begin with a parallel

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.060 
we're going to begin with a parallel
connection<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:28.110> wire<00:00:28.290> our<00:00:28.439> panels<00:00:28.950> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
begin our parallel connection we're

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.209 
begin our parallel connection we're
going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> grab<00:00:39.539> both<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.809> our<00:00:40.170> positive<00:00:40.770> leads

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
going to grab both of our positive leads

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.790 
going to grab both of our positive leads
which<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.640> readily<00:00:42.079> identified<00:00:43.079> by<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
which are readily identified by the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.380 
which are readily identified by the
indicator<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:45.539> grab<00:00:45.749> our<00:00:45.929> nc4<00:00:46.440> connector<00:00:47.390> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
indicator we grab our nc4 connector and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.559 
indicator we grab our nc4 connector and
we<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.749> plug<00:00:48.929> it<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:56.030> next<00:00:57.030> we're

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
we just plug it in like this next we're

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.969 
we just plug it in like this next we're
going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.749> grab<00:00:57.839> both<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.229> our<00:00:58.350> negative<00:00:58.739> leads

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:14.180 

we<00:01:01.979> plug<00:01:02.190> them<00:01:02.309> into<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> other<00:01:02.729> adapter<00:01:13.190> now

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
we plug them into the other adapter now

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.900 
we plug them into the other adapter now
we<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:15.260> positive<00:01:16.260> lead<00:01:16.800> and<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.550> negative

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
we have a positive lead and a negative

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.870 
we have a positive lead and a negative
lead<00:01:18.120> and<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:19.230> next<00:01:19.500> step<00:01:19.710> would<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> plug

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
lead and the next step would be to plug

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.010 
lead and the next step would be to plug
these<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:22.410> our<00:01:22.770> adapter<00:01:23.490> kit<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.780> we

into<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.879> series<00:02:39.360> series<00:02:40.290> connection<00:02:41.190> we'll

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
into a series series connection we'll

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.150 
into a series series connection we'll
utilize<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.970> 24<00:02:42.629> volt<00:02:42.660> system<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.830> first<00:02:44.010> thing

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
utilize a 24 volt system the first thing

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.320 
utilize a 24 volt system the first thing
we're<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.489> do<00:02:44.580> for<00:02:44.849> our<00:02:44.879> serious

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
we're going to do for our serious

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.750 
we're going to do for our serious
connection<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.989> we're<00:02:46.830> going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.310> take<00:02:47.459> our

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
connection is we're going to take our

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.240 
connection is we're going to take our
negative<00:02:47.970> lead<00:02:48.379> from<00:02:49.379> one<00:02:49.590> panel<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.129> our

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
negative lead from one panel and our

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.880 
negative lead from one panel and our
positively<00:02:50.849> from<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.480> other<00:02:51.569> panel<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.860> order

to<00:02:53.129> connect<00:02:53.370> them<00:02:53.549> together<00:02:54.920> like<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:58.430> now

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
to connect them together like so now

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.259 
to connect them together like so now
over<00:02:59.819> left<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:01.010> positive<00:03:02.010> lead<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:03.090> we're

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
over left with a positive lead and we're

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.400 
over left with a positive lead and we're
left<00:03:03.450> with<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.780> negative<00:03:03.959> lead<00:03:06.230> we're<00:03:07.230> going<00:03:07.349> to

left with a negative lead we're going to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.030 
left with a negative lead we're going to
take<00:03:07.590> our<00:03:07.769> adaptor<00:03:08.190> kit<00:03:09.620> attach<00:03:10.620> our<00:03:10.829> positive

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
take our adaptor kit attach our positive

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.150 
take our adaptor kit attach our positive
lead<00:03:13.040> like<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:15.530> we're<00:03:16.530> going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.709> put<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
lead like so we're going to put the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.089 
lead like so we're going to put the
adapter<00:03:17.370> kit<00:03:17.760> on<00:03:18.000> our<00:03:18.120> negative<00:03:18.480> lead<00:03:19.430> like<00:03:20.430> so

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
adapter kit on our negative lead like so

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.630 
adapter kit on our negative lead like so
now<00:03:23.150> we<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.239> ready<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.690> plug<00:03:24.930> our<00:03:25.230> leads<00:03:26.220> into

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
now we are ready to plug our leads into

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.400 
now we are ready to plug our leads into
our<00:03:27.420> charge<00:03:27.690> controller

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
our charge controller

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.910 
our charge controller
we've<00:03:29.370> now<00:03:29.579> just<00:03:29.609> converted<00:03:30.239> our<00:03:30.920> 12-volt

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
we've now just converted our 12-volt

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.530 
we've now just converted our 12-volt
system<00:03:32.069> into<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> 24<00:03:33.569> volt<00:03:33.600> system<00:03:35.510> now<00:03:36.510> that

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
system into a 24 volt system now that

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.920 
system into a 24 volt system now that
we've<00:03:36.870> connected<00:03:37.139> our<00:03:37.440> panels<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.519> series<00:03:38.930> and

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
we've connected our panels in series and
