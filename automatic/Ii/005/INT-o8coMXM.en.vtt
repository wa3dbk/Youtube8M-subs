case<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.920> perfect<00:02:12.550> solution<00:02:12.850> because

case this is a perfect solution because
her<00:02:14.200> weight<00:02:14.500> could<00:02:14.950> fluctuate<00:02:15.220> thirty<00:02:15.910> to

her weight could fluctuate thirty to

her weight could fluctuate thirty to
forty<00:02:16.390> pounds<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.380> few<00:02:17.410> minutes<00:02:17.980> when<00:02:18.190> she

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
forty pounds in a few minutes when she

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.090 
forty pounds in a few minutes when she

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
puts on her her gear and the Thrive foot

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.130 
puts on her her gear and the Thrive foot
can<00:02:21.760> handle<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.330> weight<00:02:22.630> change

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
can handle that weight change

can handle that weight change
prior<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:24.010> had<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> renegade<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.030> I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
prior to this I had the renegade and I

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.000 
prior to this I had the renegade and I
have<00:02:25.690> my<00:02:25.840> renegade<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.560> wear<00:02:26.770> every<00:02:26.980> day

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010

have my renegade that I wear every day
which<00:02:27.400> i<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.000> too<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.950> one<00:02:30.190> that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
which i think is it too and the one that

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.640 
which i think is it too and the one that
was<00:02:30.820> given<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.270> me<00:02:31.390> for<00:02:31.630> work<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:32.050> was<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> five

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
was given to me for work it was a five

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.340 
was given to me for work it was a five
and<00:02:32.950> stiffness<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:34.270> when<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.570> wasn't<00:02:35.080> wearing<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
and stiffness so when I wasn't wearing a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.040 
and stiffness so when I wasn't wearing a
load<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.010> wearing<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.400> stiff<00:02:37.090> foot<00:02:37.510> that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
load and wearing that stiff foot that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.280 
load and wearing that stiff foot that
became<00:02:38.350> hard<00:02:38.590> easier<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:40.330> felt<00:02:40.930> sore

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
became hard easier and I felt sore

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.220 
became hard easier and I felt sore
throughout<00:02:41.950> my<00:02:42.130> stump<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:43.330> once<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.720> was<00:02:43.900> given

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
throughout my stump so once I was given

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.260 
throughout my stump so once I was given
the<00:02:44.320> Thrive<00:02:44.650> for<00:02:45.220> work<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.730> made<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:45.970> big

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
the Thrive for work it made a big

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.420 
the Thrive for work it made a big
difference<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.870> pick<00:02:47.170> up<00:02:47.320> gear<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.130> do

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
difference I pick up gear I do

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.610 
difference I pick up gear I do
everything<00:02:48.940> without<00:02:49.030> having<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.870> change<00:02:50.140> my

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
everything without having to change my

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.920 
everything without having to change my
socket

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
socket

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.170 
socket
I<00:02:51.989> think<00:02:52.890> once<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.430> set<00:02:53.640> your<00:02:53.670> mind<00:02:54.030> to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
I think once you set your mind to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.030 
I think once you set your mind to
something<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.409> can't<00:02:55.890> give

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
something and you really you can't give

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.270 
something and you really you can't give
up<00:02:56.159> if<00:02:56.549> there's<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> will<00:02:57.359> there's<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.900> way<00:02:58.280> with

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
up if there's a will there's a way with

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.979 
up if there's a will there's a way with
the<00:02:59.400> right<00:02:59.609> leg<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.480> right<00:03:00.510> socket

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
the right leg and a right socket

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.899 
the right leg and a right socket
definitely<00:03:01.709> make<00:03:01.859> all<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.250> difference<00:03:02.609> in

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
definitely make all the difference in

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.689 
definitely make all the difference in
the<00:03:03.540> world
