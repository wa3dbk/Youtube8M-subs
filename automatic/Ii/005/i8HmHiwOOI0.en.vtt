00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.500
 Now I know that the gods of Olympus 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.540
 are real 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.240
 and sometimes they have children with humans 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.830
 called demigods we are practically 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.570
 equal to others 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.550
 but some slight differences 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.800
 remarkable 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.510
 and we ask in the only safe place to 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.130
 our species 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:32.380
 until now 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:35.620
 what is that come in see the oracle chases 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.370
 kronos a god so evil that three of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.310
 his children 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.800
 zeus hades and poseidÃ³n destroyed it 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.840
 is predestined to resurface for 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.520
 revenge on the doll 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.880
 the only thing that can save our home 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.830
 of destruction is the golden fleece 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.330
 of the monsters to which humans 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.670
 they call Bermuda triangle 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.280
 our mission requires the hero more 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.950
 excellent to the best of all 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 the daughter of the god of war floris no 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.540
 worry about being always in seconds 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.630
 everything they say about you is a lie 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.370
 you have a lot of sense of humor is a 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.170
 bad idea if you do not know what I was going to say 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.550
 that you are going to look for the vellocino in 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.550
 I was going to say come on 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.820
 it looks like a new york taxi the same 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 part 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.350
 hallucinatory 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.280
 we will raise kronos and he invoked 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.840
 meet death we need help and 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.220
 we do not have much time to remove the plug 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.920
 and release 'aces' the winds of the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.560
 four best in the world 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.820
 and here not 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.820
 we will find the vellocino 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.580
 the sun has to open 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.130
 that are not sharks is not a mon type
