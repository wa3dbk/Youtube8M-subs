 specialized in ceremonial costumes that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.810
 It will help us dress choice 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.540
 bride for the wedding of living tells us 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.940
 mark that they propose to Sara as she has 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.820
 very very Latin very Spanish factions 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.820
 I would offer you this model that is 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.640
 inspired by a line 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.030
 I think it's a youth model 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.950
 very spanish with ruffles down and good 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.930
 adorned with this headdress that are 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.670
 combs I think it can be very pretty 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.100
 we will also offer other models 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.450
 but in principle I think that with this one 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.479
 You can feel life as very 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.680
 identified and a little flamenco not if 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 with a little flamenco 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.720
 what advice does this recommend to the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 time for the bride to arrive at your atelier and 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.729
 some do not know as to orient 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.800
 what is the one that is the most 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.479
 successful in terms of color in terms of 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.100
 woven in terms of how it has 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.810
 much to see the characteristics of the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.880
 wedding follow something religious or is a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.400
 civil wedding if it is morning or afternoon 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.680
 the aspect is also important 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.440
 binding of the person and search 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.150
 always provided that the bride does not 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.690
 feel disguised and identify 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.690
 with the suit 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.680
 we have the second proposal of dress 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.330
 Bridal marga tell us a bit about 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.160
 lines of this dress and style and 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.890
 she told me that it is possible that the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.670
 wedding to take place in December 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.530
 then we have put a model more 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 classic with sleeves in the silk mikado 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.940
 It has a lot of tail, it has a lot of poise but 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.770
 it's too classic for her if 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.260
 we are looking for the bride to 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.670
 identify with the suit you must wear 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.020
 although brides are very pretty 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.510
 always with everything you have to look for what 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.640
 that are excellent although the veil 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.650
 it also gives a touch even more 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.350
 classic but not super successful for this 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.780
 design yes yes it's an embroidered veil is very 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.980
 rich in embroidery because the model as it is 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.620
 classic 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.030
 it suits us, it's convenient for us to recreate a 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.030
 little in the complement 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.680
 is now he has told me that with this model 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.870
 it is with the one that most identified feels 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.060
 I agree with her she is very 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.450
 young then it is just a line 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.069
 youth 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.080
 we worry a bit if the wedding is 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.950
 It celebrates in winter and it's cold but 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.870
 Well, we will look for a solution 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.989
 we will cover with the hose with a 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.180
 complement but of course is which 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.190
 this line with which she to meet 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.530
 prettier and what we have to do and 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.530
 pretend that the bride is grounded 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.860
 we are in the creative area of the atelier 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.450
 from marga sÃ¡nchez marga tell us which one is 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.250
 the procedure since the client 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.350
 ask for the appointment until the final preparation 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.970

 I 've already chosen it in the first test 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.410
 we make an exclusive pattern 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.920
 for each client like this that I am 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.959
 showing 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.290
 and then with that pattern is made what 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.060

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.650

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.049
 corrections made in it in the 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.380
 which are passed to the employer and with that with 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.630
 that pattern is cut the dress is tested 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.180
 Semi-sewn and adjusts until 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.450
 is perfect is the procedure of the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.450
 high fashion
