talking about display technology the two
are<00:00:42.480> vastly<00:00:42.840> different<00:00:42.960> things<00:00:43.500> now<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.640> you

are vastly different things now if you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
are vastly different things now if you
know<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.210> difference<00:00:45.510> between<00:00:45.539> LCD<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.440> LED

you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.879> LED<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.570> LED<00:00:48.930> TV<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.530> really

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you know the LED and LED TV is really

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.529 
you know the LED and LED TV is really
just<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> reference<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> T's<00:00:50.820> backlighting

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.750 
just a reference to the T's backlighting
technology<00:00:51.739> but<00:00:52.739> these<00:00:52.860> types<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> TVs<00:00:53.550> are

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
technology but these types of TVs are

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.080 
technology but these types of TVs are
really<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.120> LED<00:00:54.690> backlit<00:00:55.199> LCD<00:00:55.410> displays<00:00:56.190> now

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
really just LED backlit LCD displays now

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
really just LED backlit LCD displays now
LED<00:00:57.719> displays<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.320> completely<00:00:58.829> different

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
LED displays are completely different

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
LED displays are completely different
but<00:00:59.460> I've<00:00:59.820> been<00:00:59.969> relying<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.510> LCD<00:01:00.660> filter

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
but I've been relying on an LCD filter

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.260 
but I've been relying on an LCD filter
to<00:01:01.500> turn<00:01:01.739> an<00:01:01.859> individual<00:01:02.430> sub<00:01:02.609> pixel<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.120> or

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
to turn an individual sub pixel on or

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.230 
to turn an individual sub pixel on or
off<00:01:03.439> LED<00:01:04.439> pixels<00:01:04.830> are<00:01:04.920> independently<00:01:05.580> lit<00:01:05.850> so

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
off LED pixels are independently lit so

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.640 
off LED pixels are independently lit so
they<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:06.570> require<00:01:06.780> backlighting<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
they don't require backlighting and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.940 
they don't require backlighting and

LED<00:04:05.760> displays<00:04:06.120> are<00:04:06.299> definitely<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> superior

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
LED displays are definitely the superior

the<00:04:12.299> only<00:04:12.630> problem<00:04:12.989> is<00:04:13.109> they're

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
the only problem is they're

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.349 
the only problem is they're
prohibitively<00:04:14.040> expensive<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.850> at<00:04:15.209> this

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
prohibitively expensive and at this

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.999 
prohibitively expensive and at this
point<00:04:15.630> I'm<00:04:15.780> not<00:04:15.810> sure<00:04:16.079> how<00:04:16.259> long<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.650> pixels

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.090 
to degrade and lose brightness for this
reason<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.959> recommend<00:04:22.109> holding<00:04:22.620> off<00:04:22.890> and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
reason I recommend holding off and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.680 
reason I recommend holding off and
waiting<00:04:23.370> for<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.580> technology<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.150> mature
