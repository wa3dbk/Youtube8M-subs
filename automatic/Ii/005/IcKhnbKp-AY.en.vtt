00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
relationship but it made me feel so much

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.710 
relationship but it made me feel so much
worse<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.450> about<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
worse all I did was think about the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.469 
worse all I did was think about the
relationship<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> fact<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> failed

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
relationship and the fact that it failed

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.880 
relationship and the fact that it failed
24-7<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.570> was<00:01:51.659> always<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.200> my<00:01:52.350> mind<00:01:52.380> because

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
24-7 it was always on my mind because

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.800 
24-7 it was always on my mind because
like<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.310> said<00:01:53.369> when<00:01:53.729> something<00:01:54.119> goes<00:01:54.270> wrong<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
like I said when something goes wrong I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.209 
like I said when something goes wrong I
want<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> fix<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.680> because<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.070> thought

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
want to fix it and because I thought

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.800 
want to fix it and because I thought
this<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:56.729> fault<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.180> was<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.450> over

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
this was my fault I was just over

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.389 
this was my fault I was just over
analyzing<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.500> situation<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.250> was

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
analyzing the situation and I was

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.830 
analyzing the situation and I was
getting<00:01:59.670> nowhere<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.509> gonna<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.719> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
getting nowhere and if I'm gonna be a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.060 
getting nowhere and if I'm gonna be a
little<00:02:01.020> bit<00:02:01.170> honest<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.950> way

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
little bit honest because of the way

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.350 
little bit honest because of the way
that<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.280> dealt<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.790> whole<00:02:02.969> thing<00:02:03.000> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that I dealt with this whole thing I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.120 
that I dealt with this whole thing I
don't<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:04.049> ever<00:02:04.259> properly<00:02:04.680> got

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
don't think I really ever properly got

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.469 
don't think I really ever properly got
over<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.549> breakup<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
over this breakup and I think I

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.150 
over this breakup and I think I
manifests<00:02:06.990> itself<00:02:07.079> every<00:02:07.530> time<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> come<00:02:07.979> close

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
manifests itself every time I come close

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.710 
manifests itself every time I come close
to<00:02:08.459> having<00:02:08.610> romantic<00:02:09.000> feelings<00:02:09.539> about

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
to having romantic feelings about

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.150 
to having romantic feelings about
somebody<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.349> something<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.890> almost

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
somebody I do something to almost

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.309

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
realize that for the most part it

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.099 
realize that for the most part it
probably<00:02:19.730> isn't<00:02:19.909> your<00:02:20.269> fault<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.689> hundred

hundred percent for a situation that for
the<00:02:24.200> most<00:02:24.349> part<00:02:24.439> is<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:24.799> going<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.069> be<00:02:25.219> in<00:02:25.340> your

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
the most part is not going to be in your

anywhere you're gonna paralyze yourself

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.050 
anywhere you're gonna paralyze yourself
so<00:02:33.799> if<00:02:33.889> you're<00:02:33.980> dealing<00:02:34.280> with<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.400> breakup<00:02:34.609> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
so if you're dealing with a breakup and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.759 
so if you're dealing with a breakup and
the<00:02:35.120> pain<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.329> still<00:02:35.629> very<00:02:35.870> very<00:02:36.049> fresh<00:02:36.560> my

the pain is still very very fresh my

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.259 
the pain is still very very fresh my
advice<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:37.670> do<00:02:37.939> things<00:02:38.180> that

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
advice to you is this do things that

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.879 
advice to you is this do things that
make<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.569> happy<00:02:38.599> just<00:02:39.109> stop<00:02:39.379> thinking<00:02:39.829> about

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
make you happy just stop thinking about

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.379 
make you happy just stop thinking about
it<00:02:40.069> because<00:02:40.430> when<00:02:40.609> you<00:02:40.669> stop<00:02:40.909> thinking<00:02:41.120> about

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
it because when you stop thinking about

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.729 
it because when you stop thinking about
it<00:02:41.569> you're<00:02:41.780> gonna<00:02:41.870> allow<00:02:42.079> yourself<00:02:42.469> time<00:02:42.680> to

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
it you're gonna allow yourself time to

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:43.989 
it you're gonna allow yourself time to
heal<00:02:42.889> and<00:02:43.370> once<00:02:43.489> you've<00:02:43.609> allowed<00:02:43.819> yourself

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:43.999 
heal and once you've allowed yourself

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.849 
heal and once you've allowed yourself
enough<00:02:44.480> time<00:02:44.689> to<00:02:44.840> heal<00:02:45.079> you<00:02:45.319> can<00:02:45.530> go<00:02:45.650> back

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
enough time to heal you can go back

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.679 
enough time to heal you can go back
think<00:02:46.340> about<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:46.700> see<00:02:46.909> what<00:02:47.120> went<00:02:47.269> wrong<00:02:47.480> and

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689 
think about it see what went wrong and

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.119 
think about it see what went wrong and
realized<00:02:48.139> that<00:02:48.319> for<00:02:48.439> the<00:02:48.530> most<00:02:48.709> part<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:49.040> was

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
realized that for the most part it was

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.860 
realized that for the most part it was
probably<00:02:49.519> no<00:02:49.790> one's<00:02:49.969> fault<00:02:50.269> people<00:02:50.599> just<00:02:50.719> grow

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
probably no one's fault people just grow

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.809 
probably no one's fault people just grow
apart<00:02:51.099> romantically<00:02:52.099> sometimes<00:02:52.549> it's<00:02:52.760> a

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
apart romantically sometimes it's a

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.309 
apart romantically sometimes it's a
thing<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.150> just<00:02:53.209> not<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.629> our<00:02:53.719> control<00:02:53.840> but

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
thing it's just not in our control but

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.479 
thing it's just not in our control but
those<00:02:54.439> are<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.739> conclusions<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.340> I've

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489
