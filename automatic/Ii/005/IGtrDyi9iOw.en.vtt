00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
the reason it's so stretches well it's

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.030 
the reason it's so stretches well it's
the<00:01:19.659> way<00:01:19.810> that<00:01:19.960> they<00:01:20.110> place<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.530> scenes<00:01:20.799> as

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
the way that they place the scenes as

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.620 
the way that they place the scenes as
well<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.580> way<00:01:21.670> they<00:01:21.820> cut<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.150> panels<00:01:22.510> you

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
well so the way they cut the panels you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.420 
well so the way they cut the panels you
can<00:01:22.690> see<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:23.049> kind<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.290> V<00:01:23.530> formation<00:01:23.830> there

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
can see that kind of V formation there

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.060 
can see that kind of V formation there
if<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.120> was<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.270> straight<00:01:25.720> basic<00:01:26.500> seem<00:01:26.799> like

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
if it was a straight basic seem like

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.020 
if it was a straight basic seem like
that<00:01:27.250> but<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:27.520> wouldn't<00:01:27.760> give<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:27.909> that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
that but it wouldn't give you that

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.640 
that but it wouldn't give you that
flexibility<00:01:28.600> because<00:01:28.840> they<00:01:29.110> use<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.470> sort

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
flexibility because they use that sort

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.380 
flexibility because they use that sort
of<00:01:29.680> overall<00:01:30.070> technique<00:01:30.580> they<00:01:30.940> give<00:01:31.120> you<00:01:31.210> more

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
of overall technique they give you more

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.920 
of overall technique they give you more
flexibility<00:01:32.020> through<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.470> soup<00:01:32.680> as<00:01:32.830> well

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
flexibility through the soup as well

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.969 
flexibility through the soup as well
glued<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.049> blind<00:01:35.260> stitch<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.680> whole<00:01:35.830> way

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
glued and blind stitch the whole way

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.050 
glued and blind stitch the whole way
through<00:01:36.250> which<00:01:36.400> means<00:01:36.670> there<00:01:36.820> shouldn't<00:01:37.030> be

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
through which means there shouldn't be

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.850 
through which means there shouldn't be
any<00:01:37.240> punch<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.659> punch<00:01:38.170> of<00:01:38.320> holes<00:01:38.500> going<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
any punch of punch of holes going the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.500 
any punch of punch of holes going the
whole<00:01:38.979> way<00:01:39.040> through<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.610> suit<00:01:39.850> basically<00:01:40.150> so

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
whole way through the suit basically so

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.390 
whole way through the suit basically so
you<00:01:40.570> get<00:01:40.720> minimal<00:01:41.049> water<00:01:41.200> penetration<00:01:41.799> but

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
you get minimal water penetration but

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.070 
you get minimal water penetration but
one<00:01:42.610> thing<00:01:42.790> they<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.240> reinforce<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:43.810> as

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
one thing they do to reinforce that as

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.330 
one thing they do to reinforce that as
well<00:01:44.260> which<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:44.530> don't<00:01:44.740> get<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.100> entry

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
well which you don't get on the entry

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.950 
well which you don't get on the entry
level<00:01:45.369> suits<00:01:45.729> like<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.060> dorm<00:01:46.240> control<00:01:46.540> is

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
level suits like the dorm control is

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.170 
level suits like the dorm control is
this<00:01:47.229> liquid<00:01:47.619> taping<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.850> can<00:01:49.000> see<00:01:49.150> that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
this liquid taping it you can see that

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.450 
this liquid taping it you can see that
sort<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.479> liquid<00:01:49.630> taping<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.830> basically<00:01:51.220> that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
sort of liquid taping and basically that

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.039 
sort of liquid taping and basically that
just<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.760> runs<00:01:52.030> over<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.299> seems<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.840> really

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
just that runs over the seems to really

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.899 
just that runs over the seems to really
eradicate<00:01:53.770> any<00:01:53.950> water<00:01:54.250> getting<00:01:54.610> through<00:01:54.820> the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
eradicate any water getting through the

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.539 
eradicate any water getting through the
suit<00:01:55.119> okay<00:01:56.080> good<00:01:56.619> thing<00:01:56.770> about<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.010> is<00:01:57.250> as<00:01:57.369> well

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
suit okay good thing about it is as well

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.910 
suit okay good thing about it is as well
you<00:01:57.970> can<00:01:58.000> see<00:01:58.299> how<00:01:58.479> flexible<00:01:58.810> that<00:01:59.049> is<00:01:59.229> just

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
you can see how flexible that is just

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.789 
you can see how flexible that is just
demonstrate<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.369> monk<00:02:00.549> in<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.790> little<00:02:01.060> tug

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
demonstrate that monk in the little tug

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.450 
demonstrate that monk in the little tug
basically<00:02:02.799> so<00:02:02.890> it's<00:02:03.009> not<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.310> restrict

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
basically so it's not going to restrict

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.110 
basically so it's not going to restrict
the<00:02:03.850> movement<00:02:03.880> or<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.600> pliability

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
the movement or the pliability

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.480 
the movement or the pliability
a<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.630> work<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.020> time<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.230> don't<00:02:07.490> okay

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
a little work for this time I don't okay

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.490 
a little work for this time I don't okay

will<00:02:48.570> mean<00:02:48.750> there's<00:02:48.990> less<00:02:49.170> seams<00:02:49.500> which<00:02:49.830> means

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
will mean there's less seams which means

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.830 
will mean there's less seams which means
there's<00:02:50.220> more<00:02:50.250> flexibility<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.300> there's

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
there's more flexibility and there's

there's more flexibility and there's

be less water getting into the zoo

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.570 
be less water getting into the zoo
obviously<00:02:55.410> because<00:02:55.710> they<00:02:55.830> have<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.100> cut<00:02:56.370> from

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
obviously because they have to cut from

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.220 
obviously because they have to cut from
a<00:02:56.640> bigger<00:02:56.850> bit<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.120> neoprene<00:02:57.540> basically<00:02:58.110> they

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
a bigger bit of neoprene basically they

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.530 
a bigger bit of neoprene basically they
can't<00:02:58.470> make<00:02:59.010> as<00:02:59.220> many<00:02:59.370> suits<00:02:59.760> from<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.360> piece

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
can't make as many suits from that piece

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.030 
can't make as many suits from that piece
of<00:03:00.570> mirin<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.260> makes<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.560> slightly<00:03:01.770> more

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
of mirin it makes it slightly more

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.760 
of mirin it makes it slightly more
expensive<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:03.050> on<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.230> back<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.620> suit

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
expensive and on the back of the suit

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.470 
expensive and on the back of the suit
and<00:03:05.130> there's<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:05.730> bit<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:05.910> technology

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and there's a little bit of technology

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.960 
and there's a little bit of technology
which<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:06.990> definitely<00:03:07.620> definitely<00:03:08.280> useful

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
which is a definitely definitely useful

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.460 
which is a definitely definitely useful
for<00:03:09.330> keeping<00:03:09.450> water<00:03:09.750> out<00:03:09.900> sit<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.260> keeping

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
for keeping water out sit and keeping

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.370 
for keeping water out sit and keeping
you<00:03:10.530> warmer<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> zip<00:03:12.720> basically<00:03:13.230> like

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
you warmer it's the zip basically like

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.070 
you warmer it's the zip basically like
an<00:03:13.470> interlocking<00:03:13.920> zip<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.570> open<00:03:15.570> this<00:03:15.660> just<00:03:15.989> to

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
an interlocking zip I open this just to

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.690 
an interlocking zip I open this just to
show<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.320> just<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.739> lifted<00:03:17.280> only<00:03:17.430> thing<00:03:17.580> that

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
show you just a lifted only thing that

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.820 
show you just a lifted only thing that
most<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.420> most<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.290> companies<00:03:19.500> do

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
most of the most of the companies do

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.340 
most of the most of the companies do
this<00:03:20.010> day<00:03:20.190> they<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.459> marry<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.150> neoprene<00:03:22.140> up

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
this day they just marry the neoprene up

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.620 
this day they just marry the neoprene up
over<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.890> zip<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.550> meets<00:03:24.000> up<00:03:24.180> perfectly

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
over the zip so just meets up perfectly

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.620 
over the zip so just meets up perfectly
and<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.530> creates<00:03:25.830> basically<00:03:26.010> like<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.630> you

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
and just creates basically like a you

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.260 
and just creates basically like a you
know<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.810> like<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.640> basically<00:03:29.640> public<00:03:29.970> seal

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
know you like it a basically public seal

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.790 
know you like it a basically public seal
over<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.660> back<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.020> suit<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.410> any<00:03:31.530> water

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
over the back of the suit so any water

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.560 
over the back of the suit so any water
running<00:03:32.190> over<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> back<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> suit<00:03:32.970> won't

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
running over the back of the suit won't

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.630 
running over the back of the suit won't
go<00:03:33.840> straight<00:03:34.380> through<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.770> zip<00:03:34.980> basically

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
go straight through the zip basically

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.600 
go straight through the zip basically
okay<00:03:36.180> when<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.020> do<00:03:37.200> open<00:03:37.500> up<00:03:38.040> here<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.459> can

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
okay when you do open up here we can

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.790 
okay when you do open up here we can
have<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> look<00:03:39.060> at<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.270> zip<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.440> probably

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
have a look at the zip and it probably

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.530 
have a look at the zip and it probably
won't<00:03:41.070> really<00:03:41.250> get<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.489> too<00:03:41.670> much<00:03:41.790> justice<00:03:42.270> on

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
won't really get it too much justice on

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.900 
won't really get it too much justice on
the<00:03:42.570> on<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.350> camera<00:03:43.890> here<00:03:44.040> but<00:03:44.280> basically<00:03:44.400> the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the on the camera here but basically the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.729 
the on the camera here but basically the
zip<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.270> completely<00:03:45.780> interlocking<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:46.590> once

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
zip is completely interlocking so once

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.100 
zip is completely interlocking so once
it<00:03:46.860> actually<00:03:46.890> zips<00:03:47.489> up<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:48.600> really<00:03:48.810> shouldn't

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
it actually zips up it really shouldn't

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.110 
it actually zips up it really shouldn't
let<00:03:49.260> any<00:03:49.440> water<00:03:49.590> through<00:03:50.010> at<00:03:50.130> all<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.550> there's

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
let any water through at all and there's

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.699 
let any water through at all and there's
a<00:03:51.150> few<00:03:51.360> features<00:03:51.570> inside<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.140> suit<00:03:52.350> was<00:03:52.440> just

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
a few features inside the suit was just

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.620 
a few features inside the suit was just
really<00:03:53.010> sort<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.220> reinforced<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.030> stop<00:03:54.450> any

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
really sort of reinforced that stop any

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.210 
really sort of reinforced that stop any
air<00:03:54.840> water<00:03:55.230> getting<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.769> what<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:55.890> run<00:03:56.070> through

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
air water getting and what I run through

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.400 
air water getting and what I run through
those<00:03:56.489> with<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.239> owner<00:03:57.360> seconds<00:03:57.840> we<00:03:58.080> turn<00:03:58.260> the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
those with the owner seconds we turn the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.729 
those with the owner seconds we turn the
suit<00:03:58.590> inside<00:03:59.010> out<00:03:59.239> okay<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.739> that's

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
suit inside out okay so that's

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.050 
suit inside out okay so that's
everything<00:04:01.980> really<00:04:02.280> going<00:04:02.550> on<00:04:02.610> there<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
everything really going on there on the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.240 
everything really going on there on the
outside<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.810> soup<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.170> we<00:04:04.290> turn<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.950> bad

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
outside of the soup so we turn it is bad

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.560 
outside of the soup so we turn it is bad
boy<00:04:05.430> inside<00:04:05.820> out<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.180> then<00:04:06.330> what<00:04:06.450> I've<00:04:06.540> a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
boy inside out and then what I've a

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.080 
boy inside out and then what I've a
little<00:04:06.810> look<00:04:06.930> inside<00:04:07.670> okay<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:08.730> here<00:04:08.970> we<00:04:09.060> have

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
little look inside okay so here we have

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.890 
little look inside okay so here we have
the<00:04:09.330> inside<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.720> course<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.590> skin

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
the inside of course I skin

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.069 
the inside of course I skin
also<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.230> middle<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.680> range<00:04:12.950> suit<00:04:13.310> and

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
also the middle of the range suit and

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.880 
also the middle of the range suit and
probably<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.170> first<00:04:15.290> thing<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.590> point<00:04:15.709> now

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
probably the first thing to point now

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.159 
probably the first thing to point now
which<00:04:16.579> wondering<00:04:17.269> what<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.509> is<00:04:17.600> all<00:04:17.720> about<00:04:17.750> is

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
which wondering what it is all about is

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.390 
which wondering what it is all about is
there<00:04:18.320> are<00:04:18.410> different<00:04:18.680> colors<00:04:18.949> of<00:04:19.009> neoprene

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
there are different colors of neoprene

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.650 
there are different colors of neoprene
different<00:04:19.850> colors<00:04:20.150> running<00:04:20.419> through<00:04:20.539> this

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
different colors running through this

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.529 
different colors running through this
inside<00:04:21.500> of<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.739> suit<00:04:21.949> and<00:04:22.220> it's<00:04:23.210> basically

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
inside of the suit and it's basically

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.150 
inside of the suit and it's basically
the<00:04:23.690> types<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.229> near<00:04:24.440> purring<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.800> they<00:04:24.919> use

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
the types of near purring that they use

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.310 
the types of near purring that they use
I<00:04:25.400> mentioned<00:04:25.759> before<00:04:25.850> other<00:04:26.180> III<00:04:26.690> neoprene<00:04:27.139> is

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
I mentioned before other III neoprene is

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.920 
I mentioned before other III neoprene is
that<00:04:27.500> stretches<00:04:27.949> neoprene<00:04:28.370> rip<00:04:29.210> curl<00:04:29.449> use<00:04:29.630> and

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
that stretches neoprene rip curl use and

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.240 
that stretches neoprene rip curl use and

really really super stretchy stuff as
you<00:04:38.389> mentioned<00:04:38.720> before<00:04:38.750> that's<00:04:39.199> kind<00:04:39.440> of<00:04:39.470> in

you mentioned before that's kind of in
the<00:04:39.620> upper<00:04:39.949> body<00:04:40.100> of<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.460> suit<00:04:40.669> so<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.090> can

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
the upper body of the suit so you can

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.450 
the upper body of the suit so you can
see<00:04:41.389> that<00:04:41.570> there<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.680> run<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.039> back<00:04:43.220> as<00:04:43.430> well

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
see that there and run the back as well

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.719 
see that there and run the back as well
the<00:04:44.330> blue<00:04:44.539> stuff<00:04:44.840> basically<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.729> seventeen

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
the blue stuff basically is seventeen

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.580 
the blue stuff basically is seventeen
percent<00:04:46.880> as<00:04:47.419> stretchy<00:04:47.840> as<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.289> III

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
percent as stretchy as the III

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.529 
percent as stretchy as the III
apparently<00:04:49.070> going<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.520> rip<00:04:49.789> curl<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.360> that

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
apparently going to rip curl and that

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.450 
apparently going to rip curl and that
runs<00:04:50.720> through<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.110> rest<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.590> soup<00:04:51.830> okay

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
runs through the rest of the soup okay

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.890 
runs through the rest of the soup okay
so<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:52.669> still<00:04:52.910> get<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.090> lot<00:04:53.150> of<00:04:53.330> flex<00:04:53.630> in<00:04:53.810> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
so you still get a lot of flex in the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.110 
so you still get a lot of flex in the
lower<00:04:54.050> body<00:04:54.260> in<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.650> legs<00:04:54.830> as<00:04:55.010> well<00:04:55.160> okay<00:04:56.060> so

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
lower body in the legs as well okay so

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.640 
lower body in the legs as well okay so
you're<00:04:56.449> not<00:04:56.510> going<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.750> lose<00:04:56.870> any<00:04:56.930> flexibility

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
you're not going to lose any flexibility

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.650 
you're not going to lose any flexibility
there<00:04:57.889> but<00:04:58.370> where<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.669> core<00:04:58.880> area<00:04:59.270> is<00:04:59.419> it's

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660
