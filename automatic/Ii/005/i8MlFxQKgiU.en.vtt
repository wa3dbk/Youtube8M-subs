00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.500 
showcasing a minecart that put down
track<00:00:08.040> in<00:00:08.309> front<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.730> itself<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.360> could

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
track in front of itself so it could

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.870 
track in front of itself so it could
move<00:00:09.660> forever<00:00:09.990> all<00:00:10.950> right<00:00:11.070> now<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.460> then<00:00:11.610> Seth

uploaded the first um track-laying mine
card<00:00:16.170> ever<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:17.130> anyways<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.760> realized<00:00:18.300> that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
card ever so anyways I realized that

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.290 
card ever so anyways I realized that
this<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.890> cornerstone<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.699> huge<00:00:21.060> new

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
this was the cornerstone for a huge new

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.500 
this was the cornerstone for a huge new
concept<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.930> Minecraft<00:00:22.380> which<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.769> full<00:00:23.510> full

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
concept in Minecraft which is full full

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.019 
concept in Minecraft which is full full
mine<00:00:24.810> automation<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.000> have

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
mine automation as then you just have

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
mine automation as then you just have
mine<00:00:27.480> carts<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.930> command<00:00:28.199> blocks<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.560> do

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
mine carts with command blocks that do

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.890 
mine carts with command blocks that do
all<00:00:29.070> your<00:00:29.400> mining<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> mean

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
all your mining for you or I mean

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.359 
all your mining for you or I mean
obviously<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.619> wouldn't<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.040> these<00:00:32.219> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
obviously you wouldn't have these in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.090 
obviously you wouldn't have these in
survival<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.750> would<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
survival but this would this is like a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.790 
survival but this would this is like a
vanilla<00:00:35.700> tool<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.540> mapmakers<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.649> going

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
vanilla tool for mapmakers this is going

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.930 
vanilla tool for mapmakers this is going
to<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.950> huge<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.489> um<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.940> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to be huge so um what I have here is a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
to be huge so um what I have here is a
set<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> command<00:00:42.840> blocks<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.230> places<00:00:43.620> down

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
set of command blocks that places down

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.029 
set of command blocks that places down
some<00:00:44.040> command<00:00:44.430> block<00:00:44.579> mine<00:00:44.789> carts<00:00:45.120> that

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
some command block mine carts that

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.049 
some command block mine carts that
essentially<00:00:47.039> mine<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> three<00:00:47.879> by<00:00:48.030> three

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
essentially mine out a three by three

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.790 
essentially mine out a three by three
tunnel<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:49.020> some<00:00:49.140> torches<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
tunnel and put some torches on the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.090 
tunnel and put some torches on the
ground<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.280> um<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.840> mean<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> wanted<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.000 
ground so um if I mean if you wanted to
make<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.610> mine<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.059> your<00:00:54.780> map<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.230> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
with command blocks you want to make

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.490 
with command blocks you want to make
something<00:00:59.210> now<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.350> could

just paste these into roleplay sit down
and<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.570> them<00:01:03.690> make<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> mine<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.470> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and have them make a mine so that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.730 
and have them make a mine so that
further<00:01:05.460> ado<00:01:05.760> further<00:01:06.510> ado<00:01:06.930> I'll<00:01:07.320> show<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
button and it will spawn to mine carts

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.590 
button and it will spawn to mine carts
there<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.869> manage<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> follow<00:01:13.500> them

activator rails from the second one I'm

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.359 
activator rails from the second one I'm
going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.659> back<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.500> machine<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.100> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
going to go back to the machine now you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.550 
going to go back to the machine now you
guys<00:01:23.490> saw<00:01:23.729> how<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> worked<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.960> second<00:01:25.409> one

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
guys saw how that worked the second one

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.730 
guys saw how that worked the second one
has<00:01:26.220> um<00:01:26.549> loads<00:01:27.000> more<00:01:27.500> minecarts<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
has um loads more minecarts than the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
has um loads more minecarts than the
first<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> mine<00:01:30.420> carts

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
first one it's not just to mine carts

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.740 
first one it's not just to mine carts
it's<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:31.229> about<00:01:31.820> um<00:01:32.820> oh<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.600> out<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
it's actually about um oh they're out of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's actually about um oh they're out of
range<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.320> actually<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:35.659> I'd<00:01:36.659> say<00:01:36.689> forty

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
range but actually about I'd say forty

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.690 
range but actually about I'd say forty
fifty<00:01:37.590> minecarts<00:01:38.340> total<00:01:39.200> anyway<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.259> um<00:01:40.700> but

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
fifty minecarts total anyway so um but

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.350 
fifty minecarts total anyway so um but
the<00:01:41.850> second<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.659> does<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.710> clears<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the second one does is it clears out the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.050 
the second one does is it clears out the
top<00:01:46.200> three<00:01:46.439> blocks<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> site<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.670> two

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
top three blocks on the site and the two

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.450 
top three blocks on the site and the two
lower<00:01:48.299> side<00:01:48.689> box<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.530> places<00:01:49.950> down<00:01:50.130> some

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
wanted to do just an idea that popped

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.889 
wanted to do just an idea that popped
into<00:02:08.640> my<00:02:08.759> head<00:02:08.879> was<00:02:09.179> make<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.720> these

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
into my head was make it so that these

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.410 
into my head was make it so that these
minor<00:02:10.560> hurt<00:02:10.800> command<00:02:11.160> blocks<00:02:11.400> place<00:02:11.790> minecart

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
minor hurt command blocks place minecart

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.670 
minor hurt command blocks place minecart
command<00:02:12.750> blocks<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.170> those<00:02:13.260> go<00:02:13.470> off

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
command blocks and those go off

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.559 
command blocks and those go off
to<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.859> side<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.700> know<00:02:15.299> you<00:02:15.359> could<00:02:15.510> have

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
to the side so I know you could have

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.539 
to the side so I know you could have
this<00:02:15.840> make<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> whole<00:02:16.439> underground<00:02:16.769> labyrinth

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
this make a whole underground labyrinth

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.069 
this make a whole underground labyrinth
or<00:02:17.700> something<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.239> thought<00:02:18.599> that'd<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.900> pretty

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
or something I thought that'd be pretty

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.569 
or something I thought that'd be pretty
cool<00:02:19.200> maybe<00:02:19.739> one<00:02:19.859> of<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.040> guys<00:02:20.129> could<00:02:20.340> work<00:02:20.489> on

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
cool maybe one of you guys could work on

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.640 
cool maybe one of you guys could work on
that<00:02:20.790> host<00:02:21.510> as<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> video<00:02:21.989> response<00:02:22.170> or

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
that host as a video response or

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.270 
that host as a video response or
something<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.730> uh<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:25.230> i'll<00:02:25.590> give<00:02:25.829> i'll<00:02:26.069> try

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
something but uh so i'll give i'll try

something but uh so i'll give i'll try

places down the rails you have to have a

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.499 
places down the rails you have to have a
delay<00:03:47.129> between<00:03:47.189> them<00:03:47.699> because<00:03:47.939> occasionally

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
delay between them because occasionally

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.009 
delay between them because occasionally
it<00:03:49.049> will<00:03:49.109> try<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.439> film<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.919> rails<00:03:50.159> first<00:03:50.609> and

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
it will try to film the rails first and

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.659 
it will try to film the rails first and
when<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.139> does<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.530> rails<00:03:52.979> will<00:03:53.340> realize

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
when it does that the rails will realize

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:54.710 
when it does that the rails will realize
there's<00:03:53.879> nothing<00:03:54.150> underneath<00:03:54.419> them<00:03:54.689> and

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
there's nothing underneath them and

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.830 
there's nothing underneath them and
disappear<00:03:55.729> so<00:03:56.729> that's<00:03:57.180> why<00:03:57.329> i<00:03:57.359> have<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:57.659> one

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
disappear so that's why i have this one

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.689 
disappear so that's why i have this one
tick<00:03:58.049> delay<00:03:58.290> between<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.709> two<00:03:58.859> of<00:03:58.949> them<00:03:59.129> then

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
tick delay between the two of them then

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.719 
tick delay between the two of them then
it<00:04:00.180> will<00:04:00.720> next<00:04:00.959> slide<00:04:01.229> up<00:04:01.409> this<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:02.220> jairo<00:04:02.609> of

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
it will next slide up this to jairo of

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.189 
it will next slide up this to jairo of
command<00:04:03.000> blocks<00:04:03.209> here<00:04:03.449> which<00:04:03.840> will<00:04:04.049> place

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
command blocks here which will place

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.640 
command blocks here which will place
down<00:04:04.530> ten<00:04:05.340> minecart<00:04:05.819> command<00:04:06.120> blocks<00:04:06.650> which

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
down ten minecart command blocks which

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.170 
down ten minecart command blocks which
place<00:04:08.040> down<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> redstone<00:04:08.729> blocks<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
place down the redstone blocks in the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.390 
place down the redstone blocks in the
activator<00:04:09.750> rails<00:04:10.049> in<00:04:10.319> front<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.280> you're

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
activator rails in front of it so you're

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.189 
activator rails in front of it so you're
probably<00:04:11.549> thinking<00:04:11.759> why<00:04:12.599> do<00:04:12.659> you<00:04:12.810> need<00:04:12.959> ten

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
probably thinking why do you need ten

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.379 
probably thinking why do you need ten
you<00:04:13.379> could<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.620> done<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:13.859> with<00:04:14.040> just<00:04:14.389> just

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
you could have done that with just just

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.870 
you could have done that with just just
too<00:04:15.599> well<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.949> kind<00:04:17.669> of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
too well it's kind of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.760 
too well it's kind of
hit<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.180> miss<00:04:18.390> with<00:04:18.420> how<00:04:18.810> often<00:04:19.230> places<00:04:19.650> down

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
hit and miss with how often places down

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.620 
hit and miss with how often places down
a<00:04:19.800> redstone<00:04:20.160> block<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:20.820> may<00:04:21.030> only<00:04:21.060> place<00:04:21.510> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
a redstone block it may only place the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
a redstone block it may only place the
Ritz<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:21.989> walk<00:04:22.140> every<00:04:22.530> other<00:04:22.650> track<00:04:23.640> or<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:23.970> I

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
Ritz and walk every other track or so I

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.780 
Ritz and walk every other track or so I
believe<00:04:25.650> it's<00:04:25.860> two<00:04:26.250> out<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.430> every<00:04:26.640> three

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
believe it's two out of every three

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.490 
believe it's two out of every three
blocks<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.510> will<00:04:27.630> place<00:04:27.780> down<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.080> track<00:04:28.320> or

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
blocks it will place down to track or

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.170 
blocks it will place down to track or
something<00:04:28.800> like<00:04:28.890> that<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.370> just<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.910> guarantee

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
something like that so just to guarantee

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.360 
something like that so just to guarantee
that<00:04:30.510> it's<00:04:30.930> always<00:04:31.260> placing<00:04:31.770> blocks<00:04:32.100> and

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
that it's always placing blocks and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.370 
that it's always placing blocks and
track<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:32.670> front<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.240> have<00:04:33.720> five<00:04:34.050> mine

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
track in front of it I have five mine

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.650 
track in front of it I have five mine
carts<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.830> each<00:04:34.950> type<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:35.610> five<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.480> place

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
carts of each type so five that place

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.240 
carts of each type so five that place
down<00:04:36.780> redstone<00:04:37.200> blocks<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.590> five<00:04:37.800> that<00:04:38.070> place

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
down redstone blocks in five that place

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.850 
down redstone blocks in five that place
down<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.580> rails<00:04:39.080> alright<00:04:40.080> secondly<00:04:40.560> then<00:04:40.740> it

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
down the rails alright secondly then it

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.340 
down the rails alright secondly then it
waits<00:04:41.010> almost<00:04:41.490> about<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.760> second<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.450> spawns

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
waits almost about a second and spawns

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.730 
waits almost about a second and spawns
in<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:44.150> some<00:04:45.150> blocks<00:04:45.450> right<00:04:46.320> here<00:04:46.680> um<00:04:48.710> I'll<00:04:49.710> just

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
in a some blocks right here um I'll just

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.030 
in a some blocks right here um I'll just
get<00:04:50.040> rid<00:04:50.310> of<00:04:50.340> these<00:04:51.980> so<00:04:52.980> first<00:04:53.430> there's<00:04:53.850> the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
get rid of these so first there's the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.290 
get rid of these so first there's the
self-propagating<00:04:56.040> minecart<00:04:56.850> this<00:04:57.030> is<00:04:57.150> what

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
self-propagating minecart this is what

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.840 
self-propagating minecart this is what
CaptainSparklez<00:04:58.080> made<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.530> then<00:04:59.220> this<00:04:59.490> next

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
CaptainSparklez made and then this next

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.640 
CaptainSparklez made and then this next
part<00:05:00.030> is<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.270> my<00:05:00.750> Edition<00:05:01.170> also

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
part is a my Edition also

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.950 
part is a my Edition also
CaptainSparklez<00:05:02.550> designed<00:05:02.910> this<00:05:03.060> broken<00:05:03.780> in

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
CaptainSparklez designed this broken in

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.310 
CaptainSparklez designed this broken in
one<00:05:04.440> in<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:05.070> 13<00:05:05.610> snapshot<00:05:06.300> 39b<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:07.140> believe<00:05:07.530> so

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
one in the 13 snapshot 39b I believe so

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.600 
one in the 13 snapshot 39b I believe so
yeah<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.470> solution<00:05:10.860> there<00:05:11.010> is<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.280> just<00:05:11.430> add

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
yeah the solution there is to just add

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.220 
yeah the solution there is to just add
more<00:05:11.790> minecarts<00:05:12.300> because<00:05:12.480> he<00:05:12.570> just<00:05:12.750> used<00:05:12.990> for

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
more minecarts because he just used for

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.070 
more minecarts because he just used for
I<00:05:13.290> believe<00:05:13.380> but<00:05:13.740> anyways<00:05:16.550> then<00:05:17.750> sorry<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:18.840> just

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
I believe but anyways then sorry I just

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.360 
I believe but anyways then sorry I just
had<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.230> put<00:05:19.410> those<00:05:19.530> back<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:19.830> because<00:05:20.130> i'm<00:05:20.280> a

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
had to put those back in because i'm a

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.420 
had to put those back in because i'm a
bit<00:05:20.580> OCD<00:05:20.760> but<00:05:21.360> now<00:05:21.690> this<00:05:22.530> huge<00:05:22.860> chunk<00:05:23.220> will

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
bit OCD but now this huge chunk will

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.390 
bit OCD but now this huge chunk will
spawn<00:05:23.640> a<00:05:23.670> lot<00:05:24.090> more<00:05:24.380> mine<00:05:25.380> carts<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.950> i

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
spawn a lot more mine carts and i

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.670 
spawn a lot more mine carts and i
believe<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:27.480> place<00:05:27.630> is<00:05:27.690> a<00:05:27.840> block<00:05:28.170> here<00:05:28.200> and

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
believe that place is a block here and

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.340 
believe that place is a block here and
then<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.830> powered<00:05:29.220> rail<00:05:29.430> there<00:05:29.730> so<00:05:30.600> let<00:05:31.140> me<00:05:31.230> just

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
then a powered rail there so let me just

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.750 
then a powered rail there so let me just
power<00:05:31.560> this<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.740> second<00:05:32.130> watch<00:05:32.280> closely<00:05:32.550> what

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
power this a second watch closely what

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.570 
power this a second watch closely what
happens<00:05:33.560> yeah<00:05:34.560> place<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:34.950> down<00:05:34.980> iron<00:05:35.400> block

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
happens yeah place it down iron block

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.580 
happens yeah place it down iron block
and<00:05:35.730> empowered<00:05:36.090> rail<00:05:36.330> then<00:05:36.870> sends<00:05:37.230> that<00:05:37.260> group

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
and empowered rail then sends that group

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.070 
and empowered rail then sends that group
on<00:05:37.770> its<00:05:37.980> way<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.360> that<00:05:39.360> group<00:05:39.570> is<00:05:39.690> what<00:05:39.870> places

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
on its way and that group is what places

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.050 
on its way and that group is what places
down<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.500> torches<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.100> destroys<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.760> three

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
down the torches and destroys the three

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.620 
down the torches and destroys the three
back<00:05:42.210> through<00:05:42.420> area<00:05:42.830> so<00:05:43.830> yeah<00:05:44.250> um<00:05:44.460> if<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:45.420> want

way you can paste this anywhere in your

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.790 
way you can paste this anywhere in your
world<00:06:06.420> and<00:06:06.690> it'll<00:06:06.900> still<00:06:07.140> work<00:06:07.170> it's<00:06:07.590> not

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
world and it'll still work it's not

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.820 
world and it'll still work it's not
location<00:06:08.250> specific<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:09.200> then<00:06:10.200> those

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
location specific and then those

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.460 
location specific and then those
minecart<00:06:11.370> command<00:06:11.610> blocks<00:06:11.790> have<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.150> command

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
minecart command blocks have the command

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.310 
minecart command blocks have the command
set<00:06:13.470> block<00:06:13.790> let's<00:06:14.790> see<00:06:15.030> negative<00:06:15.270> one<00:06:15.660> new<00:06:15.930> one

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
set block let's see negative one new one

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.200 
set block let's see negative one new one
so<00:06:16.650> what<00:06:17.340> this<00:06:17.520> one<00:06:17.790> would<00:06:18.000> do<00:06:18.180> is<00:06:18.510> place<00:06:19.050> um

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
so what this one would do is place um

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.410 
so what this one would do is place um
air<00:06:21.210> and<00:06:21.690> air<00:06:22.350> block<00:06:22.730> let's<00:06:23.730> see<00:06:23.850> I<00:06:23.880> think<00:06:23.970> one

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
air and air block let's see I think one

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.570 
air and air block let's see I think one
behind<00:06:24.750> it<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:25.080> one<00:06:25.290> to<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.470> left<00:06:25.710> so<00:06:26.130> about

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
behind it and one to the left so about

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.580 
behind it and one to the left so about
right<00:06:26.790> there<00:06:26.970> is<00:06:27.150> where<00:06:27.330> that<00:06:28.260> one<00:06:28.440> would

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
right there is where that one would

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.430 
right there is where that one would
place<00:06:28.740> into<00:06:28.950> your<00:06:29.040> block

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
place into your block

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.730 
place into your block
yeah<00:06:30.710> that's<00:06:31.010> about<00:06:31.190> all<00:06:31.310> this<00:06:31.580> works<00:06:31.850> um
