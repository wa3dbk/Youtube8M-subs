00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
gonna stop in that time so it's going to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.429 
gonna stop in that time so it's going to
explode<00:01:24.659> you're<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> save<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.259> many

explode you're going to save as many

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.960 
explode you're going to save as many
people<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:25.920> score<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.310> based<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.729> how

people and your score is based on how
many<00:01:27.030> people<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.450> save<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.930> how<00:01:28.200> long<00:01:28.650> they

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
many people you save is how long they

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.160 
many people you save is how long they
last<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> go<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.610> food<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.170> at

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
last for so you go get food up there at

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.760 
last for so you go get food up there at
the<00:01:31.200> moment

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the moment

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.050 
the moment
sixty<00:01:32.189> thousand<00:01:32.520> people<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.789> going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.969> die

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
sixty thousand people are going to die

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.819 
sixty thousand people are going to die
and<00:01:33.180> zero<00:01:33.539> is<00:01:33.719> that<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.679> die

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and zero is that all just going to die

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.370 
and zero is that all just going to die
soon<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> get<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.609> their<00:01:36.390> food<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
soon to get up in their food that's a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.499 
soon to get up in their food that's a
count<00:01:37.920> down<00:01:38.039> there<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.329> die

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
count down there you're going to die

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.830 
count down there you're going to die
they<00:01:40.350> did<00:01:40.700> okay<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.759> where<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> stuff

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
they did okay so where are all the stuff

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.749 
they did okay so where are all the stuff
so<00:01:43.020> basically<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.189> hobby<00:01:44.460> now

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so basically this is the hobby now

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.749 
so basically this is the hobby now
remember<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> hobby<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.899> same<00:01:46.549> Sam<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
remember this is a hobby the same Sam is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.179 
remember this is a hobby the same Sam is
doing<00:01:48.210> anymore<00:01:48.929> copy<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:51.679> it's<00:01:52.679> kind<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.069> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
doing anymore copy so it's kind of a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.830 
doing anymore copy so it's kind of a
it's<00:01:53.219> a<00:01:53.459> simulation<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
it's a simulation this one here is a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.959 
it's a simulation this one here is a
simulation<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.649> add<00:01:55.860> parts<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
simulation and you add parts to it to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.240 
simulation and you add parts to it to
make<00:01:57.090> more<00:01:57.270> money<00:01:57.560> because<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.069> feed

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
make more money because you got to feed

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
make more money because you got to feed
all<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> homeless<00:01:59.939> people<00:02:00.420> who<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.689> scaping

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
all the homeless people who are scaping

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.740 
all the homeless people who are scaping
Ebola<00:02:01.469> yeah<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.909> want<00:02:03.209> to<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> dick<00:02:03.719> but

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
Ebola yeah I don't want to be a dick but

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.319 
Ebola yeah I don't want to be a dick but
that<00:02:04.349> is<00:02:04.470> totally<00:02:04.770> Africa<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> background

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that is totally Africa in the background

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.910 
that is totally Africa in the background
it's<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.770> round<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.130> round<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:09.920> I'm

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
it's going round and round but that I'm

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.759 
it's going round and round but that I'm
a<00:02:11.009> genius<00:02:11.400> perfect<00:02:12.239> book<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:13.440> was<00:02:13.500> really

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
a genius perfect book that was really

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.360 
a genius perfect book that was really
really<00:02:14.430> cool<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.290> how<00:02:16.290> many<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:16.860> work<00:02:17.190> is

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
really cool so how many like work is

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.460 
really cool so how many like work is
really<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.610> scoring<00:02:18.090> system<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.900> or<00:02:19.170> like

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
really a scoring system on this or like

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.050 
really a scoring system on this or like
what<00:02:19.650> do<00:02:19.709> we<00:02:19.799> do<00:02:20.010> there's<00:02:20.579> our<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
what do we do there's our then the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.430 
what do we do there's our then the
beginning<00:02:21.329> to<00:02:21.450> give<00:02:21.599> giving<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.870> career<00:02:22.200> after

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
beginning to give giving a career after

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.100 
beginning to give giving a career after
it<00:02:22.799> looks<00:02:22.980> nice<00:02:23.280> okay<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.329> this<00:02:24.450> person<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.930> but

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
it looks nice okay so this person is but

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.009 
it looks nice okay so this person is but
it<00:02:25.170> becomes<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.590> server<00:02:26.269> exams<00:02:27.269> desk<00:02:27.569> or<00:02:27.750> zero

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
it becomes a server exams desk or zero

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.080 
it becomes a server exams desk or zero
emotion<00:02:28.319> okay<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:28.829> that<00:02:29.040> person<00:02:29.370> sucks<00:02:29.549> wait

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
emotion okay so that person sucks wait

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.369 
emotion okay so that person sucks wait
that<00:02:30.239> was<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.510> you've<00:02:30.989> got<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> high<00:02:31.349> score

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
that was you you've got the high score

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.210 
that was you you've got the high score
in<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.190> portal<00:02:32.760> school

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.550 

that<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.340> grossly<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.450> just<00:02:38.600> put<00:02:38.960> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
that is grossly so you just put the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.490 
that is grossly so you just put the
wings<00:02:39.710> on<00:02:39.950> yeah<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.660> like<00:02:41.990> why<00:02:42.170> didn't<00:02:42.440> you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
wings on yeah and I like why didn't you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800 
wings on yeah and I like why didn't you
add<00:02:42.650> morning<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.790> are<00:02:43.940> in<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.330> next<00:02:44.630> Raja

add morning you are in the next Raja

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.740 
add morning you are in the next Raja
school<00:02:50.230> night<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.530> get<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.710> cup<00:02:52.090> ok<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.630> now

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
school night I get a cup ok so and now

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.270 
school night I get a cup ok so and now
you<00:02:53.810> gotta<00:02:54.020> tell<00:02:54.170> us<00:02:54.200> about<00:02:54.320> this<00:02:54.560> one<00:02:59.080> ok<00:03:00.280> so

you gotta tell us about this one ok so
you're<00:03:01.370> gonna<00:03:01.490> get<00:03:01.640> more<00:03:02.060> complex<00:03:02.630> ok<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:04.070> is

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
you're gonna get more complex ok this is

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.680 
you're gonna get more complex ok this is
going<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.490> be<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.610> business<00:03:04.820> simulation<00:03:05.120> game

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.720 

and<00:03:08.690> pretty<00:03:09.080> much<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.530> just<00:03:09.560> over<00:03:10.040> 400<00:03:10.220> solar

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
and pretty much is just over 400 solar

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.400 
and pretty much is just over 400 solar
systems<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.240> know<00:03:11.360> over<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.750> regenerated

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
systems you know over and regenerated

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.390 
systems you know over and regenerated
four<00:03:12.590> hundred<00:03:13.100> solar<00:03:13.340> systems<00:03:14.200> 400<00:03:15.280> how<00:03:16.280> did

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
four hundred solar systems 400 how did

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.040 
four hundred solar systems 400 how did
you<00:03:16.460> get<00:03:16.580> 400<00:03:16.790> solar<00:03:17.240> systems<00:03:17.600> in<00:03:17.720> this<00:03:17.870> that's

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
you get 400 solar systems in this that's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.570 
you get 400 solar systems in this that's
actually<00:03:18.380> expose<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:18.980> can<00:03:19.100> have<00:03:19.220> up<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.370> nine

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
actually expose I can have up to nine

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.910 
actually expose I can have up to nine

all<00:03:44.270> right<00:03:44.480> we<00:03:44.630> can<00:03:44.780> do<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.110> two<00:03:45.230> spaces<00:03:45.530> at<00:03:45.860> the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
all right we can do it two spaces at the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.920 
all right we can do it two spaces at the
same<00:03:46.160> spacing<00:03:46.640> she<00:03:46.760> thinks<00:03:47.209> they<00:03:47.360> say<00:03:47.569> we'll

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
same spacing she thinks they say we'll

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.390 
same spacing she thinks they say we'll
take<00:03:48.140> it

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.010 

buderim<00:03:51.400> probes<00:03:51.640> are<00:03:51.910> satellites<00:03:52.360> okay<00:03:52.960> so

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
buderim probes are satellites okay so

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.530 
buderim probes are satellites okay so
the<00:03:53.200> goal<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.100> space<00:03:54.520> stations<00:03:55.000> and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
the goal is to the space stations and

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.710 
the goal is to the space stations and
that's<00:03:56.440> kind<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.860> like<00:03:57.040> your<00:03:57.400> city<00:03:57.730> they<00:03:58.569> like

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
that's kind of like your city they like

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.030 
that's kind of like your city they like
mine<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.080> do<00:03:59.170> everything<00:03:59.290> for<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.740> yeah

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
mine and do everything for you yeah

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.949 
mine and do everything for you yeah
there<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.850> go<00:04:00.880> up<00:04:01.150> let's<00:04:01.420> go<00:04:01.540> out<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.750> solar

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
there you go up let's go out of a solar

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.930 
there you go up let's go out of a solar
systems<00:04:02.319> to<00:04:02.560> go<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.709> mine<00:04:02.920> asteroids<00:04:03.310> in<00:04:03.850> our

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
systems to go to mine asteroids in our

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.300 
systems to go to mine asteroids in our
solar<00:04:04.000> system

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
solar system

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.229 
solar system
that's<00:04:06.270> first<00:04:06.569> quiet<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:08.280> how<00:04:08.430> far<00:04:08.760> along<00:04:08.819> are

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
that's first quiet so how far along are
