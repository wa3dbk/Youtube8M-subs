00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510
 what about friends and today I want 

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.430
 teach them how to place the tablecloth in the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.429
 frame this is a wooden frame 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.190
 Large size 50 x 50 is ideal for 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.999
 when they have to be cushions 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.379
 practically what I want to teach them 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.990
 how to place it fits properly 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.000
 Tense the fabric and this what is going to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
 help is to avoid that we are changing 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.690
 constantly from frame and finish 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.400
 from a one-time job if you 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.740
 I will teach how to place it so that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.920
 they are so tense to see this is a 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.490
 wooden dressing room 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.610
 on this side so that the hotel 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.230
 and I 'm going to show you how to do it for 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.970
 place the fabric in our frame what 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.340
 first we need a frame 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.910
 of these features a rack of 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:50.020
 wood 50 x 50 is the size of stem 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.640
 and you have some points here with some nails 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.130
 with which we are going to hold the points 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.440
 from our web this is all all the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.140
 joke all around has these 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.480
 more or less separated pins in case 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.270
 throw two of two or three centimeters 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.950
 approximately is for you to leave the fabric 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.750
 well tense yes 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.920
 and what we are going to need is also the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.159
 fabric on which we are going to work 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.990
 our design and here a tip jon 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.259
 important is that the fabric should be 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.130
 larger than the size of the frame if 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.170
 they are going to work a rug the rug is 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.420
 suppose one meter by one meter 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.460
 then the fabric must measure at least 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.189
 five centimeters more or one meter or 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.409
 five centimeters so that 's that 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.549
 be the fabric to help us stretch 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.840
 around what is the mat or what 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.049
 which is the frame itself 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.240
 and more if it is a fabric that you feel 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.310
 that frays a lot on the banks 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.960
 then try to leave a little more 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.049
 of cloth 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.380
 the first point we are going to make is 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.510
 place the fabric well stretched in the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.110
 first two points in our frame 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:05.310
 we are going to do it this way 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.860
 here I have my fabric that is bigger than 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.440
 the frame see from this side 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.460
 and it's about 5 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:20.310
 centimeters that I tell you and this one 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.310
 side if we're going to start with 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.470
 and this point is to be placed this 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.300
 together we will put it well stretched and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.300
 let's pull to the other end 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.310
 towards the last plane trying that 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.170
 this is very close that the fabric 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.239
 is even if you do not have a couple here 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.030
 and they put more cloth on this side of the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.379
 another side will be needed then 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.290
 try if you want, you can even 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.209
 mark so that they go straight and already 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.170
 which is the first the first two 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.840
 points introduced on the banks we are going 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.470
 to start putting the even fabric in the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.470
 other nails 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.560
 as it is the first grade that we are going to 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.720
 enter and we do not need to stretch 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.879
 we're just going to live by provoking 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.769
 I tell them to be even and here 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.670
 enter all the nails now we 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:21.020
 let's go to the opposite side 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.700
 the opposite side here my TV was a lot 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.190
 larger than those five centimeters by 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.110
 that's more than one side to me but 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.330
 well that does not matter if I wanted to do 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.020
 a bigger rug because that's how it goes 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.670
 there's a lot of fabric left over from one side and now 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.150
 I'm going to stretch and I'm going to put the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.780
 two 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.970
 points the last two points stretching 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.980
 our fabric stretched well I'm 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.019
 speaking from the bottom up and I'm going to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.230
 introduce and sideways and I'll 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.720
 introduce the two next to you if you already 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.750
 it's like this now I'm going to start 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.970
 introduce the others stretching I'm going to 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.939
 be here if we are going to list see how 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.940
 I exercise tension upwards I introduce 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:11.900
 the attention verse introduces 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.900
 style 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.280
 let's stretch hard to go in a heaven 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.120
 and the stretch now let's do what 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.120
 same with the opposite side 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.630
 the other sides, let's remember 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.630
 to mit on the first point on one side 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.440
 and the other is pulling sideways has 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.550
 arrived and we started 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.550
 and put the rest 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.190
 easily when it costs more work 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.400
 is when we are doing the second 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.660
 part of the other side that is stretching with 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.210
 force 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.639
 here we go see what I said in this 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.229
 case as the fabric frays if not 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:12.500
 Let's leave enough space 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.570
 tell him would throw a lot then 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.340
 you always have to leave a lot of cloth in 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.520
 this case I had a little more 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.350
 short on one side and this fabric if you tend 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.930
 fray a lot but good what 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.280
 I want to show you how I'm doing 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.280
 allocating really strong 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 this 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:45.590
 and everything I told you I want 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.930
 see how here 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.810
 the fabric is very close to the edge and is 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.780
 a fabric that frays then this 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.470
 this should not happen to you here 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.870
 must go through they should try to get them 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.760
 over enough cloth so that they are not 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.370
 fray and the number now I'm going to 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.320
 damage your work good how good that we 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.840
 it happened so that they see what does not owe them 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.200
 pass and finally look like fabric 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.240
 it must be well stretched 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.240
 it was well stretched in the frame 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.070
 these racks are very easy to 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.590
 get them can send them to do with 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.560
 a carpenter only have these 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.120
 characteristics and if they can not 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.250
