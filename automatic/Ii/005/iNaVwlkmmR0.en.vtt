00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.189
 sometimes 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.960
 the technique itself also fails you or there is 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:13.780
 floor accidents 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.250
 slippery to be so safe 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.849
 for when you read cenart it's mostly 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.510
 when the classics are 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.670
 perfect 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.470
 we go academically perfect 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.630
 but I think that more than that is to do 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.369
 that perfect and the emotional part that 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.750
 it has to be 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.310
 there can not be a failure 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.940
 simply one size 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.940
 things 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.969
 a misstep to give power to the hand 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.960
 dancer twelve floors and in hand 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:58.870
 totally broke the emotional thing 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.870
 Sometimes the human becomes 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.539
 is totally superior there is failure in 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.820
 that second you 're not painting and what 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:11.030
 retouch if you correct it again when 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.180
 you saw them a sublime night is but as 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.979
 that is not unrepeatable and surely 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.390
 is unrepeatable because that's why they are 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.010
 moments 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.950
 first you have to have the preparation 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.470
 daily of the class that is the morning as 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.590
 breakfast but you have to mold 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.550
 heat and repeat exercises 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.550
 high fatigue 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.040
 two-hour stage and the starter 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.670
 the attention of standing in the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.310
 scenario is a training to be done more 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.830
 revolts that it is clean to pass it 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.409
 back up and fall with the other 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.570
 more than that instead of 16 times 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.500
 of turn 32 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.990
 or 45 and that's a resistance that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.510
 if you are tired turning and turning 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.740
 how can you convey one thing 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.340
 emotional when you're with a 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.920
 concentration of an athlete why but 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.429
 the preparation for me comes from the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.290
 first day that is not only that the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.290
 says stretched blah 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.709
 control 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.709
 from the ribs to the shoulders the turn 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.940
 to the head and all the preparation that the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.940
 teacher also gives you 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.780
 absorbing there 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.540
 an artist because if it does not an artist 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.730
 you have to read as a first step the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.270
 work to know at the time that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.130
 elapses 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.020
 the time was the time because it was used 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.660
 Long dress short dress is not 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.430
 only that as was the society of the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.800
 era because this was punished or 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.800
 failed and that is not 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.080
 social functions the artist can not 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.040
 go out and do only the technique has 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.730
 have an idea 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.670
 strong an idea a very strong idea of 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.150
 what is dancing if you slip very 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.069
 simple is a peasant who falls in love 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 a person who is noble are those 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.290
 social conventions of the era 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.110
 impossible 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.810
 we want to bloom and fragile 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.930
 in your health 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.709
 so as I give this error I am a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.090
 girl in love with a fragile health already 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.599
 his veto that according to the variations 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.720
 difficult that I have to have a 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.970
 technique equis and this then life food 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.300
 waldo are joke what I tell you but 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.790
 but to understand is good that those of is that 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.390
 you are there in walking always by the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.390
 final 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.830
 dancer creativity and has in how 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.260
 executed 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.690
 where where shmatkó accentuates they make the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.970
 same choreography and give an accent to 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.670
 a phrase 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.130
 or checkpoints here or the long ones beyond 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.090
 faster and is this a bit your 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.330
 creativity as you feel what 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.600
 not exactly know the idea but 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.780
 you can also make a small 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.680
 only the step portion can not be changed 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:38.240
 but you move in a musical sense 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.490
 different more like about one water or more 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.650
 over fire at certain times 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.440
 why are 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.849
 and how are you going to shake hands with the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.869
 dance 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:52.050
 to take it if it's going to be more compact or 

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:53.580
 it's going to be softer 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.139
 at the same time musical that the game 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.770
 there will be cut 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.280
 not what you can not change 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.080
 dancer 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.480
 creativity is the emotional thing and 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.720
 how 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.410
 to crash or transmit to me the thing 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.410
 musical 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.270
 in that medium that the public 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.460
 not only the fighter 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.900
 in the big stars is that there is a 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.900
 power 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.790
 to go through with that which is not is not the part 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.790
 good technique plisétskaya giving them 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.780
 and when the curtain rises there is a 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.780
 fast 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.200
 a bull that gets up and discovers his 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.200
 security 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.910
 the music starts very strong 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.480
 believing let's say and in the head everything is 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.800
 is raising that woman is standing there 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.680
 down but the feeling that one receives 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.449
 the one that got bull and ran away with his 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.069
 head up was a projection 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.069
 without making any movement 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.199
 the emotional wife 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.390
 Here I am active and start dancing 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.650
 with a little chicken skin because 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.240
 but if it did not do anything in fact people 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:21.050
 I applauded 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.050
 golden men of that magnetic thing 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.740
 enter the stage and capture all 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.500
 an audience where I felt that 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.500
 breathe there is a cough that there is no 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:41.630
 and makes him a great artist 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.630
 a great dancer are these things
