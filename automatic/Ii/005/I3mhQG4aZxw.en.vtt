00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.260 
lobsters that's really good for food
in<00:02:10.220> your<00:02:10.369> first<00:02:10.550> few<00:02:10.820> levels<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.420> ranging<00:02:13.270> one

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
in your first few levels of ranging one

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.120 
in your first few levels of ranging one
to<00:02:14.390> 40<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.780> would<00:02:15.020> recommend<00:02:15.440> bronze<00:02:15.740> or<00:02:15.980> higher

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
to 40 I would recommend bronze or higher

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.120 
to 40 I would recommend bronze or higher
knives<00:02:16.430> because<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.300> really<00:02:17.480> fast<00:02:17.720> XP<00:02:18.260> and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
knives because it's really fast XP and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.190 
knives because it's really fast XP and
you<00:02:19.250> could<00:02:19.400> do<00:02:19.490> Slayer<00:02:19.820> with<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.420> too<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.110> you

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
you could do Slayer with that too so you

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.370 
you could do Slayer with that too so you
can<00:02:21.260> hit<00:02:21.410> pretty<00:02:21.650> well<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.100> fast<00:02:23.350> right<00:02:24.350> now
