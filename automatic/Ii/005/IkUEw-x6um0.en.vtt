I've got up on the screen right now is
two<00:00:29.980> different<00:00:30.339> waves<00:00:30.519> pedal<00:00:30.999> boards<00:00:31.359> with<00:00:32.079> a

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
two different waves pedal boards with a

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.390 
two different waves pedal boards with a
bunch<00:00:32.349> of<00:00:32.470> different<00:00:32.710> waves<00:00:32.890> things<00:00:33.190> so<00:00:33.310> I'm

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
bunch of different waves things so I'm

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.970 
bunch of different waves things so I'm
gonna<00:00:33.550> go<00:00:33.760> through<00:00:33.790> all<00:00:34.000> of<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.660> waves<00:00:35.500> pedals

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
gonna go through all of the waves pedals

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.700 
gonna go through all of the waves pedals
some<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.780> icao<00:00:37.780> multimedia<00:00:38.230> AmpliTube

you how to string kind of multiple

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.939 
you how to string kind of multiple
effects<00:00:57.670> together<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.899> series<00:00:59.379> with<00:00:59.589> guitar

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
effects together in series with guitar

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.189 
effects together in series with guitar
amps<00:01:00.309> not<00:01:00.579> necessarily<00:01:01.269> pedals<00:01:01.719> more<00:01:02.019> like

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
amps not necessarily pedals more like

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.259 
amps not necessarily pedals more like
regular<00:01:02.620> plug-in<00:01:03.129> style<00:01:03.460> effects<00:01:03.789> on<00:01:03.969> guitar

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
regular plug-in style effects on guitar

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.120 
regular plug-in style effects on guitar
amps<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.900> also<00:01:05.199> I'm<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.560> show<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:05.830> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
amps and also I'm going to show you the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.090 
amps and also I'm going to show you the
difference<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:06.640> tone<00:01:07.180> so<00:01:08.020> some<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.070> other

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
difference in tone so some of the other

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.130 
difference in tone so some of the other
tutorials<00:01:09.400> have<00:01:09.939> really<00:01:10.240> gone<00:01:10.390> over<00:01:10.420> how<00:01:11.079> to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
tutorials have really gone over how to

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.710 
tutorials have really gone over how to
manipulate<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.860> amplifiers<00:01:12.400> themselves<00:01:13.150> but

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
manipulate the amplifiers themselves but

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.690 
manipulate the amplifiers themselves but
I'm<00:01:13.869> going<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.259> show<00:01:14.439> you<00:01:14.579> briefly<00:01:15.579> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
I'm going to show you briefly the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.210 
I'm going to show you briefly the
difference<00:01:16.119> that<00:01:16.630> just<00:01:17.290> changing<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.860> pickup

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
difference that just changing the pickup

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.090 
difference that just changing the pickup
on<00:01:18.399> your<00:01:18.579> guitar<00:01:18.759> can<00:01:19.720> drastically<00:01:20.470> have<00:01:20.740> a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
on your guitar can drastically have a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.249 
on your guitar can drastically have a
difference<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.880> tone<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.630> what<00:01:23.140> you're

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
difference in the tone of what you're

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.260 
difference in the tone of what you're
going<00:01:23.470> for<00:01:23.770> with<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.130> amp<00:01:24.280> sim<00:01:24.610> or<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.939> pedal

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
going for with the amp sim or the pedal

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.780 
going for with the amp sim or the pedal
or<00:01:25.450> whatever<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.950> that's<00:01:27.130> gonna<00:01:27.310> be<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.520> main

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
or whatever so that's gonna be the main

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
or whatever so that's gonna be the main
gist<00:01:28.060> of<00:01:28.270> this<00:01:28.509> let<00:01:28.750> me<00:01:28.780> dig<00:01:29.110> right<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:30.810> let's

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
gist of this let me dig right in let's

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.120 
gist of this let me dig right in let's
see<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:34.119> this<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:35.500> little<00:01:35.710> picking

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
see so I have this a just little picking

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.290 
see so I have this a just little picking
pattern<00:01:36.490> going<00:01:36.670> on

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300 

nothing<00:01:42.300> fancy<00:01:42.680> I'm<00:01:43.680> gonna<00:01:43.890> start<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
nothing fancy I'm gonna start with the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.880 
nothing fancy I'm gonna start with the
waves<00:01:44.520> pedals<00:01:45.170> basically<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.230> have<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
waves pedals basically I have this just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.370 
waves pedals basically I have this just
copied<00:01:47.310> four<00:01:47.520> times<00:01:47.930> it's<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.080> four

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
copied four times it's not four

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.310 
copied four times it's not four
different<00:01:49.680> parts<00:01:50.840> because<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.900> wanted<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> show

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
you several different chains with it

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.940 
you several different chains with it
first<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.380> uh<00:01:56.330> here<00:01:57.330> we<00:01:57.420> go

first is uh here we go
so<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.280> waves<00:01:59.640> guitar<00:02:00.090> amp

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.670 

nice<00:02:11.610> clean<00:02:12.030> basic<00:02:12.540> tone<00:02:12.750> nothing<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.380> it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
nice clean basic tone nothing to it

nice clean basic tone nothing to it
I'm<00:02:13.770> not<00:02:13.980> trying<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.340> show<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.640> amps<00:02:15.050> let's<00:02:16.050> go

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
I'm not trying to show you amps let's go

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.320 
I'm not trying to show you amps let's go
to<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.320> first<00:02:16.500> pedal<00:02:16.950> board<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.760> waves<00:02:18.060> has<00:02:18.300> a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
to the first pedal board so waves has a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.410 
to the first pedal board so waves has a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.610 

one<00:03:17.790> word<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.150> note<00:03:18.330> it's<00:03:19.020> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.380> hard<00:03:19.560> to

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
one word of note it's kind of hard to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.580 
one word of note it's kind of hard to
see<00:03:19.920> maybe<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.610> your<00:03:20.730> screen<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.410> only
