a big ripoff but unlike many others and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.220 
a big ripoff but unlike many others and
try<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> replicate<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.340> sonic<00:00:59.670> formula<00:01:00.230> this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

but<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.160> said<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.489> game<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.790> actually<00:02:18.940> good

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
but so I said this game is actually good

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.390 
but so I said this game is actually good
and<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.690> found<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.080> secret<00:02:20.500> exit<00:02:20.650> which<00:02:21.069> I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and we found the secret exit which I

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.590 
and we found the secret exit which I
don't<00:02:21.730> know<00:02:21.850> if<00:02:21.940> it<00:02:22.030> actually<00:02:22.120> does<00:02:22.390> anything

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
don't know if it actually does anything

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.280 
don't know if it actually does anything
I<00:02:24.270> might<00:02:25.270> be<00:02:25.390> able<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.569> get<00:02:25.660> two<00:02:25.810> levels<00:02:26.140> in

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
I might be able to get two levels in

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.699 
I might be able to get two levels in
here

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
here

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.780 
here
well<00:02:27.310> two<00:02:27.910> whole<00:02:28.180> areas<00:02:29.489> stages<00:02:30.489> aren't<00:02:30.640> that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
well two whole areas stages aren't that

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.830 
well two whole areas stages aren't that
long<00:02:31.000> they<00:02:31.600> get<00:02:31.780> longer<00:02:32.410> as<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.650> go<00:02:32.890> but<00:02:33.280> I

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
long they get longer as you go but I

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.339 
long they get longer as you go but I
love<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> music<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.470> stage<00:02:36.690> whoa

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:47.719 
life meter something sonic didn't have

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.080 
life meter something sonic didn't have
we<00:02:48.319> don't<00:02:48.499> lose<00:02:48.709> all<00:02:48.980> these<00:02:49.129> gems<00:02:49.519> we<00:02:49.760> collect

platform<00:04:20.690> animations<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:21.890> Sonic<00:04:22.280> would<00:04:22.460> have

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
platform animations in Sonic would have

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.020 
platform animations in Sonic would have

oh and I died anyway and unfortunately I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.560 
oh and I died anyway and unfortunately I
didn't<00:04:37.250> find<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.490> midpoint<00:04:37.670> so<00:04:38.240> we<00:04:38.360> have<00:04:38.480> to

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
didn't find a midpoint so we have to

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.800 
didn't find a midpoint so we have to
start<00:04:38.810> all<00:04:39.260> over<00:04:39.290> again

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
start all over again

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
start all over again
although<00:04:41.810> this<00:04:41.900> stage<00:04:42.200> is<00:04:42.380> actually<00:04:42.500> pretty

why<00:05:16.610> I<00:05:17.590> think<00:05:18.590> it's<00:05:18.830> just<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.100> shape<00:05:19.280> of<00:05:19.430> the

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
why I think it's just the shape of the

jumping on one of these planes here we
go<00:05:29.620> even<00:05:30.620> with<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.950> jump<00:05:32.440> jumping<00:05:33.440> running

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
go even with the jump jumping running

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.350 
go even with the jump jumping running
boots<00:05:34.190> whatever<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.730> servo<00:05:34.940> state<00:05:35.180> should<00:05:35.330> be

he's<00:05:38.300> kind<00:05:38.510> of<00:05:38.570> got<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.720> pathetic<00:05:39.140> jump<00:05:39.410> but<00:05:39.650> he

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
he's kind of got a pathetic jump but he

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.210 
he's kind of got a pathetic jump but he
is<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.280> seal<00:05:41.050> I'm<00:05:42.050> guessing<00:05:42.440> jumping<00:05:42.830> isn't<00:05:42.980> his

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
is a seal I'm guessing jumping isn't his

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:54.240 
is a seal I'm guessing jumping isn't his
strong<00:05:43.520> point<00:05:47.650> let's<00:05:48.650> take<00:05:48.890> the<00:05:48.980> bottom<00:05:49.100> route

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.440 

hoping<00:05:55.250> I<00:05:55.310> can<00:05:55.370> make<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:55.730> the<00:05:55.850> food<00:05:56.090> before<00:05:56.420> I

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
hoping I can make to the food before I

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.930 
hoping I can make to the food before I
die<00:05:56.540> again

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.370 

I<00:06:00.000> don't<00:06:00.780> know<00:06:00.960> if<00:06:01.170> those<00:06:02.300> items<00:06:03.300> stack<00:06:04.020> and

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
I don't know if those items stack and

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.440 
I don't know if those items stack and
give<00:06:04.560> you<00:06:04.710> multiple<00:06:05.220> boosts<00:06:05.790> or<00:06:06.000> if<00:06:06.120> it's<00:06:06.270> just

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
give you multiple boosts or if it's just

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
one be nice if you got multiple jump

one be nice if you got multiple jump
boots<00:06:09.840> actually<00:06:10.440> whoa<00:06:11.420> all<00:06:12.420> right<00:06:12.480> here<00:06:12.720> we<00:06:12.810> go

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200

boots actually whoa all right here we go
I<00:06:15.110> believe<00:06:16.110> that<00:06:16.290> roll<00:06:16.560> actually<00:06:16.950> does<00:06:17.130> damage

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
I believe that roll actually does damage

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.190 
I believe that roll actually does damage
maybe<00:06:19.680> we<00:06:19.830> won't<00:06:19.980> get<00:06:20.100> two<00:06:20.280> stages<00:06:20.610> in<00:06:21.200> already

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
maybe we won't get two stages in already

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.970 
maybe we won't get two stages in already
the<00:06:22.350> first<00:06:22.560> boss<00:06:22.770> though<00:06:23.070> and<00:06:23.540> oh<00:06:24.540> dear<00:06:24.980> it's

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
the first boss though and oh dear it's

the first boss though and oh dear it's
captain<00:06:26.490> Bernardo<00:06:27.030> is<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.450> first<00:06:27.690> box<00:06:27.990> which

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
captain Bernardo is the first box which

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.580 
captain Bernardo is the first box which
is<00:06:29.360> really<00:06:30.360> it<00:06:30.600> makes<00:06:30.780> it<00:06:30.930> simply<00:06:31.170> the<00:06:31.290> games<00:06:31.500> a

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
is really it makes it simply the games a

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.450 
is really it makes it simply the games a
lot<00:06:31.740> shorter<00:06:31.980> than<00:06:32.130> it<00:06:32.310> is<00:06:32.430> ouch<00:06:34.310> the<00:06:35.310> hit

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
lot shorter than it is ouch the hit

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.190 
lot shorter than it is ouch the hit
detection<00:06:35.580> in<00:06:35.970> this<00:06:36.090> game<00:06:36.300> is<00:06:36.660> probably<00:06:37.080> the

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
detection in this game is probably the

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.730 
detection in this game is probably the
worst<00:06:37.640> aspect<00:06:38.640> of<00:06:38.790> it<00:06:39.350> everything<00:06:40.350> else<00:06:40.530> is

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
worst aspect of it everything else is

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.920 
worst aspect of it everything else is
pretty<00:06:40.920> solid<00:06:41.340> but<00:06:41.490> the<00:06:41.670> hit<00:06:42.270> detection<00:06:42.540> on

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
pretty solid but the hit detection on

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.430 
pretty solid but the hit detection on
this<00:06:43.110> kick<00:06:43.410> is<00:06:43.590> just<00:06:43.620> not<00:06:44.100> good<00:06:45.020> it's<00:06:46.020> probably

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
this kick is just not good it's probably

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.810 
this kick is just not good it's probably
just<00:06:46.500> the<00:06:46.620> way<00:06:46.770> he<00:06:46.860> half<00:06:46.980> the<00:06:47.100> time<00:06:47.340> it<00:06:47.550> that<00:06:47.700> it

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
just the way he half the time it that it

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.130 
just the way he half the time it that it
makes<00:06:47.940> it<00:06:48.090> seem<00:06:48.270> like<00:06:48.450> it's<00:06:48.600> bad<00:06:48.810> but<00:06:49.050> it

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
makes it seem like it's bad but it

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.190 
makes it seem like it's bad but it
doesn't<00:06:49.440> work<00:06:49.530> that<00:06:49.590> well<00:06:49.890> to<00:06:50.130> be<00:06:50.280> honest<00:06:51.200> at

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
doesn't work that well to be honest at

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.780 
doesn't work that well to be honest at
least<00:06:52.380> not<00:06:52.560> on<00:06:52.590> bosses<00:06:53.160> on<00:06:53.280> regular<00:06:53.640> enemies

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
least not on bosses on regular enemies

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.110 
least not on bosses on regular enemies
it<00:06:54.120> seems<00:06:54.300> to<00:06:54.390> do<00:06:54.510> okay<00:06:54.920> and<00:06:55.920> getting<00:06:56.850> hit<00:06:57.000> with

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
it seems to do okay and getting hit with

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.540 
it seems to do okay and getting hit with
his<00:06:57.300> sword<00:06:57.780> there<00:06:58.050> will<00:06:58.410> do<00:06:58.650> I<00:06:59.040> think<00:06:59.250> about

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
his sword there will do I think about

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.390 
his sword there will do I think about
half<00:06:59.910> of<00:07:00.120> your<00:07:00.270> life<00:07:00.390> bar<00:07:00.950> and<00:07:01.950> then<00:07:02.070> it<00:07:02.190> seems

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
half of your life bar and then it seems

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.800 
half of your life bar and then it seems
like<00:07:02.490> it<00:07:02.580> drains<00:07:02.940> about<00:07:03.090> half<00:07:03.450> of<00:07:03.630> whatever

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
like it drains about half of whatever

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.790 
like it drains about half of whatever
you<00:07:04.050> have<00:07:04.230> left

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.170 

this<00:07:09.800> isn't<00:07:10.100> too<00:07:10.250> hard<00:07:10.280> he<00:07:10.640> does<00:07:10.820> get<00:07:11.030> more
