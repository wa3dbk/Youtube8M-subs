00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.650
 living from all this absence to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.240
 I thank you tonight for the presence of 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.820
 Mr. Emilio Azcárraga President of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.190
 Television group emilio a first 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.040
 Comment on the death of Roberto Gómez 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.720
 bolaños please 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.619
 Well, here is what I can tell you 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.240
 very sad because roberto 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.250
 regardless of the importance in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710
 the working part and the characters wanted 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.110
 to be a great friend of mine was a great friend 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 from my father a great friend of televisa and 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.520
 obviously it leaves us a very 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.260
 deep to the whole azcárraga family and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.930
 Obviously by this means also 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 send a very affectionate hug to all 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.730
 all the families of Roberto and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 obviously good as an icon of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.019
 global television because nothing 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.780
 in Mexico in the Spanish-speaking world 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.549
 but in many sides he gave a lot 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.479
 happiness and many thanks to many 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:54.000
 people 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.630
 emilio puerto aged you grew up with the guy 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 of eight ' and with chespirito 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.710
 and now I literally grew up with 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.780
 them for the television part and 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.010
 then for the part of knowing it 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.050
 personally and apart that robert aras 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.850
 of the birthday of February 21 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.070
 I then we agreed on that that 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.810
 we agreed on the bird in the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.510
 Americanism that as you know I had it 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.880
 then yes yes as tenure is a 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.830
 hollow because there was a lot more relationship 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.590
 that an employment relationship by loving him and 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.630
 obviously since I was a child to 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.000
 all my childhood and all my youth because what 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.150
 said all the characters if you what 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 you went from seeing it on the screen to 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.229
 treat him as a friend 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.329
 and there was definitely an excellent 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.909
 relationship there is an excellent relationship with 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.270
 his whole family and the truth as I say 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.909
 that's part of the artistic history of 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.299
 this country and obviously is a pillar and a 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.770
 icon of Mexican television of 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.140
 export we have not seen that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 obviously in many parts of the world today 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.189
 there is great sadness for everything that we 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.659
 he left roberto with that one and with that 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.119
 creativity so great that I had the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.149
 white humor does not always come to 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.740
 these to this complicated difficult comedy 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.280
 because as you know it is much more difficult 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.710
 make white comedy and I think it leaves us 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.510
 so many, many, many hours 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.610
 of recording these programs that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.590
 they will surely continue for many years 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.840
 amusing many people of the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.700
 new generations tell me emilio you 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.980
 Last encounter what you remember about your 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.670
 last encounter with roberto gómez 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.340
 Bolaños I spoke relatively recently 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.130
 with him but he always had details 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.440
 with my children as with me and I the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.810
 truth is 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.190
 until the end he always had the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.560
 perfect mind and always had the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.930
 bold comment and good comment 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.660
 to make you a better day then I'll 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.230
 I carry effectively in the heart as 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.050
 a great person is not roberto was a 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.360
 good person and we will remember him 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.160
 always like that not through its programs 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.780
 and also all the memories that we 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.880
 she left family friends 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.250
 so that the ones of these thousand I remember the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.140
 tribute that you organize in the auditorium 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.870
 national that maybe was the last 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.420
 public appearance of chespirito de la 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.610
 verda gómez bolaños and it was a tribute 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.240
 that would be outside the national auditorium if 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.240
 remember there were dances and there was a 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.950
 series of competitions throughout 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.330
 latin america with all the worlds of 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.550
 Spanish speaking including brasilia 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.560
 Portuguese for all the success it has 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.380
 It was a way to give her a 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.200
 homage in life to an amazing person 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.930
 not a great author to a great writer to 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.010
 a great musician 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.010
 and obviously it is 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.980
 a great icon of the power of the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.650
 television that leaves us today but we 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.450
 leaves fortunately with the magic of 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.000
 digital dvd platforms 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.560
 etcetera leaves us with many pretty 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.080
 memories that we can continue reliving 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.840
 how many times do we want it to finally be 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.090
 the magic of television maybe dies 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.390
 the man but the character remains for 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.310
 forever 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.350
 if we have seen it with great characters 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.330
 of the television movie of mexico and 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.090
 today without a doubt it will be one of the 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.160
 bigger well emilio because this 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.100
 pressure that nobody gets the wrong of that 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.500
 call to recover this memory of 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.760
 roberto gómez bolaños thank you very much 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.760
 paragraph they want hug
