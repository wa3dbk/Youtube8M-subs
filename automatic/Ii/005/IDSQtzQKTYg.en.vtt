00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.230 
was just like way too long so I had to
trim<00:01:42.080> off<00:01:42.200> about<00:01:42.440> four<00:01:42.770> inches<00:01:43.220> which<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:43.970> think

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
trim off about four inches which I think

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.930 
trim off about four inches which I think
