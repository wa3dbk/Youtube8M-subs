from our table but you can see it moves
much<00:02:04.549> faster<00:02:04.579> than<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.209> human<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:05.719> much<00:02:06.200> more

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
much faster than a human and much more

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.200 
much faster than a human and much more
accurate<00:02:06.829> to

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.910 

we<00:02:12.210> could<00:02:12.360> also<00:02:12.480> use<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.750> file<00:02:13.020> template<00:02:13.530> to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
we could also use a file template to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
we could also use a file template to
increase<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.550> speed<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.000> process<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
increase the speed of this process and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.570 
increase the speed of this process and
reduce<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.140> scripting<00:02:16.560> time<00:02:16.740> for

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
reduce the scripting time for

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.160 
reduce the scripting time for
demonstration<00:02:17.700> purposes<00:02:18.570> we'll<00:02:18.810> save<00:02:19.020> that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
demonstration purposes we'll save that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.770 
demonstration purposes we'll save that
for<00:02:19.410> another<00:02:19.440> video
