00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.099
 today on the example of printer epson stoc 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.960
 c20 os x 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.199
 I will show how to read it wash and forehead 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 principle is the same model everywhere 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:32.690
 the lid is also removed unscrewed latches here 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:37.820
 I will show you how you say everything 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:43.579
 here itâ€™s the same here 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:47.360
 understand the principle of the model was very much 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.840
 it was necessary to them in different ways 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.270
 all almost shiny things this design 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.600
 speed 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:05.299
 electronics head on to where it was washed 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:12.260
 whom we remove the cartridge cover has 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:12.260
 such gave black color 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.220
 there were models for three others 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.729
 but the principle of the game is the same everywhere 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:30.290
 here is this nest 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:34.800
 onion is apparently 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:39.420
 There is such a type of tube 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:57.020
 sucking pins but they need us 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:57.020
 rinse itself thats how we see it here 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:13.610
 our task is simple you by chance 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:19.700
 pick up by these four 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.700
 you can take the tubes 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.830
 Of course for what purposes you need to buy 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.870
 glove at the pharmacy 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.690
 2 2 you can usually use 1 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.260
 take pick up tubules 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.360
 any from to suffered they are different 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.700
 diameters I have already shown here first 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.990
 video there is a little bit another principle where 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.990
 smartly built 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.770
 You can of course and remove in principle 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.130
 let's get easier to shoot will not 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.560
 just take these tubes 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.250
 the diameter of these 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.250
 pins 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.500
 such can 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.870
 Miscellaneous din is the main thing that it fits 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.140
 they become 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.140
 over here 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.370
 so they get up 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:59.710
 these steel tubes have to be taken 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:06.250
 special liquid store here such 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:10.440
 sold it is universal we need 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.440
 buy red specifically for epson 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:19.620
 the demonstration doesn't matter 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.620
 show such buy liquid it 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:32.160
 I repeat once again red color 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:36.150
 syringe and any less more 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.150
 we collect this liquid 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:05:02.170
 and take turns pouring these tubes 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:06.670
 pour pour pour waiting still have one 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:12.900
 moment take a napkin or there a piece 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:20.470
 toilet paper doing this 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:30.900
 pad and try to put it here 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:34.740
 the wolf so we put it under a wolf and all 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.740
 recruit liquid 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:49.080
 the liquid we curl again I repeat 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.949
 red can be a universal ray of light 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:06:06.059
 since we turn all fill these tubes 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:06:10.020
 and dawn I left somewhere for days old 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:14.849
 and then it remains only to top us 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.909
 liquid these tubules are in line again 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.759
 I repeat the most convenient from droppers they 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:25.529
 there are different diameters of different diameters 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:29.479
 stiffness ball and now you already and greens and 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:32.490
 put a napkin and everything can wait until 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:35.339
 the head will break through then just add 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:40.680
 liquid change the napkin ceiling and 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:41.419
 and here on this principle so here 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.310
 the way 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:50.370
 need to recover but 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:52.529
 heads on epson printer well, two to visit 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.610
 if the case is not very serious, you can 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:58.189
 simpler over here instead of tubes 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.759
 put donuts there 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:03.449
 cotton wool cotton wool pour liquid 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.569
 flush 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:11.309
 and we just enclose everything 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:14.129
 swab of napkins and principle 

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:19.319
 is in this way can be rinsed well 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:21.899
 after all this when we change there 

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:26.099
 donuts here they stop 

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:28.399
 painted clear no naka on each 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:32.399
 tubule blue and red and black colors 

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:33.029
 yellow will pass only already clean 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.509
 liquid 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:38.870
 Nights head washed we put back to 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.870
 drills 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.760
 the most exact we dry more precisely we dry 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.800
 head 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:52.710
 Then of course is cost, she deftly 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:58.830
 Now you can sell back 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:08:01.910
 enjoy this video today on this 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.910
 today everything
