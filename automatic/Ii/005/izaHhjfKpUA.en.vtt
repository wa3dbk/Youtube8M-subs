z and xperia z ultra in this review we

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.000 
z and xperia z ultra in this review we
are<00:00:06.750> going<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.140> boot<00:00:07.350> up<00:00:07.500> these<00:00:07.680> devices

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
are going to boot up these devices

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339 
are going to boot up these devices
together<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.820> not<00:00:09.389> even<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:10.080> are<00:00:10.200> also

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
together and not even that we are also

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.440 
together and not even that we are also
going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.860> run<00:00:11.070> onto<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> benchmark<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.240> check

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
going to run onto the benchmark to check

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.680 
going to run onto the benchmark to check
CPU<00:00:12.900> gpn<00:00:13.320> rammus<00:00:13.740> course<00:00:14.120> we<00:00:15.120> will<00:00:15.269> also<00:00:15.420> try

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
CPU gpn rammus course we will also try

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.480 
CPU gpn rammus course we will also try
to<00:00:15.780> power<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.320> these<00:00:16.529> devices<00:00:16.770> together<00:00:17.130> to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to power of these devices together to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.740 
to power of these devices together to
see<00:00:17.670> which<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.359> power<00:00:18.660> up

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
see which one is going to power up

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.859 
see which one is going to power up
quickly<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.380> us<00:00:19.490> so<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.699> galaxy<00:00:21.270> note<00:00:21.420> 2<00:00:21.630> s<00:00:21.840> 3

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
quickly for us so like galaxy note 2 s 3

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.880 
quickly for us so like galaxy note 2 s 3
S<00:00:22.410> 4<00:00:22.820> we<00:00:23.820> don't<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.750> restart<00:00:25.320> option<00:00:25.710> in

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
S 4 we don't have a restart option in

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.040 
S 4 we don't have a restart option in
these<00:00:26.340> devices<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.240> wouldn<00:00:27.480> able<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.810> check

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
these devices so we wouldn able to check

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
these devices so we wouldn able to check
which<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.369> better<00:00:29.760> device<00:00:30.060> when<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.510> are

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
which one is a better device when we are

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.870 
which one is a better device when we are
trying<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> restart<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> system<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.579> will

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
trying to restart a system but we will

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.910 
trying to restart a system but we will
try<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.120> power<00:00:33.510> them<00:00:33.750> off<00:00:33.960> together<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.620> then

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
try to power them off together and then

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.530 
try to power them off together and then
we<00:00:35.100> will<00:00:35.219> boot<00:00:35.460> them<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.820> together<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.329> see

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
we will boot them up together to see

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.150 
we will boot them up together to see
which<00:00:36.719> one<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> quick<00:00:37.860> device<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> guys

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
which one is a quick device so guys

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160 
which one is a quick device so guys
let's<00:00:41.489> start<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.390> by<00:00:42.600> shutting<00:00:42.989> down

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
let's start this is you by shutting down

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.990 
let's start this is you by shutting down
these<00:00:43.410> devices<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.190> let's<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:44.879> is

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
these devices and let's see which one is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.340 
these devices and let's see which one is
going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> shut<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:45.570> quickly<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.320> us<00:00:51.350> so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
going to shut down quickly for us so

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.729 
going to shut down quickly for us so
here<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.079> witness<00:01:01.410> that

here we go so here you can witness that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
here we go so here you can witness that
xperia<00:01:02.219> z<00:01:02.280> ultra<00:01:02.430> has<00:01:03.120> shut<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:03.660> quickly

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
xperia z ultra has shut it down quickly

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
xperia z ultra has shut it down quickly
for<00:01:04.290> us<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> comparison<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> XP<00:01:05.729> Ozzy<00:01:08.570> now<00:01:09.570> we

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
for us in comparison to XP Ozzy now we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.120 
for us in comparison to XP Ozzy now we
are<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.260> boot<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.590> these<00:01:10.799> devices

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
are going to boot up these devices

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
are going to boot up these devices
together<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
together to see which one is going to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.830 
together to see which one is going to
boot<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.229> quickly<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.830> us<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> press

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
boot up quickly for us so when you press

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
boot up quickly for us so when you press
power<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.560> off<00:01:19.619> key<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:19.979> both<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> these

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
power on and off key on both of these

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
power on and off key on both of these
devices<00:01:21.200> xperia<00:01:22.200> z<00:01:22.380> ultra<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
devices xperia z ultra is going to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:40.010 
devices xperia z ultra is going to
respond<00:01:23.820> quicker<00:01:24.240> than<00:01:24.540> xperia<00:01:25.409> z

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020 

so<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.050> think<00:01:41.230> XP<00:01:41.800> as<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.040> ultra<00:01:42.370> has<00:01:42.550> booted<00:01:42.820> up

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
so I think XP as the ultra has booted up

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.340 
so I think XP as the ultra has booted up
quickly<00:01:43.240> for<00:01:43.600> us<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.570> as<00:01:49.750> both<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.200> these

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
quickly for us so as both of these

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.000 
quickly for us so as both of these
devices<00:01:50.710> have<00:01:51.160> booted<00:01:52.120> up<00:01:52.360> both<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.560> them<00:01:53.740> are

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
devices have booted up both of them are

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.200 
devices have booted up both of them are
ready<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.430> get<00:01:54.610> into<00:01:54.850> an<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.840> do<00:01:55.930> benchmarking

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.480 

so<00:02:01.210> let's<00:02:01.479> start<00:02:01.900> our<00:02:02.050> test<00:02:02.229> guys<00:02:02.560> without

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
so let's start our test guys without

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:12.660 
so let's start our test guys without
wasting<00:02:03.729> any<00:02:04.000> time<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.860> here<00:02:09.009> we<00:02:09.039> go<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.430> will

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
wasting any time so here we go so I will

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.640 
wasting any time so here we go so I will
be<00:02:12.700> back<00:02:12.910> when<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.270> will<00:02:13.510> get<00:02:13.690> results<00:02:14.020> from<00:02:14.380> and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
be back when I will get results from and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.170 
be back when I will get results from and
an<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> benchmark<00:02:17.610> now<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:18.970> got<00:02:19.150> a
