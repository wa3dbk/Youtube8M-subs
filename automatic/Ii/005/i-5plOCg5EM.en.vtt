00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
to the white side do you capture right

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.410

away or do you just allow it to remain
closed<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:17.010> an<00:02:17.519> f5<00:02:17.970> move<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.390> coming<00:02:18.569> up

closed and then an f5 move is coming up
very<00:02:19.080> soon<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.220> we<00:02:20.250> would<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.670> at<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
very soon and we would have at that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.670 
very soon and we would have at that
point<00:02:22.050> then

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
point then

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.860 
point then
a<00:02:22.709> position<00:02:23.370> very<00:02:23.730> reminiscent<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.480> Kings

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
a position very reminiscent to a Kings

Indian<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:26.069> it's<00:02:26.879> not<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.269> easy<00:02:27.540> for<00:02:28.040> white<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
Indian but it's not so easy for white to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.649

make progress on the Queen side and

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.970 
make progress on the Queen side and
that's<00:02:30.780> what<00:02:31.019> typically<00:02:31.440> would<00:02:31.560> happen<00:02:32.159> if

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
that's what typically would happen if

having f5 what's one one thing that's
worthwhile<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.129> note<00:03:23.370> is<00:03:23.579> if<00:03:24.060> g4<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.959> played<00:03:25.230> in

worthwhile to note is if g4 is played in

worthwhile to note is if g4 is played in
Knight<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.769> f4<00:03:26.159> it<00:03:26.310> seems<00:03:26.549> very<00:03:26.790> cozy<00:03:27.299> right

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
Knight to f4 it seems very cozy right

Knight to f4 it seems very cozy right
here<00:03:27.630> but<00:03:27.810> after<00:03:28.019> Queen<00:03:28.260> d2<00:03:28.880> there's<00:03:29.880> no<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
here but after Queen d2 there's no the

here but after Queen d2 there's no the
knight<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.900> clearly<00:03:31.200> running<00:03:31.620> short<00:03:31.889> on

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
knight is clearly running short on

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.430 
knight is clearly running short on
squares<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.669> so<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:32.910> move<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.239> g5<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.139> now

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
squares and so I move like g5 is now

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.770 
squares and so I move like g5 is now
becomes<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.950> necessity<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:36.209> keep<00:03:36.419> in<00:03:36.569> mind

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
becomes a necessity but keep in mind

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.300 
becomes a necessity but keep in mind
that<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.109> is<00:03:37.169> not<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.709> advanced<00:03:38.010> black

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
that this is not the advanced black

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.940 
that this is not the advanced black
wants<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.700> get<00:03:38.849> in<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.959> f5<00:03:40.349> advance<00:03:40.739> but

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
wants to get in it's the f5 advance but

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.190 
wants to get in it's the f5 advance but
that's<00:03:41.099> completely<00:03:41.549> ruled<00:03:41.910> out<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.389> because

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
that's completely ruled out and because

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.199 
that's completely ruled out and because
f5<00:03:43.620> cannot<00:03:44.069> be<00:03:44.250> played<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.730> Bishop<00:03:45.090> is

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
f5 cannot be played this Bishop is

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.050 
f5 cannot be played this Bishop is
essentially<00:03:45.720> biting<00:03:46.049> on<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.169> rock<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.700> this<00:03:47.940> is

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
essentially biting on a rock so this is

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.759 
essentially biting on a rock so this is
not<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.450> direction<00:03:48.599> black<00:03:49.109> wants<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.470> go<00:03:49.590> and

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
not the direction black wants to go and

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.520 
not the direction black wants to go and
yes<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.220> has<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.400> nice<00:03:50.760> nicely<00:03:51.720> placed<00:03:52.109> Knight

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
yes it has a nice nicely placed Knight

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.759 
yes it has a nice nicely placed Knight
on<00:03:52.680> f4<00:03:53.220> but<00:03:53.430> beyond<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.879> it's<00:03:54.599> not<00:03:55.260> good<00:03:55.560> in

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
on f4 but beyond that it's not good in
