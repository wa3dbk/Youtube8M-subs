we develop like your fuel we were

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
we develop like your fuel we were
looking<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.630> common<00:01:06.930> metric<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.590> made<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
looking for a common metric that made it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530 
looking for a common metric that made it
easier<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.430> anyone<00:01:08.850> who's<00:01:09.000> active<00:01:09.390> to
