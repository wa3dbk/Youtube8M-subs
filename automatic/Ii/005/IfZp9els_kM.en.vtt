bandwidth of how much you know is going

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
bandwidth of how much you know is going
in<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.860> house<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:09.090> that's<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
in now from your house so that's that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.280 
in now from your house so that's that
could<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.110> number<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.070> reason<00:01:11.960> but<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> most

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
could be number one reason but the most

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.219 
could be number one reason but the most
likely<00:01:13.710> reason<00:01:14.150> why<00:01:15.150> you're<00:01:15.450> lagging<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
likely reason why you're lagging and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.399 
likely reason why you're lagging and
this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> no<00:01:17.340> fault<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.820> infinity<00:01:18.360> word<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.810> mean

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
this is no fault of infinity word I mean

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.039 
this is no fault of infinity word I mean
you<00:01:19.560> they<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:20.009> only<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.610> much<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.240> mean<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
you they can only do so much I mean you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.830 
you they can only do so much I mean you
can<00:01:22.259> only<00:01:22.530> program<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.720> software<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:26.040> pick<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
can only program the software to pick a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.600 
can only program the software to pick a
person<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.759> time<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> good<00:01:31.380> host

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
person that at the time is a good host

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
person that at the time is a good host
meaning<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.759> their<00:01:32.909> connection<00:01:33.390> flows

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
meaning that their connection flows

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.010 
meaning that their connection flows
really<00:01:33.930> well<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> packets

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
really well and you know the packets

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.760 
really well and you know the packets
coming<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.650> from<00:01:38.040> their<00:01:38.880> connection

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
coming in and out from their connection

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
coming in and out from their connection
well<00:01:40.770> here's<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> problem<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.689> run

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
well here's the problem that you run

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.499 
well here's the problem that you run
into<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.560> prime<00:01:44.220> time<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.850> mean<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.299> eight

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
into in prime time I mean like eight

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.109 
into in prime time I mean like eight
o'clock<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:46.799> anything<00:01:47.280> time<00:01:47.610> after<00:01:47.970> one

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
o'clock you know anything time after one

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.660 
o'clock you know anything time after one
o'clock<00:01:48.210> after<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> afternoon<00:01:49.710> here's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
o'clock after in the afternoon here's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.850 
o'clock after in the afternoon here's
the<00:01:50.729> problem<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> run<00:01:51.450> into<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:52.649> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the problem that you run into now this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.530 
the problem that you run into now this
specific<00:01:53.399> program<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.119> run<00:01:54.360> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
specific program that they run that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
specific program that they run that
picks<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> best<00:01:55.049> host<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:56.159> host<00:01:56.340> migration

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
picks the best host the host migration

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.959 
picks the best host the host migration
for<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> best<00:01:57.780> game<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.350> mean<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.490> has<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.850> be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
for the best game I mean this has to be

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.060 
for the best game I mean this has to be
in<00:02:00.090> real<00:02:00.299> time<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:01.409> because<00:02:01.680> here's<00:02:01.890> what

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
in real time here because here's what
