sixteen by nine or anything like that
the<00:03:02.650> only<00:03:02.769> thing<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.099> you<00:03:03.190> can<00:03:03.430> do<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.880> go<00:03:04.000> to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
the only thing that you can do is go to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.729 
the only thing that you can do is go to
your<00:03:04.180> screen<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.810> go<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.080> your<00:03:05.200> screen<00:03:05.410> size

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
your screen is go to your screen size

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.670 
your screen is go to your screen size
and<00:03:06.099> make<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:06.700> bigger<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:08.349> but<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.620> is

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
and make it bigger like this but this is

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.610 
and make it bigger like this but this is
way<00:03:08.860> too<00:03:08.920> small<00:03:09.280> for<00:03:09.340> me<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:11.049> can<00:03:11.500> like

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
way too small for me and you can like

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.979 
way too small for me and you can like
