00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
of the main character in a way where it

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.369 
of the main character in a way where it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
play the game and actually make them

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.430 
play the game and actually make them
complementary<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> each<00:00:54.480> other<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.020> keep<00:00:55.320> in

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
complementary to each other and keep in

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.869 
complementary to each other and keep in
mind<00:00:55.620> we've<00:00:55.829> had<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> long<00:00:56.550> time<00:00:56.850> but

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
mind we've had this for a long time but

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760 
mind we've had this for a long time but
it<00:00:57.149> was<00:00:57.180> purely<00:00:57.510> aesthetic<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.620> could

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it was purely aesthetic like you could

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.110 
it was purely aesthetic like you could
change<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.190> costume<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.879> change

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
change the costume you can change

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
change the costume you can change
weapons<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.379> no<00:01:01.500> real<00:01:01.649> stats

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
weapons but there was no real stats

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
weapons but there was no real stats
related<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.539> actually<00:01:03.660> are

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
related to them now there actually are

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.340 
related to them now there actually are
so<00:01:04.320> any<00:01:05.040> gear<00:01:05.970> element<00:01:06.360> has<00:01:06.540> an<00:01:06.900> actual

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so any gear element has an actual

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
so any gear element has an actual
purpose<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.340> gameplay<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.790> example<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
purpose for gameplay for example the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.780 
purpose for gameplay for example the
hood<00:01:09.470> will<00:01:10.470> make<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.830> blend<00:01:11.130> faster<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
hood will make you blend faster in a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.520 
hood will make you blend faster in a
crowd<00:01:12.000> belt<00:01:12.420> might<00:01:12.659> allow<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.140> carry<00:01:13.260> more

elements<00:02:26.240> in<00:02:26.360> AC<00:02:26.630> unity<00:02:27.350> in<00:02:27.680> my<00:02:27.980> opinion<00:02:28.310> it's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
elements in AC unity in my opinion it's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.670 
elements in AC unity in my opinion it's
not<00:02:28.790> really<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.210> much<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.630> big<00:02:29.870> deal<00:02:29.900> I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
not really that much of a big deal I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.350 
not really that much of a big deal I
like<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.130> they<00:02:31.280> are<00:02:31.430> restricting<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.210> a

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
like that they are restricting it to a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.150 
like that they are restricting it to a
very<00:02:32.630> small<00:02:32.750> amount<00:02:32.960> of<00:02:33.350> items<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.980> can

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
very small amount of items that you can

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.490 
very small amount of items that you can
still<00:02:34.400> grind<00:02:34.790> for<00:02:35.120> if<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.450> don't<00:02:35.780> want<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.230> pay

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
still grind for if you don't want to pay

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.130 
still grind for if you don't want to pay
but<00:02:37.190> I'm<00:02:37.430> also<00:02:37.610> hoping<00:02:38.210> that<00:02:38.420> if<00:02:38.630> successful

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
but I'm also hoping that if successful

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.230 
but I'm also hoping that if successful
this<00:02:39.680> doesn't<00:02:40.130> pave<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.550> way<00:02:40.580> for<00:02:40.760> bigger

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
this doesn't pave the way for bigger

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.060 
this doesn't pave the way for bigger
