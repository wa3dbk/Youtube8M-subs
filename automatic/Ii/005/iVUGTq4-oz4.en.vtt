00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.250
 greetings to all friends digit final 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.990
 punto.it in the last weeks that 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.059
 we are presenting a lot of devices 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.160
 interesting and certainly not to be 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.900
 minus this is noobs 8 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 the smartphone is clearly inspired by or 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 then it one equipped with a rotary camera 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.070
 and chipset exa core mediatek mt 60 591 a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.660
 chipset 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.910
 very interesting is that I really am 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.160
 curious to test we thank top 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 dealer on point it for limit symbol e 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.699
 we see a unboxing waiting for 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.250
 full review to be published 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.410
 in the coming weeks, the box will be classic 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.170
 bmw as you see very simple and with the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.780
 classique side opening with drawer 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.760
 we immediately find the phone that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.500
 we'll see a little under the tray 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 protective film a user manual 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.420
 in English and apparently also 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.440
 quite detailed a cover 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:06.470
 protective in semitransparent plastic 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:13.640
 semi-rigid charger in European format 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:15.509
 earphone in ear and micro usb usb cable 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.460
 perfect we send to see the phone 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.549
 more in detail the dimensions of the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.869
 juve 8 are 155.7 by 77 mm by 6.8 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.820
 mm thick even if there are mm and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 thickness seem a little more then 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.829
 we will check later for a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.810
 total weight of 166 grams battery 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.680
 removable from 2 thousand and 400 thousand per hour 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.630
 including 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.970
 a weight that is quite reduced if they go 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.049
 to consider itself above all the dimensions 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.479
 general information of the device 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.369
 she is a v8 indeed is certainly not one of 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.130
 those devices usable with one 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.590
 one hand as for the open and one in fact 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.540
 even for this smartphone the design is 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.400
 very influenced by the presence of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.720
 camera 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.150
 rotating that obviously tends to 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.250
 significantly increase the size 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.009
 of the upper frame and consequently 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.649
 also that of the lower frame 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.149
 as a matter of proportionality 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.800
 of the appearance of the device 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.330
 but we come to the structure on the side 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.190
 left we find the power button 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.410
 extreme on and off and keys 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.060
 volume while on the right 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.890
 nothing the rate remains of the audeur side ad 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.650
 be completely clean on the edge 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.209
 lower we find the micro usb slot mt 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.610
 pptp and or tg the 3.5 mm jack for i 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.150
 earphones and the microphone on the side 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.680
 higher 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.200
 obviously there is nothing as 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.440
 this was necessary to leave 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.030
 space to the swivel camera in the 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.540
 back part of course 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.000
 camera laps min and 207 207 degrees 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.720
 sorry 13 megapixel with double flash 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.680
 led and autofocus and f 2.0 aperture that is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.630
 surrounded 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.700
 indeed both the camera and the double 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.730
 flash led and surrounded by a frame 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.880
 long chrome with a chrome finish though 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.880
 printed that creates a relief effect is 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.170
 at the center of the body a touch panel 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.959
 rear 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.730
 Finally, but only of the speaker system the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.100
 removable back cover I make you 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.560
 see immediately what but a 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.450
 hide and under the body we find 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.459
 first of all on the makeover you see i 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.100
 back panel contacts e 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.380
 contacts of the nfc klein ubi 8 is equipped 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.049
 also of nfc batteries of 2 thousand and 400 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.620
 thousand for now dual sim dual sim card 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.260
 one standard 3g and the other 2g in format 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.930
 micro sim and the slot for expansion with 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.450
 micro sd up to 32 gigabytes below it 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.510
 system speaker we are going to enter 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.100
 back cover again and let's talk one 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.260
 little of the finishes of this phone that 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.850
 they look really good 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.819
 obviously not my impressions 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.290
 we do not see constructive imperfections 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.680
 I show it a bit in an overview 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.680
 more detailed here it is 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.250
 as you can see, the design is very nice too 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.450
 if clearly new with this design not 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.190
 has invented nothing and we have to see the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.710
 front on the front 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.290
 we turn on the device on the side 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.959
 frontal we obviously find the capsule 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.370
 earphone and the brightness sensor e 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:30.890
 proximity and the three touch keys at the bottom 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:35.690
 soft touch that are well back lit. 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:38.660
 obviously 5.5 inch hd display with 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.980
 1080 x 720 resolution protected by a 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.230
 gorilla glass glass 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.750
 2 how to show up before 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.270
 the phone's perimeter is surrounded by 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.710
 a double double chrome frame that 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.110
 I don't think it is realized in 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.820
 metal material and interspersed with 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.070
 a white strip in the central part 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.730
 obviously an elegant solution that 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.910
 but it has definitely decidedly inspired 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.980
 wolf n 1 despite that of v8 is 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.300
 a panel but with hd resolution I have to 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.870
 say that at least from first impressions 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.840
 it looks quite sharp and bright 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.970
 especially if we go to see that the 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.230
 the interface has been modified e 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.540
 so it tends to look a lot like 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.060
 that of their group n 1 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.520
 in specific, however, on v8 it is installed 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:32.090
 the exa core chipset so you're core mtk 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.920
 65 91 ti cortex a7 clocked at 1.5 ghz 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.490
 that we remember the saint from today 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.630
 more evils 450 from 1gb of 16gb ram of 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.990
 internal memory of which we are going to see 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.990
 in the settings 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:51.020
 here here about 13 well 13 are reserved 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.000
 the user is very good anyway 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.550
 expandable thanks to the presence of 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.460
 slot for microsd expansion up to 32 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.380
 gigabyte also the rom installed on the 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.230
 wood 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.910
 v8 therefore is modified by the house as 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.090
 see in the graphic and is based on 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.040
 android such as 1.4.2 kat kit 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.980
 complete the specifications of this 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.680
 5g wifi device bluetooth 4.0 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:20.630
 and the nfc then a hardware equipment 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.980
 which is quite complete with the juve 8 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.450
 obviously we will talk more 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.020
 in detail in the review 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.340
 full 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.170
 for now let's close by thanking 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.120
 again top of sylvester pointit dal
