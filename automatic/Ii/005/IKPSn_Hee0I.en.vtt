00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello dear friends with you nodded and 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.869
 Today we are considering a song 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.390
 ramstein group which is called zones 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.039
 Allison song is very well-suited to all 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.590
 beginners because despite all 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.350
 heaviness and roho you this song 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.600
 it is still quite simple and today we 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.010
 see for yourself how to play by 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.660
 at least basic proper 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.960
 guitar reefs and so rammstein group 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.960
 songs 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.910
 he 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.399
 Sasha to play this song 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.699
 we will need to tune the guitar 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.050
 emphasis on nature it means that 6 what 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.050
 we need to be customized 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.710
 the fifth string we have left namutili 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.420
 and the fourth side stays overnight is 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.840
 the rest of the cartridges are all the same 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.180
 okay 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.260
 the main ones in the song are very simple let's 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.260
 let's see how it is played 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.740
 in the performance of the bodice we will need 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:34.490
 right hand with a pick all the time to beat 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:38.350
 down the top 3 so do two hits 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.970
 on the open of these three strings 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.850
 further we clamp one some 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.030
 finger all these three countries on the sixth 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.030
 year 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.750
 evil angry 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.990
 after which we play open again 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.310
 then at 5 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.930
 others sweet 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.930
 together the overall picture of you 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.980
 this is the first part of the figure further the same 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.370
 The same 2 hits on open 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.370
 sleep 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.370
 balls again 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.220
 after which we load the strings and so the second 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.220
 part of us 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.080
 If you combine 1, you get this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.080
 full figure 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.870
 that's actually all this reef times 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:47.709
 repeats from time to time we repeat 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:52.239
 that these two circles completely again but 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.530
 at the end we have this fragment instead 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.530
 will go fragment yet 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.060
 here we pinch the fifth fret and beat three 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.060
 times 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.340
 so completely the whole picture 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.569
 and now this is a full circle we 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.200
 repeat again in the song on this with us 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.049
 the song doesn't end there yet 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.819
 a fragment resembling a chorus in ordinary 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.260
 song about the word chorus next to the word 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.180
 that he somehow in my head does not 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.549
 fit so put so just 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.650
 let's say one more part of the song too 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.629
 it plays a very simple yet even easier 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.190
 than this reef there we have four 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.629
 chord groups before her two bands 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.670
 chords now we have them in our 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.480
 let's take a look at everything 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.480
 we for the beginning xx 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.670
 for convenience, I have recommended not 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.400
 memorize it as first circle second 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.350
 circle and so on because it is very easy 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.180
 you can get confused there actually 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.710
 the same chords are involved all the time 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.280
 changing sequences repeat 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.470
 they are not in the same places so i 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.210
 I advise you to remember and this is how 88 different 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.860
 chords and just play them 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.250
 repeat in the same way 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:53.570
 round and round so consider 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.570
 successively 8 went with us 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.970
 xii 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:03.700
 for we are here 5 string fourth string 4 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.700
 watt only these two sides are 5 and 4 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:11.250
 trying the second chord is it on us on 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.950
 second fret we occupy our here these three 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.950
 shackles three strings 1 2 3 4 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.889
 third chord all the same thing only 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.889
 strictly open 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:30.709
 the fourth chord on the 5th country we clamp 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.709
 on the fourth string we clamp 5 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.789
 four chords 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.339
 go ahead 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.080
 on the second fret we pins the field up on 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.630
 the second fret we clamp feels crumpled 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:55.440
 fourth string 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:06:00.080
 6 on steel fret we clamp on 5 countries 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.080
 I clamp 2 to 4 we clamp 4 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.450
 7 we clamp all three ours on the 5th string 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.450
 strings 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.480
 it is the same only on the fourth fret 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.480
 not recognized 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.930
 need 2 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.659
 if you play consistently the whole picture 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:35.319
 chorus we will say something happens 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.319
 such a picture 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.840
 chance 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.520
 began to leave again Masha also studied 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.520
 men are famously 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.900
 all you have to do is I grew rock 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.759
 head off because we have this song already 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.849
 learned to play before meeting new 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.849
