00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.920
 what is the time of a snack and has 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.410
 100 calories in your wallet to spend 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.940
 in fruit that will buy all the 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.430
 Fresh fruits are a good offer 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.289
 they offer fiber mineral vitamins and 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.880
 healthy antioxidants but the 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.919
 amount of fruit you will get for your 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.259
 without calories depends a lot on how much 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.779
 water has the fruit while more water 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.820
 the greater the portion combine the the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.320
 variety is important since fruits 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.599
 they differ in the nutrition they offer 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.550
 let's analyze some common fruits and 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.950
 how much can you consume with 100 calories 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.990
 in your wallet the melons contain 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.850
 more water than all fruits reason 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.160
 which will get two huge rates of 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.020
 melon party for its 100 calories 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.970
 the berries contain a lot of water and fiber 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.460
 so they really are a bargain in 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.410
 calories for only 100 calories can 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.210
 eat 25 medium strawberries or 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.430
 about one and a half cups of 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.500
 blackberries or raspberries citrus fruits 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.300
 they contain a lot of water one reason why 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.490
 which often we turn to them for 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.770
 juices but juices lack fiber 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.020
 so you will feel more satisfied if 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.970
 you better eat the whole fruit for only 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.700
 100 calories can eat 2 tangerines 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.320
 medium or more than one whole grapefruit one 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.450
 medium apple around 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.430
 inches contains only 100 calories and 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.680
 your 5 grams of fiber will help you 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.450
 feel satisfied also the pineapple is a 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.520
 little sweeter and more dense than melon 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.860
 which is why you will get a little less 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.229
 for its no calories approximately one 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.970
 cup and a quarter but you'll also get 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.340
 the value of a full day of vitamin 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.170
 c mangoes and bananas are more fruit 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.880
 dense so their portions of 100 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.979
 calories are going to be a little smaller 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.229
 but mangoes are a rich source of 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.940
 vitamin and bananas are one of the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.280
 best options to find potassium 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.869
 the nuts are practical but already 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.240
 that much of the water has been extracted 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.759
 their 100 calories do not give much just one 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.570
 handful of raisins 6 rings of dried apple or 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.570
 a date and a half
