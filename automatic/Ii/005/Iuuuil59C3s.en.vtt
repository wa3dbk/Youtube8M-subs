00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.929 

CNC<00:00:16.760> setup<00:00:17.500> so<00:00:18.500> you<00:00:18.529> received<00:00:19.490> your<00:00:19.789> new

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
CNC setup so you received your new

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.310 
CNC setup so you received your new
machine<00:00:20.349> from<00:00:21.349> con<00:00:21.619> masters<00:00:23.169> what<00:00:24.169> do<00:00:24.259> you

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
machine from con masters what do you

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.240 
machine from con masters what do you
need<00:00:24.439> to<00:00:24.590> do<00:00:24.710> next<00:00:26.079> in<00:00:27.079> here<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:27.860> have<00:00:28.610> my<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:30.250> have

need to do next in here I have my I have

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.680 
need to do next in here I have my I have
my<00:00:31.279> C<00:00:31.730> I<00:00:32.059> have<00:00:32.270> my<00:00:33.309> my<00:00:34.309> computer<00:00:36.730> down<00:00:37.730> here<00:00:38.329> I

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
my C I have my my computer down here I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:48.900 
my C I have my my computer down here I
have<00:00:39.170> my<00:00:40.570> control<00:00:41.570> box<00:00:42.309> with<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:46.690> there<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.870> is

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
have my control box with the there it is

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.360 
have my control box with the there it is
with<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:49.940> Zee<00:00:50.590> touchpad<00:00:51.590> installed<00:00:54.130> on<00:00:55.130> the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
with the Zee touchpad installed on the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.840 
with the Zee touchpad installed on the
other<00:00:55.489> side<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.680> control<00:00:58.100> box<00:00:58.460> is<00:00:58.850> the<00:01:00.850> the

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
other side of the control box is the the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.179 
other side of the control box is the the
emergency<00:01:02.600> East<00:01:03.230> op<00:01:03.530> on/off<00:01:04.460> switch<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:06.470> 25

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
emergency East op on/off switch and a 25

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.929 
emergency East op on/off switch and a 25
pinned<00:01:07.930> cable<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.829> hooks<00:01:10.189> up<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.729> back

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
pinned cable that hooks up to the back

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.520 
pinned cable that hooks up to the back
of<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.479> computer<00:01:12.310> via<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:14.600> wind<00:01:14.840> CNC<00:01:15.850> PCI<00:01:16.850> card

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
of a computer via the wind CNC PCI card

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.520 
of a computer via the wind CNC PCI card
so<00:01:18.530> once<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.430> get<00:01:19.549> everything<00:01:19.700> hooked<00:01:20.150> up

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
so once you get everything hooked up

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.210 
so once you get everything hooked up
what<00:01:21.530> do<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.710> do<00:01:21.890> next<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:24.140> let's<00:01:24.830> go<00:01:25.070> with

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
what do you do next so let's go with

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.050 
what do you do next so let's go with
some<00:01:25.400> basic<00:01:25.880> stuff<00:01:26.180> first<00:01:27.370> well<00:01:28.370> actually<00:01:28.670> let

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
some basic stuff first well actually let

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.420 
some basic stuff first well actually let
me<00:01:29.240> put<00:01:29.270> on<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.930> power<00:01:30.170> first<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:30.950> just<00:01:31.220> flip

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
me put on the power first so just flip

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.149 
me put on the power first so just flip
the<00:01:31.549> power<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:31.970> arm<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:33.440> can<00:01:33.560> hear<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.950> fans

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
the power to arm you can hear the fans

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.760 
the power to arm you can hear the fans
come<00:01:34.490> in

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.030 

so<00:01:38.280> let's<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.760> over<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:38.970> basic<00:01:39.570> stuff<00:01:43.040> I'll

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so let's go over some basic stuff I'll

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
so let's go over some basic stuff I'll
get<00:01:44.250> back<00:01:44.400> to<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> minute<00:01:44.880> okay<00:01:45.770> back

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
get back to you in a minute okay back

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.630 
get back to you in a minute okay back
again<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.330> put<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:52.280> camcorder<00:01:53.280> on

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
again so I just put the the camcorder on

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.389 
again so I just put the the camcorder on
a<00:01:53.810> tripod<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.440> I<00:01:56.040> actually<00:01:56.220> have<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.940> webcam

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
a tripod and I actually have a webcam

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.219 
a tripod and I actually have a webcam
pointing<00:01:59.399> at<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> screen<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.690> can<00:02:00.960> see

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
pointing at the screen so you can see

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.649 
pointing at the screen so you can see
what's<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.440> on<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> started<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:04.110> twin<00:02:04.320> CNC

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
what's going on so I started a twin CNC

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.800 
what's going on so I started a twin CNC
blank<00:02:06.659> screen<00:02:07.080> just<00:02:07.680> started<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> program<00:02:08.810> we

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
blank screen just started the program we

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.750 
blank screen just started the program we
have<00:02:10.019> power<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.950> CNC<00:02:11.790> controller<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:14.100> what

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
have power on the CNC controller so what

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.710 
have power on the CNC controller so what
has<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.570> done<00:02:15.800> every<00:02:16.800> time<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.269> click<00:02:18.540> on

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
has to be done every time is to click on

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.640 
has to be done every time is to click on
initialize<00:02:19.519> when<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.640> click<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.000> initialize

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
initialize when I click on initialize

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.300 
initialize when I click on initialize
this<00:02:22.650> will<00:02:22.950> lift<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:25.170> router<00:02:25.410> you'll<00:02:26.040> see

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
this will lift the the router you'll see

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.900 
this will lift the the router you'll see
lift<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> router<00:02:27.269> up<00:02:28.160> took<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.370> limit<00:02:29.640> switch

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
lift the router up took the limit switch

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.610 
lift the router up took the limit switch
and<00:02:30.560> then<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.800> talk<00:02:31.980> further<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.080> there<00:02:34.440> we

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
and then we can talk further so there we

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.900 
and then we can talk further so there we
go

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.630 

this<00:02:43.450> has<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.900> be<00:02:44.020> done<00:02:44.230> because<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:45.280> machine

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
this has to be done because the machine

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.960 
this has to be done because the machine
doesn't<00:02:45.970> know<00:02:46.120> its<00:02:46.720> coordinates<00:02:47.640> it's<00:02:48.640> all

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
doesn't know its coordinates it's all

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.650 
doesn't know its coordinates it's all
it's<00:02:49.390> basically<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:50.620> dead<00:02:51.160> machine<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:54.660> when

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
it's basically just dead machine so when

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.750 
it's basically just dead machine so when
C<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.110> C<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.560> cam<00:02:56.800> masters<00:02:57.340> they<00:02:57.520> have<00:02:57.730> a

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
C and C and cam masters they have a

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.720 
C and C and cam masters they have a
button<00:02:58.270> called<00:02:58.570> initialize<00:02:59.400> some<00:03:00.400> people

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
button called initialize some people

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.830 
button called initialize some people
call<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.150> home

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
call it home

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.590 
call it home
some<00:03:02.830> people<00:03:03.160> have<00:03:03.370> no<00:03:03.610> buttons<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.480> they

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
some people have no buttons and they

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:13.890 
some people have no buttons and they
type<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.140> g28<00:03:07.170> Z<00:03:08.170> or<00:03:08.830> g28<00:03:09.730> X<00:03:10.380> d-28<00:03:11.380> Y<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.510> small

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
type in g28 Z or g28 X d-28 Y and small

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.680 
type in g28 Z or g28 X d-28 Y and small
that's<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.320> same<00:03:14.530> job<00:03:14.920> if<00:03:15.820> you<00:03:16.000> do<00:03:16.180> do<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.510> by

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
that's the same job if you do do it by

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.110 
that's the same job if you do do it by
code<00:03:17.070> type<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.310> g28

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
code type in g28

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.930 
code type in g28
Z<00:03:19.510> first<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.920> don't<00:03:21.160> want<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.370> moving<00:03:21.610> across

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
Z first you don't want it moving across

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.400 
Z first you don't want it moving across
the<00:03:22.060> table<00:03:22.420> because<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:22.900> might<00:03:23.170> hit

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
the table because you might hit

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.270 
the table because you might hit
something<00:03:24.210> so<00:03:25.210> as<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:25.900> see<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.980> Machine

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
something so as you can see the Machine

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.460 
something so as you can see the Machine
is<00:03:30.460> home<00:03:30.640> we're<00:03:30.970> ready<00:03:31.210> to<00:03:31.390> go<00:03:31.540> it

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
is home we're ready to go it

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.200 
is home we're ready to go it
automatically<00:03:33.070> goes<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.850> have<00:03:35.280> no<00:03:36.280> green<00:03:36.640> boxes

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
automatically goes I have no green boxes

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.510 
automatically goes I have no green boxes
or<00:03:37.600> blue<00:03:38.170> boxes<00:03:38.710> we'll<00:03:38.920> talk<00:03:39.100> about<00:03:39.280> that

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
or blue boxes we'll talk about that

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.110 
or blue boxes we'll talk about that
later

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
later

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.200 
later
so<00:03:40.660> this<00:03:41.080> position<00:03:41.620> X<00:03:41.890> 0<00:03:42.720> y<00:03:43.720> 0<00:03:43.750> Z<00:03:44.200> 0<00:03:44.470> is<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.850> home

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
so this position X 0 y 0 Z 0 is the home

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.890 
so this position X 0 y 0 Z 0 is the home
position<00:03:47.140> it's<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:48.040> machine<00:03:48.550> home<00:03:49.150> position

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
position it's the machine home position

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.250 
position it's the machine home position
this<00:03:52.900> lower<00:03:53.170> left-hand<00:03:53.530> corner<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.900> the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
this lower left-hand corner is the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.690 
this lower left-hand corner is the
position<00:03:56.800> if<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:57.820> have<00:03:58.090> no<00:03:58.300> boxes<00:03:59.640> this<00:04:00.640> is

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
position if you have no boxes this is

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.450 
position if you have no boxes this is
the<00:04:00.850> position<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.480> we're<00:04:01.630> going<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:03.160> if<00:04:03.310> I

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
the position that we're going to so if I

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.910 
the position that we're going to so if I
jog<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.030> Machine<00:04:05.820> using<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:06.940> keyboard<00:04:07.440> or<00:04:08.440> I

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
jog the Machine using the keyboard or I

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.560 
jog the Machine using the keyboard or I
just<00:04:09.250> let<00:04:09.400> me<00:04:09.550> use<00:04:09.730> these<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.270> that<00:04:10.390> way<00:04:10.510> you

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
just let me use these and that way you

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.950 
just let me use these and that way you
can<00:04:10.720> see<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.160> just<00:04:12.490> move<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.390> position

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
can see it so I just move the position

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.770 
can see it so I just move the position
and<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:15.670> say<00:04:16.210> go<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.900> X<00:04:17.470> 0<00:04:17.859> y<00:04:18.130> 0<00:04:18.270> so<00:04:19.270> here's<00:04:19.540> the

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
and I say go to X 0 y 0 so here's the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.820 
and I say go to X 0 y 0 so here's the
router<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:21.130> red<00:04:21.370> circle<00:04:22.000> it'll<00:04:22.540> travel<00:04:22.870> to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
router the red circle it'll travel to

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.940 
router the red circle it'll travel to
this<00:04:23.980> lower<00:04:24.280> left-hand<00:04:24.640> corner<00:04:25.770> there<00:04:26.770> it

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
this lower left-hand corner there it

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.290 
this lower left-hand corner there it
goes

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
goes

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.330 
goes
so<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.510> is<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.960> whole<00:04:30.200> position<00:04:32.590> okay<00:04:33.590> let's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
so that is the whole position okay let's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.930 
so that is the whole position okay let's
have<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.520> look<00:04:34.580> at<00:04:34.790> some<00:04:35.000> basics<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:37.370> CNC

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
have a look at some basics of the CNC

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.890 
have a look at some basics of the CNC
itself<00:04:39.310> let<00:04:40.310> me<00:04:40.400> take<00:04:40.610> my<00:04:40.640> keyboard<00:04:41.300> which<00:04:41.690> you

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
itself let me take my keyboard which you

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.260 
itself let me take my keyboard which you
can<00:04:42.080> also<00:04:42.350> operate<00:04:42.890> I<00:04:43.340> have<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:44.000> wireless

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
can also operate I have a wireless

00:04:44.270 --> 00:05:19.300 
can also operate I have a wireless
keyboard<00:04:46.600> so<00:05:15.070> some<00:05:16.070> basics<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:18.500> capacitor

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
keyboard so some basics the capacitor

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.130 
keyboard so some basics the capacitor
comes<00:05:19.490> equipped<00:05:19.790> with<00:05:19.940> limit<00:05:20.390> switches<00:05:20.660> here

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
comes equipped with limit switches here

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.640 
comes equipped with limit switches here
is<00:05:21.320> a<00:05:21.350> limit<00:05:21.800> switch<00:05:22.090> on<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.540> other<00:05:23.690> side<00:05:24.080> is<00:05:24.590> a

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
is a limit switch on the other side is a

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.940 
is a limit switch on the other side is a
limit<00:05:25.190> switch<00:05:25.310> of<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.820> Z<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:26.650> underneath<00:05:27.650> and

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
limit switch of the Z and underneath and

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.760 
limit switch of the Z and underneath and
underneath<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.730> table<00:05:29.300> is<00:05:29.690> a<00:05:30.110> limit<00:05:30.620> switch

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
underneath the table is a limit switch

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.310 
underneath the table is a limit switch
for<00:05:31.130> Y<00:05:32.470> if<00:05:33.470> you<00:05:33.830> ever<00:05:34.070> hit<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:34.460> liquid<00:05:35.060> switch<00:05:35.330> so

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
for Y if you ever hit a liquid switch so

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.020 
for Y if you ever hit a liquid switch so
we'll<00:05:36.500> look<00:05:36.620> on<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:36.830> screen<00:05:37.190> I'm<00:05:37.700> going<00:05:37.760> to

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
we'll look on the screen I'm going to

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.050 
we'll look on the screen I'm going to
jog<00:05:39.070> well<00:05:40.070> actually<00:05:40.250> I'll<00:05:40.490> do<00:05:40.610> it<00:05:40.700> on<00:05:40.880> the

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
jog well actually I'll do it on the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.420 
jog well actually I'll do it on the
screen<00:05:41.360> I'm<00:05:41.660> just<00:05:41.960> going<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.140> go<00:05:42.290> G<00:05:42.620> up<00:05:42.830> but<00:05:43.250> not

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
screen I'm just going to go G up but not

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.840 
screen I'm just going to go G up but not
pay<00:05:43.640> any<00:05:43.820> attention<00:05:47.170> okay<00:05:48.170> I'm<00:05:48.590> going<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:49.670> go

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
pay any attention okay I'm going to go

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.980 
pay any attention okay I'm going to go
across<00:05:50.330> to<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:51.470> left

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:05.660 

so<00:05:58.730> you<00:05:59.730> can<00:05:59.940> do<00:06:00.060> everything<00:06:00.270> with<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:04.670> with

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
so you can do everything with the with

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.170 
so you can do everything with the with
with<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.480> screen<00:06:07.410> or<00:06:07.650> with<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:08.180> keypad

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
with the screen or with the keypad

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.670 
with the screen or with the keypad
doesn't<00:06:09.840> make<00:06:09.930> any<00:06:10.110> difference

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
doesn't make any difference

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.790 
doesn't make any difference
so<00:06:11.130> we<00:06:11.520> go<00:06:11.670> back<00:06:11.700> to<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:14.310> machine<00:06:14.670> again<00:06:15.800> this

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
so we go back to the machine again this

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.370 
so we go back to the machine again this
has<00:06:17.040> a<00:06:17.070> laser<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:19.160> precision<00:06:20.160> laser<00:06:20.430> for<00:06:21.380> line
