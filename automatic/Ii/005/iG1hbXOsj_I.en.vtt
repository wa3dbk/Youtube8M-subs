00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you there's also microphones you built

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
you there's also microphones you built
in<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.230> there<00:00:37.950> maybe<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.370> cannot<00:00:38.670> show

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
in the right there maybe I cannot show

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.520 
in the right there maybe I cannot show
you<00:00:39.030> guys<00:00:39.270> will<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.480> closer<00:00:39.809> right<00:00:40.110> here

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
you can see also few buttons like your
example<00:00:44.250> play<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.760> pause<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.210> an<00:00:45.600> off<00:00:45.719> switch

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
example play and pause on an off switch

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.360 
example play and pause on an off switch
and<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> other<00:00:46.469> side<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:46.980> plus<00:00:47.190> and

and on the other side we have plus and
minus<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> course<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.629> regulate<00:00:49.050> your

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
minus of course so you can regulate your

before<00:00:55.949> charging<00:00:56.340> even<00:00:56.579> though<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> open

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
before charging even though this is open

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.860 
before charging even though this is open
this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> still<00:00:58.250> ip57<00:00:59.420> certified<00:01:00.420> which<00:01:00.600> means

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
this is still ip57 certified which means

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.860 
this is still ip57 certified which means
you<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:02.010> maybe<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.969> swimming<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.660> but

you could maybe go swimming with it but

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
you could maybe go swimming with it but
you<00:01:04.290> shouldn't<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.729> actually

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you shouldn't because this is actually

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
you shouldn't because this is actually
just<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.990> raining<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.950> you're

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
just a for if it's raining or if you're

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.679 
just a for if it's raining or if you're
the<00:01:08.220> sweating<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> lot<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.330> course<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the sweating a lot then of course it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
the sweating a lot then of course it
shouldn't<00:01:09.930> break<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.380> there's<00:01:10.770> also<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
shouldn't break because there's also a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.000 
shouldn't break because there's also a
little<00:01:11.369> bit<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> water<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:13.110> those<00:01:13.710> activities

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
little bit of water in those activities

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
little bit of water in those activities
so<00:01:14.490> let<00:01:14.850> me<00:01:14.970> turn<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.930> by<00:01:16.650> pressing

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
so let me turn these on just by pressing

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.950 
so let me turn these on just by pressing
this<00:01:17.040> button<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.580> there's<00:01:18.509> also<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.840> LED

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
this button and there's also an LED

this button and there's also an LED
which<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:20.900> somewhere<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.409> was

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
which is somewhere right there it was

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.580 
which is somewhere right there it was
also<00:01:22.740> vibrating<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:24.630> vibrated<00:01:25.110> again<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
also vibrating and it vibrated again and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.620 
also vibrating and it vibrated again and

connection<00:01:39.200> mode<00:01:39.350> for<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.770> iOS<00:01:40.130> devices<00:01:40.700> but

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
connection mode for the iOS devices but

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.520 
connection mode for the iOS devices but
actually<00:01:41.270> that's<00:01:41.360> also<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:41.900> course<00:01:42.080> possible

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
actually that's also of course possible

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.680 
actually that's also of course possible
because<00:01:42.680> Bluetooth<00:01:43.430> is<00:01:43.550> bluetooth<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.180> it's

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
because Bluetooth is bluetooth and it's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.750 
because Bluetooth is bluetooth and it's
working<00:01:45.470> on<00:01:45.560> any<00:01:45.800> device<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.340> there's<00:01:46.580> also

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
working on any device so there's also

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.340 
working on any device so there's also
noise<00:01:47.030> cancellation<00:01:47.600> inside<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.140> if<00:01:48.229> you're

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
noise cancellation inside so if you're

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.080 
noise cancellation inside so if you're
talking<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.740> somebody<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.790> have<00:01:49.940> this

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
are annoying me but these are quite

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.620 
are annoying me but these are quite
comfortable<00:02:40.220> right<00:02:40.400> now<00:02:40.549> and<00:02:40.760> let's<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:41.090> try

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
comfortable right now and let's just try

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.810 
comfortable right now and let's just try
playing<00:02:41.959> some<00:02:42.230> music<00:02:42.410> at<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.220> maximum<00:02:43.670> volume

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
playing some music at the maximum volume

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.699 
playing some music at the maximum volume
they<00:02:44.150> should<00:02:44.360> last<00:02:44.540> up<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.810> six<00:02:45.170> hours<00:02:45.290> at

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
they should last up to six hours at

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.530 
they should last up to six hours at
maximum<00:02:46.190> volume<00:02:46.580> which<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:46.880> really<00:02:47.180> amazing

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
maximum volume which is really amazing

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.850 
maximum volume which is really amazing
because<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:47.870> you're<00:02:47.989> not<00:02:48.140> using<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.500> maximum

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
because if you're not using a maximum

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.100 
because if you're not using a maximum
volume<00:02:49.160> they<00:02:49.640> can<00:02:49.850> apps<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.180> think<00:02:50.600> up<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.810> even

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
volume they can apps I think up to even

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.600 
volume they can apps I think up to even
ten<00:02:51.350> hours<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:51.890> would<00:02:52.130> be<00:02:52.220> quite<00:02:52.400> amazing

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
ten hours so that would be quite amazing

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.530 
ten hours so that would be quite amazing
