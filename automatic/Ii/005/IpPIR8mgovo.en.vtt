00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.410
 how to remove the grains first and 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.570
 genÃ­s to the area 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.570
 you can disinfect a needle and click 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.240
 just the surface to facilitate the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.269
 output of the impurities contained there 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.119
 inside but without squeezing it and by far 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.939
 careful you could also apply a 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.939
 special product for the beans that what 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.159
 dries in four or five applications a 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.829
 good homemade trick is to treat it with 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.960
 toothpaste toothpaste since it has 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.050
 hygiene and saints components that are 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.660
 ideal to remove the grains only 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.089
 applies a small portion of toothpaste 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.449
 over the grain and leave it there for 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.120
 night this will facilitate the mud 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.300
 dry and disappear and there is another 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.079
 somewhat more extreme measure than you can 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.480
 carry out resorting to garlic clove 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.579
 you open it and gently rub the granite 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.309
 with the inside of the garlic clove 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.559
 that will dry it and reduce it in 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.780
 matter of a while you have to have 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.330
 caution in this case 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.790
 first protect the area 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.509
 around the grain because this could 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.850
 Too dry your skin apply a cream 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.430
 or cover with a paper or tape all the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.460
 skin around the grain before rubbing 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.340
 garlic is a good idea to do this for the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.490
 night and wash the face or area well 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.190
 in the morning to avoid permanence 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.620
 of the smell of garlic on our skin 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.810
