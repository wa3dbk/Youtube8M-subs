00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
digits and then we can't make an unlock

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.370 
digits and then we can't make an unlock
code<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:42.210> won't<00:01:42.420> get<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> automatically

code and you won't get it automatically

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.929 
code and you won't get it automatically
in<00:01:43.619> two<00:01:43.799> minutes<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> would<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.850> an

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
in two minutes because it would be an

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.109 
in two minutes because it would be an
error<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.770> we<00:01:46.770> need<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> check<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.759> was<00:01:47.939> done

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
error so we need to check what was done

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.139

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
maybe in a couple of hours or so so it's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.569 
maybe in a couple of hours or so so it's
important<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.829> check<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.340> send
