you can see it's a repeat of four
stitches

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
and then my back stitch to back stitches

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:57.410 
and then my back stitch to back stitches
in<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.400> same<00:02:49.640> place<00:02:54.820> back<00:02:55.820> up

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
in the same place back up

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:10.839 
in the same place back up
back<00:02:58.050> into<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> center

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.649

and<00:03:17.659> it<00:03:17.780> will<00:03:17.930> build<00:03:18.109> up<00:03:18.409> like<00:03:19.069> this<00:03:19.370> all<00:03:19.909> the

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
and it will build up like this all the

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.229 
and it will build up like this all the
way<00:03:20.510> around<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.560> what<00:03:21.859> happens<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:23.090> more

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
way around and what happens is the more

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.270 
way around and what happens is the more
you<00:03:23.420> go<00:03:23.599> into<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.959> center<00:03:24.379> you<00:03:24.859> create<00:03:25.249> a

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
you go into the center you create a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.789 
you go into the center you create a
parting<00:03:25.939> in<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.180> fabric<00:03:26.659> that<00:03:27.290> becomes<00:03:27.680> a

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
parting in the fabric that becomes a

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.910 
parting in the fabric that becomes a
little<00:03:28.129> hole<00:03:28.370> an<00:03:28.909> eyelet<00:03:29.840> stitch<00:03:29.989> can<00:03:30.500> be<00:03:30.620> used
