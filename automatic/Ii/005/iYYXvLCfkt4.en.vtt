00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
time and it used to dominate back in the

right here that's not good it's going to
cause<00:01:38.380> twirling<00:01:38.920> what's<00:01:39.130> also<00:01:39.340> going<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.640> cost

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
cause twirling what's also going to cost

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.569 
cause twirling what's also going to cost
whirling<00:01:40.359> is<00:01:40.539> that<00:01:41.530> if<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:41.920> look<00:01:42.069> at<00:01:42.100> where

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
whirling is that if you look at where

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.270 
whirling is that if you look at where
the<00:01:42.819> hook<00:01:42.999> is<00:01:43.119> in<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.390> head<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.770> eye<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.979> hook

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
the hook is in the head the eye the hook

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.580 
the hook is in the head the eye the hook
and<00:01:45.490> then<00:01:45.609> the<00:01:45.789> hook<00:01:45.939> point<00:01:46.469> they're<00:01:47.469> in

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
and then the hook point they're in

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.879 
and then the hook point they're in
they're<00:01:48.009> offline<00:01:48.490> they<00:01:49.210> should<00:01:49.450> be<00:01:49.539> vertical

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
they're offline they should be vertical

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.550 
they're offline they should be vertical
okay<00:01:50.889> and<00:01:51.130> they're<00:01:51.369> offset<00:01:51.549> so<00:01:52.210> it's<00:01:53.079> causing

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
okay and they're offset so it's causing

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800 
okay and they're offset so it's causing
two<00:01:53.740> different<00:01:54.189> angles<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.450> it's<00:01:55.659> going<00:01:55.749> to

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
two different angles and it's going to

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.489 
two different angles and it's going to
cause<00:01:55.990> twisting<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:58.229> hold<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.319> bait

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
cause twisting so hold the bait

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.160 
cause twisting so hold the bait
naturally<00:02:00.039> like<00:02:00.219> it<00:02:00.399> would<00:02:00.549> hang<00:02:00.789> okay<00:02:01.630> and

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
naturally like it would hang okay and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.370 
naturally like it would hang okay and
look<00:02:02.859> at<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.069> hook<00:02:03.249> where<00:02:03.850> would<00:02:03.969> go<00:02:04.149> in

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
look at the hook where would go in

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.820 
look at the hook where would go in
in<00:02:05.910> correlation<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.540> eye<00:02:07.870> all<00:02:08.350> right<00:02:08.680> and

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
in correlation to the eye all right and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.820 
in correlation to the eye all right and
then<00:02:09.369> crimp<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.759> up<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:09.940> little<00:02:10.060> bit<00:02:10.680> go<00:02:11.680> in

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
then crimp it up a little bit go in

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.760 
then crimp it up a little bit go in
there<00:02:12.010> straight<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:14.110> right<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:14.590> don't

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
there straight all right so we don't

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.090 
there straight all right so we don't
have<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> hump<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.600> we're<00:02:16.600> in<00:02:16.750> there<00:02:17.100> straight

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
have a hump and we're in there straight

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.090 
have a hump and we're in there straight
on<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.120> now<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.630> bait<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.230> going<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.980> do

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
on so now that bait is going to do

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.550 
on so now that bait is going to do
exactly<00:02:21.310> what<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.210> wanted<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.720> if<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.530> look

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
exactly what I wanted to do if you look

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.680 
exactly what I wanted to do if you look
at<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.830> footage<00:02:24.040> here<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:25.270> can<00:02:25.390> see<00:02:25.510> when

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
at the footage here you can see when

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.300 
at the footage here you can see when
that<00:02:25.720> bait<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.170> rigged<00:02:26.470> off<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.070> side<00:02:27.280> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
that bait is rigged off to the side a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.850 
that bait is rigged off to the side a
little<00:02:27.550> bit

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
little bit

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.850 
little bit
it<00:02:29.860> falls<00:02:30.300> okay<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.570> know<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.780> looks<00:02:31.930> good<00:02:32.170> but

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
it falls okay you know it looks good but

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.950 
it falls okay you know it looks good but
it<00:02:33.490> doesn't<00:02:33.670> have<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.240> certain<00:02:34.570> action<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
it doesn't have a certain action that I

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.110 
it doesn't have a certain action that I
wanted<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:36.970> that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
wanted to have and that is that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.440 
wanted to have and that is that
side-to-side<00:02:37.540> action<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.150> look<00:02:40.300> at<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
side-to-side action if you look at the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.050 
side-to-side action if you look at the
way<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.570> rigged<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.990> right<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:42.610> head<00:02:42.880> is

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
way I rigged it right the head is

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.580 
way I rigged it right the head is
actually<00:02:43.360> moving<00:02:43.510> side<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.810> side<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.350> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
actually moving side to side and the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.830 
actually moving side to side and the
tail<00:02:44.800> at<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.100> same<00:02:45.280> time<00:02:45.520> creating<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.600> lot<00:02:46.720> of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
tail at the same time creating a lot of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.199 
tail at the same time creating a lot of
vibration<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:48.430> fish<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.760> feel<00:02:48.970> that

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
vibration and the fish can feel that

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.080 
vibration and the fish can feel that
they<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.840> see<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.410> looks<00:02:50.650> natural<00:02:51.090> anytime

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
they can see it it looks natural anytime

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.900 
they can see it it looks natural anytime

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
really natural to the fish and they're

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.600
