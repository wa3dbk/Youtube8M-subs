00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 who enters a farm like this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.120
 accustomed to confinement of livestock soon 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.670
 takes a fright 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.080
 the pickets are empty and the few 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780
 animals that remain 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.070
 spend a lot of time loose on the grass 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.289
 is that the high cost of agricultural inputs 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.880
 used to feed the herd 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.100
 rose both price and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.359
 confinements are increasingly being 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.789
 feasible 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.570
 the soybean sack that in January of this year 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.340
 cost 43 reais in August was already 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.309
 negotiated for 78 3 cement of 81% 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.329
 already the sack of corn jumped 18 reais 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.610
 to 24 in the same period a survey 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.280
 made by the Matogrossense institute of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 agricultural economy shows that the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.469
 volume of confined animals dropped from 814 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.690
 thousand in December last year to 740 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.190
 thousand in July this year a drop of 9% 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.719
 confirmed by the breeders association 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.360
 from mato grosso 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.000
 we did some surveys and only in the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.159
 physical installation of the confinement 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.610
 would require an investment of two 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.830
 millions of dollars to confine thousands 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.720
 animals is in the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.939
 a daily confinement costs 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.570
 approximately today with the price of 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.020
 grains 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 where it is more or less than 5 to 6 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.549
 an alternative found by 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.560
 producers to reduce the cost within 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.710
 farms was to invest in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.290
 semi- system in this system cattle 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 feed in the trough and within the picket 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.860
 also in the area of ​​pasture in the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.990
 property 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.899
 the semiconfiguration differs essentially 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.930
 the confinement itself by the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.659
 supply the massive problem in the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.770
 non-semicircular trough 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.810
 only the feed and not in the feed system. 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.659
 confinement must provide all the food 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.899
 of the bulky animal that are 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.840
 the fibers and in other things like 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.750
 also the ratio so that it facilitates 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.230
 the management does not need to do 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.040
 investments in mine. 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.959
 farm 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.170
 cm confinement requires you to make a 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.849
 very large fort of cochos connects each 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.560
 animal has to have its space to 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.359
 eat with ease 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.480
 there is already enough capital 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.489
 high and labor also very 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.189
 costly and very large 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.220
 meet the requirements of that 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.590
 handling them while in semi 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.189
 confinement as I go alone 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.500
 I'm just giving the food 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.109
 the bulky that is the cattle way goes there and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.689
 how to fertilize this step in advance 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.939
 and the large bulky forum 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.919
 of good quality with fertilization 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.859
 the animal goes there and eats quietly 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.540
 without any cost and if voluminous and becomes 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.549
 eat only the feed in the trough 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.950
 this requires less manpower and 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.290
 less costs and less facilities for 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.900
 acrimat the semiconfinamento is 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.189
 trend and should grow in the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.530
 next year 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.409
 management allows an increase in the supply of 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.030
 ox and ensures regularity in the 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.940
 slaughter of animals 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.540
 semiconfining is a productive model 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.040
 which best adapts in the state given the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.060
 characteristics of weed production 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.090
 grosso mato grosso is a state 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.519
 predominantly of extensive production 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.040
 livestock and the 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.919
 fits into it when 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.889
 installation of course lines within the 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.000
 own small ones we get 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.180
 supplement the animals from the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.280
 drought is causing them to keep the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.370
 weight or even gain weight on account 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.959
 Moreover, due to the very 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 smaller in the semi-confinement than 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.370
 compared to confinement is the model that 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.680
 the small producer and the average 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.030
 producer to participate in this model 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.810
 production helping to maintain gains 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.810
 of these animals
