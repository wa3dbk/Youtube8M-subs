very<00:02:44.630> much<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.260> front<00:02:45.500> one<00:02:45.890> or<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.459> a

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
very much like the front one or it is a

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.720 
very much like the front one or it is a
push<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.300> release<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:48.770> reveal<00:02:49.280> what's

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
push to release to reveal what's

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.060 
push to release to reveal what's
underneath<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:51.230> course<00:02:51.530> another<00:02:51.770> dust

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.720 
underneath and of course another dust
filter<00:02:52.400> behind<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:53.320> so<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.590> get<00:02:54.770> plenty<00:02:55.310> of

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
filter behind it so you get plenty of

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.240 
filter behind it so you get plenty of
room<00:02:55.970> for<00:02:56.239> mounting<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.170> lot<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.470> fans<00:02:57.800> as<00:02:58.100> well

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
room for mounting a lot of fans as well

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.370 
room for mounting a lot of fans as well
as<00:02:58.310> long<00:02:58.610> radiators<00:02:59.209> so<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.630> can<00:02:59.750> mount<00:02:59.930> up<00:03:00.170> to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
as long radiators so you can mount up to

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.970 
as long radiators so you can mount up to
three<00:03:00.739> 120<00:03:01.670> millimeter<00:03:02.030> fans<00:03:02.330> or<00:03:02.540> two<00:03:03.050> 140

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980

360<00:03:08.900> millimeters<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.590> length<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.100> very<00:03:10.370> much

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
360 millimeters in length so very much

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.180 
360 millimeters in length so very much
like<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.420> front<00:03:11.630> now<00:03:12.260> let's<00:03:12.470> go<00:03:12.620> ahead<00:03:12.769> and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
like the front now let's go ahead and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.190 
like the front now let's go ahead and
move<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.430> along<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.120> bottom<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.019> case

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
move it along to the bottom of the case

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.620 
move it along to the bottom of the case
on<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.950> bottom<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.580> do<00:03:16.700> get<00:03:16.880> these<00:03:17.150> raised

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
on the bottom you do get these raised

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.990 
on the bottom you do get these raised
feet<00:03:18.110> as<00:03:18.410> well<00:03:18.830> as<00:03:19.040> plenty<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.640> this

I<00:05:30.620> removed<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.639> windowed<00:05:32.090> side<00:05:32.270> panel<00:05:32.570> so<00:05:32.599> we

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
I removed the windowed side panel so we

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.690 
I removed the windowed side panel so we
can<00:05:32.810> go<00:05:32.930> ahead<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:33.410> check<00:05:33.530> out<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.740> interior
