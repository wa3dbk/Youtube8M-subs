you<00:05:25.620> know<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:25.950> would<00:05:26.070> kill<00:05:26.250> in<00:05:26.430> one<00:05:26.580> hit<00:05:26.790> but<00:05:26.940> it

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
you know it would kill in one hit but it

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.120 
you know it would kill in one hit but it
makes<00:05:27.240> sense<00:05:27.390> that<00:05:27.540> it<00:05:27.720> doesn't<00:05:28.110> but<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.950> makes

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
makes sense that it doesn't but it makes

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.230 
makes sense that it doesn't but it makes
it<00:05:29.250> extra<00:05:29.460> hard<00:05:29.610> as<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:29.880> can<00:05:29.970> see<00:05:30.120> this
