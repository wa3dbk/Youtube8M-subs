00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
way we are all artists and it's really

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.280 
way we are all artists and it's really
inspired<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.030> complete<00:00:15.750> environment

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
inspired to be in a complete environment

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.990 
inspired to be in a complete environment
of<00:00:16.439> artists<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.040> think<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.580> me<00:00:17.700> it<00:00:17.759> was<00:00:17.849> really

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
of artists I think for me it was really

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880 
of artists I think for me it was really
there<00:00:18.210> are<00:00:18.390> worms<00:00:18.599> like<00:00:19.110> dorm<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.740> your

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
there are worms like dorm that your

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.880 
there are worms like dorm that your
roommate<00:00:20.310> sort<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.910> started<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
roommate sort of started with that

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.250 
roommate sort of started with that
especially<00:00:22.890> art<00:00:23.220> students<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.789> think<00:00:24.260> they're

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
especially art students I think they're

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.720 
especially art students I think they're
a<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.619> more<00:00:27.680> introverted<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.580> they

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
a little bit more introverted so they

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
a little bit more introverted so they
kind<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.119> wait<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.359> other<00:00:30.689> people<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:32.220> make

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
kind of wait for other people to to make

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
to make friends if you're in the dorms I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.640 
to make friends if you're in the dorms I
think<00:00:50.030> just<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.119> you're<00:00:51.650> living

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
think just because you're living

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.030 
think just because you're living
together

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
together

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.439 
together
yeah<00:00:53.489> definitely<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.119> think<00:00:54.299> you've

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
yeah definitely and I think you've

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
yeah definitely and I think you've
learned<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.019> lot<00:00:55.170> about<00:00:55.470> yourself<00:00:55.619> and<00:00:56.220> how<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
learned a lot about yourself and how you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.850
