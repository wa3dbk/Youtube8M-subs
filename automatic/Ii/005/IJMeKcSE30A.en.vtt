 already with the guitar that it is the same if 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.320
 it's electric or Spanish acoustic and what 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.000
 let's look at a practical topic in a 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.489
 quique gonzÃ¡lez theme called 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.230

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.829
 pop rock and Spanish indie 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.740
 concerts interviews of everything 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.509
 well come let's zoom in 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.050
 and I also explain to you all the good things about 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.360
 this easy rock and roll we go there 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.420
 for the verses we are going to use three 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:22.380
 chords a yes a me and a side and like 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.740
 we build this very easy if we step on 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.160
 Fret two with your finger 1 fret 2 of the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.560
 fifth string with your finger 3 fret 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.640
 four of the fourth string and with your finger 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.159
 little finger fret 4 of the third string 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.130
 this is a yes 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.189
 try strumming only fifth and fourth 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.189
 third 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.740
 You can help yourself from the factor finger to 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.810
 cover the sixth string so it does not emit 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.950
 no noise but if it seems very 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.100
 difficult and is second I agreed a 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.130
 we raise these two fingers and make a 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.270
 mini capo here on the fret two and so 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 that we are left behind 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.330
 and in this same position only that the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.240
 we went down a step on a rope and we 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.240
 it remains fret 0 2 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.090
 nothing else 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.840
 if you have noticed my right hand we do 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.140
 all the eggs down but if you 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.120
 have you set let's say that at the time of 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.730
 change chords in this rock and roll 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.790
 and in other rock and roll is life and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.850
 from the bars we changed a little bit before 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:52.080
 of the first beat of compass that is 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:58.740
 We do not 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 in 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:02.520
 that and we do 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.590
 4 and then in that and between 4 and 1 is 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.100
 when we make the change when 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.100
 we track 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:30.020
 you've seen a little before very easy very 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.640
 easy and before going to the chorus in 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.050
 place to make a similar 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.050
 we do a if the ami 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.940
 all right 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.690
 it's the same but we've changed the order 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.840
 in the end 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.780
 and now we go to the chorus 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.670
 we see a new agreement but this position 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.100
 of fifths in the chord of if we the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.950
 we take to the 5th fret of the fifth string 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.489
 and we have a king so we make a king 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.489
 until 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.260

 is 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:51.030
 if we start again the 3 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.970
