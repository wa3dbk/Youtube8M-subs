00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.639
 wood fire was the only source of domestic heating for a long time 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.250
 so much so that many people at home do not want to give up the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.159
 nice to 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.279
 create a flame 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.279
 to warm the environment 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.609
 once in every house there is at least one fire 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.579
 based on climate needs, the lifestyle of the building type 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.469
 so there are developed different traditions of wood heating 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.140
 while in some areas of the Alpine arc the one that comes today has taken hold 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.900
 call accumulation stove 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.059
 ingram party italia the classic open fireplace was present in every home 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 all this the epoch of the industrial revolution following the 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.240
 which the cast iron stove before the economic kitchen after 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.660
 they started stealing space from the fireplace 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.390
 in effect the open fireplace is characterized by some drawbacks 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.460
 intrinsic 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 first of all the poor energy efficiency 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.520
 if on the one hand we have witnessed the loss of importance of the journey as 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.230
 source 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.960
 on the other hand, we have seen weight grow due to its aesthetic appearance 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.050
 thus the paradox of very beautiful expensive chimneys becomes more and more frequent 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.240
 characterized by very low efficiency hotel times even from serious 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.120
 draw problems our answer this problem is not the current one 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.909
 of the chimney insert but the heat storage stove fireplace 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 having behind it a very solid tradition of the so-called stove ad 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.000
 Tyrolean type accumulation 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.040
 we will never give up head offers benefits 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.810
 thus the accumulation stove fireplace is born 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.250
 in all respects a stove with a butt made re-proposing the style and the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.250
 form of the journey 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.460
 only slight difference in technical performance 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.229
 and the one linked to the size of the glass of the combustion chamber 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.999
 our fireplaces heat storage stoves 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.989
 therefore they offer the same advantages as that which is also called stove 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.159
 full Tyrolean that is 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.159
 very high energy efficiency 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.679
 great management convenience 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.669
 very high thermal comfort 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.739
 operation even in the absence of electricity 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.559
 no possibility of failure 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.669
 possibility to heat more rooms 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.869
 total customization 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.509
 thanks to the decades of experience of our smoking masters 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.059
 we are able to meet the needs of those 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:13.839
 in every part of Italy, even if he wants a dog at home, he doesn't want to give up 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.550
 efficiency at comfort 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.959
 and from the comfort of a classic main sheet music
