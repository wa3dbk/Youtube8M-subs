I<00:01:47.470> thought<00:01:48.070> we<00:01:48.189> got<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.369> wrong<00:01:48.520> route<00:01:48.759> to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
I thought we got the wrong route to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.340 
I thought we got the wrong route to
solve<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.240> bit<00:01:49.420> quieter<00:01:49.869> look<00:01:50.079> at<00:01:50.200> this

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
solve is a bit quieter look at this

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.100 
solve is a bit quieter look at this
absolutely<00:01:51.220> unbelievable<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.329> think<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:52.930> can

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
absolutely unbelievable I think you can

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.710 
absolutely unbelievable I think you can
see<00:01:53.289> what<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.560> means<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.039> whole<00:01:54.159> city<00:01:54.720> it's

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
see what it means to the whole city it's

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.840 
see what it means to the whole city it's
I<00:01:56.020> think<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.560> players<00:01:56.830> will<00:01:57.100> be<00:01:57.250> blown<00:01:57.700> away

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850
