00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.750
 used by the finished project which 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.420
 was proposed by the siberian home did you understand 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.780
 This model projects of European homes that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.279
 there is already where each like centimeters 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.310
 we will choose a practice we will choose a life 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.890
 often people when they design themselves they 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.019
 see that flight of fancy then them 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.849
 comes out sideways they did not take into account any 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 elementary norms well the first thing 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.050
 I liked it here and later 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.450
 we have seen that absence 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.450
 basement lack of these problems here 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.309
 cellular wastewater there sediments with 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.039
 which owners usually fight 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.130
 basements here and there was no speed 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.400
 in general it was surprised when it rained 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.520
 that is, it was about a month and a half 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.780
 can 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.190
 barely 2 if it had n't rained like us 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.520
 it would be faster 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.350
 that is, but even the neighbors of those around 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.280
 Nobody saw such houses like that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.650
 quickly 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.869
 Not only that, the screw piles were 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.210
 screwed literally one day before he 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.580
 literally threats before our eyes so we 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.520
 now happy that under the house here is a pudge 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.890
 This so-called skirt but under not this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.290
 the air he vents there no any 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.490
 stagnant waters this principle is very much 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.049
 happy like that and here 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.590
 insulation good like what's in it 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.080
 you even came in in winter that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.179
 he keeps warm even for a very long time 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.119
 Well, respectively, in the summer it is cool 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.570
 what an important point it cost even 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.509
 cheaper than usual in the face of the house because 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.190
 people when building a house always 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.340
 set up what is the cost 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.350
 but the house was built like you 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.899
 we did not build a bath house or there like a river 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.479
 why times I can say how long 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.360
 why stuff why type canadian house 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.360
 when we lived in Kamchatka we have a friend 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.229
 gathered such a house to surprise and drive - 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.790
 America sent we saw just what 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.340
 the company is engaged on stream these 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.960
 things and we realized that we do not need 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.190
 will be 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.170
 drives we won't need anything 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.220
 invent that is the company is already doing 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 these houses 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.430
 we kind of took advantage of the reviews of one 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.030
 the man who already built this house 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.480
 here in Novosibirsk bravely accepted 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.480
 decision
