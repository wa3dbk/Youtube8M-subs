00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
episode now what we're doing at this

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.100 
episode now what we're doing at this
point<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.340> we're<00:00:11.700> just<00:00:11.730> simply<00:00:12.240> tighten<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
point is we're just simply tighten the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.450 
point is we're just simply tighten the
rope<00:00:13.259> onto<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.620> various<00:00:13.889> spurts<00:00:14.130> hooking

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
rope onto the various spurts hooking

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.670 
rope onto the various spurts hooking
everything<00:00:14.549> up<00:00:15.170> it<00:00:16.170> took<00:00:16.260> us<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.440> little<00:00:16.560> while

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
everything up it took us a little while

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.010 
everything up it took us a little while
to<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.400> our<00:00:17.580> first<00:00:17.820> time<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.869> had<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
to do so is our first time but we had a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.540 
to do so is our first time but we had a
pretty<00:00:19.199> good<00:00:19.350> idea<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.740> how<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:19.920> need<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.490> it

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
pretty good idea of how we need to do it

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.679 
pretty good idea of how we need to do it
cool<00:00:21.710> then<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:23.250> took<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> thing<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.420> we

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
cool then we took the thing out and we

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.019 
cool then we took the thing out and we
each<00:00:24.869> had<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> go<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.800> hurt<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.430> hell<00:00:26.490> because

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
each had a go it hurt like hell because

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.939 
each had a go it hurt like hell because
we<00:00:27.330> were<00:00:27.390> holding<00:00:27.689> ropes<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.470> were<00:00:28.529> pulling

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
we were holding ropes that were pulling

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.880 
we were holding ropes that were pulling
very<00:00:29.160> tights<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.849> our<00:00:30.060> hands<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.740> that<00:00:31.740> was

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
very tights on our hands and that was

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.970 
very tights on our hands and that was
very<00:00:32.130> unpleasant<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.469> added<00:00:34.649> some

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
very unpleasant so then we added some

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.580 
very unpleasant so then we added some
hand<00:00:35.219> holds<00:00:35.550> these<00:00:36.540> made<00:00:36.930> things<00:00:37.200> much<00:00:37.530> easier

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
hand holds these made things much easier

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.670 
hand holds these made things much easier
and<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:39.239> you're<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> see

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and so now you're going to get to see

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
and so now you're going to get to see
some<00:00:40.950> clips<00:00:41.160> which<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:42.090> much<00:00:42.329> like

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
some clips which are very much like

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
some clips which are very much like
their<00:00:43.260> clips<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.829> will<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.040> seen<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
their clips you will have seen in the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.910 
their clips you will have seen in the
other<00:00:44.550> episodes<00:00:45.440> now<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
other episodes now I just want to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
other episodes now I just want to
interrupt<00:00:47.250> myself<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.120> an<00:00:48.450> important

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
interrupt myself here with an important

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.549 
interrupt myself here with an important
point<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> look<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.940> how<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.289> go

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
point I have a look at how we and I go

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.979 
point I have a look at how we and I go
how<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.280> shoot<00:00:53.610> stays<00:00:53.940> fairly<00:00:54.300> full<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
how the shoot stays fairly full and I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.680 
how the shoot stays fairly full and I
get<00:00:55.230> really<00:00:55.710> pulled<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.460> hard<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.090> then

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
get really pulled really hard and then

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.299 
get really pulled really hard and then
you<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> look<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.289> me<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.440> turn<00:00:58.680> goes<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
you have a look at me in turn goes and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.040 
you have a look at me in turn goes and
he<00:00:59.550> still<00:00:59.760> gets<00:00:59.940> pulled<00:01:00.180> hard<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.780> their

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
he still gets pulled hard but their

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.130 
he still gets pulled hard but their
chute<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:01.680> often<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.250> come<00:01:02.520> down<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.960> then

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
chute will often have come down and then

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.530 
chute will often have come down and then
we'll<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.409> moments<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.979> pauses<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
we'll be moments when it pauses so the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.780 
we'll be moments when it pauses so the
moral<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> story<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.500> while<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.760> can

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
moral of the story is that while you can

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
moral of the story is that while you can
jump<00:01:09.210> around<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.750> fair<00:01:09.960> bit<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.590> still<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
jump around a fair bit you still have to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
jump around a fair bit you still have to
maintain<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.610> tension<00:01:12.270> otherwise<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.810> soon

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
maintain that tension otherwise as soon

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.170 
maintain that tension otherwise as soon
as<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.470> lose<00:01:13.950> too<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.430> tension<00:01:14.790> thing

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
as you lose too much tension thing

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
as you lose too much tension thing
you'll<00:01:15.330> completely<00:01:15.750> lose<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> power<00:01:16.530> any

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you'll completely lose all the power any

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.820 
you'll completely lose all the power any
right<00:01:17.340> back<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> show<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.650> about

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
right back to the show so right about

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
right back to the show so right about
now<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:20.369> seeing<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.820> footage<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.330> was

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
now you're seeing the footage that was

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.310 
now you're seeing the footage that was
used<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> talky<00:01:22.560> episode<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.170> have

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
used in the talky episode and so we have

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
used in the talky episode and so we have
each<00:01:25.500> head<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.890> Hugo's<00:01:26.250> doing<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.150> we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
each head of Hugo's doing that and we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480 
each head of Hugo's doing that and we
only<00:01:27.869> needed<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> few<00:01:28.350> guys<00:01:28.710> before<00:01:28.979> who<00:01:29.369> are

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
only needed a few guys before who are

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.200 
only needed a few guys before who are
tired<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.270> sore<00:01:31.759> but<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.880> couldn't

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
tired and very sore but we couldn't

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.719 
tired and very sore but we couldn't
leave<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.950> took<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.400> thing

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
leave it at that and so I took the thing

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.999 
leave it at that and so I took the thing
out<00:01:35.850> again<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.840> time<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.409> wanted<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> test

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
out again and this time I wanted to test

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.330 
out again and this time I wanted to test
out<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> few<00:01:38.430> ideas<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:40.259> most<00:01:40.470> notable<00:01:41.009> is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
out a few ideas the most notable is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.050 
out a few ideas the most notable is
where<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.890> took<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> top<00:01:44.310> ones<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.820> put<00:01:44.909> an

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
where I took the top ones and put an

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.929 
where I took the top ones and put an
extra<00:01:45.360> knot<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.899> they're<00:01:46.560> top<00:01:46.920> corners<00:01:49.939> I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
extra knot if they're top corners I

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.679 
extra knot if they're top corners I
decided<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.170> revert<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:53.460> their<00:01:53.729> third<00:01:54.060> outing

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
decided to revert on their third outing

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.709 
decided to revert on their third outing
because<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.880> would<00:01:57.000> deflate<00:01:57.390> too

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
because that's it would deflate too

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.260 
because that's it would deflate too
easily<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:59.610> takes<00:01:59.790> us<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.149> our<00:02:00.180> third

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
easily so that takes us to our third

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.350 
easily so that takes us to our third
outing<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.000> their<00:02:03.180> most

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
outing and this is this is their most

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.679 
outing and this is this is their most
successful<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.290> far<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:06.360> we've<00:02:06.540> had

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
successful so far and here we've had

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.089 
successful so far and here we've had
some<00:02:06.869> fun<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> wind<00:02:07.950> was

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
some fun here but the wind was

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.190 
some fun here but the wind was
completely<00:02:08.580> inconsistent<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:10.020> one

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
completely inconsistent and that's one

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.510 
completely inconsistent and that's one
of<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> advantages<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.099> hell<00:02:11.280> was<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
of the advantages of the hell was that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.200 
of the advantages of the hell was that
the<00:02:11.760> wind<00:02:11.940> was<00:02:12.120> always<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.720> same

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
the wind was always going to same

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.760 
the wind was always going to same
because<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.840> was<00:02:13.990> being<00:02:14.170> channeled<00:02:14.590> that

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
because that was being channeled that

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.030 
because that was being channeled that
way<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.180> next<00:02:16.360> outing<00:02:17.230> I'm<00:02:17.560> hoping<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.950> be

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
way so the next outing I'm hoping to be

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.330 
way so the next outing I'm hoping to be
up<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.370> hill<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:19.890> I've<00:02:20.890> made<00:02:21.130> some

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
up on the hill so I've made some

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.970 
up on the hill so I've made some
modifications<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:23.140> I'm<00:02:23.350> looking<00:02:23.500> over<00:02:23.800> at

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
modifications there I'm looking over at

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.370 
modifications there I'm looking over at
the<00:02:24.040> battens<00:02:24.370> as<00:02:24.520> I'm<00:02:24.700> saying<00:02:24.910> this<00:02:25.320> I've<00:02:26.320> made

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the battens as I'm saying this I've made

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.680 
the battens as I'm saying this I've made
some<00:02:26.860> modifications<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.940> those<00:02:28.390> are<00:02:28.570> going

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
some modifications and those are going

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.470 
some modifications and those are going
to<00:02:28.780> be<00:02:28.930> in<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.050> future<00:02:29.380> episode<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:30.480> they're

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
to be in a future episode and they're

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.690 
to be in a future episode and they're
really<00:02:32.200> going<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.530> enable<00:02:33.100> some<00:02:33.250> interesting

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
really going to enable some interesting

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.420 
really going to enable some interesting
things<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.030> happen
