00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.560 
computer-generated stuff when we're
filming<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> live<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.610> took<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.090> more<00:00:45.149> there

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
filming it live it took a lot more there

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.029 
filming it live it took a lot more there
was<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> lot<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.110> questions<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.739> answers

going<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.520> while<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.910> were<00:00:48.030> filming<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> first

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
going on while we were filming the first

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.270 
going on while we were filming the first
one<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.649> exactly<00:00:49.860> how<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
make it better faster quicker so it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.860 
make it better faster quicker so it
didn't<00:00:53.190> take<00:00:53.250> us<00:00:53.489> long<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.820> film<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> the
