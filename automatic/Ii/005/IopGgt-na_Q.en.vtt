00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
I think first you know a bit visit is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.810 
I think first you know a bit visit is
one<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> top<00:01:13.950> clubs<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> country

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that's all so that's why it was very

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.700
