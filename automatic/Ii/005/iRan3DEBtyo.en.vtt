00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
reseller of mastercam and that was the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.549 
reseller of mastercam and that was the
program<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.550> used<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> actual

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
program that was used for the actual

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.920 
program that was used for the actual
milling<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.549> propeller<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.510> important

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
milling of the propeller the important

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.350 
milling of the propeller the important
part<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.909> only<00:01:09.000> did<00:01:09.240> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
part of this was that not only did we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.760 
part of this was that not only did we
have<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.630> replicate<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.619> had<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
have to replicate it but we had to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.160 
have to replicate it but we had to
replicate<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> exactly<00:01:11.750> which<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.140> course

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
replicate it exactly which is of course

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.039 
replicate it exactly which is of course
the<00:01:13.530> feature<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.070> digital<00:01:14.670> scanning<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.450> in

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the feature of digital scanning and in

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.370 
the feature of digital scanning and in
reproducing<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.369> CNC<00:01:17.909> machines<00:01:18.420> today<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
reproducing with CNC machines today the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
reproducing with CNC machines today the
exactness<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> propeller<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.790> important

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
exactness of the propeller is important

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.170 
exactness of the propeller is important
because<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.860> designed<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.729> this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
because it was designed for this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.590 
because it was designed for this
specific<00:01:24.479> engine<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> without<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.909> mating

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
specific engine and without that mating

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
specific engine and without that mating
we<00:01:28.080> wouldn't<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> performance<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
we wouldn't get the performance on the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.890 
we wouldn't get the performance on the
airplane<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.509> original

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
airplane we have the original

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
airplane we have the original
performance<00:01:31.079> figures<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.100> our<00:01:33.090> flight<00:01:33.390> test

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
performance figures and our flight test

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.020 
performance figures and our flight test
program<00:01:33.750> will<00:01:34.500> show<00:01:34.710> us<00:01:34.829> how<00:01:34.979> close<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
program will show us how close we get to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.679 
program will show us how close we get to
those<00:01:36.180> figures<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.799> propeller<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
those figures but the propeller is

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.260 
those figures but the propeller is
integrals<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.920> performance<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.070> courses<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
integrals and performance of courses is

mastercam and his great team have helped

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.990 
mastercam and his great team have helped
us<00:01:48.390> produce<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.990> propeller<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
us produce this propeller and this is a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.090 
us produce this propeller and this is a
cut<00:01:51.329> down<00:01:51.360> version<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.470> test<00:01:52.710> club

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
cut down version this is the test club

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.860 
cut down version this is the test club
that<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.060> used

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
that will be used

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.720 
that will be used
and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.280> next<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.910> be<00:01:56.940> for<00:01:57.120> flight
