so<00:01:31.400> real<00:01:31.640> inflation<00:01:32.060> at<00:01:32.930> least<00:01:33.290> when<00:01:33.860> we're

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
so real inflation at least when we're

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.250 
so real inflation at least when we're
talking<00:01:34.250> about<00:01:34.310> gasoline<00:01:34.930> is<00:01:35.930> somewhere
