00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.860
 in this tutorial show how to talk like 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.509
 to mount a coupling correctly 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.050
 i pay back words like style for 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.050
 not urgent 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:34.790
 go with the drain of the engine oil 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.609
 the drain plug are just about everyone 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.289
 vehicle in different places 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.510
 again laterally below the car 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.910
 motors 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.839
 then take a takeover drink 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.019
 the leaves clutch it to the trunks and 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.749
 I have to face the parliamentary demo trubel 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.470
 later also later enthof 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:58.710
 use 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.460
 We recommend we see how 40 are full 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.190
 would go to the brake lever and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.410
 other disturbing parts away so that they the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.410
 can cover tents 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.390
 you are now the screws from 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.390
 clutch corp 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.280
 Take the clutch is springer 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.280
 out 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:42.040
 so you can use the clutch pressure plate 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.580
 lose weight and see the names match them 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.090
 so that the part does not fall out 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.940
 Investigate from behind pen that everyone 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:59.380
 vehicle placed differently and 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:03.310
 is loose to you now the old camels 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.620
 now cc the inside and the big basket 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.220
 Check them the payments the plant 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.210
 all are still good 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.670
 not that's why it's distributed and 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.030
 similar now has the opportunity 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.540
 the people in winterberg now just them 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.090
 they always start with the new clutch 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.340
 the ball on the 11th 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.890
 So where is the coating and then always 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.690
 alternating steel slats lamellar stall 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:36.860
 stay until all element14 and set the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.060
 pressure plate run put the coop lux 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.060
 spring back in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:52.590
 insert the screws and pull 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.390
 also be careful about cross with the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.810
 right rotary momentary instrument 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.760
 you will find books in your workshops 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.410
 informel books or just times 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.450
 ask for the size and of the screws 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.520
 kevin the now check out the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.820
 operability of the clutch whether the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:17.730
 clutch triggers so went in the town hall 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.860
 but and their good side lids 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.959
 Do not forget the seal too 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.070
 assemble tip direction too short too 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.239
 example with lions 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:33.840
 With that something falls off , now she sees 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.400
 the screws cross over evenly and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.180
 again with magnificent torque 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.760
 do not over tighten 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.910
 and here are all the other parts needed 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.209
 had to dismantle before and now can 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.959
 we fill the motor oil we fill 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.330
 recommend 10.40 ethic engine oil 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.110
 you can also take mineral oil but 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.260
 take it to decorate 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.500
 We hope you have your golf 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.100

 Dusty version will not be 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.530
 problems no longer have more desire 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.500
 have and have a clutch at all 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.150
 highest burden 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.519
