00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.429
 Orchid Orchid Transplant Not 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 it is recommended to repot often do 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.469
 it is better only when the plants 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.949
 strongly grown or the substrate is completely 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.170
 decomposed average adults and fitny 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.920
 orchids are recommended to replant once a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.740
 two to three years ground orchid losing and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.699
 Forward rest poop requires annual 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.369
 transplants and records of goods on a regular basis every 6 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.680
 8 months substrate change well 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.610
 responds only young to three 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.420
 phalaenopsis orchid roots have periods 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.640
 active growth and rest periods since 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.829
 transplant time is related to the period 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.980
 root activity then transplant 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.020
 Orchid can be year-round optimal 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.610
 time for transplanting most species 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.260
 as usual spring or early summer 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.800
 active growth feeds occur in the period 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.309
 the release of new growth y-sin fake 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.460
 orchids and the emergence of a new leaf in 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.010
 about perfect perfect replant 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.010
 orchid before starting root 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.320
 activity if you have the opportunity 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.900
 look at the tip of your roots 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.450
 orchids you will see what they have 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.049
 uniform color ax not able 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 rest 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.000
 if on roots noticeable bright green 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.070
 Donuts Means Roots Growing Up 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 A transplant during this period is undesirable because 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.939
 how young 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.390
 the tips are very easily damaged and 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.790
 the root stops developing however 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.399
 if root activity started a 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.950
 transplant still need to go by 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.040
 wait until the young roots grow back 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.630
 at least five centimeters with such 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.119
 length they can already 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.390
 form side branches in the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.700
 If the club is damaged by the main three 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.189
 orchid transplants remember that their 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.399
 the roots are more fragile than most 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.740
 other plants to reduce the risk to 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.649
 the minimum is to follow a number 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.159
 rules 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.000
 you need to plant well before transplanting 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:17.689
 moisten for easier separation 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.750
 the roots 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.579
 from the walls of the pot if the old pot 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.760
 plastic then make it be 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:28.220
 pretty easy if the orchid grew in 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.670
 clay pot you have to work hard 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.430
 the roots are likely to stick to the walls and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.280
 wooden will be required for their separation 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.489
 wand a little patience 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.069
 if the ceramic pot is not poured 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.430
 inside , it may even have to 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.010
 smash extracted and soak the plant 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.810
 in the slop slightly warm water this 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.200
 necessary in order for the roots 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.629
 completely swollen and easy from them 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.420
 old substrate is separated if some 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.599
 pieces of bark holding tight not worth them 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.730
 it's better to tear it remain until 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.590
 orchid soaks mix in advance 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.310
 cooked ingredients new 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.709
 substrate by removing the old substrate 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.160
 inspect the roots on the subject of the book 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.470
 dead roots and so on as well 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.840
 remove from the top and the bulb is not worth it 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.449
 tear off the dead roots with their hands better 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.049
 cut with a sharp clean knife then alive 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.840
 fabrics 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.470
 chris desire at the same time carry out 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.480
 division 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.669
 tiempo de ichal orchids all cuts 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.389
 dry and powder crushed 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:41.079
 charcoal can use sulfur 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.359
 or another fungicide for disinfection 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.569
 need to pour a new pot drainage 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:50.569
 we stack a part of the substrate and carefully 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.329
 we put the plant gradually pour 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.419
 substrate and tapping the pot on the walls 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.060
 for more uniform filling not 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:02.479
 aim to shove all the pot 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.099
 shove all these roots in there 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.790
 several of them will stay on 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.500
 surface or completely out of substrate 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.569
 the substrate should not be heavily tamped 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.199
 but need to be carefully strengthened 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.440
 plant in it so that it does not stagger 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:19.780
 it is advisable to cover the substrate with moss in 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.990
 wow 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.460
 against bacteria and plays well 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.560
 transfer of orchids to new more 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.130
 spacious dishes used extremely 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.460
 rarely well if you are sure that old 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.130
 the substrate did not decompose plants too 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.740
 it has grown that then you can put 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.349
 root ball sometimes even with old 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.169
 dishes if the orchid grew in a basket 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:48.349
 in a more spacious capacity and spans 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.819
 Filled with new substrate transplanted 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:54.560
 the plant is not watered better just 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:57.169
 spray it a little bit and put on 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.400
 two or three weeks to a more specific 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:04.150
 place with higher humidity 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.090
 This is very important in the greenhouse 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.270
 at the end of the adapter adapter 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.080
 period plants can then be placed on 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.729
 permanent place correct transplant not 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.389
 should adversely affect 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:23.509
 plant and that year she owes you 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.250
 whistles however for not former actions 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.919
 you can pay for years 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.620
 summing up let's say that the main 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:36.340
 orchid transplanting tools 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.340
 is your patience and care
