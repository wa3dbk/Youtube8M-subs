00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
this is different than our previous

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.230 
this is different than our previous
seven<00:00:08.820> strand<00:00:09.179> braids<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.580> I'm<00:00:11.580> going<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
seven strand braids and I'm going to

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.020 
seven strand braids and I'm going to
show<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.630> picture<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:13.620> found

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
show you a picture here that we found

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.810 
show you a picture here that we found
online<00:00:15.080> and<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:16.859> what<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> Senate<00:00:17.609> braid

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
online and that's what a Senate braid

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.730 
online and that's what a Senate braid
looks<00:00:18.119> like<00:00:18.359> they've<00:00:19.020> used<00:00:19.320> some<00:00:19.470> other

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
looks like they've used some other

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.529 
looks like they've used some other
strands<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:20.550> we're<00:00:20.730> gonna<00:00:20.939> incorporate

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
strands but we're gonna incorporate

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.390 
strands but we're gonna incorporate
those<00:00:21.930> strands<00:00:22.260> together<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.890> make<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> seven

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
those strands together and make a seven

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.929 
those strands together and make a seven
strand<00:00:23.910> braid<00:00:24.269> I've<00:00:25.310> gone<00:00:26.310> ahead<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.609> put

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
strand braid I've gone ahead and put

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 
strand braid I've gone ahead and put
different<00:00:27.599> colored<00:00:27.869> elastics<00:00:28.560> onto<00:00:28.920> her<00:00:29.039> hair

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
different colored elastics onto her hair

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.800 
different colored elastics onto her hair
so<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.580> see<00:00:29.789> we've<00:00:29.939> got<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.119> purple<00:00:30.510> yellow

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
so you can see we've got a purple yellow

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.220 
so you can see we've got a purple yellow
red<00:00:31.380> pink<00:00:31.830> green<00:00:32.219> white<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.969> blue<00:00:33.270> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
red pink green white and blue so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.020 
red pink green white and blue so
hopefully<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.680> will<00:00:34.770> help<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.910> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
hopefully that will help you kind of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.370 
hopefully that will help you kind of
keep<00:00:36.180> track<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.600> what's<00:00:36.750> going<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
keep track of what's going on because it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.770 
keep track of what's going on because it
will<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:37.920> confusing<00:00:38.399> at<00:00:38.700> first<00:00:38.780> now

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
will be a little confusing at first now

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.389 
will be a little confusing at first now
I'm<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> start<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.559> four<00:00:40.800> strands<00:00:41.190> on

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
I'm going to start with four strands on

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.700 
I'm going to start with four strands on
this<00:00:41.579> side<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.090> three<00:00:42.390> strands<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.440> side

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
this side and three strands on this side

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
this side and three strands on this side
I'm<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.000> take<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> outside<00:00:45.539> strand

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
I'm going to take that outside strand

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.139 
I'm going to take that outside strand
over<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:49.050> adjacent<00:00:49.350> strand<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.219> under<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
over the adjacent strand and under the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.799 
over the adjacent strand and under the
next<00:00:51.360> two<00:00:52.219> now<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.489> over<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:54.120> part<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
next two now it's over as part of this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.979 
next two now it's over as part of this
side<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:55.590> I've<00:00:55.680> got<00:00:55.829> three<00:00:56.129> over<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
side so now I've got three over here and

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.560 
side so now I've got three over here and
four<00:00:57.989> over<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.210> kind<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
four over here I like to just kind of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779 
four over here I like to just kind of
separate<00:01:00.930> them<00:01:01.050> between<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.559> fingers<00:01:02.010> now

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
separate them between my fingers now

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.070 
separate them between my fingers now
we're<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> move<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.629> side<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.960> has

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
we're going to move to the side that has

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.520 
we're going to move to the side that has
four<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> same<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:05.700> over<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.200> adjacent

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
four do the same thing over the adjacent

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.140 
four do the same thing over the adjacent
one<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.600> under<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.840> next<00:01:10.049> two<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:11.970> we've

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
one and under the next two so now we've

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
one and under the next two so now we've
just<00:01:12.360> switched<00:01:12.450> back<00:01:12.869> four<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.619> side

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
just switched back four on this side

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.340 
just switched back four on this side
three<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.790> side<00:01:16.070> repeat<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> steps<00:01:17.549> over

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
three on this side repeat the steps over

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.499 
three on this side repeat the steps over
the<00:01:19.350> adjacent<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:21.770> under<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> next<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:23.700> now

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the adjacent and under the next two now

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.550 
the adjacent and under the next two now
I'm<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> tell<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I'm going to tell you it's going to be a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
I'm going to tell you it's going to be a
lot<00:01:25.830> easier<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.670> hairstyle<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
lot easier to do this hairstyle with a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.770 
lot easier to do this hairstyle with a
wet<00:01:27.659> hair<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.729> here<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.030> hopefully<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.659> can

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
wet hair so here we go hopefully you can

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.719 
wet hair so here we go hopefully you can
see<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> okay<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.400> take<00:01:32.670> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
see that okay I'm gonna take this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.590 
see that okay I'm gonna take this
outside<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.509> over<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:35.360> under<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.570> next<00:01:36.960> two

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
outside one over and under the next two

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
outside one over and under the next two
so<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.229> how<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.439> pattern

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
so you can kind of see how that pattern

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
so you can kind of see how that pattern
is<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:42.229> over<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:44.450> under<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.049> next<00:01:46.380> two

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
is going over and under the next two

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
is going over and under the next two
that<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.280> confusing<00:01:47.579> holding

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that can be a little confusing holding

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.960 
that can be a little confusing holding
all<00:01:48.509> these<00:01:48.659> strands<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.409> keep<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.970> but

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
all these strands as you keep going but

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.450 
all these strands as you keep going but
you'll<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.049> once<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.680> keep<00:01:52.860> practicing

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you'll get it once you keep practicing

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
you'll get it once you keep practicing
so<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.390> gonna<00:01:54.540> continue<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.380> braid

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
so I'm just gonna continue this braid

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
so I'm just gonna continue this braid
over<00:01:59.030> under<00:02:01.369> now<00:02:02.369> I've<00:02:02.520> kind<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.820> lost<00:02:03.000> track

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
over under now I've kind of lost track

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.910 
over under now I've kind of lost track
of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.659> elastics<00:02:04.259> since<00:02:04.469> we're<00:02:04.619> getting<00:02:04.799> down

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
of the elastics since we're getting down

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
of the elastics since we're getting down
to<00:02:04.979> where<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.460> were<00:02:05.520> tightened<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.689> I'm

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
to where they were tightened but I'm

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.240 
to where they were tightened but I'm
gonna<00:02:06.930> keep<00:02:07.170> moving<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.129> how

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
gonna keep moving on so you can see how

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.640 
gonna keep moving on so you can see how
this<00:02:08.369> braid<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.759> gonna<00:02:08.940> look<00:02:10.129> over

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
this braid is gonna look over

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.240 
this braid is gonna look over
under<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.720> now<00:02:15.840> I've<00:02:15.930> got<00:02:16.079> my<00:02:16.200> four<00:02:16.500> over<00:02:16.739> here

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
under so now I've got my four over here

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.920 
under so now I've got my four over here
and<00:02:17.340> I'll<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.700> take<00:02:17.970> my<00:02:18.030> elastics<00:02:18.629> out<00:02:18.720> when

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
and I'll just take my elastics out when

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.330 
and I'll just take my elastics out when
I'm<00:02:19.049> done<00:02:19.230> with<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.470> braid<00:02:19.680> over<00:02:22.189> under<00:02:23.189> those

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
I'm done with the braid over under those

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.399 
I'm done with the braid over under those
next<00:02:23.760> two<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.239> add<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.599> onto<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.989> opposite

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
next two and add it onto the opposite

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.819 
next two and add it onto the opposite
side<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.010> now<00:02:26.819> we've<00:02:26.970> got<00:02:27.120> four<00:02:27.360> over<00:02:27.569> here

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.720 

over<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:32.459> adjacent<00:02:33.829> and<00:02:34.829> take<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.280> under

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
over the adjacent and take it under

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.339 
over the adjacent and take it under
those<00:02:35.909> next<00:02:36.209> two<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.629> slide<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.079> over<00:02:39.349> it's

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
those next two and slide it over it's

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.530 
those next two and slide it over it's
really<00:02:40.739> not<00:02:40.920> hard<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.489> concept<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.239> just

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
really not hard in concept it's just

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.349 
really not hard in concept it's just
keeping<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.170> strands<00:02:44.150> where<00:02:45.150> they

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
keeping all the strands where they

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.970 
keeping all the strands where they
should<00:02:45.569> be<00:02:45.780> as<00:02:45.900> you're<00:02:46.079> working<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
should be as you're working that's the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.580 
should be as you're working that's the
tricky<00:02:47.340> part

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
tricky part

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.750 
tricky part
especially<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:49.739> dry<00:02:49.950> hair<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.370> becomes

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
especially with dry hair it becomes

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.640 
especially with dry hair it becomes
almost<00:02:51.180> somewhat<00:02:51.959> impossible<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.709> do

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
almost somewhat impossible to do

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.330 
almost somewhat impossible to do
over-under<00:02:55.650> those<00:02:55.859> next<00:02:56.129> two<00:02:57.950> now<00:02:58.950> you'll<00:02:59.099> see

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
over-under those next two now you'll see

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.270 
over-under those next two now you'll see
that<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.840> take<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.019> over<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.470> Strand<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.069> then

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
that I take it over the Strand and then

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.640 
that I take it over the Strand and then
what<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.489> do<00:03:02.639> is<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.000> grab<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.239> strand<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.989> then

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
what I do is I grab that strand and then

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.960 
what I do is I grab that strand and then
I<00:03:04.829> grab<00:03:05.099> those<00:03:05.280> next<00:03:05.760> two<00:03:06.120> with<00:03:06.450> one<00:03:06.720> finger<00:03:07.970> to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
I grab those next two with one finger to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.729 
I grab those next two with one finger to
move<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.389> strand<00:03:09.780> over<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.709> a

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
move that strand over it just is a

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.649 
move that strand over it just is a
little<00:03:10.920> simpler<00:03:11.340> for<00:03:11.670> me<00:03:11.790> okay<00:03:12.329> go<00:03:12.480> ahead<00:03:12.569> and

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
little simpler for me okay go ahead and

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.839 
little simpler for me okay go ahead and
tip<00:03:12.840> your<00:03:12.870> head<00:03:13.079> down<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.290> little<00:03:13.530> honey<00:03:16.849> over

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
tip your head down a little honey over

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:26.000 
tip your head down a little honey over
the<00:03:18.000> adjacent<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:20.540> under<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.750> next<00:03:22.139> two<00:03:25.010> over

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
the adjacent and under the next two over

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.900 
the adjacent and under the next two over
the<00:03:26.129> adjacent<00:03:27.620> under<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.829> next<00:03:29.069> two<00:03:31.910> let's

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
the adjacent under the next two let's

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.349 
the adjacent under the next two let's
just<00:03:33.120> continue<00:03:33.359> this<00:03:33.780> braid<00:03:34.079> down<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.209> can

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
just continue this braid down so we can

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.180 
just continue this braid down so we can
get<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> finished<00:03:36.870> product<00:03:37.260> for<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.889> I

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
get a finished product for you and I

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.589 
get a finished product for you and I
have<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.519> say<00:03:38.699> the<00:03:38.849> more<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.090> do<00:03:39.389> it<00:03:39.419> the

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
have to say the more you do it the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.439 
have to say the more you do it the
faster<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.769> becomes<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.609> do<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.940> it's<00:03:42.060> not<00:03:42.090> too

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
faster it becomes to do it it's not too

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.930 
faster it becomes to do it it's not too
hard<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.870> braid<00:03:43.109> it's<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.519> kind<00:03:44.879> of

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
hard of a braid it's just kind of

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:56.960 
hard of a braid it's just kind of
getting<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.419> rhythm

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.400 

and<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.060> can<00:03:58.270> see<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:58.930> making<00:03:59.140> a

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
and you can see that it's making a

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.790 
and you can see that it's making a
really<00:03:59.770> really<00:04:00.190> pretty

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.230 

style<00:04:03.700> here<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:06.310> got<00:04:06.460> a<00:04:06.490> nice<00:04:06.730> look<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.060> it

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
style here it's got a nice look to it

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.700 
style here it's got a nice look to it
this<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.930> actually<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> rope<00:04:08.980> tiny<00:04:10.380> trick<00:04:11.380> the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
this is actually a rope tiny trick the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.000 
this is actually a rope tiny trick the
center<00:04:12.070> rope<00:04:13.380> but<00:04:14.380> we've<00:04:14.560> gone<00:04:14.710> ahead<00:04:14.860> and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
center rope but we've gone ahead and

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.740 
center rope but we've gone ahead and
just<00:04:15.250> incorporate<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.790> into<00:04:16.060> braids<00:04:16.450> that's

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
just incorporate it into braids that's

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.170 
just incorporate it into braids that's
basically<00:04:17.170> all<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:17.530> braids<00:04:17.770> ours<00:04:18.180> different

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
basically all that braids ours different

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.220 
basically all that braids ours different
ways<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.900> twisting<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.530> braiding<00:04:20.950> in<00:04:21.070> tying

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
ways of twisting and braiding in tying

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.940 
ways of twisting and braiding in tying
ropes<00:04:23.230> and<00:04:23.500> all<00:04:23.620> sorts<00:04:23.980> of<00:04:24.010> things<00:04:24.220> like<00:04:24.340> that

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.080 

okay<00:04:29.950> let<00:04:30.100> me<00:04:30.190> walk<00:04:30.370> through<00:04:30.400> just<00:04:30.730> one<00:04:30.940> more

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
okay let me walk through just one more

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.520 
okay let me walk through just one more
time<00:04:31.330> as<00:04:31.510> we're<00:04:31.630> getting<00:04:31.840> down<00:04:31.960> hair<00:04:32.230> tip<00:04:32.410> your

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
time as we're getting down hair tip your

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.920 
time as we're getting down hair tip your
head<00:04:32.620> down<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:32.920> you<00:04:33.040> take<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.090> outside<00:04:34.240> strand

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
head down so you take the outside strand

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.820 
head down so you take the outside strand
over<00:04:35.230> its<00:04:36.010> adjacent<00:04:36.610> one<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.530> under<00:04:38.530> those

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
over its adjacent one and under those

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.770 
over its adjacent one and under those
next<00:04:39.100> two<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:39.640> that<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:39.910> gets<00:04:40.060> added<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.540> the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
next two so that it gets added to the

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.740 
next two so that it gets added to the
opposite<00:04:41.170> side<00:04:42.090> do<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.150> same<00:04:43.270> with<00:04:43.630> that

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
opposite side do the same with that

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.880 
opposite side do the same with that
