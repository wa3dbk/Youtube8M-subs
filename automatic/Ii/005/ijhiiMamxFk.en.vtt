00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.120
 good night my name is Jonathan if 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.299
 I did it 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.280
 I'm going to do the trick theme of 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.080
 engines in low gasoline engines 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.450
 displacement my companions of 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.110
 investigation are luis fernando 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.430
 hernandez jonathan his place diego 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.460
 bejarano frei engine 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.460
 what we intend with this job 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.120
 investigative is to demonstrate how you can 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.160
 do a trick on motor that is 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.070
 modified so that the superior power 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.830
 and a much more effective performance to the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.160
 time to start the engine 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.680
 as such for this you must get 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.610
 for a greater use of the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.129
 power the achieved some greater 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.250
 indexes of torque values then 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.380
 we have to make a series of changes or 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.800
 a series of tweaks to certain 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.350
 specific components within it 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.360
 engine make only the means we have 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.260
 to achieve that the engine provides a 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.080
 greater power is based on it 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.120
 several factors first is to increase the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.980
 displacement the second is to increase the 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.920
 rate of and double revolutions with 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.510
 engine the third is to increase the relationship 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.400
 of compression that is a very factor 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.730
 important the moment of performance 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.260
 engine and the fourth is to improve the 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.160
 carburation in the fuel inlet 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.520
 to the motor cameras this last point 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.490
 we can handle in various ways the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.880
 first is by modifying the parameters of 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.330
 carburetion of fuel inlet the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.490
 second time modified the pieces 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.460
 internal motor for this come sets 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.430
 or trick games that come as 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.650
 single pieces or complete sets from 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.520
 the valves up to the same 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.520
 crankshaft properly 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.079
 and these these these pieces have been 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.630
 specifically built for a 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.090
 much greater performance and a power and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.020
 an effective real power also 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.590
 much better 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.500
 what we have in reality that defined 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.560
 what to do with this project 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.010
 research is to demonstrate what steps 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.440
 must continue to be able to do the trick 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.630
 of motor properly and that we have left 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.600
 working as it should be that we stay 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.470
 working properly the first thing that 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.800
 must do is increase the cubic capacity 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.050
 in the pile it is known that by increasing the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.730
 displacement increases the power because 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.740
 there is a higher fuel consumption and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.500
 greater fuel input in the 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.310
 combustion chambers systems more 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.740
 effective is to lower a few 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.260
 millimeters so you can see the result 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.060
 inside the berlin stuff inside 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.070
 of shirts camera system 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.290
 combustion 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.630
 we have to take the same measure and the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.060
 same diameter of the symbols of the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.100
 pistons together with the same material 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.480
 so that we stay with the resistance 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.980
 adequate 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.659
 so that it also works 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.659
 so that it works for me 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.080
 the pistons properly and do not go 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.230
 to have a water hammer, let's go to 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.760
 have a break due to fatigue or lack 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.760
 of resistance of the same material 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.700
 we also have another very effective way 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.840
 to achieve this is taking into account the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.069
 modification of the valves or even 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.700
 the modification of the cylinder head 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.129
 when modifying the stock and reducing it 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.859
 how many tenths of a millimeter what 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.879
 we are doing that is to increase the 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:03.040
 compression ratio substantially 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.010
 this compression ratio is ultimately 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.799
 where he gives us the performance to the 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.900
 moment to put the mixture to work 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.599
 of moments in the explosion within the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.349
 combustion chamber the relationship of 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.709
 compression is directly governed 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:23.380
 towards the real efficiency of the engine for 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.979
 This is achieved by lowering the cylinder head 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.620
 it is necessary to replace it at the level of 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.020
 she as a specialized kit but 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.330
 make a brush by calculating a process 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.750
 of rectification so that we stay with 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.789
 the highest compression ratio in 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.729
 regarding the camshafts and storks 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.770
 what can be done is a burnished or 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.160
 give it more strength properties 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.380
 to the movement or the regime of rotation to 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.020
 high speeds this is obtained 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.590
 also adding precise materials 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.100
 as 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.410
 titan carbide and not within the 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.680
 same injuries that they have constituted 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.720
 these material materials and also in 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.720
 last we can think of a change 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.630
 possible piece by a new set 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.900
 that already comes in a kit in a kit 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.190
 forged to touch the motors what 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.500
 which is essentially done 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.840
 is to increase the step or increase the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.810
 diameter of the cams so that the 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.230
 valves are opening or closing 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:31.470
 much more slowly to give us a 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.480
 greater exhaust gas output and a 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.580
 greater fuel input with this 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.980
 we achieve efficiency 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.430
 we achieved speed and a bigger wheel and a 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.800
 higher rate of rotation especially at high 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.440
 revolutions where we have to achieve 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.050
 a higher effective average power 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.410
 after doing this job what 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.200
 what we look for qualitatively is more or 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.200
 minus an increase between 20 and 30 per 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.660
 hundred of the definite real power 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.240
 that has the vehicle or the engine from 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.700
 that leaves the factory with this trick then 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.009
 we can considerably increase this 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.839
 no need 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.059
 to put the turbo system 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:14.159
 food that is another subject very 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:18.979
 different what we want is to demonstrate 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:22.080
 that you do not need to change 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.569
 many components but doing more 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.360
 well a specialized job in hand 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.279
 a good the certifier we can achieve 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.740
 that these components give us a maximum 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.960
 performance and give us a very good 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.689
 power so the engine would be left with a 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.670
 Real power gestiba of 30 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.890
 cent 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.890
 he showed research work 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.720
 I wanted to share it with you my name 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.110
 it's jonathan just talk thank you very much 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.110
 for your time
