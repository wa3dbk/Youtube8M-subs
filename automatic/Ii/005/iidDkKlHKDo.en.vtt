00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.800 
will be enough to cover the hardware to
protect<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.829> hardware<00:04:21.250> from<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.609> rain<00:04:21.810> if

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
protect the hardware from the rain if

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.750 
protect the hardware from the rain if
your<00:04:22.990> bag<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.229> canvas<00:04:23.919> or<00:04:24.130> something<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.639> you

your bag is canvas or something that you
want<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.600> is<00:04:25.660> it<00:04:28.620> if<00:04:29.620> your<00:04:29.800> bag<00:04:29.979> is<00:04:30.220> canvas<00:04:30.729> or

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
want that is it if your bag is canvas or

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.150 
want that is it if your bag is canvas or
something<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.360> isn't<00:04:31.570> waterproof<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:33.010> you

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
something that isn't waterproof then you

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.060 
something that isn't waterproof then you
take<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.669> second<00:04:34.210> contractor<00:04:34.990> bag<00:04:35.169> inside<00:04:35.860> of

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
take a second contractor bag inside of

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.710 
take a second contractor bag inside of
the<00:04:36.160> first<00:04:36.400> one<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:36.970> will<00:04:37.120> hang<00:04:37.270> down<00:04:37.510> and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
the first one and it will hang down and

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.529 
the first one and it will hang down and
cover<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.110> entire<00:04:38.139> bag<00:04:39.090> now<00:04:40.090> I'm<00:04:40.270> going<00:04:40.479> to

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
cover the entire bag now I'm going to

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.219 
cover the entire bag now I'm going to
attach<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.050> mine<00:04:42.510> this<00:04:43.510> bag<00:04:43.870> is<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.139> little

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
attach it to mine this bag is a little

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.400 
attach it to mine this bag is a little
funny-looking<00:04:45.099> because<00:04:45.280> it's<00:04:45.460> homemade<00:04:46.410> but

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
funny-looking because it's homemade but

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.970 
funny-looking because it's homemade but
it<00:04:47.530> has<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.740> waterproof<00:04:48.190> skin

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.350 

basically<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.250> reason<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.640> cut<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.000> bucket

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
basically the reason I cut the bucket

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.240 
basically the reason I cut the bucket
short<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.080> don't<00:04:58.290> want<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.590> interfering

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
short is you don't want to interfering

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.860 
short is you don't want to interfering
with<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.520> hardware<00:04:59.880> especially<00:05:00.510> if<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.690> have

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
with the hardware especially if you have

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:12.320 
with the hardware especially if you have
the<00:05:00.920> 3<00:05:01.920> chainpipe<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:10.790> this<00:05:11.790> covers<00:05:12.300> the

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
the 3 chainpipe and this covers the

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.600 
the 3 chainpipe and this covers the
hanging<00:05:12.900> hardware<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.710> half<00:05:14.100> of<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.430> bag

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
hanging hardware and half of the bag

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.330 
hanging hardware and half of the bag
again<00:05:15.570> if<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:15.930> don't<00:05:16.230> have<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.500> one<00:05:16.770> if<00:05:17.040> your

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
again if you don't have a one if your

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.790 
again if you don't have a one if your
back<00:05:17.520> doesn't<00:05:17.970> have<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> waterproof<00:05:18.510> skin<00:05:19.080> then

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
back doesn't have a waterproof skin then

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.380 
back doesn't have a waterproof skin then
you<00:05:19.950> simply<00:05:20.340> cut<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.700> bottom<00:05:21.030> out<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.210> a

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
you simply cut the bottom out of a

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.770 
you simply cut the bottom out of a
second<00:05:21.830> contractor<00:05:22.830> bag<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.370> tape<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.660> the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
second contractor bag and tape it to the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:34.400 
second contractor bag and tape it to the
inside<00:05:25.200> of<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.530> first<00:05:25.770> one<00:05:32.000> okay<00:05:33.000> here<00:05:33.930> is<00:05:34.200> the

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
inside of the first one okay here is the

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.020 
inside of the first one okay here is the
heavy<00:05:34.590> bag<00:05:34.950> outside<00:05:37.430> see<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.820> bag

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
heavy bag outside see that the bag

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.000 
heavy bag outside see that the bag
covers<00:05:39.510> about<00:05:39.840> half<00:05:40.140> of<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:40.530> covers<00:05:40.860> the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
covers about half of it it covers the

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.590 
covers about half of it it covers the
hardware<00:05:41.220> if<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:41.790> bag<00:05:41.970> didn't<00:05:42.390> have<00:05:42.570> a

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
hardware if the bag didn't have a

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.690 
hardware if the bag didn't have a
waterproof<00:05:43.020> skin<00:05:43.560> then<00:05:44.280> you<00:05:44.400> would<00:05:44.520> tape

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
waterproof skin then you would tape

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.440 
waterproof skin then you would tape
another<00:05:45.740> another<00:05:46.740> contractor<00:05:47.430> bag<00:05:47.670> inside<00:05:48.240> of

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
another another contractor bag inside of

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.790 
another another contractor bag inside of
the<00:05:48.540> first<00:05:48.780> one<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:50.210> of<00:05:51.210> course<00:05:51.650> when<00:05:52.650> you're

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
the first one and of course when you're

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.470 
the first one and of course when you're
training<00:05:53.040> if<00:05:53.370> this<00:05:53.550> is<00:05:53.730> in<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.000> way<00:05:54.150> you<00:05:54.450> just

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
training if this is in the way you just

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.740 
training if this is in the way you just
tuck<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:55.020> up<00:05:55.140> out<00:05:57.950> right<00:05:58.950> here<00:05:59.190> and<00:05:59.750> this

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
tuck it up out right here and this

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.860 
tuck it up out right here and this
allows<00:06:00.810> if<00:06:01.290> you<00:06:01.530> have<00:06:01.740> a<00:06:02.330> place<00:06:03.330> to<00:06:03.360> exercise

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
allows if you have a place to exercise

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:12.200 
allows if you have a place to exercise
outside<00:06:07.880> this<00:06:08.880> gives<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.510> nice<00:06:09.690> some<00:06:11.210> permanent

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
outside this gives a nice some permanent

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.120 
outside this gives a nice some permanent
waterproof<00:06:13.050> mount<00:06:13.350> for<00:06:13.650> a<00:06:13.680> heavy<00:06:13.890> bag<00:06:14.220> and<00:06:16.130> if

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
waterproof mount for a heavy bag and if

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.350 
waterproof mount for a heavy bag and if
you're<00:06:17.280> going<00:06:17.460> to<00:06:17.550> hang<00:06:17.730> it<00:06:17.880> off<00:06:18.000> a<00:06:18.030> pull-up

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
you're going to hang it off a pull-up

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.240 
you're going to hang it off a pull-up
bar<00:06:18.480> off<00:06:18.930> the<00:06:19.200> end<00:06:19.350> of<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.530> pull-up<00:06:19.740> bar<00:06:19.860> like

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
bar off the end of a pull-up bar like

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.020 
bar off the end of a pull-up bar like
this<00:06:20.540> then<00:06:21.540> I<00:06:21.690> suggest<00:06:21.930> it<00:06:22.380> be<00:06:22.790> parallel<00:06:23.790> with

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
this then I suggest it be parallel with

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.390 
this then I suggest it be parallel with
the<00:06:24.180> pull-up<00:06:24.510> bar<00:06:24.740> because<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.860> two<00:06:26.040> feet<00:06:26.280> of

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
the pull-up bar because the two feet of

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.920 
the pull-up bar because the two feet of
leverage<00:06:26.790> that<00:06:26.970> that<00:06:27.120> bag<00:06:27.330> is<00:06:27.510> pulling<00:06:27.900> down

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
leverage that that bag is pulling down

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.380 
leverage that that bag is pulling down
on<00:06:28.140> is<00:06:28.860> being<00:06:29.190> countered<00:06:29.580> by<00:06:29.730> six<00:06:30.060> feet<00:06:30.240> of
