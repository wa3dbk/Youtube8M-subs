here we have the driver's seat obviously

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.970 
here we have the driver's seat obviously
where<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.660> driver<00:02:02.870> sits<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.890> then

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980

this<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.850> Kevlar<00:02:11.330> fuel<00:02:11.720> system<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.230> as<00:02:12.620> you

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
this is a Kevlar fuel system and as you

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.860 
this is a Kevlar fuel system and as you
can<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:13.160> have<00:02:13.190> lots<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.870> horizontal

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
can see we have lots of horizontal

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.780 
can see we have lots of horizontal
baffles<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:15.500> now<00:02:16.340> if<00:02:16.490> we<00:02:16.520> didn't<00:02:16.760> have

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
baffles in there now if we didn't have

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.880 
baffles in there now if we didn't have
these<00:02:16.970> horizontal<00:02:17.270> baffles<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.440> fuel<00:02:18.710> would

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
these horizontal baffles the fuel would

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.590 
these horizontal baffles the fuel would
surge<00:02:19.160> around<00:02:19.490> ticking<00:02:19.940> under<00:02:20.090> braking<00:02:20.300> with

surge around ticking under braking with
a<00:02:20.630> high<00:02:20.870> IG<00:02:21.740> there<00:02:21.920> was<00:02:22.070> any<00:02:22.280> cornering<00:02:22.700> in

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
a high IG there was any cornering in

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.060 
a high IG there was any cornering in
each<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.600> baffles<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.230> little<00:02:24.890> flat

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
each of the baffles the little flat

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.800 
each of the baffles the little flat
vowels<00:02:25.460> which<00:02:25.820> allow<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.090> fuel<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.450> go<00:02:26.570> down

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
vowels which allow the fuel to go down

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.470 
vowels which allow the fuel to go down
but<00:02:27.230> not<00:02:27.350> only<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.100> as<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.340> fuel<00:02:28.580> fueled<00:02:29.090> rains

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
but not only so as the fuel fueled rains

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.840 
but not only so as the fuel fueled rains
fuel<00:02:30.140> could<00:02:30.290> never<00:02:30.470> come<00:02:30.710> above<00:02:31.340> one<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.730> these

fuel could never come above one of these
horizontal<00:02:32.120> baffles<00:02:32.510> by<00:02:33.440> doing<00:02:33.740> this<00:02:33.770> we<00:02:34.580> keep

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
horizontal baffles by doing this we keep

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.580 
horizontal baffles by doing this we keep
the<00:02:34.880> center<00:02:35.150> gravity<00:02:35.330> as<00:02:35.720> always<00:02:36.110> as<00:02:36.290> low<00:02:36.440> as

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the center gravity as always as low as

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.680 
the center gravity as always as low as
possible<00:02:36.790> there<00:02:37.790> are<00:02:37.850> also<00:02:37.940> lots<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.420> pipes

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
possible there are also lots of pipes

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.870 
possible there are also lots of pipes
and<00:02:39.080> pumps<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.770> here<00:02:39.980> these<00:02:40.310> are<00:02:40.490> positioned

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
and pumps in here these are positioned

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.570 
and pumps in here these are positioned
strategically<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:42.290> feed<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.920> engine<00:02:43.250> while

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
strategically to feed the engine while

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.210 
strategically to feed the engine while
also<00:02:43.820> allowing<00:02:44.270> your<00:02:44.630> fuel<00:02:44.810> cell<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.170> breathe

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.410 

we've<00:02:49.220> spoken<00:02:49.580> about<00:02:49.760> all<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.090> technical

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
we've spoken about all the technical

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.610 
we've spoken about all the technical
components<00:02:50.900> on<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.050> car<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.410> how<00:02:51.560> we

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
components on the car and how we

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.860 
components on the car and how we
position<00:02:51.860> them<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.520> package<00:02:52.820> them<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.180> guess

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
position them and package them I guess

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.020 
position them and package them I guess
the<00:02:53.960> final<00:02:54.260> piece<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.560> jigsaw<00:02:54.860> now<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.340> to

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
the final piece of the jigsaw now is to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.060 
the final piece of the jigsaw now is to
position<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.450> driver<00:02:56.690> some<00:02:57.590> say<00:02:57.740> he's<00:02:57.950> the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
position the driver some say he's the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.680 
position the driver some say he's the
most<00:02:58.220> important<00:02:58.670> part<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.000> car<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.480> we're

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
most important part of the car so we're

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.990 
most important part of the car so we're
so<00:02:59.960> let's<00:03:00.140> get<00:03:00.260> him<00:03:00.350> in<00:03:00.440> it's<00:03:01.280> important<00:03:01.880> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
so let's get him in it's important to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
so let's get him in it's important to
refit<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.930> are<00:03:03.020> not<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.470> normal<00:03:03.709> position

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
refit you are not in a normal position

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.850 
refit you are not in a normal position
you<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> lot<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.420> forces<00:03:06.020> especially<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.770> a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
you have a lot of forces especially in a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.699 
you have a lot of forces especially in a
crash<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.430> had<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.090> big<00:03:08.450> accident<00:03:08.630> last<00:03:09.200> year<00:03:09.380> in

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
crash I had a big accident last year in

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.000 
crash I had a big accident last year in
in<00:03:10.370> Monaco<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:11.840> we<00:03:12.170> quite<00:03:12.440> know<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.860> it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
in Monaco so we we quite know that it's

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.610 
in Monaco so we we quite know that it's
a<00:03:13.130> safe<00:03:13.670> car<00:03:14.000> should<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.510> get<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.720> in<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.020> of

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
a safe car should we get you in then of

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.580 
a safe car should we get you in then of
course<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:17.540> shouldn't<00:03:17.690> comfy<00:03:18.110> well<00:03:18.950> okay

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
course you shouldn't comfy well okay

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.680 
course you shouldn't comfy well okay
this<00:03:21.590> how<00:03:21.800> it<00:03:21.920> looks<00:03:22.130> as<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:23.090> told<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.450> not<00:03:23.630> a

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
this how it looks as I told you not a

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.750 
this how it looks as I told you not a
very<00:03:23.930> comfortable<00:03:24.110> position<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:25.400> visit

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
very comfortable position to visit

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.270 
very comfortable position to visit
inning<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.810> two<00:03:27.140> hours<00:03:27.590> we<00:03:27.830> spoken<00:03:28.190> about

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280

inning in two hours we spoken about
getting<00:03:28.820> all<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.060> components<00:03:29.390> as<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:30.020> slow

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
getting all the components as a slow

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.560 
getting all the components as a slow
down<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:30.830> cars<00:03:31.070> as<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.450> possible

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
down on the cars as it's possible

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.300 
down on the cars as it's possible
obviously<00:03:33.260> you're<00:03:33.440> you're<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.160> another

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
obviously you're you're just another

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.600 
obviously you're you're just another
component<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:35.720> as<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.050> can<00:03:36.170> see<00:03:36.610> you're

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
component to it so as you can see you're

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.610 
component to it so as you can see you're
sort<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.820> backside<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.510> 10<00:03:38.989> millimeters<00:03:39.500> away

from<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.950> tarmac<00:03:40.340> well<00:03:40.519> sure<00:03:40.730> which

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
from the tarmac well sure which

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.020 
from the tarmac well sure which
obviously<00:03:41.330> you<00:03:41.810> know<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.230> feel<00:03:42.590> when<00:03:42.860> you're

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
obviously you know you feel when you're

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.610 
obviously you know you feel when you're
what<00:03:44.030> you're<00:03:44.120> racing<00:03:44.450> in<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.570> car<00:03:44.780> is<00:03:45.350> usually

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
what you're racing in the car is usually

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.340 
what you're racing in the car is usually
a<00:03:45.650> good<00:03:45.800> gauge<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.690> tell<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.810> if<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.050> car<00:03:48.230> is

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
a good gauge to tell is if the car is

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.710 
a good gauge to tell is if the car is
too<00:03:48.530> low<00:03:48.709> because<00:03:48.950> their<00:03:49.519> backside<00:03:50.480> maybe

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
too low because their backside maybe

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.900 
too low because their backside maybe
gets<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.989> little<00:03:51.140> bit<00:03:51.320> more<00:03:51.470> yes<00:03:52.459> till<00:03:52.670> their

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
gets a little bit more yes till their

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.200 
gets a little bit more yes till their

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.490 

safety<00:04:00.210> is<00:04:00.270> obviously<00:04:00.540> paramount<00:04:00.990> in<00:04:01.140> Formula

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
safety is obviously paramount in Formula

safety is obviously paramount in Formula
One<00:04:01.650> obviously<00:04:02.130> if<00:04:02.490> anything<00:04:02.970> does<00:04:03.120> happen<00:04:03.270> we
