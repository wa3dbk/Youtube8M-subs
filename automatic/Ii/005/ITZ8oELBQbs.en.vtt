00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.110 
as I used to when I first started out
and<00:03:05.129> I<00:03:05.159> do<00:03:05.219> think<00:03:05.519> that's<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.790> little<00:03:05.939> bit

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
and I do think that's a little bit

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.699 
and I do think that's a little bit
unjust<00:03:06.480> because<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:06.959> are<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.109> great<00:03:07.290> bunch<00:03:07.500> of

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
unjust because they are a great bunch of

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.409 
unjust because they are a great bunch of
lipsticks<00:03:08.219> and<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:08.730> kind<00:03:08.939> of<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.090> deep<00:03:09.209> for

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
lipsticks and it's kind of a deep for

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.140 
lipsticks and it's kind of a deep for
max<00:03:09.659> rebel<00:03:10.200> or<00:03:10.439> my<00:03:10.829> very<00:03:11.310> much<00:03:11.609> well<00:03:11.909> love
