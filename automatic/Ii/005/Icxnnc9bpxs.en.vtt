as<00:01:31.600> such<00:01:31.900> though<00:01:32.170> that's<00:01:32.440> why<00:01:32.650> they're<00:01:32.890> there

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
as such though that's why they're there

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:43.410 
as such though that's why they're there
in<00:01:33.670> important<00:01:34.300> species

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.180 

because<00:01:44.420> you've<00:01:44.600> got<00:01:44.780> areas<00:01:45.380> like<00:01:45.619> this<00:01:45.920> like

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
because you've got areas like this like

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.130 
because you've got areas like this like
wangi<00:01:46.640> National<00:01:47.030> Park<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.510> surrounding

forest where there should be plenty of

forest where there should be plenty of
dogs<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.930> if<00:01:51.590> they're<00:01:51.799> not<00:01:52.009> there<00:01:52.400> they're<00:01:52.700> an

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
dogs and if they're not there they're an

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.570 
dogs and if they're not there they're an
indicator<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:54.020> there's<00:01:54.500> something<00:01:54.890> not

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
indicator that there's something not

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.120 
indicator that there's something not
right<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:56.150> you<00:01:56.450> know<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.840> balance<00:01:57.290> isn't

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
right that you know the balance isn't

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.490 
right that you know the balance isn't
correct<00:01:59.259> as<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:02.030> species<00:02:02.540> they're<00:02:03.229> struggling

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
correct as a species they're struggling

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.440 
correct as a species they're struggling
on<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.860> pan-african<00:02:04.460> scale<00:02:05.210> they're

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
on a pan-african scale they're

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.169 
on a pan-african scale they're
considered<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:05.990> be<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.140> decline<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:08.090> know

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
considered to be in decline so you know

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:22.470 
considered to be in decline so you know
we've<00:02:08.360> got<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.479> lot<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:08.720> work<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.140> do

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
so now we're back in the rehabilitation

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.699 
so now we're back in the rehabilitation

organizations and the field research

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.679 
organizations and the field research
that's<00:02:46.280> going<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:46.969> the<00:02:47.030> data<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.540> comes

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689 
that's going on and the data that comes

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.569 
that's going on and the data that comes
out<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.170> field<00:02:48.439> from<00:02:48.739> tracking<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.310> dogs

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.569 
out of the field from tracking the dogs
and<00:02:49.849> observing<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.689> dogs<00:02:50.959> is<00:02:51.230> vital<00:02:52.099> for<00:02:52.129> how

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
and observing the dogs is vital for how

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.050 
and observing the dogs is vital for how
we<00:02:52.639> look<00:02:52.969> after<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.389> dogs<00:02:53.599> in<00:02:53.870> captivity<00:02:54.230> and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
we look after the dogs in captivity and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.509 
we look after the dogs in captivity and
also<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.269> data<00:02:56.750> that's<00:02:57.109> collected<00:02:57.680> can<00:02:58.340> be

also the data that's collected can be

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.270 
also the data that's collected can be
analyzed<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.389> used<00:02:59.419> by<00:03:00.109> researchers<00:03:00.590> and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
analyzed and used by researchers and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:14.849 
analyzed and used by researchers and
students<00:03:01.730> back<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.239> UK<00:03:02.599> at<00:03:02.900> universities

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.089 

to<00:03:15.859> protect<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.579> wildlife<00:03:17.139> in<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.290> area<00:03:18.439> we

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
to protect the wildlife in the area we

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.849 
to protect the wildlife in the area we
have<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.579> do<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.939> through<00:03:20.329> a<00:03:20.540> link<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.019> thus

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
have to do that through a link and thus

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.690 
have to do that through a link and thus
the<00:03:22.519> conservation<00:03:23.269> clubs<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:25.159> schools<00:03:25.519> are

the conservation clubs the schools are

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.520 
the conservation clubs the schools are
within<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.269> villages<00:03:26.780> they<00:03:27.079> are<00:03:27.229> in<00:03:27.409> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.839 
within the villages they are in the
communities<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.510> therefore<00:03:29.510> reaching<00:03:30.409> out

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
communities and therefore reaching out

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.020 
communities and therefore reaching out
making<00:03:31.849> a<00:03:31.970> foundation<00:03:32.720> at<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.590> school<00:03:33.889> level

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
making a foundation at the school level

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.330 
making a foundation at the school level
means<00:03:35.030> reaching<00:03:35.540> out<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.379> the<00:03:36.500> community<00:03:36.530> at<00:03:37.280> a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
means reaching out to the community at a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.390 
means reaching out to the community at a
faster<00:03:38.120> rate

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.000 

so<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.299> only<00:03:45.420> way<00:03:45.689> painted<00:03:46.530> dolls<00:03:46.769> can<00:03:46.980> be

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
so the only way painted dolls can be

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.949 
so the only way painted dolls can be
conserved<00:03:47.519> in<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.819> wild<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.480> the
