can't<00:01:09.479> imagine<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.260> had<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.619> going

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
can't imagine what you had to be going

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.500 
can't imagine what you had to be going
through<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.189> first<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
through because first you get the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.260 
through because first you get the
diagnosis<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.650> then<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.909> the

diagnosis right and then you get the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.420 
diagnosis right and then you get the
recommendation<00:01:16.049> absolutely<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.280> initial

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
recommendation absolutely my initial

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.820 
recommendation absolutely my initial
option<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> lumpectomy<00:01:19.049> which

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
option was to have a lumpectomy which

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.649 
option was to have a lumpectomy which
they<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> diseased<00:01:20.580> tissue<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
they take the diseased tissue out I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.020 
they take the diseased tissue out I
would<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.500> had<00:01:22.680> eight<00:01:23.220> weeks<00:01:23.700> 5

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
double mastectomy it's interesting
because<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.060> through<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
because you know so you go through the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.700 
because you know so you go through the
surgeries<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.259> course<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> have

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
surgeries and then of course you have

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.370 
surgeries and then of course you have
the<00:01:43.829> recovery<00:01:44.280> process<00:01:44.990> but<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.200> had<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the recovery process but then you had to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.249 
the recovery process but then you had to
learn<00:01:46.590> some<00:01:46.860> things<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:48.030> hard<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:49.140> did

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
learn some things the hard way what did

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.600 
learn some things the hard way what did
the<00:01:49.380> doctor<00:01:49.710> tell<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.549> certainly

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the doctor tell you it's it's certainly

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.069 
the doctor tell you it's it's certainly
not<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> funny<00:01:51.270> story<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.780> interesting

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
not a funny story but it's interesting

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.230 
not a funny story but it's interesting
your<00:01:52.649> reaction<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.729> did<00:01:53.790> he<00:01:53.909> tell<00:01:54.119> you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
your reaction to it what did he tell you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.179 
your reaction to it what did he tell you
it's<00:01:54.899> interesting<00:01:55.079> because<00:01:55.500> doctors<00:01:56.040> only

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it's interesting because doctors only

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.160 
it's interesting because doctors only
tell<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.549> what<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.149> need<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> very

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
tell you what you need to know in a very

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.080

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
drains it's a direct portal to the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.310 
drains it's a direct portal to the
surgery<00:02:20.300> site<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.900> if<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.050> were<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.170> get

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
surgery site and if you were to get

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.110 
surgery site and if you were to get
water<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:21.980> surgery<00:02:22.250> site<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:22.940> could<00:02:23.060> be

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
water in the surgery site that could be

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.940 
water in the surgery site that could be
a<00:02:23.180> chance<00:02:23.390> for<00:02:23.510> bacteria<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.680> could<00:02:24.860> get

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
a chance for bacteria and you could get

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.160 
a chance for bacteria and you could get
an<00:02:25.040> infection<00:02:25.210> so<00:02:26.210> in<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.420> nutshell<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:26.840> went

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170

trying to protect myself from any any
water<00:02:33.260> going<00:02:33.530> into<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.950> incision<00:02:34.400> sites<00:02:34.760> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
water going into the incision sites and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.330 
water going into the incision sites and
I<00:02:35.540> just<00:02:35.750> kept<00:02:36.050> going<00:02:36.320> over<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.590> my<00:02:36.680> mind<00:02:36.710> women

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
I just thought about this because we

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.300 
I just thought about this because we
were<00:04:14.870> talking<00:04:15.110> about<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.380> family<00:04:15.800> connection

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
were talking about the family connection

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.640 
were talking about the family connection
having<00:04:16.609> your<00:04:16.760> family<00:04:17.209> involved<00:04:17.600> was<00:04:18.470> that

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
having your family involved was that

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.610 
having your family involved was that
therapeutic<00:04:19.430> for<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:19.940> as<00:04:20.450> well<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.470> whole

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
therapeutic for you as well the whole

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.460 
therapeutic for you as well the whole
process<00:04:22.130> was<00:04:22.250> therapeutic<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:23.030> think

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
process was therapeutic I think

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.080 
process was therapeutic I think
again<00:04:24.470> when<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> was<00:04:25.070> diagnosed<00:04:25.310> my<00:04:25.880> first

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
again when I was diagnosed my first

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.060 
again when I was diagnosed my first
thought<00:04:26.270> was<00:04:26.540> it's<00:04:27.170> it's<00:04:27.410> my<00:04:27.560> turn<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:28.010> have

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
thought was it's it's my turn to have

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.560 
thought was it's it's my turn to have
breast<00:04:28.310> cancer<00:04:28.370> there's<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:28.970> many<00:04:29.060> women<00:04:29.300> I've

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
breast cancer there's so many women I've

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.360 
breast cancer there's so many women I've
had<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.050> many<00:04:30.080> friends<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.950> have<00:04:31.070> had<00:04:31.190> breast

had so many friends that have had breast

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.100 
had so many friends that have had breast
cancer<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:32.090> then<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.270> thought<00:04:32.480> what<00:04:32.750> can<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:32.990> do

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
cancer and then I thought what can I do

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.050 
cancer and then I thought what can I do
how<00:04:33.530> can<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.890> make<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.340> difference<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:34.940> how<00:04:35.000> can
