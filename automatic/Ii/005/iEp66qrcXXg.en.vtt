00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello here is how to make a care 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.740
 lemon and haughty nails for 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.889
 to start you need 10 g of complexion 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.529
 then the juice of half a lemon 1 110 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.890
 liters of sweet almond oil a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.130
 leaf of sopalin and a small 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.849
 slow reese to be able to close the know 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.340
 and infusions that we will achieve 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:35.040
 I start by putting the complexion 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:42.120
 middle of the sopalin and then I close like 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 a papillote thanks to my little reese 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:55.530
 slow I attach everything to prevent that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:58.920
 the complexion does not leave in the water I warm 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:11.189
 a bowl of hot water in which 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 I will add the lemon juice and then the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.270
 small infusion of thyme I leave 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:25.200
 brew it all for five minutes in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 mixing from time to time then I 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:36.290
 take the little bag out of a leak and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.290
 I add to sweet almond oil 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:48.930
 I just have to dip my 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:55.950
 nails in the bath for 10 minutes 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:02:00.719
 each hand do not hesitate to make 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.409
 small massages so that the care returns 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.070
 well in the tab after ten 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.209
 minutes 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.870
 these loans you can wipe your nails 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.200
 your care is over you will find 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.400
 nails of impeccable whiteness and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.400
