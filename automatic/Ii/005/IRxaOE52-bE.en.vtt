chip but I think it's she's also there's
an<00:01:24.080> obvious<00:01:24.259> connection<00:01:24.619> between<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.220> two<00:01:25.340> of

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
an obvious connection between the two of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.279 
an obvious connection between the two of
them<00:01:25.549> that's<00:01:25.700> it's<00:01:26.479> kind<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.990> once<00:01:27.170> in<00:01:27.200> a

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
them that's it's kind of a once in a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.080 
them that's it's kind of a once in a
lifetime<00:01:27.439> thing<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.250> they're<00:01:28.460> pursuing<00:01:28.939> that

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
lifetime thing so they're pursuing that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.560 
lifetime thing so they're pursuing that
right<00:01:29.780> now<00:01:30.020> as<00:01:30.770> taboo<00:01:31.340> as<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:31.729> may<00:01:31.880> seem<00:01:32.060> how
