00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.860
 for this eighth exercise I show you 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.810
 nature and we will see nothing again 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.000
 in this exercise in this example it's 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.860
 a rhythmic one double eighth a re 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.740
 Major air over berrer 6-4 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.630
 not even two neurons or chickens off 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.759
 it's just that I like this riff in 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.960
 this form and suddenly I warn myself 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.880
 present it and maybe that you 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.160
 will inspire to write your own little ones 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.350
 the sequences of sus of 6.4 so I 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.120
 wanted to play a first time a little 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.120
 little bit slowly to see what it gives 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.730
 as you can see replica 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.130
 mans it's not super super simple ago 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.450
 sixteenth notes and links I 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.489
 will not break it down more than that 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.040
 because it's not the rescue goal of 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.879
 show complex rhythmic 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.770
 do not hesitate to work there if you 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.240
 want to do or simplify it there is no 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.740
 no problem i just wanted you 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.150
 show that what is interesting in 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.130
 this riff is enough that we change often 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.570
 agree on the fourth double of a 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.830
 time this first time we lured 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.229
 major that starts on the move towards the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.729
 down hangs and after on the fourth 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.550
 double small shot up at the end 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.840
 we change to a sus two on which we 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.759
 rest 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.030
 after on the third beat we lured 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.530
 6 4 which is either taken in duplicate 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.240
 and one becomes his major stop would 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.729
 fourth double of this third time 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.170
 and fourth time we have the first 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.700
 double that is not playing then after the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.030
 second third or fourth will 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.830
 double one plays blind this 2 and the fact of 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.229
 put chord changes on a 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.850
 fourth sixteenth note 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.770
 it gives a very interesting side of a 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.540
 little bit of anticipation a little full 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.440
 in like that where we are never too much on 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.670
 the time we have a little bit 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.220
 and it's something that is very 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.479
 used in music pop music 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.450
 if you listen to beatles they do that 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.550
 very often for example 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.170
 not to use this concept to take 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.850
 your your chord grid your re 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.140
 major and received two received what a hole 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.250
 on the major and a minor etc 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.210
 as usual we could do it on 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.979
 all the agreements you want 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.539
 and try to make the hams okay 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.190
 will be fourth double rather than on the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.510
 your I do them once we kill the most 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.630
 quickly so that you see what that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.630
 given 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.909
 so that inspires you so much better if 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.099
 it will not give you any worse not so much 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.030
 we'll go to the 9th exercise and for 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.930
 the data the exercises I have you 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.310
 reserved two shores fired straight from 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.379
 known pieces that they use and sucks 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.860
 2 6 4 for us to see what we 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.090
 can do like super tube with that and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.470
 as usual for also us 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.640
 join on facebook.com to buy 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.379
 four guitars to future points like 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.019
 slashtag acoustic sport 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.120
 so this new exercise is an excerpt 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.650
 which is straight from the famous 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.280
 piece stairway to heaven of led 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.769
 zeppelin 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.099
 it's the small passage just a few 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.930
 measurements before the famous leduby solo 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.290
 Belgian where he actually has a small 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.290
 rhythmic
