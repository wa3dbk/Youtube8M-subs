have<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.420> force<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.110> there<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:17.270> can<00:03:18.350> just<00:03:19.350> say

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
have to force it in there I can just say

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.230 
have to force it in there I can just say
it<00:03:19.709> out<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.980> way<00:03:23.540> SATA<00:03:24.540> cables<00:03:24.959> are<00:03:25.260> very

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
it out of the way SATA cables are very

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:38.449 
it out of the way SATA cables are very
inconvenient<00:03:27.240> place<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:37.310> looks<00:03:38.310> like

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
inconvenient place and looks like

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.120 
inconvenient place and looks like
they're<00:03:38.489> going<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.820> be<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.940> problem<00:03:40.070> so<00:03:41.070> I'm

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
they're going to be a problem so I'm

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.490 
they're going to be a problem so I'm
gonna<00:03:41.250> get<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.489> fixed<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:41.880> all<00:03:42.260> right<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.410> all

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
gonna get this fixed up all right so all

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.490 
gonna get this fixed up all right so all
I<00:03:43.530> basically<00:03:43.739> did<00:03:44.070> was<00:03:44.100> get<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.630> L<00:03:45.630> say<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
I basically did was get to L say the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.580 
I basically did was get to L say the
cables<00:03:47.480> right<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.810> hell<00:03:48.930> type<00:03:49.170> connectors

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
cables right the hell type connectors

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.550 
cables right the hell type connectors
and<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.750> still<00:03:51.750> might<00:03:51.900> think<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.230> might<00:03:52.410> be<00:03:52.440> a

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and I still might think this might be a

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.970 
and I still might think this might be a
snug<00:03:52.950> fit<00:03:54.110> but<00:03:55.110> yeah<00:03:56.100> there<00:03:56.310> we<00:03:56.400> go<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.709> we<00:03:58.830> got

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
snug fit but yeah there we go and we got

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.350 
snug fit but yeah there we go and we got
it<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.220> there<00:04:00.060> we<00:04:00.150> go<00:04:00.270> thanks<00:04:00.989> for<00:04:01.080> watching
