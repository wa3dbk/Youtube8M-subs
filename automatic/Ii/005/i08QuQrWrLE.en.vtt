00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
again posting some big numbers so if we

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.000 
again posting some big numbers so if we
have<00:00:38.150> a<00:00:38.180> look<00:00:38.330> at<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.600> periodic<00:00:39.230> returns<00:00:39.769> here

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
have a look at the periodic returns here

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.710 
have a look at the periodic returns here
for<00:00:40.190> pts<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:40.730> that's<00:00:40.940> our<00:00:41.120> pivot<00:00:41.360> traitor

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
for pts and that's our pivot traitor

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.869 
for pts and that's our pivot traitor
remember<00:00:42.260> if<00:00:43.250> we<00:00:43.309> have<00:00:43.519> a<00:00:43.550> look<00:00:43.670> at<00:00:43.790> the

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
remember if we have a look at the

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.810 
remember if we have a look at the
periodic<00:00:44.239> returns<00:00:44.720> we'll<00:00:44.930> go<00:00:45.019> to<00:00:45.080> our<00:00:45.820> returns

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
periodic returns we'll go to our returns

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.549 
periodic returns we'll go to our returns
for<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.149> month<00:00:47.390> it's<00:00:47.690> sitting<00:00:48.110> in<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.289> pretty

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
for the month it's sitting in a pretty

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.220 
for the month it's sitting in a pretty
good<00:00:48.649> position<00:00:48.890> for<00:00:49.190> August<00:00:49.579> at<00:00:49.730> 44<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:50.930> it

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
good position for August at 44 so it

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.110 
good position for August at 44 so it
hasn't<00:00:51.440> quite<00:00:51.800> got<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.550> lofty<00:00:52.699> heights

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
hasn't quite got to the lofty heights

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.959 
hasn't quite got to the lofty heights
that<00:00:53.360> we<00:00:53.510> saw<00:00:53.989> in<00:00:54.020> May<00:00:54.410> but<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.129> volatility

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
that we saw in May but the volatility

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.720 
that we saw in May but the volatility
should<00:00:56.180> see<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.449> good<00:00:57.050> week<00:00:57.289> on<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:58.160> strategy

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
should see a good week on this strategy

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.310 
should see a good week on this strategy
and<00:00:58.940> I'm<00:00:59.030> thinking<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.629> we<00:01:00.050> could

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
and I'm thinking that we could

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.889 
and I'm thinking that we could
potentially<00:01:00.559> get<00:01:01.070> some<00:01:01.250> nice<00:01:01.899> continued

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
potentially get some nice continued

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.650 
potentially get some nice continued
action<00:01:03.289> as<00:01:03.410> we<00:01:03.559> as<00:01:03.829> we<00:01:03.859> roll<00:01:04.250> on<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:04.789> we<00:01:05.390> want<00:01:05.570> to

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
action as we as we roll on so we want to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.930 
action as we as we roll on so we want to
keep<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.869> good<00:01:06.259> eye<00:01:06.410> on<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:06.979> coffee<00:01:07.430> we<00:01:07.789> know

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
keep a good eye on on coffee we know

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.820 
keep a good eye on on coffee we know
that<00:01:08.180> there's<00:01:08.720> good<00:01:08.930> volatility<00:01:09.560> at<00:01:09.710> the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
that there's good volatility at the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.499 
that there's good volatility at the
moment<00:01:10.160> in<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.280> markets<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:10.970> we're

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
moment in the markets and we're

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.419 
moment in the markets and we're
particularly<00:01:11.869> looking<00:01:12.020> at<00:01:12.320> coffee<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.920> tea

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
particularly looking at coffee to tea

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.880 
particularly looking at coffee to tea
yield<00:01:14.240> some<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.600> those<00:01:14.690> high<00:01:15.020> returns<00:01:15.500> so

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
yield some of those high returns so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.580 
yield some of those high returns so
again<00:01:16.789> we<00:01:17.179> we've<00:01:17.660> got<00:01:17.840> that<00:01:17.990> as<00:01:18.110> part<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.440> our

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
again we we've got that as part of our

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.010 
again we we've got that as part of our
life<00:01:18.860> strategy<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.610> our<00:01:19.700> live<00:01:20.390> portfolio

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
life strategy and our live portfolio

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.620 
life strategy and our live portfolio
assisted<00:01:21.650> portfolio<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:22.790> doing<00:01:23.000> very<00:01:23.150> well

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
assisted portfolio it's doing very well

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.390 
assisted portfolio it's doing very well
with<00:01:23.659> our<00:01:23.900> traders<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:24.590> again<00:01:25.810> pt10<00:01:26.810> is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
with our traders so again pt10 is

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.310 
with our traders so again pt10 is
probably<00:01:28.400> our<00:01:28.670> number<00:01:28.759> one<00:01:29.270> store<00:01:29.659> number<00:01:30.140> one

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
probably our number one store number one

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.649 
probably our number one store number one
number<00:01:30.530> two<00:01:30.680> strategies<00:01:31.369> at<00:01:31.700> strategy<00:01:32.479> at<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
number two strategies at strategy at the

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.780 
number two strategies at strategy at the
moment<00:01:33.049> it's<00:01:33.470> average<00:01:33.860> trade<00:01:34.159> net<00:01:34.340> profit<00:01:34.700> is

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
moment it's average trade net profit is

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.960 
moment it's average trade net profit is
huge<00:01:35.240> here<00:01:35.600> at<00:01:35.720> one<00:01:36.619> 3953<00:01:37.579> with<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.570> return<00:01:39.320> of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
huge here at one 3953 with a return of

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.210 
huge here at one 3953 with a return of
profit<00:01:40.970> factor<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.299> 1.95<00:01:42.110> our<00:01:42.829> win<00:01:43.009> rates

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
profit factor of 1.95 our win rates

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.819 
profit factor of 1.95 our win rates
around<00:01:43.369> about<00:01:43.640> forty<00:01:44.030> three<00:01:44.180> percent<00:01:44.829> which

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
around about forty three percent which

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.510 
around about forty three percent which
isn't<00:01:46.189> too<00:01:46.399> bad<00:01:46.729> but<00:01:47.060> again<00:01:47.810> it's<00:01:48.520> running

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
isn't too bad but again it's running

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.480 
isn't too bad but again it's running
really<00:01:49.820> well<00:01:50.000> max<00:01:50.840> drawdown<00:01:51.110> $3,000<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:52.340> it's

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
really well max drawdown $3,000 so it's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.740 
really well max drawdown $3,000 so it's
in<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.850> category<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:54.259> 20<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.890> 50<00:01:55.310> k

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
in the category of the 20 to 50 k

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.850 
in the category of the 20 to 50 k
portfolio<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.020> it's<00:01:57.170> not<00:01:57.350> our<00:01:57.530> smaller

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
portfolio so it's not our smaller

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.330 
portfolio so it's not our smaller
portfolio<00:01:58.520> strategy<00:01:59.119> but<00:01:59.840> with<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.860> numbers

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
portfolio strategy but with the numbers

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.950 
portfolio strategy but with the numbers
that<00:02:01.369> it's<00:02:01.579> producing<00:02:02.000> personal<00:02:02.509> contract

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
that it's producing personal contract

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.319 
that it's producing personal contract
it's<00:02:03.590> doing<00:02:03.920> exceptionally<00:02:04.579> well<00:02:04.579> as<00:02:05.030> far<00:02:05.299> as

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
it's doing exceptionally well as far as

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.840 
it's doing exceptionally well as far as
overall<00:02:05.659> performance<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.009> just<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.579> very<00:02:07.790> quick

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
overall performance so just a very quick

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.810 
overall performance so just a very quick
update<00:02:08.600> their<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:08.929> PT<00:02:09.350> 10<00:02:09.619> tracking<00:02:10.549> really
