00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.920
 another illegal immigrant died 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.150
 in the attempt from France to 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.859
 england to arrive 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.630
 the young man from the sudan was 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.259
 obviously run over by a truck 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.089
 as 1500 illegal tried in the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.859
 French port city Calais das 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.570
 storming eurotunnel terminal 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.520
 it is the second night in a row 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 in which the migrants are desperate 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.869
 try to get into the terminal 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 Monday night, 2,000 people stormed 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.859
 gaps in the security zones and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.519
 then tried to 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.529
 climb high-speed trains 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.239
 The police took six hours to kill 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.010
 the situation under control 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.140
 some of the migrants tried the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.879
 to use chaotic situations calais 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 those of striking French 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.530
 eurotunnel workers were triggered the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 months of work because of possible 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.649
 layoffs has the busy 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 transport system already several times 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.660
 decommissioned laura berman lee traveled 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.610
 last eight minutes to calais which takes 30 minutes 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.899
 should be moved over 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 five hours in front they see the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.340
 Operation stack of authorities one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.229
 kilometer-long snake truck is at it 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.820
 prevented from driving in the tunnel 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.680
 here on the left side you can see 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.530
 for kilometers long they wait for 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.180
 hours slowly allow some 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.720
 dozens of driveways but still 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.720
 not missing 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.759
 I am now in the euro tunnel dates 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.619
 a normally 20 minutes long 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.840
 Ride took chaos because of the commuter 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.289
 and the truck shutdown two and a half 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.289
 hours 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.729
 I finally got it in the tunnel 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.530
 I am now in the train and we are 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.450
 move us what has about four 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.000
 took hours so we have tremendous 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.500
 delay 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.939
 we have now made it to calais 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.890
 here to my left we see 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.929
 countless migrants incoming and 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.479
 Often the followers of these trucks go out 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.229
 want to try in the chassis 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.959
 to get 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.189
 and also directly into the truck that happens 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.379
 now day and night 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.879
 I am now standing next to these four meters 

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:05.679
 high fence with razor sharp 

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:08.259
 barbed wire this is a so-called 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.090
 preventive measure to migrants of it 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.950
 keep away from freight 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.709
 right behind me you can see all these 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.849
 Large truck and the border fence leads 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.859
 completely around her england gave the 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.019
 French Ministry of the Interior twelve 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.790
 million pounds to build this fence 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.670
 but they were already in the first month 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.920
 as set in the sand as the fence of 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.920
 very strong winds was blown around 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.090
 eurotunnel says they have been doing since january 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.280
 over 37,000 migrants blocked and that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.959
 the company costs a lot the company 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.760
 now demands nearly ten million euros 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.889
 Compensation from France and England 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.060
 The two countries say they are trying 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.040
 to secure the tunnel 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.209
 now they have more decided 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.980
 to build fences 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.139
 england is also planning a 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.849
 set up a safety zone for trucks and 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.849
 promises to use more police 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.530
 The countries have also decided 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.630
 the migrants to their home countries or 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.269
 to return the original port 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.040
 especially to west africa bass 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.290
 former vice-chairman of the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.910
 European refugee council says this 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.109
 Measures do not deal with 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.180
 The core of the problem is something you can do 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.560
 circular migration one of the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.209
 problems when you just people 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.799
 It does not send that back 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.750
 the problem with respect to this 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.310
 Individuals permanently solve it 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.000
 there is the possibility that they are 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.830
 try again 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.750
 we see the enormous courage of those 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.880
 under very dangerous circumstances 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.680
 try to escape europe and me 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.680
 think that only shows her despair 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.260
 so what is the answer honestly 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.880
 the true answer is yes 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.500
 Try these conflicts already 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.300
 to prevent their origin 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.030
 to try the influx of migrants 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.320
 to master by making sure that 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.220
 people are no longer from their countries 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.220
 have to flee 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.080
 that's something I'm afraid what 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.030
 the eu and many other countries of the world 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.750
 with stable systems pitiful 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.750
 have failed
