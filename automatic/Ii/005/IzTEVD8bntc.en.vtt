00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
ago but I ended up building the video

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
ago but I ended up building the video
because<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.390> screwed<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.020> anyway

obviously I would like to know what you

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.900 
obviously I would like to know what you
guys<00:02:24.380> think<00:02:24.680> obvious<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.280> I'm<00:02:25.400> not<00:02:25.520> one<00:02:25.730> has

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
guys think obvious and I'm not one has

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.550 
guys think obvious and I'm not one has
as<00:02:26.150> much<00:02:26.300> time<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.630> play<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:26.990> game<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.500> do

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
as much time to play this game as I do

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.380 
as much time to play this game as I do
so<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.980> mean<00:02:28.280> even<00:02:28.310> well<00:02:28.670> with<00:02:28.790> my<00:02:28.910> have<00:02:29.120> them

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
so I mean even well with my have them

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.360 
so I mean even well with my have them
it's<00:02:29.540> still<00:02:29.690> kind<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.290> hard<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.040> guess<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.280> takes

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
it's still kind of hard I guess it takes

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.250 
it's still kind of hard I guess it takes
up<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> while<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.030> definitely<00:02:32.750> takes<00:02:32.900> nowhere

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
up a while but definitely takes nowhere

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.990 
up a while but definitely takes nowhere
near<00:02:33.380> as<00:02:33.470> much<00:02:33.590> time<00:02:33.830> as<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.040> does<00:02:34.280> for<00:02:34.940> example

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
near as much time as it does for example

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.370 
near as much time as it does for example
on<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.570> know<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> little<00:02:35.900> school<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.230> I'm
