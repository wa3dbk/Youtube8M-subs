00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.670 
me and in that specific category now
again<00:03:15.419> like<00:03:15.599> I<00:03:15.750> said<00:03:15.810> though<00:03:16.109> if<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.319> want<00:03:16.590> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
again like I said though if you want to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.259 
again like I said though if you want to
go<00:03:16.799> ahead<00:03:16.919> and<00:03:17.069> have<00:03:17.280> more<00:03:17.489> flexibility

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
go ahead and have more flexibility

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.059 
go ahead and have more flexibility
because<00:03:18.569> you'll<00:03:18.720> notice<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.620> kind<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.859> hard

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
because you'll notice it's kind of hard

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.849 
because you'll notice it's kind of hard
to<00:03:20.099> see<00:03:20.459> where<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.359> that<00:03:21.449> 70%<00:03:21.989> up<00:03:22.379> here<00:03:22.590> well

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
to see where is that 70% up here well

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.490 
to see where is that 70% up here well
right<00:03:23.760> there<00:03:24.000> right<00:03:24.419> so<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.079> could<00:03:25.260> change

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
right there right so you could change

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.800 
right there right so you could change
that<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.949> course<00:03:26.159> or<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.669> go<00:03:27.180> ahead<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.569> take

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
that of course or just go ahead and take

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.979 
that of course or just go ahead and take
the<00:03:28.079> specific<00:03:28.799> code<00:03:29.489> for<00:03:29.909> this<00:03:30.689> category

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
the specific code for this category

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
go back to that regular link that I

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.179 
go back to that regular link that I
showed<00:03:38.729> you<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.209> edit<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> node<00:03:40.199> and<00:03:40.500> you're

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
showed you and edit the node and you're

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.469 
showed you and edit the node and you're
done<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.669> reason<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.120> important

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
done and the reason this is important

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.939 
done and the reason this is important
because<00:03:42.569> like<00:03:42.689> I<00:03:42.810> said<00:03:42.870> sometimes<00:03:43.290> Amazon

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
because like I said sometimes Amazon

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.189 
because like I said sometimes Amazon
will<00:03:44.159> give<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.579> discount<00:03:45.509> links<00:03:45.750> on<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.959> left

will give you discount links on the left

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.979 
will give you discount links on the left
but<00:03:46.439> all<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.739> see<00:03:47.159> in<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:47.669> case<00:03:47.939> you<00:03:48.720> know<00:03:48.840> is

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
but all I see in this case you know is

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.749 
but all I see in this case you know is
70%<00:03:49.319> or<00:03:49.650> more<00:03:49.799> we<00:03:49.919> can<00:03:50.069> click<00:03:50.250> back<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.489> any

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:50.759 
70% or more we can click back to any

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.879 
70% or more we can click back to any
discount<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.449> they'll<00:03:51.870> give<00:03:52.049> us<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.259> few<00:03:52.560> set

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.849 
discount and they'll give us a few set
discounts<00:03:53.489> but<00:03:54.419> it's<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.930> lot<00:03:55.139> easier<00:03:55.319> when<00:03:55.769> you

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
discounts but it's a lot easier when you

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.189 
discounts but it's a lot easier when you
know<00:03:56.009> how<00:03:56.159> to<00:03:56.189> navigate<00:03:56.729> with<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.359> Amazon
