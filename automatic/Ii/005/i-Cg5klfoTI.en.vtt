pickaxe to make the plays rod ax you
just<00:01:28.030> do<00:01:28.150> so<00:01:28.390> basically<00:01:29.140> it's<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.290> exact<00:01:29.890> same

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
just do so basically it's the exact same

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.440 
just do so basically it's the exact same
recipes<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:31.020> any<00:01:32.020> old<00:01:32.229> tool<00:01:32.760> but<00:01:33.760> just<00:01:34.270> with

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
recipes as any old tool but just with

recipes as any old tool but just with
blaze<00:01:34.720> rods<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:38.290> my<00:01:38.619> mind<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.220> is

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
blaze rods and in my mind it is

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.600 
blaze rods and in my mind it is
overpowered<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:43.119> know<00:01:44.310> well<00:01:45.310> not<00:01:45.550> really

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
overpowered but you know well not really

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.320 
overpowered but you know well not really
good<00:01:46.000> blaze<00:01:46.240> rods<00:01:46.510> are<00:01:46.630> kind<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.350> hard<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.650> get

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330
