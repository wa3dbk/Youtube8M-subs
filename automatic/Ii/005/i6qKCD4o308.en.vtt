millimetres<00:00:58.140> we've<00:00:59.140> decided<00:00:59.440> on<00:00:59.559> a<00:00:59.619> 2

millimetres we've decided on a 2
millimeter<00:01:00.070> material<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.089> reason<00:01:01.420> for<00:01:01.570> that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
millimeter material the reason for that

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.509 
millimeter material the reason for that
is<00:01:01.900> that<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.199> 2<00:01:02.680> millimeter<00:01:03.040> material<00:01:03.430> will

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
is that the 2 millimeter material will

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.500 
is that the 2 millimeter material will
accommodate<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.659> max<00:01:04.930> gap<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.439> 1.8<00:01:06.510> the

accommodate the max gap of 1.8 the

accommodate the max gap of 1.8 the
nominal<00:01:07.960> obviously<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.380> 1.6<00:01:09.100> but<00:01:09.610> will<00:01:09.729> also

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
nominal obviously of 1.6 but will also

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.490 
nominal obviously of 1.6 but will also
be<00:01:10.000> able<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.210> get<00:01:10.330> down<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.570> 1.4<00:01:11.260> millimeters

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
be able to get down to 1.4 millimeters

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.370 
be able to get down to 1.4 millimeters
it's<00:01:12.310> about<00:01:12.430> 30%<00:01:12.730> compression<00:01:13.510> for<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.720> 200

we're gonna see about 40 psi it's

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.230 
we're gonna see about 40 psi it's
important<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.460> keep<00:01:30.580> in<00:01:30.760> mind<00:01:30.940> that<00:01:31.000> these

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
important to keep in mind that these

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.210 
important to keep in mind that these

but<00:01:33.850> these<00:01:33.940> are<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.150> forces<00:01:34.480> you're<00:01:34.540> going<00:01:34.690> to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
but these are the forces you're going to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.649 
but these are the forces you're going to
see<00:01:34.840> during<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.170> initial<00:01:35.470> installation<00:01:36.659> next

thing<00:01:37.750> we're<00:01:37.870> gonna<00:01:37.930> want<00:01:38.230> to<00:01:38.320> look<00:01:38.440> at<00:01:38.590> is

thing we're gonna want to look at is

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.530 
thing we're gonna want to look at is
actually<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.130> thermals<00:01:39.640> obviously<00:01:40.390> that's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
actually the thermals obviously that's

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.500 
actually the thermals obviously that's
what<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.900> material<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:41.380> therefore<00:01:42.330> in<00:01:43.330> this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
what the material is therefore in this

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.300 
what the material is therefore in this
application<00:01:44.170> we've<00:01:44.290> got<00:01:44.409> a<00:01:44.440> heat<00:01:44.710> source<00:01:44.920> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
application we've got a heat source and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.470 
application we've got a heat source and
what<00:01:45.550> we're<00:01:45.700> saying<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.120> heat<00:01:46.240> source<00:01:46.330> is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
what we're saying is the heat source is

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.810 
what we're saying is the heat source is
about<00:01:46.659> 5<00:01:46.900> watts<00:01:47.200> per<00:01:47.440> square<00:01:47.800> inch<00:01:47.830> that's<00:01:48.610> one

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
about 5 watts per square inch that's one

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.100 
about 5 watts per square inch that's one
of<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:48.970> reasons<00:01:49.270> we<00:01:49.390> pick<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.780> ji-ae

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
of the reasons we pick the ji-ae

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.300 
of the reasons we pick the ji-ae
material<00:01:50.770> which<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.040> much<00:01:51.280> more

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
material which is a much more

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.460 
material which is a much more
cost-effective<00:01:51.880> lower-performing<00:01:52.659> material

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
cost-effective lower-performing material

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.260 
cost-effective lower-performing material
and<00:01:53.830> these<00:01:54.190> power<00:01:54.430> densities<00:01:54.909> should<00:01:55.090> work

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
and these power densities should work

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.840 
and these power densities should work
pretty<00:01:55.540> well<00:01:55.690> with<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.740> material<00:01:57.220> so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
pretty well with that material so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.690 
pretty well with that material so
looking<00:01:58.090> at<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.240> 200<00:01:58.720> ji-ae<00:01:59.400> we've<00:02:00.400> got<00:02:00.520> about
