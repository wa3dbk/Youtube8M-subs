00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.169
 hi and welcome to our little anatomy lesson today we face the 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.109
 The scapular-humeral articulation is the theme of the scapular-humeral articulation 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.860
 the + mobile articulation of the human body here we see different red parts 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.050
 obviously the Latin word articulations humerus is also used 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.630
 scapular is up ooh connection between the scapula and the Russian lumen 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.349
 the scapula bone is the most important part of the bachelor joint 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.070
 humeral 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.030
 is found on the dorsal side deruta orax and is a flat bone that presents several 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030
 ledges so now we will talk in detail 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.660
 the second part of the article scapulo humeral sione is the upper bone of the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.070
 Russian lumen arm that with the head of the humerus fits into the whale 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.400
 of the bone in the box we first take a look at the scapula 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.490
 the scapula is formed by more charity and protrusions 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.420
 which allow anatomical orientation 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.300
 we see here on the dorsal area of ​​the scapula a strong protrusion of the bone 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.680
 the plug boxes 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 which from the front ends in chromium 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.870
 above and below the spine boxes there are two cavities where i 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.850
 muscles 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.320
 one above the plug boxes 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.720
 the so-called supine spinata pit 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.960
 then placed on the plug 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.780
 and the other under the thorn box the pit 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 infraspinatus 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.090
 let's vote for the ventral side 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 and here we see a cavity 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 that in this case also directed towards the ribs the so-called fossa subs 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.910
 head brawl 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.360
 within this can reside powerful muscles that reach 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.550
 somerhalder 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.870
 in front bordering on the bone of the scapula we see the clavicula 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.140
 the clavicle connected with the scapula bone 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140
 through a small articulation 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.090
 also here we notice several ligaments that stabilize the connection between the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.500
 clavicle clavicle of the scapula 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.660
 observing the humeral bone lumen rus we can also distinguish here some 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.240
 important anatomical structures currently the head first 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.200
 of the humerus and the humeral shaft in the area of ​​the humeral head 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.829
 then he decided to protrude the bone 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.249
 wii the so-called tube no uhmamma juss 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.299
 that is, a large copa of the key bone acts as a graft for the musculature 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:35.769
 on your ventral youtube alchool a minus a small bobba of the bone 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.010
 between the two tuberculata flowing on the cusio that is a furrow his inter course 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.299
 turku larissa 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.470
 and represented by the small cord the tendons of the long head 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.859
 of the biceps which in this sulcus inter tuberculars if it flows through the 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.179
 scapulohumeral articulation 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.719
 observing the scapular-humeral articulation we note that there are 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.659
 relatively few connection facilities with unlike 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.399
 other articulations, therefore, are mainly a joint 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.479
 muscle oriented now take a look at every single muscle 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.230
 one speaks of the rotator cuff 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.790
 because headphones because these muscles close around the head of the humerus 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.549
 like a headset 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.370
 these muscles only specifically the musculus therese minor 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.349
 keita to the scapula reaches the pubis any maius of the menale bone 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:27.679
 then below his spine the musculus infraspinato sua 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.000
 a flat triangular-shaped muscle 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.879
 that by inserting itself in the tubercle maius it converges with its fibers 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:44.709
 and above the spine the shoulder blades 15 muscular supraspinatus that passes under the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.139
 find in the evening the pubis again some caps 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.139
 Russian lamps 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.899
 on torrent alex is a fourth key muscle is part of the headphones 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.059
 rotators the muscular sub scapula rise up 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.109
 that fits into the luminous tube of a virus 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.099
 together 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.549
 these 4 muscles reach the head of the humerus and can therefore move the lumen 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.549
 and stabilize the shoulder joint 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.659
 if we exclude the musculus sub and scapula we rediscover my god that I was it 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.810
 does not have a real glenoid quincy this I just leans on one 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.190
 very small pit and the shoulder blade makes it available 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.669
 the so-called 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.560
 caritas ideal wine 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.270
 which actually only occupies a very small surface of the head 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.270
 of the humerus lined with cartilage 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.759
 this surface extends slightly you can see it 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.959
 and these gray structures through a piece of fibrocartilage that envelops 

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.719
 this glenoid and then amp lena 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.300
 the so-called ideal brum flax 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.950
 the scapulohumeral articulation and therefore an articulation from the structure 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.139
 rather complex 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.009
 above all because it must allow numerous movements in a firm manner 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.419
 therefore we note that the shoulder joint can be moved into 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.570
 many directions and of course the possibility of so to speak 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.590
 also move the arm with you in many directions if you also look at the 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.830
 the lateral area shows that the soft parts between the bony structures have 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.930
 relatively little space 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.379
 and at the clinical level this leads to certain conditions 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.550
 to a so-called impingement syndrome ie the soft parts yes 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.879
 they block between the bones causing pain in the certain bachelor-humeral joint 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.250
 we just flew over the shoulder topic
