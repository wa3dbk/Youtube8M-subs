great<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> use<00:00:54.750> while<00:00:54.989> using<00:00:55.230> both<00:00:55.530> hands

still<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.309> unusual<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.940> me<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> can

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
still a little unusual to me but I can

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.900 
still a little unusual to me but I can
see<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> benefit<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.649> doing<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.160> especially

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
with long websites windows 8 was quick

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.789 
with long websites windows 8 was quick
to<00:01:05.519> rotate<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> resize<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.960> display<00:01:07.350> which

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to rotate and resize the display which

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.289 
to rotate and resize the display which
meant<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.070> could<00:01:08.250> switch<00:01:08.430> between<00:01:08.640> portrait

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
