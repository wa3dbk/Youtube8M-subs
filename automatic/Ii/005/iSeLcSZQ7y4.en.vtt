then we have got this 4222 hybrid and

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.670 
then we have got this 4222 hybrid and
the<00:04:17.699> reason<00:04:18.000> why<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.120> saw<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.389> view<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:18.840> is

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
the reason why I saw a view of this is

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.129 
the reason why I saw a view of this is
because<00:04:20.039> it<00:04:20.789> was<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.969> hard<00:04:21.209> with<00:04:21.419> no<00:04:21.449> dead<00:04:21.780> links

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
because it was a hard with no dead links

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:22.980 
because it was a hard with no dead links
had

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
had

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.749 
had
I<00:04:23.110> can't<00:04:23.740> member<00:04:23.919> what<00:04:24.009> it<00:04:24.130> was<00:04:24.250> like<00:04:24.460> for

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
I can't member what it was like for

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.700 
I can't member what it was like for
leagues<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.389> it's<00:04:25.840> bundesliga<00:04:26.380> in<00:04:26.470> there

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
leagues is it it's bundesliga in there

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.400 
leagues is it it's bundesliga in there
there<00:04:27.009> is<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.599> may<00:04:28.599> be<00:04:28.660> short<00:04:28.840> i<00:04:28.960> believe<00:04:29.199> that

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
there is the may be short i believe that

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.640 
there is the may be short i believe that
is<00:04:29.500> cereal<00:04:30.370> boxes<00:04:30.849> from<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.060> league<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.650> some

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
is cereal boxes from a league and some

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.700 
is cereal boxes from a league and some
other<00:04:32.800> league<00:04:32.979> as<00:04:33.160> well<00:04:33.340> where<00:04:34.120> is<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.710> think

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
other league as well where is it I think

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.270 
other league as well where is it I think
yeah<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:35.889> think<00:04:36.039> it's<00:04:36.280> four<00:04:36.520> leagues<00:04:36.759> and<00:04:38.280> like
