00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone how are you welcome from 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.640
 new to my soy channel drains gÃ³mez and 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.309
 as the title of the video says this 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.190
 can give some tips to learn 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.799
 more or less how to choose the type of 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.049
 conditioner shampoo the next time 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.670
 go shopping to the super good in 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.220
 First are people 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 that are Chinese 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.050
 scalp fat costs more 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.750
 work that goes down to cover all the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.699
 hair as it is Chinese because it gives double 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.769
 travel to the fat so that all the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.980
 hair then that's why the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.620
 most of the time he looks abused and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.510
 dry good if it's your case the first thing 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 you have to do is stop washing 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.160
 every day it is advisable to wash it 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.719
 every third day that's why you have 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 have to use shampoos that are between 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.410
 mossos and having it is preferable that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.300
 have almond oil or any 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.140
 another product that is based on 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.600
 silicones or glycerin in the case of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.030
 conditioner 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.939
 Apply it every time you wash your hair 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.750
 this is going to provide you more 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.610
 hydration has to be a 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.020
 creamy conditioner of preference 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.600
 that is from the same line because 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.619
 generally they carry as much similarity 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.229
 As for new products too 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.990
 Another thing that your girl has is that she 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.399
 moisturizes hair at the same time 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 decreases stress because you are 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.270
 people have a lot of problem of 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.399
 that their hair was disheveled 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.000
 size especially when the imh age 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:38.690
 then so you already know you have to 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.179
 look for creamy shampoos and they have 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.330
 extracted handlers good after 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:48.200
 find the hair that are thin 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.360
 traced or laces usually this 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.130
 hair type tends to be seen is 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.690
 shows in a short time so it's not 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.950
 recommended to use nothing 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.440
 shampoos that are creamy or any 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.480
 another type of oil in the hair 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.580
 for this type of hair are the 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.540
 neutral or hydration shampoos 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.790
 profound in terms of 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.220
 conditioners if you feel that you 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.870
 hair is not very dry after 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.489
 having washed it is not necessary to use 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.400
 conditioner but if you are not that 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.799
 you feel it is more difficult to comb it 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.540
 After this, you can apply a 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.390
 little from media conditioner to 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.349
 Tips never touch the scalp 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.359
 good and finally the dyed hair 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.269
 here you have to give it a treatment 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:41.689
 special to the road dyed because to the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.790
 few days of applying the dye starts to 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.709
 fade the color which makes 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.019
 the hair looks a little bit the abuser 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.659
 for this you have to apply shampoos that 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.639
 they protect the color but that 6 extra 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.650
 moisturizing there are some that work 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.510
 for the different types of color and they are 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.450
 ideal since they contain a bit of 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.060
 dye so they work wonderfully 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.010
 This type of products contain 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.500
 less aggressive cleaners which 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.930
 prevents the color from fading 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.470
 As for the conditioner, the same 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.690
 to use 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.070
 conditioners are special for the 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.720
 dyed hair care as for 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.130
 conditioner re-selected 1 also 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.330
 specific for hair care 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.160
 dyed these usually contain in 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.560
 protection against uvb rays what 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.800
 it works like a blocker for your 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.830
 hair and prevents it from becoming cloudy and losing 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.200
 interior brightness good for this 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.870
