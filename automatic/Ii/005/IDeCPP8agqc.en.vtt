00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Do not you like your vegetables you want something 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.440
 try again prepares for 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.230
 stainless pumpkin with finely baked apple aroma to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.080
 zucchini okay you do not have to peel 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.059
 that's why it 's pretty simple 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 the part user a sharp knife 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.320
 and whatever your fingers want from me 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.300
 it's easiest and safest if 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.250
 I stab with a sharp knife 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.250
 and then slowly works through me 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.150
 probably the most compelling from the pumpkin seeds 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.430
 Can tourists and eat if you want that 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.310
 Washes out the fruit and she gets one 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.570
 day long soak in water decreases 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.570
 small pieces of the pumpkin 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.239
 does the same thing with an apple you 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.650
 can take two then it will 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.870
 even better for the marinade I take 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.840
 Some oil of coconut oil is best I have 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.200
 but no star and half of it 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.140
 actually enough a pinch of cinnamon 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.280
 peppercorn pepper a lot of pepper and 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.280
 are still with can not hurt synonymous 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:25.100
 then you have the whole thing about one 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.750
 three quarters of an hour designed that can 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.160
 you already eat what it's so delicious 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.770
 that it does not even need anything 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.330
 set it up so well 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.280
 or you already bulbs and tubers of 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.250
 Break on the pumpkin and apple 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.050
 then a dose of coconut milk and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.940
 Boil the salt once 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.350
 I always do the stove after that and 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.580
 a lid on it then pulls 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.149
 again through how the zucchini 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.149
 finished 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.280
 Since I have this thing , it is quite 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.600
 far too few even fairy tales amazing 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.240
 that a thing suddenly much better 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.500
 tastes just because it looks better 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.970
 if you do not have such a thing ever 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.960
 in the infobox that too 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.940
 alternative in it 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.619
 take the porridge and come in 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.179
 a little bit around I just do that 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.130
 a bit because I like that so much 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.750
 if you like one 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.490
 you want a liquid sauce you can 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.070
 little vegetable stock or water to 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.680
 The whole thing is going to be really tasty 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.570
 a little pumpkin knows they can 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.540
