00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:18.522
 With the footsteps of a horse and the pomp of an elephant 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.019

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.420
 With the footsteps of a horse and the pomp of an elephant 

00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.351

00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:21.795
 The clouds descended The clouds descended 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.498
 They blocked our way. 

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:34.849
 What is your will, cloud? Are not you going to let us go? 

00:02:35.953 --> 00:02:39.555
 The rains ahead A storm behind 

00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:43.361
 Oh treacherous time! Where will we go? 

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:52.436

 The sky came down It came down 

00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:54.818
 All was paralyzed Paralyzed 

00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:59.295
 How beautiful is the season of shadows! 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.791
 Consider it as the monsoon sign! 

00:04:04.103 --> 00:04:07.300
 In this monsoon mood Say something 

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:12.342
 Do something! Why are you silent? 

00:04:19.173 --> 00:04:22.873
 With the footsteps of a horse and the pomp of an elephant 

00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:26.874
