this is what we call the digital age it
is<00:01:17.270> literally<00:01:17.690> very<00:01:18.229> easy<00:01:18.740> for<00:01:19.580> just<00:01:19.820> about

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
is literally very easy for just about

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.810 
is literally very easy for just about
any<00:01:20.240> news<00:01:20.509> story<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:21.410> go<00:01:21.650> viral<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.640> make
