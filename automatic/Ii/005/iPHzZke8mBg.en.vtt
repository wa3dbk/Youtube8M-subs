00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
out of hair like how I am on this one

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.679 
you pick a strand that's kind of long
and<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.310> move<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.490> hair<00:01:41.759> over<00:01:42.030> there<00:01:42.240> so

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
then you'll have more hair to braid with

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.670 
then you'll have more hair to braid with
that<00:01:45.299> happens<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:46.110> especially

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that happens all the time especially

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.840 
that happens all the time especially
when<00:01:46.950> you're<00:01:47.189> dealing<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.430> hair<00:01:47.670> that's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
when you're dealing with hair that's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.840 
when you're dealing with hair that's
layered<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> you're<00:01:50.159> gonna<00:01:50.250> braid<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> down

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
layered so you're gonna braid it down

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.510 
layered so you're gonna braid it down
until<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> can't<00:01:51.570> braid<00:01:51.869> any<00:01:52.140> more<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
until you can't braid any more and it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.649 
until you can't braid any more and it
doesn't<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:53.880> matter<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
doesn't really matter what the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
doesn't really matter what the
consistency<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.649> braid<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.369> how

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
consistency of your braid is like how

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
consistency of your braid is like how
the<00:01:56.520> actual<00:01:56.939> braid<00:01:57.360> looks<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.259> braid<00:01:58.500> could

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the actual braid looks the braid could

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.499 
the actual braid looks the braid could
look<00:01:58.829> horrible<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.939> long<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.390> nice

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
look horrible but as long as it's nice

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.819 
look horrible but as long as it's nice
and<00:02:00.719> tight<00:02:00.869> you're<00:02:01.079> gonna<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.710> achieved

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
and tight you're gonna get the achieved

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.559 
and tight you're gonna get the achieved
result

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.869 

so<00:02:10.200> here<00:02:10.409> we<00:02:10.500> go<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.370> getting<00:02:11.640> thinner

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
so here we go and it's getting thinner

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.490 
so here we go and it's getting thinner
at<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.120> bottom<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.780> guess<00:02:13.019> what<00:02:13.260> you're

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
at the bottom and guess what you're

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.009 
at the bottom and guess what you're
gonna<00:02:13.590> still<00:02:14.040> braid<00:02:14.519> because<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.390> want<00:02:15.659> even

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
gonna still braid because you want even

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.220 
gonna still braid because you want even
the<00:02:16.349> bottom<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:17.579> be<00:02:17.760> nice<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.599> tight<00:02:18.989> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
the bottom to be nice and tight and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.709 
the bottom to be nice and tight and
crimped<00:02:22.909> so<00:02:23.909> when<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.180> get<00:02:24.329> to<00:02:24.359> the<00:02:24.540> bottom

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
crimped so when you get to the bottom

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.509 
crimped so when you get to the bottom
you<00:02:25.049> can<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.439> one<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.680> two<00:02:25.829> things

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
you can do one of two things

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.390 
you can do one of two things
you<00:02:27.299> can<00:02:27.510> use<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> clear<00:02:28.140> elastic<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.010> hair

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
you can use a clear elastic or a hair

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.210 
you can use a clear elastic or a hair
tie<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.060> can<00:02:30.209> go<00:02:30.329> over<00:02:30.359> it<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.170> if<00:02:31.980> you

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
tie and you can go over it or if you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.559 
tie and you can go over it or if you

being lazy which I am very often you can

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.300 
being lazy which I am very often you can
spray<00:02:37.079> it<00:02:37.109> and<00:02:37.349> tease<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.950> I'll<00:02:38.069> show<00:02:38.250> you

okay<00:02:51.150> we're<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.480> bottom<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.859> what

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
okay we're to the bottom this is what

you<00:02:53.069> do<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.819> take<00:02:53.849> some<00:02:54.239> spray<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:55.230> spray<00:02:55.620> the

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
you do you take some spray you spray the

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.559 
you do you take some spray you spray the
end<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:58.049> can<00:02:58.260> take<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.769> small<00:02:59.220> tooth<00:02:59.549> tail<00:03:00.269> comb

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
end you can take a small tooth tail comb

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.699 
end you can take a small tooth tail comb
and<00:03:01.319> just<00:03:01.500> back<00:03:01.739> home<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.450> back<00:03:04.169> home<00:03:04.379> from

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
and just back home and back home from

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.690 
and just back home and back home from
different<00:03:05.340> sides<00:03:06.889> just<00:03:07.889> to<00:03:08.010> make<00:03:08.159> sure<00:03:08.189> it's

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
different sides just to make sure it's

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.330 
different sides just to make sure it's
gonna<00:03:08.909> be<00:03:09.419> kind<00:03:10.379> of<00:03:10.470> rough<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.159> gonna

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
gonna be kind of rough and it's gonna

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.969 
gonna be kind of rough and it's gonna
stay<00:03:11.639> put<00:03:11.909> I'm<00:03:12.900> fairly<00:03:13.139> confident<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.769> this

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:13.979 
stay put I'm fairly confident that this

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:17.899 
stay put I'm fairly confident that this
is<00:03:14.159> good<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:15.359> then<00:03:15.540> I'm<00:03:15.659> still<00:03:15.840> gonna<00:03:16.909> one

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
is good but then I'm still gonna one

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.360 
is good but then I'm still gonna one
more<00:03:18.120> spray<00:03:18.500> I'm<00:03:19.500> gonna<00:03:19.680> roll<00:03:19.919> it<00:03:20.069> with<00:03:20.190> my

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
more spray I'm gonna roll it with my

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.759 
more spray I'm gonna roll it with my
fingers<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.959> can<00:03:22.079> tell<00:03:22.139> your<00:03:22.530> braid

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
fingers and as you can tell your braid

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.369 
fingers and as you can tell your braid
is<00:03:22.919> not<00:03:23.099> unraveling<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.599> repeat<00:03:25.049> this

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
is not unraveling so you repeat this

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.890 
is not unraveling so you repeat this
step<00:03:26.010> throughout<00:03:26.669> the<00:03:26.879> whole<00:03:27.090> entire<00:03:27.510> head

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
step throughout the whole entire head

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.490 
step throughout the whole entire head
and<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.739> will<00:03:29.040> have<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.729> big<00:03:30.479> head<00:03:31.229> of

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
and you will have a big head of

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.250 
and you will have a big head of
voluminous<00:03:32.250> crimps<00:03:32.940> once<00:03:33.419> all<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:34.049> is

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
voluminous crimps once all of this is

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.039 
voluminous crimps once all of this is
dry<00:03:34.530> well<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.310> can<00:03:35.519> even<00:03:35.790> accelerate<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
dry well you can even accelerate the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.439 
dry well you can even accelerate the
process<00:03:37.260> by<00:03:37.680> taking<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.099> hair<00:03:38.340> dryer<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.970> then

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
process by taking a hair dryer and then

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.569 
process by taking a hair dryer and then
even<00:03:39.750> putting<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.620> hair<00:03:40.799> dryer<00:03:41.069> over<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
even putting the hair dryer over the

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.979 
even putting the hair dryer over the
braid<00:03:41.849> if<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.060> want<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.299> accelerate<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.840> but

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
braid if you want to accelerate it but

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.210 
braid if you want to accelerate it but
if<00:03:43.049> you<00:03:43.169> want<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.440> can<00:03:43.560> just<00:03:43.739> wait<00:03:43.889> for<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.129> to

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
if you want you can just wait for it to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.550
