 February 17 for many residents by the sea 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.620
 will become obvious unpleasant afternoon in not 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.219
 the andes 17 mezen 18 one 19 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.929
 Arkhangelsk 21 and Severodvinsk 22 this 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.130
 not the exact time signals, all the more 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 no weather forecast 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 These are rubles, which will have to be posted 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.199
 who uses public services 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 of transport 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.500
 this decision was made by the agency 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.420
 tariffs and prices of regional 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.789
 governments after turning to them 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.920
 association of the transport workers 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.920
 the appetite of the latter was much stronger 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.230
 betrothal carriers were much higher 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.430
 than 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.800
 proposed by the agency 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.680
 tariff app came pour homme 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.530
 scudo 30 rubles on their own intelligence to 27 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 rubles, we carefully analyzed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.760
 all those documents and materials received 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.190
 carriers part of the costs were 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 found to be unfounded 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.219
 the decision to raise the tariff was taken 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.719
 after signing the tripartite 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.410
 agreements between regional 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.300
 by the government 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 City Hall of the Arkhangelsk Regional 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.439
 car transport associations like 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.450
 came to this joint document 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.460
 and what it provides told us 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.409
 deputy head of agency for 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.979
 the transport of the Arkhangelsk region Oleg 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.260
 mishukov 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 we wrote his comment on this topic 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.750
 on the eve I advise you to listen 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.110
 we understand very carefully 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.770
 and see what's happening on the roads today 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.549
 Arkhangelsk city means we suggested 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.380
 carrier to move away from that kind 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.540
 transportation and which today we see on 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.260
 the street of the city ​​of Arkhangelsk is puzzles 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.260
 means carrier offered 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.100
 now apply low-floor 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.620
 buses of medium and large capacity 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.080
 This is the type of transport that will be 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.670
 suitable for primarily for 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.950
 low mobility groups and for 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.220
 another ice for another category 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.870
 citizens means also we suggested 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.280
 carrier to develop a standard of services 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.500
 which involves raising 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.340
 qualities 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.430
 passenger transport carriers themselves 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 prices with our offers mean 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.370
 what's this 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.780
 after we hang the fare like 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.120
 will rise to reef on the passage 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.750
 we will no longer hear the moto buses from 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.110
 walkie talkies of boorish conductors 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.160
 endless race for odd ruble so 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.730
 Further 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.820
 I want to say one thing if it is 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.950
 was conducted for 20 years by one 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.570
 the day of this soul but i want to point out that 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.560
 present tripartite agreement 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.410
 and the meeting was organized 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.960
 first time we are with carriers 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.230
 reached a certain agreement then 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:02.040
 have they gone 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.620
 to change exactly the quality of service 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.329
 which exist today that is they 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.640
 ready to change that state of affairs on 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.519
 the territory of the city of Arkhangelsk we 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.189
 we consider it necessary to intervene in 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.780
 this process and with the mayor's office 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.700
 somehow here 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.110
 improve the quality of passenger traffic 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.970
 and the sun 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.750
 we believe that today is already 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:37.050
 no more i think that 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:40.380
 passengers are ready to raise the fare ready 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.530
 but if on where we open social 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.950
 Network chastised look on the Internet and 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.960
 all residents feel I think that 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.660
 most residents of Arkhangelsk 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.300
 it means they are only interested in one 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.270
 the question is yes we will stop see enough for 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:02.190
 the roads of our city is the only 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.710
 question i think people don’t think i 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.750
 sure so I say if you read 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.170
 let's say that even the comments 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.750
 exactly 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.240
 were about the conclusion of a tripartite 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.820
 agreement of all interests one 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.730
 the only question is i think that 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:23.080
 everyone is tired of these races here yes 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.060
 Here are these traffic congestion yes yes I think 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.640
 what is it just for today in 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.020
 city ​​roads we see extreme 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.410
 driving and testing probably passengers 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.240
 I don't know what else to call it further 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.480
 you just have nowhere Oleg surprised you 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.020
 really think that I will be better 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.150
 I do not think I'm sure such confidence 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.040
 official certainly inspires optimism but 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.260
 sorry for the banal phrase time 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.810
 will show the last time fares 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.300
 raised in arkhangelsk in 2013 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.820
 then everyone said everything would change but 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.040
 the result is rather its absence in our 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.960
 buses and on the roads select mat of 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.150
 walkie-talkie rudeness conductors 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.890
 race for survival through the city streets and 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.510
 prospectus and illegals 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.220
 and indeed since that time 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.050
 Arkhangelsk disappeared municipal 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.000
 transportation has never been better 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.790
 transport area every year 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.880
 decayed more and more therefore with difficulty and 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.350
 it is believed that something will change to this in 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.840
 principle hints and the chairman of the board 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.700
 associations of auto transport workers of the region 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.210
 which says what tariff which 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.650
 approved they are not satisfied with this 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.010
 raising the district is not enough for 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.990
 to make a big difference she 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.790
 let's say the solution is anti-crisis for 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.270
 order not to die 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.730
 Transport think in this situation I one 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.830
 It is good that in legal transport will be 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.490
 provide benefits even if not many 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.750
 categories of the population but already something 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.730
 under this agreement in 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.070
 to protect individual 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.590
 categories of citizens 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.130
 granted benefits this first 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.480
 turn 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.450
 veterans and invalids great 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.570
 patriotic war this pensioners 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.700
 over 70 years old 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.890
 benefits are also available 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.450
 free travel for individuals 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.860
 rehabilitated from political 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.319
 repression 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.080
 and from the regional budget is paid for 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.200
 cash in the amount of 233 rubles 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.860
 this 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.570
 large families, though these benefits are not 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.220
 will provide illegal 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.480
 carriers for example bus 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.210
 one route 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.670
 or 104 they carry at their discretion 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.010
 no they are not afraid of a campaign they are 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.200
 drove and will go as they do 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.810
 for many many years now see someone 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.270
 very profitable by the way our authorities still 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.430
 advised not to sit down in illegal 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.920
 bus and thus not support them 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.450
 just go and figure out which one of them 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.450
 who is not written on them
