00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 yes i should make her champion again 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.569
 welcome to another 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.910
 video on his channel and today there is 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.059
 times a round dominion on the map 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.309
 MÃ¼ther and 20 25 was played here with 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.929
 the 1 94 and mp 7 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.210
 I always change here in between 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.570
 and you have to say if you are downstairs 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.710
 on the left, the score is 70 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 122 the game is still close to four 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.140
 minutes 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.619
 I am, as so often lately 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.880
 in the middle of a game brown tinted and java 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.929
 Monday say I have three here 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 People are playing for once 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.050
 browser then the track was olli fi 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.510
 robin hood tax the max we have one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.739
 bit black ops 2 played and search 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 a bit of domination and is always in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.610
 that dreamed something like that first 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.170
 have of course seen was at the bottom left 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.700
 the residue that we already in the middle of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.350
 the second half are divided 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.940
 the critics of the opponents were already 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.699
 built up the had constantly with 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.309
 entron end comes without air blows without 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.410
 At the end there was a black one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.960
 actually you should have gone out again 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.539
 but i tried okay 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.729
 just once to their party because drinne 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.869
 and I can give it a try if I still have it 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.710
 somehow draw or victory 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.880
 rauszuholen 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.740
 we fought to the last 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.140
 second and I once said something like that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.610
 most like to look at each other 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 if there is any tension better 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.159
 last customer if it still win system 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.320
 or not 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.909
 and that's how it will be in this match 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 I will not reveal who 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.630
 winners can tell if you are 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.549
 you like to look and I wanted 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.020
 ask questions so far with you so if 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.060
 you play with a few friends 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.240
 no matter if now call of duty black ops 2 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.799
 or mp3 or mw2 whatever you want 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.900
 just play it again now 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.310
 in two as we do in the case and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.619
 seeks dominance in the threefold 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.790
 party and seems pure in the middle of the game 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.740
 and lower left 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.869
 we have a pretty big one 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 residue lying back against yours 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.500
 it is not going to be like that 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.060
 you just do it like we do 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 For example, the trainer tries the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 to win 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.049
 even if you are neat in the beginning 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.719
 cashes or ever makes others 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.850
 the simple saying I do not need a buck 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.930
 i like to get out there i am my end effect 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.000
 No matter what you do 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.110
 stays inside and loses as 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.969
 even wins one is happy 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.649
 of course you should go out there 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.379
 you get the location but most 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.849
 and heard that shit 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.040
 statistics talk really well so 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.299
 sometimes when I have a son 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.590
 come in and me okay 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.209
 alone, that makes little sense, of course 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.700
 also from the shit you on the news 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.180
 because in the end it does not matter if I'm there 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.769
 now there are 120 loose because 120 on it 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.519
 nobody looks in my eyes anyway 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.659
 jannis always like to be in the 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.790
 we write comments that sometime 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.260
 do you do but what you can write 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.609
 if you are in the company for example 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 played and what you do when you 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.010
 Alone plays the case the match was 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.720
 really cool we just tried 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.939
 once to secure two flags 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.170
 to make points and there time always 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.150
 was less and the residue still 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.680
 was relatively big with a cut off 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.629
 beginning on three flags 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.220
 We always did that twice 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.200
 on the other hand, the flag is currently on 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.849
 then has one has the middle flag 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.859
 set and another which we 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.530
 already had and so we could 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.239
 partly also three flags at the same time 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.040
 Soaps I was able to do the classics again 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.569
 had to build up after a time sometimes 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.400
 a black border properly believe nico 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.769
 had reached him then and thus 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.840
 she was just a lot easier 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.849
 play for us we knew where the ina 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.349
 spawn their kids could built up 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.819
 that means it could not do any of the 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.359
 be expanded controller 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.949
 and yes we could say so now 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.720
 ever conquer the victory 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.190
 but it really cool in any case 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.169
 match and I'll look that I'm there 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.669
 one next day or if I am 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.989
 generally he that he play something 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.639
 if you can see that, of course 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.079
 Maybe I could do it 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.669
 there is another view there is yes 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.729
 such a beautiful function on the view 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:40.909
 two in the kinomodus that one from the 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.500
 view of a showmaster 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.810
 and if you want I can too 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.129
 looking for what to tell or that 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.959
 try the gameplay too 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.150
 comment on how the whole thing ended 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.250
 is then in between sometimes the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.510
 view change the individual player but 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.979
 I would say wait and see 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.439
 watch if I play a game of games 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:59.780
