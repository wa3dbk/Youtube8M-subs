00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.730
 hello to all and press, which means it is nearing 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.130
 wonderful holiday March 8 and today 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.250
 together with you i will do very nice 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.779
 gift on grandmother's mom and so 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 devices and materials 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.750
 Well , firstly it is ordinary scissors to glue 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.820
 you can use this principle not 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.460
 such glue is spent on fabric 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.260
 nights helped me with this when i 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.550
 I made a wrapper for our bouquet 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.030
 I attached such a bow 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.040
 he was looking for the fabric I pasted paper and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.980
 principle of using this glue very quickly 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.940
 everything stuck very well to us 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.940
 need rice paper 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.879
 I saw two colors with us very much 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.739
 liked and combinations if the paper 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.760
 differs from usually not very thin 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.180
 they are such streaks filiform well look 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.800
 I think you will find for the wrapper not 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.720
 be sure to look for just such paper 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.270
 You can take the success of the usual a4 white and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.490
 if you notice the corners what patterns 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.220
 4 made this special scissors think 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.080
 you guessed the fences visible so 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 a corner that breaks the principle here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.420
 so unusual and look very nice 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.700
 but I do n't think they need to fight 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.479
 then just for the sake of one time can be cut 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.299
 like this wavy will also be very 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.240
 good nila look 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.090
 I do not advise buying such a wrapper 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.409
 dense can yes she is of course very 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.229
 nice and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.799
 but when will you do the speed you have 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.950
 just take the bends and it will turn out like this 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:52.100
 not very beautiful fold that of 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.909
 this particular little road and so 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.020
 devices of the material almost all but left 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.259
 us such wire 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.630
 she bends very well and most importantly 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.549
 green I think the principle will be 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.729
 easy to find for can on sold in 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.880
 any store almost in love and she us 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.819
 will need to stalk so let's get started 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.330
 so clean yourself do it we do 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.090
 such here billet different sizes and 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.209
 paper funds 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.870
 the biggest let me green 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.870
 I have less 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.850
 pink then less green to me and so 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.459
 less and less so that we have turned 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.480
 such a flower themselves impose each on 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.330
 friend or take our wire and we will 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.150
 do with together take a little forest then 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.680
 there is it I will be a little bit above 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.970
 twist it wake the middle 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.340
 little flower and a little lower so first 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:58.150
 twist and start doing yourself 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.150
 petals that is it is 1 1 petal 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.130
 here is the second or strike 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.480
 decade 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.320
 and lift the wire away from you and that's what 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.680
 so quickly we got this 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.690
 there are petals and a little bit 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.240
 left on top so you can screw it up 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.750
 and it came out to us like this I think on 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.610
 white background will be seen this way again 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.400
 how small it happened to translate them 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:35.410
 and take the flower itself and just tip 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.410
 We also have a sharp wire pierced 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.360
 poke a flower to get us out 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.230
 middle I think you will not be difficult 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.930
 make such a cone of paper 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.540
 be sure to seal the bottom to you 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.170
 Your flowers and gift nemo 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.600
 from the cloth will eat such a bow and with 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.360
 glue it a little bit 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.910
 wait for the city to come to the end and we 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.950
 can you be our flowers 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.750
 such a wrapper end you have 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.540
 Get a few here such here 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.640
 flowers can be changed 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.580
 application sequence stencil 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.730
 of and you will have them different even with 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.890
 using the usual two different types of paper 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.880
 I did that when you can do 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.940
 510 as many as you want 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.540
 Cone insert points you as I do not 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.580
 Said and made such 30. 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.980
 Framed hand I can share it myself 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.190
 to make five was a bunch of cuckoos and 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.170
 make them of different heights so that one 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.840
 we lowered peeking the other was smaller 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.650
 it was interesting well I wish you 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.150
 Successes to get you 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.150
