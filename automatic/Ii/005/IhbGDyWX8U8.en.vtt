00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.190
 Oops real condition real length so far it is quite june 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 It is the bottom yet even a good feeling to raise 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.039

 It is always delicious that it is delicious 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.970
 It is covered 6 e 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.300
 A game that lets you really fly 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.409
 Please take this speed 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.950

 Tsuka Yassy 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:35.800
 Mach is the only way to go 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.790
 Do not tighten this at the speed you hit 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.080
 There is still a considerable distance with 1st place I do not give up Lager 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.280
 In the part where this wears 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.840
 Is the difference with the first place of the announcement of the last lap entry 5 seconds? 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.230
 Well then, bgm is great- it's totally different with and without it 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.370

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.890
 Nara I think that you want to add a difference in the next curve 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:48.720
 I'm just a little bit better I'm a curve whore from here 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:53.490
 I think that I want to make a curve in tension , and after that, it's a little while 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.640
 The goal If you turn the four last of the large curve is not to speak so say that it is Atochotto 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.640

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.120
