about hydrangeas even by longtime
gardeners<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.149> change<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
gardeners is that you can change the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
gardeners is that you can change the
color<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> balloons<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:08.129> by<00:02:08.310> making<00:02:08.700> it
