00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.820
 hello everyone guys are lor xd and like 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.779
 promised today I returned with the quaestor 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.160
 nuclear in all against all where 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.200
 I will succeed in taking a nuclear 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.200
 with the mnc as I had already anticipated 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.190
 look at this fortune I said 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 the beginning is not all so the game e 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.160
 I forgot to tell you some things 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 in the last video for example as you see 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.500
 at the top there is now a kind of mino 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 that would be mine but moving and not 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 it's my idea I got it from one 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.650
 American English youtuber I don't know well 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.330
 than to one million members and since 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.960
 I followed it and liked this idea 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:05.339
 they say reused is not me 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.530
 really liked this nuclear and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.070
 above all because all against all but 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.020
 also because I made hackers indeed 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.329
 I will succeed in taking only managing 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.420
 this small part of the spot but of 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.310
 we'll talk about this later because precisely 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 this video here as you read from 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.539
 title are the five tips for 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.740
 bend a nuclear in all 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.569
 contributions 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 then for those who didn't know it 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:33.539
 I explain nuclear power would reach 30 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.369
 row killings with weapons without 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.950
 need killing we want to stay 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.380
 you can use them there is no evil 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.799
 however if you use or make serious decisions that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.420
 they do not kill sails counts that is vi 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.539
 I explain if you take an attack 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.770
 lightning was the quadruple fan notebook 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.970
 it's not like you 're four in a row 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.850
 for nuclear power 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 you are 0 in a row if you are dead 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.070
 obviously if you are not what you were 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 before pulling the attack was mine 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.310
 having said this, I begin to list the five 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.070
 tips to take more 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.710
 quickly possible and take it because 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.070
 it is not nearly a nuclear in all against 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.920
 all 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.770
 then the first is how you will see it is 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.790
 use a bones soaked because one 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.100
 with silvets because the decisions made 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.000
 with the fast equipment 4 bones 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.640
 enter and anything else thanks count for 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.160
 the nuclear streep and if you are 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.100
 in all against all our inverts 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.070
 will certainly make you the management or 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.959
 one however will help you a lot 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:45.240
 simply to take nuclear power and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.130
 so I recommend it and place it 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.800
 especially in the places where you know that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.830
 more people go by but you know that 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.830
 not and anna b use the conservative 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.989
 I think it is less so than the taymor 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.100
 however, because one cannot be avoided 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.350
 what unbearable mind was 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.660
 considered the expert, however, he feels it 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.540
 Saturday 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.570
 and in any case I don't use it online 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.490
 simply in all the contributions that 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.130
 among other things there was never played 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.600
 definitely to create and not just because 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.440
 unlocks by doing nuclear power 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.900
 in all contents 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.730
 then the second piece of advice is to use 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.090
 a submachine gun a reporter would leave 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.630
 it is easy to do it is 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.480
 obviously there is no assault 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:35.030
 of bad and the third is to use the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.440
 silencer because you have to be 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.910
 absolutely invisible radar enemies 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.980
 Meanwhile, look at my connection 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.210
 how it always helps me 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.040
 and an attack and you must be 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.590
 invisible radar enemies because if they 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:55.010
 they see you must also use 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.780
 ghost for strength because if maybe you 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.630
 themselves and their launches 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.380
 whatever you are finished and jacques 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.880
 at the same time to recover myself 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.750
 ammunition precisely in the weapon but also for 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.360
 the left pole is the fourth piece of advice is 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.700
 don't leave too much because if you 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.070
 let too much will happen to you very often 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.500
 who kill you behind me to do 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.290
 This nuclear took me a lot 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.040
 time especially because it leaves now there 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.520
 a continuation and amy killed 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.410
 always from behind and does not mean camper 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.540
 area means simply to control 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.110
 a 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.640
 and indeed the fifth council is indeed 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.470
 as you see in this map here that there 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.120
 new sterns are a main one 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.800
 try i got what i am 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.390
 happened before where I was born here 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.170
 I'm stuck in and I'm doing up and 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.960
 down and check this pope to see 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.910
 in the ras with always there and together with this 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.580
 fifth council would also be there 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.290
 using a counterattack egg 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.660
 prominence or simple a goodbye not 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.730
 having blocked by the virus to that 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.320
 used on beautiful video locations 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.690
 guys is pretty much done 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.290
 remember to leave a like one 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.970
 comment with mentality to do if the 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.640
 video you liked leave me a 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.640
 like and sign up hello to everyone
