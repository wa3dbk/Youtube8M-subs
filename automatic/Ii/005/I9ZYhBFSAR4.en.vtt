or<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.820> can<00:02:45.720> sketch<00:02:46.470> out<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:47.100> scene<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.700> i'm

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
or you can sketch out a scene like i'm

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.660 
or you can sketch out a scene like i'm
going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> show<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.360> here<00:02:48.840> or<00:02:49.290> at<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.459> end<00:02:50.550> of

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
going to show you here or at the end of

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.610 
going to show you here or at the end of
the<00:02:50.760> tutorial<00:02:50.880> also<00:02:51.540> show<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:52.440> can

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the tutorial also show you you can

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.400 
the tutorial also show you you can
actually<00:02:52.820> free<00:02:53.820> hand<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.750> convert

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
actually free hand in here and convert

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.220 
actually free hand in here and convert
it<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.680> mesh<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.430> use<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.480> straight<00:02:58.050> into

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
it to a mesh and use it straight into

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.309 
it to a mesh and use it straight into
your<00:02:58.319> scene<00:02:58.819> so<00:02:59.870> first<00:03:00.870> thing<00:03:01.019> we're<00:03:01.110> going<00:03:01.230> to

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
your scene so first thing we're going to

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.330 
your scene so first thing we're going to
do<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:02.040> go<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.700> top<00:03:03.000> view<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:04.190> we're<00:03:05.190> going

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
do is go to the top view and we're going

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.960 
do is go to the top view and we're going
to<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.970> draw<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:07.010> square<00:03:08.750> basically<00:03:10.880> but<00:03:11.880> I

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
to just draw a square basically but I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.210 
to just draw a square basically but I
like<00:03:12.209> my<00:03:12.390> thickness<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.989> little<00:03:13.200> bit<00:03:13.319> better<00:03:13.560> or

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
like my thickness a little bit better or

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.390 
like my thickness a little bit better or
bigger<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.180> let's<00:03:15.750> sleep<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.319> crease<00:03:17.280> your

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
bigger so let's sleep that crease your

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.920 
bigger so let's sleep that crease your
thickness<00:03:19.670> that's<00:03:20.670> better<00:03:21.180> nice<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.750> thick

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
thickness that's better nice and thick

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.229 
thickness that's better nice and thick
and<00:03:25.070> I'm<00:03:26.070> just<00:03:26.220> holding<00:03:26.400> down<00:03:26.640> shift<00:03:26.700> left

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
and I'm just holding down shift left

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.640 
and I'm just holding down shift left
mouse<00:03:27.600> button<00:03:28.220> then<00:03:29.220> from<00:03:29.459> there<00:03:30.049> I'm<00:03:31.049> going

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
mouse button then from there I'm going

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.160 
mouse button then from there I'm going
to<00:03:32.720> select<00:03:34.310> front<00:03:35.310> view<00:03:36.709> go<00:03:37.709> there<00:03:38.810> get<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.870> top

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
to select front view go there get a top

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.509 
to select front view go there get a top
view<00:03:41.359> go<00:03:42.359> here<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.920> I'm<00:03:43.920> going<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.070> draw<00:03:44.340> one

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
view go here and I'm going to draw one

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.670 
view go here and I'm going to draw one
of<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.730> sides<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.450> cube<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.200> go<00:03:46.350> back<00:03:46.470> into

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
of the sides of the cube so go back into

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.120 
of the sides of the cube so go back into
front<00:03:47.010> view<00:03:47.690> shift<00:03:48.690> left<00:03:48.989> mouse<00:03:49.260> button<00:03:49.709> bring

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
front view shift left mouse button bring

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.610 
front view shift left mouse button bring
it<00:03:50.220> up<00:03:50.450> side<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.900> down<00:03:52.739> that's<00:03:54.320> basically<00:03:55.320> one

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
it up side and down that's basically one

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.560 
it up side and down that's basically one
side<00:03:55.829> of<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.980> cube<00:03:56.190> right<00:03:56.370> there<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:59.390> nope<00:04:00.390> at

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
side of the cube right there so nope at

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.860 
side of the cube right there so nope at
six<00:04:02.209> if<00:04:03.209> you're<00:04:03.450> using<00:04:03.600> laptop<00:04:04.079> FN<00:04:04.730> 0<00:04:05.870> or

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.219 

and<00:04:17.699> it's<00:04:18.509> kind<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.749> draw<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.049> out<00:04:19.169> here<00:04:21.229> see

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
and it's kind of draw it out here see

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.869 
and it's kind of draw it out here see
how<00:04:22.319> that<00:04:22.530> looks<00:04:22.939> looking<00:04:23.939> good<00:04:25.490> view<00:04:26.490> from

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879 
how that looks looking good view from

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:38.779 
how that looks looking good view from
view<00:04:28.490> rotate<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:31.370> again<00:04:32.749> numpad<00:04:33.749> 6<00:04:37.699> kind<00:04:38.699> of

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
view rotate it again numpad 6 kind of

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.360 
view rotate it again numpad 6 kind of
get<00:04:38.939> a<00:04:38.969> view<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.300> where<00:04:39.569> we<00:04:39.749> are<00:04:39.779> and<00:04:40.229> we<00:04:41.189> want

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
get a view of where we are and we want

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.800 
get a view of where we are and we want
to<00:04:41.430> put<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.669> cursor<00:04:42.120> where<00:04:42.330> we<00:04:42.509> want<00:04:42.719> our

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
to put the cursor where we want our

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.379 
to put the cursor where we want our
stuff<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.199> go<00:04:43.379> so<00:04:44.370> it's<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.849> correct

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
stuff to go so it's in the correct

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.809 
stuff to go so it's in the correct
orientation<00:04:45.719> here<00:04:49.340> okay<00:04:50.340> front<00:04:51.120> view<00:04:51.360> and

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
orientation here okay front view and

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.610 
orientation here okay front view and
then<00:04:53.819> shift<00:04:54.300> left<00:04:55.110> mouse<00:04:55.379> button<00:04:57.620> right

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
then shift left mouse button right

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.790 
then shift left mouse button right
through<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.779> let's<00:05:00.779> actually<00:05:01.020> go<00:05:01.379> back<00:05:01.590> into

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
through it let's actually go back into

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.689 
through it let's actually go back into
front<00:05:02.189> view<00:05:02.930> rotate<00:05:03.930> around<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:07.699> complete

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
front view rotate around and complete

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:18.310 
front view rotate around and complete
this<00:05:08.849> up

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.240 

perfect<00:05:19.340> so<00:05:20.340> now<00:05:20.460> we<00:05:20.520> have<00:05:21.410> three<00:05:22.410> sketch<00:05:22.860> cube

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
perfect so now we have three sketch cube

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.380 
perfect so now we have three sketch cube
that<00:05:24.000> we<00:05:24.300> just<00:05:24.510> may<00:05:24.630> hear<00:05:25.340> so<00:05:26.340> let's<00:05:26.700> also<00:05:26.880> add

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
that we just may hear so let's also add

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.580 
that we just may hear so let's also add
kind<00:05:28.050> of<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:29.790> background<00:05:30.260> make<00:05:31.260> you<00:05:31.380> kind<00:05:31.500> of

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
kind of the background make you kind of

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.820 
kind of the background make you kind of
into<00:05:31.920> a<00:05:31.950> scene<00:05:32.840> so<00:05:33.840> let's<00:05:34.110> go<00:05:34.230> to<00:05:34.290> top<00:05:34.560> view

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
into a scene so let's go to top view

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:47.120 
into a scene so let's go to top view
drag<00:05:37.830> a<00:05:38.120> larger<00:05:39.120> box<00:05:41.420> around<00:05:43.280> this<00:05:44.280> one<00:05:46.130> go

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
drag a larger box around this one go

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.630 
drag a larger box around this one go
check<00:05:47.490> it<00:05:47.640> looks<00:05:48.480> fine<00:05:51.290> go<00:05:52.290> to<00:05:52.460> we're<00:05:53.460> going<00:05:53.580> to

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
check it looks fine go to we're going to

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.780 
check it looks fine go to we're going to
draw<00:05:54.290> sides<00:05:55.290> on<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:57.060> these<00:05:57.240> edges<00:05:57.630> here<00:05:58.490> so<00:05:59.490> get

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
draw sides on to these edges here so get

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.840 
draw sides on to these edges here so get
it<00:05:59.940> quickly<00:06:00.450> orientate<00:06:01.230> it<00:06:01.380> zoom<00:06:02.220> out<00:06:03.710> shift

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850

off mouse button over here here here and
I<00:06:13.170> just<00:06:13.200> drew<00:06:13.560> side<00:06:14.870> let's<00:06:15.870> also<00:06:16.050> go<00:06:17.180> front

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
I just drew side let's also go front

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.400 
view up at six boom boom and let's try
to<00:06:30.060> actually<00:06:30.270> make<00:06:30.630> that<00:06:30.750> look<00:06:30.930> a<00:06:31.050> little<00:06:31.230> bit

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
to actually make that look a little bit

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.990 
to actually make that look a little bit
better

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.350 

and<00:06:42.700> shut<00:06:43.700> up<00:06:44.110> see<00:06:45.110> how<00:06:45.260> we<00:06:45.320> made<00:06:46.240> just<00:06:47.240> a

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
and shut up see how we made just a

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.950 
and shut up see how we made just a
simple<00:06:48.970> cube<00:06:50.350> in<00:06:51.350> a<00:06:52.040> kind<00:06:52.580> of<00:06:52.660> walled<00:06:53.660> area

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
simple cube in a kind of walled area

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.580 
simple cube in a kind of walled area
here<00:06:54.880> just<00:06:55.880> using<00:06:56.360> the<00:06:56.840> grease<00:06:57.050> pencil<00:06:57.410> tool

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
here just using the grease pencil tool

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.620 
here just using the grease pencil tool
and<00:06:57.860> basically<00:06:58.790> you<00:06:58.970> can<00:06:59.120> just<00:06:59.300> use<00:06:59.450> it<00:06:59.600> to

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
and basically you can just use it to

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.510 
and basically you can just use it to
sketch<00:07:00.410> out<00:07:00.560> things<00:07:00.890> like<00:07:01.010> this<00:07:01.360> in<00:07:02.360> 3d<00:07:02.870> so

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
sketch out things like this in 3d so

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.860 
sketch out things like this in 3d so
after<00:07:04.520> you<00:07:04.610> get<00:07:04.790> a<00:07:04.820> feeling<00:07:05.150> of<00:07:05.420> how<00:07:05.570> you<00:07:05.630> want

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
after you get a feeling of how you want

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.900 
after you get a feeling of how you want
your<00:07:05.990> scene<00:07:06.320> set<00:07:06.530> up<00:07:06.680> you<00:07:07.220> can<00:07:07.400> go<00:07:07.580> ahead<00:07:07.730> and

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
your scene set up you can go ahead and

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.150 
your scene set up you can go ahead and
stick<00:07:08.720> in<00:07:08.840> your<00:07:08.870> cube<00:07:09.320> and<00:07:09.530> do<00:07:09.590> your<00:07:09.770> modeling

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
stick in your cube and do your modeling

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.860 
stick in your cube and do your modeling
and<00:07:10.340> such<00:07:11.110> also<00:07:12.110> you<00:07:13.070> can<00:07:13.960> r<00:07:14.960> convert<00:07:15.830> to

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
and such also you can r convert to

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.870 
and such also you can r convert to
something<00:07:17.870> like<00:07:18.669> a<00:07:19.669> path<00:07:20.510> busier<00:07:21.260> armature<00:07:21.950> do

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
something like a path busier armature do

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.460 
something like a path busier armature do
one<00:07:23.030> of<00:07:23.060> these<00:07:23.710> doing<00:07:24.710> hold<00:07:24.890> see<00:07:25.280> and<00:07:26.470> it's

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.470 
one of these doing hold see and it's

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.630 
one of these doing hold see and it's
mesh<00:07:27.680> now<00:07:28.810> and<00:07:29.810> get<00:07:30.050> all<00:07:30.290> sorts<00:07:31.160> of<00:07:31.280> fun<00:07:31.460> with

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:31.640 
mesh now and get all sorts of fun with

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.180 
mesh now and get all sorts of fun with
that<00:07:33.130> so<00:07:34.130> I<00:07:34.280> mean<00:07:34.820> with<00:07:35.390> the<00:07:35.630> new<00:07:35.840> grease<00:07:36.800> a

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
that so I mean with the new grease a

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.159 
that so I mean with the new grease a
pencil<00:07:38.030> tool<00:07:38.240> you<00:07:38.660> can<00:07:39.370> plan<00:07:40.370> out<00:07:40.520> your<00:07:40.550> scenes

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
pencil tool you can plan out your scenes

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.330 
pencil tool you can plan out your scenes
kind<00:07:42.169> of<00:07:42.320> sketch<00:07:42.530> out<00:07:42.710> what<00:07:42.740> you<00:07:42.979> want<00:07:43.160> to<00:07:43.250> do

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340 
kind of sketch out what you want to do

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.200 
kind of sketch out what you want to do
or<00:07:44.030> are<00:07:44.540> with<00:07:45.320> that<00:07:45.350> convert<00:07:46.190> to<00:07:46.220> busier<00:07:47.000> and

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.210 
or are with that convert to busier and

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.790 
or are with that convert to busier and
then<00:07:48.070> I'll<00:07:49.070> see<00:07:49.550> to<00:07:49.580> convert<00:07:50.419> to<00:07:50.630> mesh<00:07:50.930> you<00:07:51.650> can

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800 
then I'll see to convert to mesh you can

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.450 
then I'll see to convert to mesh you can
actually<00:07:51.979> create<00:07:52.729> little<00:07:53.030> objects<00:07:54.460> carefully

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:55.460 
actually create little objects carefully

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.920 
actually create little objects carefully
this<00:07:56.120> is<00:07:56.270> only<00:07:56.450> carefully<00:07:57.020> and<00:07:57.700> paste<00:07:58.700> them

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:58.930 
this is only carefully and paste them

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.350 
this is only carefully and paste them
right<00:07:59.930> into<00:08:00.080> your<00:08:00.260> scene<00:08:00.530> so<00:08:01.430> I<00:08:01.729> hope<00:08:01.970> you

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 
right into your scene so I hope you

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.030 
right into your scene so I hope you
learned<00:08:03.200> a<00:08:03.350> little<00:08:03.530> bit<00:08:03.650> from<00:08:04.580> this<00:08:05.150> tutorial

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:06.040 
learned a little bit from this tutorial

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.240 
learned a little bit from this tutorial
I'm<00:08:07.040> using<00:08:07.280> the<00:08:07.610> grease<00:08:07.880> pencil<00:08:08.360> tool<00:08:08.600> and<00:08:09.250> I

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:10.250 
I'm using the grease pencil tool and I

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.770 
I'm using the grease pencil tool and I
hope<00:08:10.640> to<00:08:10.669> see<00:08:10.820> you<00:08:11.030> guys<00:08:11.210> in<00:08:11.510> the<00:08:11.540> next
