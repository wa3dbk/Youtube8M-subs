00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello today we are going to make choco flan or 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.559
 impossible cake very easy and in three 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.130
 steps i am and be from the kitchen of giselle 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.130
 dot com 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.269
 The first thing we will do is keep it on hand 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:40.230
 the mold already ready and buttered for 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.230
 that we do not stick data 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.850
 step 1 the candy we put to heat 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.949
 one pot and we'll add half a cup of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.530
 white sugar and a quarter cup of 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.809
 we are not going to touch it so that the 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.390
 sugar does not crystallize let the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.850
 heat do your work alone 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.710
 just start to take color I move a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.229
 little pot to caramelize 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.229
 even and we do it in the mold 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.860
 we give a few laps to cover 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.970
 well all the bottom and sides 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.970
 and we reserve it 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.049
 step 2 the quesillo of land 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 We will beat by hand or in the blender 5 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.860
 eggs 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.470
 a can of condensed milk 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.540
 whole milk we use the measure of the can 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.540
 previous 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.799
 and a spoonful of vanilla 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.650
 and we mix well 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.110
 and we will add this mixture to the mold 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.110
 where we have emptied the parameter 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.860
 we will place the mold inside another more 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.370
 large and we add water to bake it to 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.370
 bain marie 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.939
 bake we have at 220 degrees centigrade 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.560
 for 20 minutes and meanwhile we're going to 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.960
 make chocolate 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.010
 for this we are going to mix 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.010
 4 eggs 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.840
 a cup of cocoa or chocolate powder 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.950
 not instant 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.120
 half a cup of milk 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.120
 half a cup of oil 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.819
 one and a half cups of sugar 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.770
 a spoonful of baking powder 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.810
 and a cup and a half of wheat flour 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.360
 all use 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.569
 we beat by hand and ready easier 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.569
 impossible 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.450
 after 20 minutes of the quesillo in 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.640
 we are going to take it out of the oven 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.560
 and we are going to empty the cake mixture 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.120
 of chocolate on him very carefully 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.120
 so that it does not fall too abruptly 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.950
 and with a spatula we are going to spread it 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.950
 well so that it stays even 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.299
 and baked again between 40 and 45 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.660
 minutes also to bain-marie and 220 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.209
 degrees felt 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.700
 if the water was consumed we heat a 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.350
 little more and we will add the choco flan 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.050
 and will be ready when you introduce a 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.270
 stick out dry we will take it out of the 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.460
 oven and let it cool for an hour 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.639
 on a grid 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.960
 then with a knife very carefully 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.940
 we take off from the sides if it does 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.940
 is missing and we shake it a little 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.319
 we put a large plate on this one 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:54.459
 and we will quickly turn it around 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.459
 with a ninja movement 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.250
 we center them a little bit 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.240
 we cross our fingers and we give 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.240
 taps just in case 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.639
 and we already have our plan perfect 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.069
 let cool very well before serving 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.999
 and the rest is telling him that this cake is 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.999
 exquisite 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.430
