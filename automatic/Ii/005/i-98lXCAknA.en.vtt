a light plate right in front of you here

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.390 
a light plate right in front of you here
and<00:00:37.780> then<00:00:37.900> you<00:00:37.930> learn<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.410> squat<00:00:38.710> with<00:00:39.370> a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
and then you learn to squat with a

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.070 
and then you learn to squat with a
little<00:00:39.760> bit<00:00:39.910> of<00:00:40.000> load<00:00:40.330> that<00:00:40.840> you<00:00:40.930> can

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
little bit of load that you can

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.710 
little bit of load that you can
counterbalance<00:00:41.410> against<00:00:42.010> I<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:43.450> people

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
counterbalance against I think people

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.540 
counterbalance against I think people
they<00:00:44.350> tend<00:00:44.590> to<00:00:44.650> respond<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.220> this<00:00:45.340> type<00:00:45.400> of

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550
