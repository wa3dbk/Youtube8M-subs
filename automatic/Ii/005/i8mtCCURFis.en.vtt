00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.509
 the case packer calls ice cube 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:01.110
 Do you know what I see here the crowd around 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.330
 honed talent arrogance the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.670
 people are afraid 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.759
 they think you're dangerous but you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.490
 have something to say and that must be 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.500
 world is listening 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.910
 clear for the start is clear with one 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.800
 bauble plates can not here 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.140
 bills pay hits I control 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.520
 get coal 50 bucks 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.520
 Do you think you are rich now 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.940
 cube is now poet the sharpest you 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.830
 Do you know your lyrics in the water? 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.510
 I do not do anything else I have 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.190
 fierce beat and text for real 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.190
 road racing that's what you want to do with it 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.220
 actually nba would have something loud in it 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.220
 the art 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.290
 do you have any idea 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.670
 how many plates sold in late july 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.670
 starts everywhere 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.210
 these songs glorify gangsters and 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.350
 Drugs Our art reflects ours 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.090
 reality again the police force against 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.930
 children shocking people like you 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.420
 changed such a shit that is one 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.950
 tell threat of our government 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.260
 bit of truth and people are resting 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.600
 from the presentation of the songs every 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.340
 Police officers here sometimes say we want 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.310
 tell us what shit we fuck 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.550
 allowed to play but we are more likely to be allowed 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.550
 Boy 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.110
 21 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.569
 in poltergeist at that time there were many 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.060
 small allusions the boy had 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.459
 For example, Star Wars bedding was one 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.499
 may neither actionfigur and so on 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.810
 all these allusions fall in the 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:19.970
 Remake away the new poltergeist was 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.380
 produced by metro goldwyn the right one 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.419
 star wars are as known at 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.610
 Disney that will certainly be the reason 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:30.009
 to have been for such a small one 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.009
 very very regrettable detail
