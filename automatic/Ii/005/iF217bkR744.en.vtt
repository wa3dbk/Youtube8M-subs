00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.140
 there is an attic to guarantee that of the license which are intended for 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.120
 prostheses that come from the workers craftsmen of the hold onto technicians a 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.529
 important topic also in light of recent regulations that are the fruit 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.900
 of the transposition of European Union directives 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.430
 and since we talk about the health of katanas, it is not seen as a material for 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.390
 the only people in the business are all concerned and therefore better to pay attention 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.380
 of the regulatory changes introduced by the legislative decree 37 of this year in 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.649
 theme of custom-made medical devices 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.550
 during a seminar we talked about the confartigianato vicenza offered to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.370
 own dental technicians to provide clarifications on the critical points of the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.399
 new provisions to answer numerous questions of the participants was 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.269
 called the doctor and my bellocci 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.229
 of the general pharmacy medical devices department of the Ministry of the 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:58.080
 health 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.630
 and as always taken the request to type in security 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.650
 of devices from countries with low labor costs one of the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.020
 most debated topics 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 it was the one of the declaration of conformity that must accompany 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.820
 mandatory prostheses are a form of extra guarantee 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.000
 on whose presence patients should also pay attention 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.430
 first and foremost, the patient should be a professional killer he or she addresses 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.680
 from where device is manufactured 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.530
 device if fabrica too in Italy is a greater guarantee because anyway 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.450
 we are subject to the European directive which obliges us throughout the series 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.830
 of constraints that are demonstrated by the technical file statement of 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.080
 compliance that we deliver to the doctor and in this regard a circular of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.179
 ministry of health the ballad of the european union 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.329
 provides some indications for the benefit of both dental technicians and 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.740
 dentists 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.840
 we have adopted another circular note 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.070
 indicate solutions as available 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.259
 therefore a pair of the original tn is the dental technician as manufacturer 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.349
 and then provides two pairs 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.759
 l the dentist 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.899
 a 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:20.989
 of these couples the dentist the tn in his studio for 5 years 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.889
 the other lat makes available in the patient 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.659
 then we suggested with our circular note 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.639
 which the doctor to demonstrate 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.989
 which actually made this document available to the patient 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.199
 will be able to make him sign in alternative 2 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.719
 colin very simple modules 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.919
 1 in the event that terni tv the conformity declaration 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.609
 and the other one in case he takes a look at his dishes and his feast 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.830
 layout 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.799
 for the next five years 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.709
 also this sector has for some time been dealing with competition 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 foreign inevitable consequence of the so-called globalization 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.570
 and that commits craftsmanship on the one hand to pretend that this happens in full 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.190
 respect for the rules and then to give organizational suggestions 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:18.310
 confartigianato I am dying from or political-institutional to safeguard 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.770
 work of the companies on the territory and also with the new procedures that are 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.709
 also innovation and above all what is the subject of business networks 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.270
 put companies on the network in order to lower costs and be competitive 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.450
 with the outside world
