00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
intersection and then I can open up just

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.330 
intersection and then I can open up just

type I'll change that to open below so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.890 
type I'll change that to open below so
now<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.360> will<00:02:28.690> cut<00:02:28.930> our<00:02:29.580> floor<00:02:30.580> platform<00:02:31.270> for

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
now that will cut our floor platform for

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.070 
now that will cut our floor platform for
us<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.740> let's<00:02:33.670> create<00:02:33.850> an<00:02:34.120> opening<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.870> our

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
us and let's create an opening in our

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.490 
us and let's create an opening in our
railing<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:36.970> floorplan<00:02:37.690> I'll<00:02:37.960> select

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
railing so in that floorplan I'll select

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.560 
railing so in that floorplan I'll select
our<00:02:38.860> door<00:02:39.820> tool<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.650> our<00:02:41.650> doorway<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.570> let's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
our door tool and our doorway and let's

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.350 
our door tool and our doorway and let's
just<00:02:43.810> drop<00:02:44.140> one<00:02:44.440> in<00:02:44.680> here<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.400> I'll<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.150> use

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
just drop one in here and I'll just use

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.480 
just drop one in here and I'll just use
the<00:02:46.540> editing<00:02:46.990> handle<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.710> resize<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
the editing handle and resize the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.170 
the editing handle and resize the
opening<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:51.220> our<00:02:51.490> tiny-house

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
opening of it and with our tiny-house

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.930 
opening of it and with our tiny-house
since<00:02:52.600> there's<00:02:53.590> not<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.860> lot<00:02:54.130> of<00:02:54.160> space<00:02:54.490> for<00:02:54.910> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
since there's not a lot of space for a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.130 
since there's not a lot of space for a
staircase<00:02:56.130> I'm<00:02:57.130> going<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.550> place<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> ladder

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
staircase I'm going to place a ladder

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.960 
staircase I'm going to place a ladder
let's<00:02:59.140> go<00:02:59.290> back<00:02:59.560> down<00:02:59.830> to<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.190> first<00:03:00.490> floor

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
let's go back down to that first floor

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.020 
let's go back down to that first floor
and<00:03:02.220> get<00:03:03.220> into<00:03:03.520> our<00:03:03.550> library<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:06.490> I'm<00:03:06.730> just

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
and get into our library and I'm just

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.680 
and get into our library and I'm just
going<00:03:07.210> to<00:03:07.240> search<00:03:07.420> for<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.720> ladder<00:03:07.930> here<00:03:09.690> and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
going to search for a ladder here and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.680 
going to search for a ladder here and
I'll<00:03:10.810> select<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.350> ladder<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:12.210> just<00:03:13.210> drop<00:03:13.510> it

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
I'll select a ladder and just drop it

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.930 
I'll select a ladder and just drop it
right<00:03:13.720> into<00:03:14.310> my<00:03:15.310> design

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
right into my design

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.470 
right into my design
so<00:03:16.630> now<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.840> need<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.670> visually<00:03:18.670> see<00:03:18.940> where<00:03:19.300> that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
so now I need to visually see where that

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.230 
so now I need to visually see where that
opening<00:03:20.020> is<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.200> my<00:03:20.560> floor<00:03:20.830> plan<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.400> through

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
opening is in my floor plan and through

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.860 
opening is in my floor plan and through
our<00:03:22.570> tool<00:03:23.110> drop-down<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:25.120> can<00:03:25.330> click<00:03:25.630> on<00:03:25.810> our

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
our tool drop-down we can click on our

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.250 
our tool drop-down we can click on our
reference<00:03:26.470> floor<00:03:27.100> display<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:28.630> we<00:03:28.810> can<00:03:28.990> see

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
reference floor display so we can see

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.430 
reference floor display so we can see
where<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.560> opening<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.430> on<00:03:30.960> that<00:03:31.960> second

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
where that opening is on that second

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.850 
where that opening is on that second
floor<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.460> I'll<00:03:33.610> just<00:03:33.820> rotate<00:03:34.090> our<00:03:34.900> ladder

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
floor and I'll just rotate our ladder

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.730

since we did create a new room it will

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.330 
since we did create a new room it will
default<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.340> all<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.790> structural
