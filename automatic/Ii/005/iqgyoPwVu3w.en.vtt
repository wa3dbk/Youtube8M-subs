of management courses you often look at

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.920 
of management courses you often look at
situations<00:00:34.430> from<00:00:35.240> an<00:00:35.450> employee's

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
situations from an employee's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.260 
situations from an employee's
perspective<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.250> our<00:00:37.340> management<00:00:37.940> courses

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
perspective so in our management courses

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.940 
perspective so in our management courses
they<00:00:38.840> were<00:00:38.900> always<00:00:39.290> trying<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:39.710> come<00:00:39.920> across

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
they were always trying to come across

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.610 
they were always trying to come across
that<00:00:40.610> there<00:00:41.150> are<00:00:41.270> two<00:00:41.450> sides<00:00:41.720> what<00:00:42.260> the

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
that there are two sides what the

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.260 
that there are two sides what the
manager<00:00:42.860> has<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.520> do<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:43.910> what<00:00:44.090> their

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
manager has to do and what their

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.180 
manager has to do and what their
perspective<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.260> their<00:00:45.380> priorities<00:00:46.010> are

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
perspective is and their priorities are

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.190 
perspective is and their priorities are
and<00:00:46.490> then<00:00:46.640> also<00:00:46.850> what<00:00:47.450> makes<00:00:47.480> sense<00:00:47.960> and

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
and then also what makes sense and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.680 
and then also what makes sense and
what's<00:00:48.440> important<00:00:48.950> for<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.220> employees<00:00:49.730> that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
what's important for the employees that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.500 
what's important for the employees that
relationship<00:00:51.530> understanding<00:00:52.520> that<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.940> big

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
relationship understanding that is a big

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
relationship understanding that is a big
key<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:54.020> think<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.460> being<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.489> good<00:00:55.640> manager

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.139 

I<00:00:59.750> like<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.020> small<00:01:01.350> personal<00:01:02.129> classrooms<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I like the small personal classrooms a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.620 
I like the small personal classrooms a
lot<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.369> discussion<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> topics

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
lot of it is discussion about the topics

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
lot of it is discussion about the topics
about<00:01:06.960> how<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.799> would<00:01:08.130> approach<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.790> situation

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
about how you would approach a situation

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.480 
about how you would approach a situation
