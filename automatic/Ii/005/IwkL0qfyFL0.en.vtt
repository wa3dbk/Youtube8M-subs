bowl and grab it with the pliers and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.470 
bowl and grab it with the pliers and
lock<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.590> these<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.610> reversible<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> want

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
lock it these are reversible so you want

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.610 
lock it these are reversible so you want
to<00:00:45.539> make<00:00:45.660> sure<00:00:45.690> you're<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> continue

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to make sure you're going to continue

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.660 
to make sure you're going to continue
going<00:00:48.050> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> right<00:00:49.350> direction<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
going in the right direction is it

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.670 
going in the right direction is it
already<00:00:50.910> started<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:55.079> don't<00:00:55.289> want<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
already started you don't want to get it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
already started you don't want to get it
too<00:00:55.860> tight<00:00:56.160> either<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.289> will<00:00:58.289> tend

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
too tight either because that will tend

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.990 
too tight either because that will tend
to<00:00:58.590> weaken<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.600> safety<00:01:00.600> also<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:02.850> you're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to weaken the safety also and if you're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.219 
to weaken the safety also and if you're
a<00:01:03.030> little<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.300> shorter<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.750> always<00:01:03.930> add

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a little bit shorter you can always add

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
a little bit shorter you can always add
an<00:01:04.439> extra<00:01:05.780> twist<00:01:07.400> kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.580> I'm<00:01:08.760> doing
