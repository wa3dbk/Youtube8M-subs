enjoyed<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.410> as<00:03:16.560> well<00:03:16.710> because<00:03:16.920> i<00:03:17.010> know<00:03:17.070> that

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
enjoyed this as well because i know that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.530 
enjoyed this as well because i know that
when<00:03:17.400> we<00:03:17.550> started<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.030> second<00:03:18.360> faction

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
when we started the second faction

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.930 
when we started the second faction
series<00:03:19.110> up<00:03:19.260> things<00:03:19.830> weren't<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.190> same<00:03:20.220> you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
series up things weren't the same you

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.490 
series up things weren't the same you
know<00:03:21.060> there<00:03:21.270> was<00:03:21.390> still<00:03:21.870> kind<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.290> tension

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
know there was still kind of tension

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.520 
know there was still kind of tension
between<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.040> community<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.670> staff<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
between the community and the staff and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.250 
between the community and the staff and
me<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.800> an<00:03:25.890> extent<00:03:26.280> as<00:03:26.459> well<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.970> i<00:03:27.750> really

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
me to an extent as well and i really

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.170 
me to an extent as well and i really
felt<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.590> from<00:03:28.830> day<00:03:29.010> one<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.459> that's<00:03:29.640> pretty

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
felt that from day one and that's pretty

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.150 
felt that from day one and that's pretty
much<00:03:30.300> what<00:03:30.540> i<00:03:30.570> tried<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.900> avoid<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.620> course<00:03:31.950> it

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
much what i tried to avoid of course it

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.890 
much what i tried to avoid of course it
didn't<00:03:32.400> happen<00:03:32.520> I<00:03:32.850> think<00:03:33.630> that's<00:03:33.750> obvious

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
didn't happen I think that's obvious

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.630 
didn't happen I think that's obvious
because<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.560> faction<00:03:34.920> series<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.370> starting

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
because the faction series is starting

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.340 
because the faction series is starting
up<00:03:35.700> again<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.630> want<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.140> start
