level 100 and the reason I have these

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.150 
level 100 and the reason I have these
stats<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.449> because<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> quality<00:00:55.890> build

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.590 
it basically levels out both strength
and<00:00:58.739> dexterity<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.489> make<00:00:59.699> them<00:00:59.879> both<00:01:00.030> even

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

and dexterity and I make them both even
40<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.980> reason<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.430> 45<00:01:02.850> endurance

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
40 the reason I have 45 endurance

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.789 
40 the reason I have 45 endurance
because<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.080> wanted<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.439> little<00:01:04.680> more

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
because I just wanted a little more

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
because I just wanted a little more
equipment<00:01:05.640> burden<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> wear<00:01:06.360> slightly

that has good stability or you can go
with<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> grass<00:01:40.799> crest<00:01:41.220> shield<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
with the grass crest shield and the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
with the grass crest shield and the
reason<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.299> actually<00:01:42.570> recommend<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> grass

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
reason I actually recommend the grass

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.170 
reason I actually recommend the grass
crest<00:01:43.829> shield<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> gives<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
crest shield is because it gives you a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.990 
crest shield is because it gives you a
stamina<00:01:45.600> regeneration<00:01:46.049> bonus<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.700> will

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
stamina regeneration bonus this will

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
stamina regeneration bonus this will
allow<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> regenerate<00:01:48.899> stamina<00:01:49.350> faster

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
allow you to regenerate stamina faster

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.160 
allow you to regenerate stamina faster
and<00:01:50.040> makes<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> easier<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> PvP<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.930> you're

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and makes it easier to PvP if you're

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
and makes it easier to PvP if you're
going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.920> super<00:01:53.610> high<00:01:53.729> stability

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
going to go with a super high stability

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.770 
going to go with a super high stability

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.040 
I recommend the Balder shield or if you

once<00:03:33.940> you've<00:03:34.150> got<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.690> good<00:03:34.870> solid<00:03:35.140> quality

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
once you've got a good solid quality

once you've got a good solid quality
build<00:03:36.250> design<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.120> made<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:38.350> can<00:03:38.530> really

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
build design and made you can really

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.620 
build design and made you can really
experiment<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:39.730> is<00:03:39.880> why<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.030> recommend

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
experiment and this is why I recommend

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.020 
experiment and this is why I recommend
it<00:03:40.750> for<00:03:40.780> your<00:03:41.110> first<00:03:41.320> PvP<00:03:41.890> build<00:03:42.160> now<00:03:42.940> if

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
it for your first PvP build now if

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.130 
it for your first PvP build now if
you're<00:03:43.150> going<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.360> go<00:03:43.450> with<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.630> level<00:03:43.959> 100

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
you're going to go with a level 100

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.740 
you're going to go with a level 100
instead<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.160> recommend<00:03:45.580> knocking<00:03:46.450> down<00:03:46.570> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
instead I recommend knocking down the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.960 
instead I recommend knocking down the
strength<00:03:47.050> 3<00:03:47.290> cod<00:03:47.530> they<00:03:47.770> strength<00:03:48.100> from<00:03:48.310> 40<00:03:48.760> to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
strength 3 cod they strength from 40 to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.770 
strength 3 cod they strength from 40 to
maybe<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.570> don't<00:03:50.080> know<00:03:50.260> maybe<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.530> 36<00:03:51.430> or<00:03:51.790> lower

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
maybe I don't know maybe a 36 or lower

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.610 
maybe I don't know maybe a 36 or lower
32<00:03:53.380> perhaps

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
32 perhaps

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.650 
32 perhaps
which<00:03:54.980> strength<00:03:55.790> weapons<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.209> actually<00:03:56.510> want

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
which strength weapons you actually want

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.320 
which strength weapons you actually want
to<00:03:56.720> use<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:57.110> combat<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.849> leave<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:59.000> dexterity

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
to use in combat and leave the dexterity

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.270 
to use in combat and leave the dexterity
at<00:03:59.569> 40<00:03:59.870> I<00:03:59.900> think<00:04:00.110> there's<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> good<00:04:00.440> point<00:04:00.650> but

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
at 40 I think there's a good point but

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.729 
at 40 I think there's a good point but
also<00:04:01.519> not<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.090> endurance<00:04:02.480> down<00:04:02.720> from<00:04:02.989> 45<00:04:03.470> to

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
also not the endurance down from 45 to

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.220 
also not the endurance down from 45 to
40<00:04:04.129> and<00:04:04.459> perhaps<00:04:04.730> bumped<00:04:05.300> down<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.480> little<00:04:05.989> bit

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
40 and perhaps bumped down a little bit

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.220 
40 and perhaps bumped down a little bit
of<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.650> talent<00:04:07.360> because<00:04:08.360> just<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.840> few<00:04:09.050> points

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
of the talent because just a few points

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.660 
of the talent because just a few points
in<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.530> tality<00:04:09.920> aren't<00:04:10.129> going<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.340> be<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
in the tality aren't going to be the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.979 
in the tality aren't going to be the
biggest<00:04:10.970> difference<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.510> world<00:04:11.690> you

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
biggest difference in the world you

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.400 
biggest difference in the world you
could<00:04:12.890> use<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.160> albergue<00:04:13.549> i<00:04:14.019> also<00:04:15.019> recommend

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
could use the albergue i also recommend

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.629 
could use the albergue i also recommend
you<00:04:15.560> practice<00:04:15.709> parry<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.310> that's<00:04:16.430> why<00:04:16.609> I

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
you practice parry and that's why I

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.819 
you practice parry and that's why I
recommend<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:17.239> medium<00:04:17.690> shield<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.530> could<00:04:18.680> also

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
recommend a medium shield you could also

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.439 
recommend a medium shield you could also
use<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.070> small<00:04:19.370> shield<00:04:19.639> but<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.880> medium<00:04:20.209> shield

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
use a small shield but the medium shield

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.129 
use a small shield but the medium shield

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.640 
with this kind of setup the whole way
through<00:04:56.090> because<00:04:56.510> it<00:04:56.660> can<00:04:56.780> become<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:57.110> major
