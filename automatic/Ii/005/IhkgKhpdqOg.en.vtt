00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
fiberglass is actually going to do a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.649 
fiberglass is actually going to do a
better<00:01:16.110> job<00:01:16.170> dispersing<00:01:17.159> impact<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> taking

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
better job dispersing impact and taking

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660 
better job dispersing impact and taking
a<00:01:18.750> beating<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.170> an<00:01:19.259> accident<00:01:19.710> versus<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.640> of

a beating in an accident versus some of

a beating in an accident versus some of
the<00:01:20.759> less<00:01:20.939> expensive<00:01:21.270> helmets<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:21.840> there

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the less expensive helmets out there

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.660 
the less expensive helmets out there
that<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> plastic<00:01:22.950> type<00:01:23.130> shell<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that use like a plastic type shell and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249 
that use like a plastic type shell and
what<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.330> allows<00:01:24.570> them<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:24.990> actually

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
what that allows them to do is actually

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.469 
what that allows them to do is actually
use<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:25.799> low-profile<00:01:26.520> EPS<00:01:26.939> liner<00:01:26.970> that's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
use a very low-profile EPS liner that's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.990 
use a very low-profile EPS liner that's
the<00:01:27.720> foam<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.500> inside<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.369> behind<00:01:29.759> this

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the foam that's inside this behind this

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
the foam that's inside this behind this
lining<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> fabric<00:01:31.560> underneath<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
lining here the fabric underneath that

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.510 
lining here the fabric underneath that
is<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.780> EPS<00:01:34.200> foam<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.369> actually

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
is the EPS foam and that's what actually

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.109 
is the EPS foam and that's what actually
absorbs<00:01:36.210> impact<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.750> an<00:01:36.869> accident<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.119> it's

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
absorbs impact in an accident so it's

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.789 
absorbs impact in an accident so it's
nice<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.810> make<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
nice that they can make it in a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.830 
nice that they can make it in a
low-profile<00:01:41.460> design<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.570> helmet

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
low-profile design that way the helmet

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.380 
low-profile design that way the helmet
doesn't<00:01:43.140> look<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.280> large<00:01:45.090> on

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
