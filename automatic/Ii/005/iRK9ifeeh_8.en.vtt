00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:35.790
 all the world and now move on to the jar 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:41.150
 Today you have a tank mtn 94 94 like this 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:45.780
 she looks and so what you get for 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.700
 220 rubles that's stronger than a crane like this 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:55.500
 will be 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:59.909
 get in a jar of paint yes I'm like 400 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.539
 milliliters standard volume matt 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.799
 paint 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.920
 if I'm not mistaken to low pressure 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.679
 native 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:14.340
 skinny cup is now very thin from behind here 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.230
 the cut goes this one just the thinnest 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.209
 cap produces the same thinnest lines 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.940
 plastic disc with color indicator 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.940
 By the way, I broke it now. 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:38.690
 this color is black from matt black 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.220
 This color paint is made hair 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.630
 firms ntn that is 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.349
 predecessor this paint was nt and 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:54.230
 hard core manufacturer montana colors 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:59.280
 And speech again von Barcelona I generally 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:04.760
 Spain as far as I know what else to say 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:10.260
 So the paint itself is made in Spain 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.920
 one spain great paint will go for 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.530
 paradise that for bom-benge for bowling already 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.549
 You understand that 220 rubles of the form 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.030
 quite expensive 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:27.120
 about rating up to low pressure yet 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.700
 just show such a tailbone very 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.769
 pleasant that is, the finger does not get tired you can 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:39.090
 long enough to draw lines 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:42.930
 damn it does not let me already quite a while 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.650
 I usually choose black and black 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.799
 contour then and due to low pressure and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.739
 fine lines i'm in complex pieces this 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:56.299
 paint punching outlines 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:04:00.180
 great always satisfied 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:03.480
 I recommend taking you well too 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.840
 works like a fat cap or with authors 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.049
 and with other types despite the low 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.200
 sfotkay pressure gives enough 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.769
 thick line and quite quickly covers 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.459
 surface ie any mingo 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.150
 talk again too will go if 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.470
 interesting can feel free to take about that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.220
 how does chrome hide 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.669
 I basically do not know where I heard that 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.460
 yes somewhere heard that is not very personal and 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.490
 chrome never tried to cover therefore 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.199
 I won't speak but otherwise 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.669
 the paint is just great 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:48.060
 all the blood from the first time and even such 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.449
 there is a moment when you play let's say 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.610
 some line already threw waited 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.159
 until they dry 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.580
 will come start new lines tweet there 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.300
 another place also paint naturally 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.740
 will go out 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.889
 fresh liquid in a jar and not surprised 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.659
 if you see that you just 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.740
 put paint on straight glossy 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.780
 brilliant about which matt dried out 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.180
 don't worry about it go there 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.680
 a few minutes it dries and will 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:27.560
 equally matt everywhere that is there will not be 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.560
 excellent students everything will be quite decent 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.849
 paint say thicker than black like me 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:38.539
 it seemed and it is an advantage then 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:42.300
 that it practically does not flow 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:44.070
 I can even say that it does not flow if you 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.880
 Of course in one place you will be long 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:52.250
 juzat ruler infinite something up 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.840
 will flow and so there are no complaints 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.259
 good overlaps 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.449
 any other paint itself is also very 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.490
 well overlapped ie for wright 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.350
 this is important as 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.890
 draws some through lines 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:13.360
 there as where you need first 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.920
 drew lines then painted over that is 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.330
 you need to be completely sure that 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:22.860
 paint will provide you a decent job 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:27.430
 or yes this paint is completely suitable 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.530
 so take well I was advised to take 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.680
 only on Wright that is, this bowling 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:36.010
 error is fat but if you have money you can 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.680
 take on a bomber jacket about what 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:43.260
 how to work, I think that the frost 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.880
 bad because mtn hardcore at zero and 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:52.210
 just does not make sense to decorate 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:54.660
 it instantly flows down so i think with 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:59.140
 this paint will be the same 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:02.200
 Spain is our country is hot I think there 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:06.010
 I do not think I know that there are no such winters 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.169
 as we have in Russia and of course they 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.290
 the manufacturer did not take into account this nuance 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:14.590
 and thus it is not intended to 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.470
 Russian winters the rest of the time 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:22.360
 let's say from ten degrees of heat boldly 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:26.440
 take and everything will be fine remind you 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:29.430
