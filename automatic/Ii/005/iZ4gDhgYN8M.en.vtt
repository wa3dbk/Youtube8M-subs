 I'll tell you how to run coinsup correctly 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.250
 after the upgrade , the fact is that it came out 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.279
 updated version of the coinsup wallet for 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.230
 android and everything broke at us so I 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.720
 I will talk about some mistakes 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.840
 users which they did when 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.460
 installing this system and have some there 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.239
 did not work there the task did not come 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:42.520
 stuff right away right away this video 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.350
 this is the video that consists of 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.340
 five parts to his 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.950
 see whole 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.190
 first you need to click here here 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.899
 gear button settings and here 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.480
 here here press the enable button 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.260
 annotations like this they are turned off like this 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.780
 they are included 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.390
 that is, if this button is not 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.059
 pressed then you will see nothing 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.470
 links no transitions and so on to you 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.960
 you need to turn it on 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.130
 Well, let's figure it out. 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.830
 further help me in setting this 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.580
 systems had a specialist sites of experience 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 link to which will be under the video and there is 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.649
 there is a special section on the forum namely 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.660
 dedicated to the dedicated emulator android 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.959
 bluestacks 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.440
 actually want to express my gratitude 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:33.280
 comrade 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.890

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.979
 helps in all these things and he's great 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.810
 very fumbles in the emulator itself as 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.950
 it works the system is very complicated 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.619
 fancy so let's say I'm out 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.600
 very strong and this person say if 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.180
 not all that much 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.259
 Forget knows about this system here 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.860
 proper 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.960
 actually he was able to set up this thing 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.049
 under android proper about this i 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.610
 and made a video thank him again and so 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.649
 drove what needs to be done first 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.539
 if you already had an emulator installed 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.800
 and you haven't earned something there 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.310
 need it all 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.530
 remove how we do it we need 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.470
 go to control panel well here u 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.010
 I'm 8 Windows 7 a little bit wrong or there 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.140
 xp 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.470
 but neither is the same 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.540
 control panel also have go in 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.910
 install uninstall programs or like 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.260
 me here 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.200
 programs and components actually is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.239
 here we find the same plustek 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.459
 here pay attention where there is push 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.190
 double click on it and delete it from us 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.350
 asks to leave in a set of programs 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.500
 or not to leave better not to leave 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.370
 better to delete everything entirely 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.510
 there is no button here a little screen 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.970
 blinked well it's okay so everything 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.239
 the removal process went feedback not 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.920
 leave will not mean but it is not yet 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.390
 everything 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.880
 blues those who we deleted after that 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.959
 it would be nice to clean the registry because 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.760
 that they won't work for us 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.340
 if we don't clean the registry so back 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.340
 called tails how to do it right 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.620
 here on the forum there are four ways for me 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.519
 approached 1 no matter how strong I am 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.799
 bother how hard it is there 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.519
 doing the rest 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.370
 attention how to remove blue stack correctly 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.670
 Well, let's say that 1 point click on 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.670
 him 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:47.710
 so well here's a post on the forum and 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:55.070

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:06.380

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.780
 blinked i'm sorry all registry 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.670
 cleared now we have completely removed 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.160
 emulator after correct deletion 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.680
 programs need to be correct and installed 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.180
 to help you here this video which I 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.820
 recorded a long time ago 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.280
 but it is still relevant all 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.380
 broken links i cleaned hung 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.560
 fresh and everything still works everything 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.780
 actually actually many did 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.510
 some mistakes there 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.330
 lay in the fact that you know how it is 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.910
 Russian sloppiness forever it says 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.160
 one thing a person does another said 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.200
 download coinsup wallet from under video 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.180
 start it from there you need to download it from 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.919
 some other place well here i am 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.110
 set the blue stack and see 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.030
 carefully he asks for rights 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.800
 superuser on first run 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.320
 they must be resolved 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.780
 necessarily if you click opt out 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.390
 you will not succeed 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.000
 run programs to remove let's say 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.400
 some explorer type files 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.040
 here you need to click to allow repeat 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.750
 press again 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.090
 it's still very easy to resolve 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.790
 some immediately click refuse and 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.890
 then all I have not deleted a file this one 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:23.600
 here here here we go system and yew 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.100
 here is a file its host should be deleted well 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.500
 let's say so according to the instructions there so 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.570
 it is necessary to remove it if you do not remove 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.440
 then nothing will work here 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.070
 change the right 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.530
 asks for removing any program there 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.840
 chick must be allowed otherwise he 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.590
 will not give this opportunity here actually 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.990
 one of the mistakes of users apart from everything 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.840
 Otherwise, do not neglect the installation 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.460
 languages ​​do it like a video that is 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.380
 languages ​​must be installed and 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.760
 keyboard layouts just like that and 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.860
 shown in the video no 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.000
 amateur work differently again 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:03.140
 there will not be another stryker program 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.540
 which changes the gooid let's say so on 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.880
 emulator here I run it not on behalf of 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.530
 admin and just doing full 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.630
 stop change gooid pops up from me 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:18.360
 I explained the mistake again repeat video 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.610
 for those born on an armored train this 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.490
 the program needs to be run only from 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.680
 administrator name here here I am 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.110
 repeat 10 times guys will not just 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.150
 In lichku already well, just flunked all sorts 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.070
 Letters How so how so same at me 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.440
 there does not work then everything does not work 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.780
 works just need to do everything strictly 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.520
 according to the instructions, but perhaps I have 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.040
 all subscribe to the channel put 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.720
 huskies if someone all the same something else 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.280
 incomprehensible write in the comments I 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.280
 I will try to answer everyone
