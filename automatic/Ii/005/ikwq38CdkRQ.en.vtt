00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
racing experience get another good

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.859 
racing experience get another good
result<00:01:40.039> with<00:01:40.520> three<00:01:40.820> cars<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.479> category

podium

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.649 

so<00:01:57.439> if<00:01:57.530> we<00:01:57.680> do<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.890> up<00:01:58.039> 22<00:01:58.549> up<00:01:58.640> top<00:01:58.909> 25<00:01:59.360> it

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
so if we do it up 22 up top 25 it

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.649 
so if we do it up 22 up top 25 it
depends<00:02:00.140> how<00:02:00.259> many<00:02:00.590> gt3<00:02:01.219> we<00:02:01.340> have<00:02:01.490> plus<00:02:02.390> of

depends how many gt3 we have plus of

depends how many gt3 we have plus of
