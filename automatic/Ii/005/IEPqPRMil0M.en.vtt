00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.620 
little buds on you guys can see that
little<00:01:10.310> roots<00:01:10.490> on<00:01:10.729> them<00:01:13.119> I'm<00:01:14.119> gonna<00:01:14.300> start<00:01:14.539> him

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
little roots on them I'm gonna start him

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.850 
little roots on them I'm gonna start him
out<00:01:14.659> in<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.840> pot<00:01:15.080> because<00:01:15.409> it's<00:01:15.530> still<00:01:15.710> supposed

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
out in a pot because it's still supposed

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.859 
out in a pot because it's still supposed
to<00:01:15.979> freeze<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:18.470> soil<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:19.069> there

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
to freeze that soil in there

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.180 
to freeze that soil in there
we're<00:01:20.869> playing<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.259> pub<00:01:21.409> about<00:01:21.500> two<00:01:21.890> inches

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
we're playing a pub about two inches

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.219 
we're playing a pub about two inches
deep<00:01:22.399> and<00:01:24.759> before<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:25.789> do<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.360> want<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.780> put

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
deep and before I do that I want to put

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.789 
deep and before I do that I want to put
them<00:01:27.619> in<00:01:27.830> some<00:01:28.159> root<00:01:28.399> horn<00:01:28.640> room<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:30.470> see<00:01:30.679> how

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
them in some root horn room and see how

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.010 
them in some root horn room and see how
they<00:01:30.920> do

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
they do

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.930 
they do
so<00:01:33.429> basically<00:01:34.429> I'll<00:01:34.909> take<00:01:35.179> them<00:01:35.330> and<00:01:36.700> dip<00:01:37.700> them

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
so basically I'll take them and dip them

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.719 
so basically I'll take them and dip them
in<00:01:38.000> here<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.860> then<00:01:40.009> simply<00:01:42.310> place<00:01:43.310> them<00:01:43.520> with

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
in here and then simply place them with

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.349 
in here and then simply place them with
the<00:01:43.759> butts<00:01:44.090> up<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:44.859> the<00:01:45.859> roots<00:01:46.100> down<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:49.359> it's

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
the butts up and the roots down so it's

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.109 
the butts up and the roots down so it's
hard<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.719> tell<00:01:50.899> on<00:01:50.960> some<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.439> these<00:01:51.530> guys<00:01:51.770> which

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
hard to tell on some of these guys which

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:03.130 
hard to tell on some of these guys which
and<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.960> what<00:01:56.229> put<00:01:57.229> them<00:01:57.320> in<00:01:57.439> there

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:13.650 

my<00:02:03.650> guys<00:02:03.800> easy<00:02:04.070> just<00:02:04.760> put<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.150> guy<00:02:05.270> right<00:02:05.510> bet

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.950

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
through the buds I'll put that guy in

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.810 
through the buds I'll put that guy in
the<00:02:18.050> middle<00:02:18.250> he<00:02:19.250> doesn't<00:02:19.520> look<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:19.640> he's

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820
