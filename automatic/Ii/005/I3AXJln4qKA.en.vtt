going to share them with us now this is
as<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:21.199> it<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> hypersonic

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
as you can see it is a hypersonic

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.109 
as you can see it is a hypersonic
buccaneer<00:00:24.480> glitch<00:00:25.730> buccaneers<00:00:26.730> just

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
buccaneer glitch buccaneers just

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.939 
buccaneer glitch buccaneers just
attacked<00:00:27.480> at<00:00:27.630> hypersonic<00:00:28.050> speed<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.830> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
attacked at hypersonic speed for all of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.429 
attacked at hypersonic speed for all of
their<00:00:29.099> attacks<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.570> duration<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.289> this

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
their attacks for the duration of this

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.340 
their attacks for the duration of this
glitch<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.850> btb<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> long<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
glitch was up and btb not that long I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.680 
glitch was up and btb not that long I
think<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:35.160> probably<00:00:36.059> less<00:00:36.210> than<00:00:36.239> an<00:00:36.510> hour

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
think not probably less than an hour

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.690 
think not probably less than an hour
before<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:37.770> patched<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.610> was

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
before it was patched but it was

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.810 
before it was patched but it was

which<00:00:57.930> included<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.680> stalling<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> stalling

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
which included I stalling so I stalling

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.130 
which included I stalling so I stalling
should<00:01:01.289> probably<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.750> completely<00:01:03.750> dealt<00:01:03.960> with

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
should probably be completely dealt with

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.160 
should probably be completely dealt with
now<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.650> gonna<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.880> another<00:01:06.030> video<00:01:06.240> later<00:01:06.930> on

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
now I'm gonna do another video later on

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.469 
now I'm gonna do another video later on
to<00:01:07.380> try<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.680> test<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:09.330> how

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
to try and test it out and see just how

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.649 
to try and test it out and see just how
much<00:01:09.960> has<00:01:10.530> been<00:01:10.560> nerfed<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
much has been nerfed if it really is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.530 
much has been nerfed if it really is
impossible<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.729> but<00:01:14.729> yeah<00:01:15.119> that'll<00:01:15.509> be

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
impossible to do but yeah that'll be

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.890 
impossible to do but yeah that'll be
interesting<00:01:16.520> um<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.939> apparently<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> fixed

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
interesting um see apparently the fixed

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.539 
interesting um see apparently the fixed
I<00:01:19.020> stalling<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.670> this<00:01:20.670> bug<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:22.549> basically
