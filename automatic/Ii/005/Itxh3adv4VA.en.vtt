00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the main problem about this palette is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
the main problem about this palette is
that<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.799> lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.460> fallout<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.600> if

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that it has a lot of fallout now if

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.450 
that it has a lot of fallout now if
you're<00:01:18.840> someone<00:01:19.110> who<00:01:19.320> doesn't<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.310> know

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you're someone who doesn't really know

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.330 
you're someone who doesn't really know
much<00:01:20.939> about<00:01:21.000> makeup<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.470> important

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
much about makeup it's really important

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.679 
much about makeup it's really important
to<00:01:23.400> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:24.060> careful<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.600> you're

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to kind of just be careful when you're

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.060 
to kind of just be careful when you're
playing<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.680> there's<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.950> lot

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
playing with this because there's a lot

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399 
playing with this because there's a lot
of<00:01:26.250> fallout<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.689> apply<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
of fallout so when you apply this on to

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.289 
of fallout so when you apply this on to
your<00:01:28.500> lids<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.070> means<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.579> sometimes

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
your lids it means that sometimes

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.850 
your lids it means that sometimes
there's<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.810> too<00:01:31.049> much<00:01:31.140> product<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.740> your

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
there's just too much product on your

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.109 
there's just too much product on your
brush<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.520> apply<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.790> onto<00:01:32.939> your

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
brush so when you apply it onto your

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.859 
brush so when you apply it onto your
lids<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> falls<00:01:34.229> onto<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.549> lower<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.060> area<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that's what the fallout is and because

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.710 
that's what the fallout is and because
it's<00:01:39.720> very<00:01:39.900> loose<00:01:40.350> um<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:42.150> finally

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

don't find myself having to reapply this
eyeliner<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.750> it's<00:02:59.409> very<00:02:59.769> very<00:02:59.889> pigmented

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
eyeliner and it's very very pigmented

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.729 
eyeliner and it's very very pigmented
also<00:03:01.359> i<00:03:01.389> always<00:03:01.689> prefer<00:03:01.840> brown<00:03:02.260> liner<00:03:02.590> over

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
also i always prefer brown liner over

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.379 
also i always prefer brown liner over
black<00:03:03.219> liner<00:03:03.459> just<00:03:03.699> because<00:03:03.969> it<00:03:04.090> looks<00:03:04.120> more

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
black liner just because it looks more

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.939 
black liner just because it looks more
natural<00:03:04.449> and<00:03:05.139> that's<00:03:05.560> what<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.769> have

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:05.949 
natural and that's what I have

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.069 
natural and that's what I have
underneath<00:03:06.340> my<00:03:06.760> waterline<00:03:07.329> right<00:03:07.599> now<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:07.989> I

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
underneath my waterline right now and I

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.689 
underneath my waterline right now and I
feel<00:03:08.109> like<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.739> just<00:03:08.769> looks<00:03:09.189> a<00:03:09.310> little<00:03:09.459> bit

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:09.699 
feel like it just looks a little bit

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.990 
feel like it just looks a little bit
softer<00:03:09.969> and<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.989> little<00:03:11.199> bit<00:03:11.379> more<00:03:11.650> um<00:03:12.010> smoky

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
softer and a little bit more um smoky

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.899 
softer and a little bit more um smoky
and<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:14.470> just<00:03:14.680> less<00:03:14.889> than<00:03:14.919> x<00:03:15.250> less<00:03:15.400> having<00:03:15.790> a

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
and it's just less than x less having a

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.409 
and it's just less than x less having a
very<00:03:16.389> pigmented<00:03:16.780> black<00:03:17.530> eyeliner<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.579> I

it on right now and it just kind of adds

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.250 
it on right now and it just kind of adds
more<00:04:23.850> of<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.060> dimension<00:04:24.600> because<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.080> have

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
more of a dimension because you have

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.890 
more of a dimension because you have
like<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:26.130> darker<00:04:26.700> color<00:04:27.120> in<00:04:27.450> your<00:04:27.480> crease

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
like the darker color in your crease

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.990 
like the darker color in your crease
line<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.860> looks<00:04:28.890> like<00:04:29.250> it's<00:04:29.490> sinking<00:04:29.850> into

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
line so it looks like it's sinking into

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.910 
line so it looks like it's sinking into
your<00:04:30.240> eye<00:04:30.360> where<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.840> highlighting<00:04:31.680> color

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
your eye where the highlighting color

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.680 
your eye where the highlighting color
pops<00:04:32.340> out<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.000> they<00:04:33.030> have<00:04:33.300> one<00:04:33.480> right<00:04:33.630> here

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
pops out and so they have one right here

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.760 
pops out and so they have one right here
and<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.320> feel<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:35.010> is<00:04:35.070> an<00:04:35.450> incredible

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770
