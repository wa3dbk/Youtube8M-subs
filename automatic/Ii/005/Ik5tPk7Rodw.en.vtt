there's two trends which are almost the
complete<00:01:20.490> opposite<00:01:21.060> that's<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
complete opposite that's how it is and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.749 
complete opposite that's how it is and
this<00:01:22.229> trend<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.619> basically<00:01:23.070> needs<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.520> really

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.390 
this trend is basically needs of really
intense<00:01:24.150> bronze<00:01:24.659> look<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.170> guess<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
intense bronze look I guess so you can

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
intense bronze look I guess so you can
always<00:01:26.790> apply<00:01:27.060> bronzer<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.930> over<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> face

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
always apply bronzer all over the face

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
always apply bronzer all over the face
and<00:01:28.860> make<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.700> strong<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.240> intense

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.589 
you guys know what's it sees makeup
means<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.879> kind<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.299> really

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
means but just kind of that really

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.420 
means but just kind of that really
intense<00:02:21.930> contrast<00:02:22.470> between<00:02:22.680> blacks<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
intense contrast between blacks and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.789 
intense contrast between blacks and
whites<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.269> do<00:02:24.629> not<00:02:24.840> commonly<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.500> people

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
whites so I do not commonly see people

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.319 
whites so I do not commonly see people
wearing<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.220> now<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.610> think<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.939> can<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.090> quite

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
wearing that now I think it can be quite

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.910 
wearing that now I think it can be quite
good<00:02:27.569> for<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.870> night<00:02:28.019> out<00:02:28.260> though<00:02:28.470> for<00:02:28.799> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
good for a night out though for the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.710 
good for a night out though for the
evening<00:02:29.129> if<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.640> really<00:02:29.909> like<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.299> intense

evening if you really like that intense
I<00:02:30.870> effects<00:02:31.200> i<00:02:31.379> think<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.680> look<00:02:31.799> quite

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159

the lips have really kind of intense
neon<00:02:40.379> pink<00:02:40.739> lip<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.190> pig<00:02:41.609> is<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:41.819> season

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
neon pink lip because pig is in season

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.899 
also why some neon eyeliner I've seen
quite<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.560> few<00:02:46.650> people<00:02:47.159> do<00:02:47.310> on<00:02:47.489> YouTube<00:02:47.670> but

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
quite a few people do on YouTube but

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.339 
quite a few people do on YouTube but
think<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.180> looks<00:02:48.329> really<00:02:48.450> pretty<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.140> have

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
think it looks really pretty if you have

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.960 
think it looks really pretty if you have
the<00:02:49.560> rest<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> face<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.489> really<00:02:50.760> nice

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
the rest of the face like a really nice

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.910 
the rest of the face like a really nice
bare-faced<00:02:51.659> look<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.680> some

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
bare-faced look and then just some

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.830 
bare-faced look and then just some
extreme<00:02:53.730> while<00:02:53.909> I<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:54.150> we<00:02:54.329> can<00:02:54.359> just<00:02:54.659> wear

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
extreme while I know we can just wear

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390 
extreme while I know we can just wear
some<00:02:55.109> neon<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.470> shadows<00:02:55.829> which<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.129> know<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.310> can

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
some neon I shadows which I know it can

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.430 
some neon I shadows which I know it can
be<00:02:56.430> quite<00:02:56.549> difficult<00:02:56.909> to<00:02:57.180> find<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.810> maybe

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
be quite difficult to find so maybe

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.660 
be quite difficult to find so maybe
that's<00:02:58.709> not<00:02:58.859> going<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.069> be<00:02:59.099> as<00:02:59.310> easy<00:02:59.549> to

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
that's not going to be as easy to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.280 
that's not going to be as easy to
achieve<00:02:59.909> but<00:03:00.420> yeah<00:03:00.629> so<00:03:00.870> with<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.109> you're

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
achieve but yeah so with that you're

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.930 
achieve but yeah so with that you're
also<00:03:01.440> returning<00:03:01.859> back<00:03:02.099> to<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.400> first<00:03:02.670> trend

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
very interesting because it's almost

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.520 
very interesting because it's almost
only<00:03:14.370> all<00:03:14.730> mostly<00:03:15.269> just<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.900> bottom<00:03:16.319> lash<00:03:16.500> line

only all mostly just on bottom lash line
so<00:03:16.980> having<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.430> really<00:03:17.699> intense<00:03:18.209> smoked<00:03:18.569> at

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
so having a really intense smoked at

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.629 
so having a really intense smoked at
bottom<00:03:19.199> lash<00:03:19.349> line<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.799> almost<00:03:20.129> not<00:03:20.400> wearing

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
bottom lash line and almost not wearing

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.250 
bottom lash line and almost not wearing
anything<00:03:20.849> on<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.120> top<00:03:21.329> except<00:03:21.750> for<00:03:21.780> mascara

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
anything on the top except for mascara

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.020 
anything on the top except for mascara
which<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> bit<00:03:22.859> weird<00:03:22.919> by<00:03:23.310> seed<00:03:23.639> pile<00:03:23.879> of

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
which is a bit weird by seed pile of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.699 
which is a bit weird by seed pile of
models<00:03:24.419> wearing<00:03:24.629> you<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.959> catwalk<00:03:25.379> and<00:03:25.590> it

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
models wearing you on the catwalk and it

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.080 
models wearing you on the catwalk and it
looks<00:03:25.829> really<00:03:26.129> good<00:03:26.310> in<00:03:26.370> them<00:03:26.609> so<00:03:26.819> I'm<00:03:26.910> guess

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
looks really good in them so I'm guess

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.490 
looks really good in them so I'm guess
you<00:03:27.209> can<00:03:27.359> play<00:03:27.540> around<00:03:27.660> with<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.079> obviously

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
you can play around with it obviously

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.559 
you can play around with it obviously
you<00:03:28.739> need<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:29.040> find<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.849> right<00:03:29.879> clothing<00:03:30.269> to

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
you need to find the right clothing to

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.939 
you need to find the right clothing to
wear<00:03:30.599> with<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.930> because<00:03:31.109> who<00:03:31.379> is<00:03:31.680> going<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
wear with it because who is going to

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.500 
wear with it because who is going to
look<00:03:32.040> very<00:03:32.069> weird<00:03:32.579> but<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:32.879> can<00:03:32.970> always<00:03:33.180> put

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
look very weird but you can always put

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.089
