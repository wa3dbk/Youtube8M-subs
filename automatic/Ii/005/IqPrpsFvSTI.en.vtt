00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
those ten fouls he was really good I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.359 
those ten fouls he was really good I
think<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> thing<00:00:31.349> that's<00:00:31.410> impressed<00:00:32.009> me<00:00:32.219> most

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
think the thing that's impressed me most

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.799 
think the thing that's impressed me most
about<00:00:32.550> him<00:00:32.700> obviously<00:00:33.059> has<00:00:33.210> been<00:00:33.329> his<00:00:33.420> defense

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
about him obviously has been his defense

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.650 
about him obviously has been his defense
when<00:00:34.140> he<00:00:34.260> came<00:00:34.440> over<00:00:34.850> scouts<00:00:35.850> were<00:00:36.329> saying

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
when he came over scouts were saying

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
when he came over scouts were saying
that<00:00:36.809> he<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.160> mostly<00:00:38.160> known<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.460> his

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that he was mostly known for his

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.080 
that he was mostly known for his
offensive<00:00:39.300> scale<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.430> quickly<00:00:41.430> he's<00:00:41.640> become

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
offensive scale and quickly he's become

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.110 
offensive scale and quickly he's become
pretty<00:00:42.809> much<00:00:42.989> their<00:00:43.170> only<00:00:43.440> interior<00:00:43.829> presence

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
pretty much their only interior presence

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
pretty much their only interior presence
you<00:00:45.120> also<00:00:45.270> called<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.660> their<00:00:45.780> lone<00:00:45.930> bright

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you also called in their lone bright

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
you also called in their lone bright
spot<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.680> think<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.640> harsh<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
spot I think that was a little harsh to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.400 
spot I think that was a little harsh to
Courtney<00:00:48.539> Lee<00:00:48.690> what<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> pretty<00:00:49.200> good<00:00:49.320> game

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
Courtney Lee what a pretty good game

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410 
Courtney Lee what a pretty good game
that's<00:00:49.680> sure<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.430> true<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:51.000> yeah

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that's sure that's true but yeah

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.029 
that's sure that's true but yeah
faverani<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.140> mean<00:00:52.289> his<00:00:52.440> defense<00:00:52.860> has<00:00:53.010> been

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
faverani I mean his defense has been

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.850 
faverani I mean his defense has been
great<00:00:53.399> he<00:00:53.520> was<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.789> over<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.030> glass<00:00:54.270> tonight

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
great he was all over the glass tonight

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.750 
great he was all over the glass tonight
really<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> couldn't<00:00:56.219> ask<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.520> much<00:00:56.699> more

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
really you couldn't ask for much more

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.110 
really you couldn't ask for much more
from<00:00:57.210> him<00:00:57.390> being<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.670> Brazilian<00:00:59.670> rookie<00:01:00.000> who

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
from him being a Brazilian rookie who

last<00:01:02.219> year<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> ACB<00:01:03.449> League<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
last year in the ACB League you know I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.679 
last year in the ACB League you know I
didn't<00:01:05.850> expect<00:01:06.180> him<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> look<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
didn't expect him to look like a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.270 
didn't expect him to look like a
legitimate<00:01:07.080> starting<00:01:07.560> center<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.979> early

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
legitimate starting center in this early

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
legitimate starting center in this early
but<00:01:08.310> he's<00:01:08.760> done<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.210> far<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.170> big

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
but he's done it so far well the big

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.649 
but he's done it so far well the big
thing<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.860> he<00:01:11.130> only<00:01:11.729> took<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.150> 3-pointer

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
thing is that he only took one 3-pointer

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
thing is that he only took one 3-pointer
innings<00:01:12.990> he's<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.100> three<00:01:14.369> pointer

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
innings he's not really three pointer

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.310 
innings he's not really three pointer
yeah<00:01:14.970> yeah<00:01:15.299> well<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> believes<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> three-point

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
yeah yeah well I believes a three-point

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.230 
yeah yeah well I believes a three-point
shooter<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.799> let<00:01:16.920> him<00:01:16.979> take<00:01:17.159> 13<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:17.790> he

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
shooter you can let him take 13 but he

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940 
shooter you can let him take 13 but he
was<00:01:18.360> pretty<00:01:18.600> much<00:01:18.720> playing<00:01:19.170> behind<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.770> arc

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
was pretty much playing behind the arc

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
was pretty much playing behind the arc
most<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> preseason<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> first<00:01:21.659> game

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
most of the preseason in the first game

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
most of the preseason in the first game
he's<00:01:22.140> moved<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> he's<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.340> don't<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.580> whether

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
he's moved it he's I don't know whether

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.920 
he's moved it he's I don't know whether
Stevens<00:01:24.180> told<00:01:24.299> him<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.600> where<00:01:24.720> he<00:01:24.780> just

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
Stevens told him to where he just

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.450 
Stevens told him to where he just
decided<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.500> move<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.979> little<00:01:26.009> bit<00:01:26.310> closer

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
decided to move it a little bit closer

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.060 
decided to move it a little bit closer
to<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> rim<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.270> he<00:01:27.930> went<00:01:28.110> 4<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.470> 6<00:01:28.740> from<00:01:28.829> both

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to the rim and he went 4 for 6 from both

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770 
to the rim and he went 4 for 6 from both
the<00:01:29.340> field<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.759> from<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> line<00:01:30.270> tonight<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the field and from the line tonight so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450 
the field and from the line tonight so
it<00:01:30.869> seems<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.290> him<00:01:31.650> getting<00:01:31.860> closer<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it seems like him getting closer to the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980 
it seems like him getting closer to the
