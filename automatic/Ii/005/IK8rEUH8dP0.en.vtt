00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
cut very close around the edges and it

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.160 
cut very close around the edges and it
will<00:03:03.030> look<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.780> back<00:03:03.960> when

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
will look like that on the back when

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.440 
will look like that on the back when
it's<00:03:04.350> done<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.640> now<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.820> next<00:03:06.060> step<00:03:06.210> is

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
it's done and now the next step is

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.370 
it's done and now the next step is
actually<00:03:07.200> attach<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.920> ring<00:03:08.220> part<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:09.600> this

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
actually attach the ring part to this

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.770 
actually attach the ring part to this
piece<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.830> you've<00:03:10.950> made<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.730> can<00:03:11.910> use

you have story you can buy plain one

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.310 
you have story you can buy plain one
with<00:03:19.680> bases<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.210> so<00:03:22.110> I'm<00:03:22.170> just

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
with bases like this and so I'm just

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.220 
with bases like this and so I'm just
going<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.500> take<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.800> glue<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.870> someone<00:03:25.140> to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
going to take the glue it someone to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.130 
going to take the glue it someone to
base<00:03:25.440> i<00:03:25.830> also<00:03:26.130> want<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.400> stick<00:03:26.670> some<00:03:26.940> just<00:03:27.930> in

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
base i also want to stick some just in

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740 
base i also want to stick some just in
the<00:03:28.560> center<00:03:29.150> where<00:03:30.150> i'm<00:03:30.240> going<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.540> place<00:03:30.720> it

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
the center where i'm going to place it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
the center where i'm going to place it
right<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:35.390> push<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.540> down<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.860> give<00:03:38.190> it

right there and push it down and give it
a<00:03:38.340> couple<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.180> seconds<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.750> dry<00:03:40.490> it's<00:03:41.490> finished

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
a couple of seconds to dry it's finished

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.780 
a couple of seconds to dry it's finished
now<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:43.020> is<00:03:43.290> what<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.920> Rings<00:03:44.190> going<00:03:44.640> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
now so that is what the Rings going to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:55.110 
now so that is what the Rings going to
look<00:03:44.970> like<00:03:45.320> when<00:03:46.320> it's<00:03:46.500> done

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120
