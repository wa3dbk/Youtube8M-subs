right now just using the Elm you know
that<00:01:21.930> quick<00:01:22.170> short<00:01:22.470> out<00:01:22.590> kit<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.490> makes

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that quick short out kit that just makes

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.140 
that quick short out kit that just makes
the<00:01:23.850> system<00:01:24.150> work<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.869> let's<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.259> hopefully

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
the system work so let's see hopefully

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.149 
the system work so let's see hopefully
ok<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:28.400> for<00:01:29.400> anybody<00:01:29.820> who<00:01:30.000> has<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> sink<00:01:30.600> ebook

to overclock this phenom x4 965 Pat 3.9
but<00:02:19.280> first<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.580> can<00:02:19.700> get<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:19.970> right<00:02:20.060> now<00:02:20.440> but<00:02:21.440> I'm

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800
