oddball one it's going to be a good one

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.410 
oddball one it's going to be a good one
to<00:00:24.779> practice<00:00:24.869> your<00:00:25.230> timing<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:26.150> but<00:00:27.150> anyways

to practice your timing on but anyways

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.000 
to practice your timing on but anyways
that's<00:00:27.630> that's<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.350> was<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> was<00:00:28.860> just

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
that's that's what it was I was just

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.320 
that's that's what it was I was just
playing<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.430> either<00:00:29.520> and<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.820> trick<00:00:30.030> with<00:00:30.150> it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
playing for either and the trick with it

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170 
playing for either and the trick with it
is<00:00:30.600> is<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:32.129> we're<00:00:32.369> counting<00:00:32.580> this<00:00:32.970> out

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
is is that if we're counting this out

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.640 
is is that if we're counting this out
it's<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:34.050> 1<00:00:34.800> &amp;<00:00:35.190> 2<00:00:35.610> &amp;<00:00:35.970> 3<00:00:36.000> &amp;<00:00:36.510> 4<00:00:37.170> &amp;<00:00:37.530> right<00:00:38.720> so<00:00:39.720> get

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
it's like 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; right so get

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.619 
it's like 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; right so get
that<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:41.820> mind<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:42.360> off

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
that in your in your mind first off

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.520 
that in your in your mind first off
right<00:00:42.900> there's<00:00:43.140> there's<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.930> two<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
right there's there's one and two and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.130 
right there's there's one and two and
three<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.949> four<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.790> one<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.180> two<00:00:48.540> and<00:00:48.780> three

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
three and four and one and two and three

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
three and four and one and two and three
and<00:00:49.470> four<00:00:49.710> em<00:00:50.280> okay<00:00:54.979> so<00:00:55.979> the<00:00:56.129> trick<00:00:56.339> there<00:00:56.580> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and four em okay so the trick there is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670 
and four em okay so the trick there is
that<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.809> trick<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.019> this<00:00:58.199> whole<00:00:58.379> thing

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
that so the trick to this whole thing

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.770 
that so the trick to this whole thing
really<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.339> that<00:01:00.440> 1<00:01:01.440> &amp;<00:01:01.739> 2<00:01:01.979> &amp;<00:01:02.280> 3<00:01:02.339> &amp;<00:01:02.640> 4<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
really is that 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.910 
really is that 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 and
but<00:01:04.559> we're<00:01:05.220> strumming<00:01:05.670> down<00:01:05.940> on<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> 1<00:01:06.920> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
but we're strumming down on the 1 and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.430 
but we're strumming down on the 1 and
then<00:01:08.549> after<00:01:09.120> that<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.990> strum

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
then after that we're going to up strum

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.020 
then after that we're going to up strum
on<00:01:11.990> all<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> ends<00:01:13.770> okay<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:15.000> one

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
on all of the ends okay so it's down one

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
on all of the ends okay so it's down one
and<00:01:16.010> up<00:01:17.010> two<00:01:17.930> skip<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.820> up<00:01:20.820> skip<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:21.780> three

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
and up two skip it and up skip the three

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:45.010 
and up two skip it and up skip the three
and<00:01:22.640> up<00:01:23.720> skip<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.870> floor<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.640> upstroke<00:01:26.640> right

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.960 

so<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.170> practice<00:01:46.650> that<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:47.610> probably

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
so just practice that it's probably

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.890 
so just practice that it's probably
going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.120> take<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> little<00:01:48.600> bit<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.810> get

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
going to take you a little bit to get

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:58.450 
going to take you a little bit to get
used<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.230> it's<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:49.620> bit<00:01:49.800> on

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.950 

okay<00:01:59.460> I'm<00:01:59.970> just<00:02:00.180> putting<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.690> G<00:02:00.930> chord

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
okay I'm just putting that on a G chord

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.060 
okay I'm just putting that on a G chord
by<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.410> way

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
by the way

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.430 
by the way
so<00:02:04.450> that's<00:02:05.450> all<00:02:05.600> there<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.080> really<00:02:06.230> and

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
so that's all there is to it really and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:22.300 
so that's all there is to it really and
then<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:06.770> change<00:02:07.550> your<00:02:07.670> chords<00:02:21.310> but

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
then you just change your chords but

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.860 
then you just change your chords but
that's<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.640> basic<00:02:22.910> concept<00:02:23.000> you're<00:02:23.390> down<00:02:23.630> in

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
that's the basic concept you're down in

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.050 
that's the basic concept you're down in
the<00:02:23.960> first<00:02:24.200> stroke<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.710> then<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.580> and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
the first stroke and then and and and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.130 
the first stroke and then and and and
and<00:02:26.450> right<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:28.330> have<00:02:29.330> fun<00:02:29.480> with<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.750> one

again extending the video and I'm gonna
show<00:03:01.100> you<00:03:01.190> some<00:03:01.370> blues<00:03:01.790> things<00:03:02.030> because

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
show you some blues things because

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.840 
show you some blues things because
actually<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:03.680> strumming<00:03:04.370> pattern<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.820> I

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
actually that strumming pattern that I

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.870 
actually that strumming pattern that I
just<00:03:05.000> showed<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.239> is<00:03:06.430> very<00:03:07.430> similar<00:03:07.790> to

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
just showed you is very similar to

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.140 
just showed you is very similar to
what's<00:03:08.060> being<00:03:08.239> used<00:03:08.330> in<00:03:08.870> pride<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:09.950> joy<00:03:10.070> so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.729 

kind<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.360> rough<00:03:14.600> interpretation<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.530> pride

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
kind of a rough interpretation of pride

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.050 
kind of a rough interpretation of pride
and<00:03:15.890> joy<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.160> would<00:03:16.250> be<00:03:16.370> something<00:03:16.730> like<00:03:16.910> the

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
and joy it would be something like the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.430 
and joy it would be something like the
main<00:03:17.209> part<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.540> would<00:03:17.630> be<00:03:17.810> sound<00:03:18.110> something

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
main part it would be sound something

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:38.790 
main part it would be sound something
like<00:03:18.470> this

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.199 

wait

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
wait

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.100 
wait
very<00:03:41.209> roughly<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.660> course<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:44.090> now<00:03:44.569> what's<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
very roughly of course so now what's the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:55.750 
very roughly of course so now what's the
main<00:03:45.319> strum<00:03:45.650> pattern<00:03:45.950> er<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.519> can<00:03:55.610> use

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
main strum pattern er so you can use

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.250 
main strum pattern er so you can use
this<00:03:55.940> just<00:03:56.150> change<00:03:56.420> up<00:03:56.540> your<00:03:56.569> chords<00:03:56.959> use<00:03:57.080> some

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
right across the a they're actually

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.700 
right across the a they're actually
playing<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.330> normal<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.690> plus<00:04:32.990> adding<00:04:33.290> on<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> G

right here on the third fret first
string<00:04:42.950> okay<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.229> find<00:04:45.440> its<00:04:45.590> easiest<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.979> do

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
string okay and I find its easiest to do

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.950 
string okay and I find its easiest to do
that<00:04:46.280> just<00:04:46.490> by<00:04:46.610> kind<00:04:46.820> of<00:04:46.940> making<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.510> half<00:04:47.690> bar

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
that just by kind of making a half bar

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.590 
that just by kind of making a half bar
with<00:04:48.140> my<00:04:48.320> with<00:04:48.979> my<00:04:49.130> index<00:04:49.400> finger<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:49.910> then

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
with my with my index finger and then

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.440 
with my with my index finger and then
grabbing<00:04:51.140> that<00:04:51.380> G<00:04:51.590> with<00:04:51.770> my<00:04:51.979> finger<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.940> then

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
grabbing that G with my finger and then

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:01.749 
grabbing that G with my finger and then
the<00:04:54.289> other<00:04:54.680> quarters<00:04:55.010> a<00:04:55.039> b7

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.070 

and<00:05:02.759> actually<00:05:03.180> I<00:05:03.419> did<00:05:03.629> a<00:05:03.659> lesson<00:05:04.050> just

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
and actually I did a lesson just

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.899 
and actually I did a lesson just
recently<00:05:04.949> which<00:05:05.129> you'll<00:05:05.430> probably<00:05:05.550> be<00:05:05.759> seeing

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
recently which you'll probably be seeing

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.570 
recently which you'll probably be seeing
shortly<00:05:06.319> if<00:05:07.319> you're<00:05:07.499> on<00:05:07.590> my<00:05:07.710> Blues<00:05:07.919> list<00:05:08.159> about

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
shortly if you're on my Blues list about

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.279 
shortly if you're on my Blues list about
that<00:05:09.090> exactly<00:05:09.509> but<00:05:11.900> that's<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:13.050> separate

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
that exactly but that's a separate

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.489 
that exactly but that's a separate
lesson<00:05:13.469> right<00:05:14.310> so<00:05:14.520> basically<00:05:15.199> this<00:05:16.199> strum

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:16.499 
lesson right so basically this strum

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.850 
lesson right so basically this strum
pattern<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:16.949> a<00:05:16.979> really<00:05:17.249> great<00:05:17.460> one<00:05:17.580> for<00:05:17.789> blues

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860
