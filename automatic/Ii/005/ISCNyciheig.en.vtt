00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you'll understand it then obviously just

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
you'll understand it then obviously just
go<00:00:33.239> forward<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> map<00:00:34.739> again<00:00:35.040> there's<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
go forward do the map again there's a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.340 
go forward do the map again there's a
load<00:00:35.850> more<00:00:36.090> i'm<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.450> sure<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:36.989> down

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
load more i'm not sure if this is down

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.520 
load more i'm not sure if this is down
up<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:38.190> front<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.940> sideways<00:00:39.270> i<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:40.379> it's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
up in front of you sideways i know it's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
up in front of you sideways i know it's
in<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.710> 16<00:00:41.160> block<00:00:41.430> radius<00:00:41.640> though<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:42.899> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
in a 16 block radius though so as you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.690 
in a 16 block radius though so as you
can<00:00:43.079> see<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:43.530> saying<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> spiders<00:00:44.489> near

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
can see it's now saying the spiders near

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.760 
can see it's now saying the spiders near
me<00:00:44.850> loads<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.780> mobs<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.559> i'm<00:00:46.649> assuming

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
me loads of mobs about so i'm assuming

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.569 
me loads of mobs about so i'm assuming
it<00:00:47.340> means<00:00:47.520> 16<00:00:48.030> blocks<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.629> down<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.079> well

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
it means 16 blocks up and down as well

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.180 
it means 16 blocks up and down as well
so<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.789> see<00:00:50.969> spider<00:00:51.449> Enderman<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.890> i<00:00:53.039> go

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so you can see spider Enderman if i go

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.560 
so you can see spider Enderman if i go
over<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.520> there's<00:00:53.730> loads<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> mobs<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.480> will

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
tell me what's in the 16 block radius

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.049 
tell me what's in the 16 block radius
every<00:00:56.910> time<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.120> walk<00:00:57.360> into<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.750> new<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.940> can

that are in the 16 blocks that I'm in so
if<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.339> walk<00:01:05.670> away<00:01:05.939> from<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.299> you'll

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

mobs Susan sees two creepers over there

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.630 
mobs Susan sees two creepers over there
when<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.549> into<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> clear<00:01:12.210> 16<00:01:12.720> block<00:01:12.960> radius

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.090 

so<00:01:17.640> over<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:18.060> no<00:01:18.750> monsters<00:01:19.259> found<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.040> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so over here no monsters found some in a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.890 
so over here no monsters found some in a
16<00:01:20.580> block<00:01:20.790> radius<00:01:21.000> where<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:21.600> nothing

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
16 block radius where there's nothing

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.950 
16 block radius where there's nothing
found<00:01:25.970> then<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.240> obviously<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.810> walk

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
found then I can obviously just walk

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.300 
found then I can obviously just walk
towards<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.009> it'll<00:01:29.130> come<00:01:29.280> up

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
towards them and then it'll come up

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
towards them and then it'll come up
again<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> map<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.990> don't

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
again so if you do the map if you don't

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.660 
again so if you do the map if you don't
understand<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.310> type<00:01:32.490> in

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
understand what it is you can type in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.420 
understand what it is you can type in
bwk<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.799> show<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.400> of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
bwk then it will show you what all of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.609 
bwk then it will show you what all of
the<00:01:35.670> signs<00:01:35.880> stand<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.810> creeper<00:01:37.229> zombie

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the signs stand for so creeper zombie

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.429 
the signs stand for so creeper zombie
etc<00:01:38.540> then<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.110> through<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
etc then you can just go through and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.289 
etc then you can just go through and
work<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.280> stand<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
work out what they all stand for so the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.050 
work out what they all stand for so the
S<00:01:42.680> stands<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.829> spider<00:01:44.250> or<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> skeleton

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
S stands for spider or a skeleton

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.420 
S stands for spider or a skeleton
