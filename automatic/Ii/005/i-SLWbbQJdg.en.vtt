only<00:01:04.549> get<00:01:04.790> 100<00:01:05.510> bullets<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.140> need<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.470> be

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
only get 100 bullets so you need to be

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.600 
only get 100 bullets so you need to be
very<00:01:06.920> accurate<00:01:08.860> however<00:01:09.860> there<00:01:10.100> is<00:01:10.220> also<00:01:10.400> a

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
very accurate however there is also a

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.149 
very accurate however there is also a
time<00:01:11.060> limit<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.260> want<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.500> be<00:01:12.590> fast<00:01:12.920> as

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
time limit so you want to be fast as

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.580 
time limit so you want to be fast as
well<00:01:13.400> fast<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.180> accurate<00:01:14.630> which<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.140> pretty

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
well fast and accurate which is pretty

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.590 
well fast and accurate which is pretty
hard<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:15.979> do<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:16.520> don't<00:01:16.729> want<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.360> waste

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
hard to do so you don't want to waste

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.230 
hard to do so you don't want to waste
any<00:01:17.900> bullets<00:01:18.110> at<00:01:19.010> least<00:01:19.250> as<00:01:19.490> minimum<00:01:20.180> as

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
any bullets at least as minimum as

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.840 
any bullets at least as minimum as
possible<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.189> second<00:01:22.549> thing<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.820> want

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
possible and the second thing you want

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.120 
possible and the second thing you want
to<00:01:23.090> do<00:01:23.180> is<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:24.170> like<00:01:24.320> me<00:01:24.500> go<00:01:24.799> for<00:01:25.040> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
to do is just like me go for the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.190 
to do is just like me go for the
farthest<00:01:25.640> targets<00:01:26.179> the<00:01:26.390> farthest<00:01:26.750> targets

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
farthest targets the farthest targets

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.959 
farthest targets the farthest targets

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
going pretty smooth once well pop that

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.420 
going pretty smooth once well pop that
head<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.360> front<00:02:11.540> here

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.250 

there<00:02:17.430> we<00:02:17.550> go<00:02:17.730> another<00:02:18.330> tree<00:02:18.680> another<00:02:19.680> two

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
there we go another tree another two

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:30.190 
there we go another tree another two
right<00:02:22.260> five<00:02:23.190> more<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:25.620> come<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.790> there<00:02:27.600> we<00:02:27.810> go

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
