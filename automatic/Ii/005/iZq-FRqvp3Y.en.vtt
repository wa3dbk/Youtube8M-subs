 for the unity of Christians and Muslims throughout the Middle East

 now coming to an end 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.129
 and precisely on the occasion of the end of Ramadan the pontifical council for the 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.649
 interreligious dialogue 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.649
 has sent a message of good wishes to all Muslims 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:53.499
 indicating the spiritual dimension of man as a primary reality 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:58.289
 importance that Christians and Muslims are called together to promote of 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.919
 facing the challenges of video materialism secularism 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.549

 for good 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.269
 and that it is necessary to denounce all forms 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.990
 intimidation 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.400
 it seems to me that in these words there is a message of pardon Arab ferment 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.629
 this would be the most important thing if we can live forgiveness and peace 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.840
 and we move away from the borders 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.909
 we can hope for a future
