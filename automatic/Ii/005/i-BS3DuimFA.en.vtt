00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I'm sure everyone's used at least once I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400 
I'm sure everyone's used at least once I
forget<00:00:42.480> how<00:00:42.570> much<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.750> cost<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.320> was

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
forget how much it cost but it was

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.049 
forget how much it cost but it was
fairly<00:00:43.620> cheap<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.700> build<00:00:44.910> them

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
fairly cheap you can build them

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.450 
fairly cheap you can build them
yourselves<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.010> easier<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.309> me

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
yourselves but it was just easier for me

yourselves but it was just easier for me
to<00:00:47.579> buy<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> read<00:00:48.930> online<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.379> these

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to buy one but I read online that these

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.959 
to buy one but I read online that these
were<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> best<00:00:50.100> mousetraps<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
were some of the best mousetraps in the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.160 
were some of the best mousetraps in the
world<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.480> would<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> agree<00:00:52.140> that

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
world and I would have to agree that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.020 
world and I would have to agree that
this<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.440> probably<00:00:52.770> seriously<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> world's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
this is probably seriously the world's

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 
this is probably seriously the world's
best<00:00:54.239> mousetrap<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:54.989> rat<00:00:55.710> trap<00:00:55.949> or<00:00:56.129> whatever

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
best mousetrap or rat trap or whatever

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
best mousetrap or rat trap or whatever
you're<00:00:56.489> trapping<00:00:56.840> because<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> uses<00:00:58.170> this

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you're trapping because it uses this

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.279 
you're trapping because it uses this
door<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.730> lock<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.300> drops<00:01:00.809> over

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
door and this lock right here drops over

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.840 
door and this lock right here drops over
the<00:01:01.379> door<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.680> soon<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.070> door<00:01:02.129> closes<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the door as soon as that door closes and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.100 
the door as soon as that door closes and
locks<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.329> basically<00:01:03.660> becomes<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
locks it basically becomes a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.509 
locks it basically becomes a
self-contained<00:01:04.500> unit<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:05.189> something

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
self-contained unit with something

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.140 
self-contained unit with something
inside<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.439> no<00:01:07.439> way<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.189> or<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.340> from

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
inside and no way to get in or out from

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
inside and no way to get in or out from
the<00:01:09.240> inside<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.990> outside<00:01:10.110> without

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the inside or the outside without

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.910 
the inside or the outside without
unlocking

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.280 

it's<00:01:14.920> just<00:01:15.070> one<00:01:15.220> side<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:15.610> opens<00:01:15.670> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it's just one side that opens and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.570 
it's just one side that opens and
there's<00:01:17.290> just<00:01:17.590> kind<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:17.770> like<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> safety

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
there's just kind of like a safety

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.650 
there's just kind of like a safety
mechanism<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:19.300> here

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
mechanism in here

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.020 
mechanism in here
not<00:01:19.870> really<00:01:19.990> safety<00:01:20.380> but<00:01:20.550> basically<00:01:21.550> like<00:01:21.820> a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
not really safety but basically like a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.100 
not really safety but basically like a
lock

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
lock

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.860 
lock
what<00:01:23.440> you<00:01:23.560> got<00:01:23.710> here<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.790> like<00:01:25.720> your

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
what you got here is this is like your

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.900 
what you got here is this is like your
main<00:01:26.050> pin<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.620> you<00:01:27.100> got<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.310> slide<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:27.700> loop

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.150 
main pin and you got to slide this loop
up<00:01:28.060> over<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.390> pin<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.870> then<00:01:29.830> when<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.040> have

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
up over the pin and then when you have

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.410 
up over the pin and then when you have
this<00:01:30.310> pin<00:01:30.520> up<00:01:30.640> here<00:01:30.790> you<00:01:30.880> got<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.060> slide<00:01:31.240> this

this pin up here you got to slide this

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.210 
this pin up here you got to slide this
lock<00:01:31.720> I'll<00:01:32.440> do<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.590> on<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.740> other<00:01:32.770> side<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.190> you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.640 
can see this lock goes up to the top
then<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.520> door<00:01:36.760> opens<00:01:37.180> as<00:01:37.510> you<00:01:37.780> can<00:01:37.930> see<00:01:38.110> see

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
then this door opens as you can see see

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.160 
then this door opens as you can see see
that<00:01:38.680> spring<00:01:39.100> inside<00:01:39.400> there<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.780> connected

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
that spring inside there it's connected

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.050 
that spring inside there it's connected
to<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.350> door<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.830> then<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.160> inside<00:01:42.520> just

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
to the door and then to the inside just

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.060 
to the door and then to the inside just
in<00:01:43.180> front<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.540> pin<00:01:43.920> right<00:01:44.920> there<00:01:47.070> now

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
in front of this pin right there now

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.770 
in front of this pin right there now
that<00:01:48.160> we've<00:01:48.370> got<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.550> basically<00:01:49.150> set<00:01:49.480> when

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
that we've got it basically set when

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.420 
that we've got it basically set when
this<00:01:49.870> pin<00:01:50.080> let's<00:01:50.320> go<00:01:50.530> this<00:01:50.920> door<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.250> going<00:01:51.370> to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
this pin let's go this door is going to

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.790 
this pin let's go this door is going to
close<00:01:51.760> so<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.750> way<00:01:52.840> we<00:01:52.960> keep<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.290> pin<00:01:53.470> open

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
close so the way we keep that pin open

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.890 
close so the way we keep that pin open
is<00:01:53.980> on<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.640> back<00:01:54.790> here<00:01:54.820> I<00:01:55.420> don't<00:01:55.540> know<00:01:55.720> if<00:01:55.840> you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
is on the back here I don't know if you

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.870 
is on the back here I don't know if you
can<00:01:56.020> see<00:01:56.170> in<00:01:56.290> there<00:01:56.470> I'll<00:01:57.250> try<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.490> make<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.760> so

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
can see in there I'll try to make it so

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.880 
can see in there I'll try to make it so
you<00:01:57.910> can<00:01:58.180> but<00:01:58.810> there<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.170> little<00:01:59.620> swinging

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
you can but there is a little swinging

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.680 
you can but there is a little swinging
thing<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.910> can<00:02:04.030> see<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.240> top<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.660> just

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
thing you can see the top of it just

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.630 
thing you can see the top of it just
right<00:02:04.990> there<00:02:05.260> it's<00:02:05.680> like<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.890> little<00:02:06.190> loop<00:02:06.370> that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
right there it's like a little loop that

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.190 
right there it's like a little loop that
comes<00:02:06.760> up<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.480> that<00:02:08.250> pin<00:02:09.250> sets<00:02:09.780> right<00:02:10.780> into

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
comes up and that pin sets right into

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.350 
comes up and that pin sets right into
that<00:02:11.320> little<00:02:11.380> loop<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.820> when<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:12.970> trip<00:02:13.210> it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
that little loop and when you trip it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.180 
that little loop and when you trip it
you<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:14.350> your<00:02:14.470> little<00:02:14.560> piece<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.890> bait<00:02:15.040> on

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
you have your little piece of bait on

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.500 
you have your little piece of bait on
the<00:02:15.310> inside<00:02:15.610> right<00:02:15.820> in<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.030> back

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
the inside right in the back

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the inside right in the back
there's<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.900> little<00:02:17.110> hook<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.350> there<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
there's a little hook in there you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.470 
there's a little hook in there you
probably<00:02:17.620> can't<00:02:18.010> see<00:02:18.070> but<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.270> basically

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
probably can't see but you basically

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.810 
probably can't see but you basically
when<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:20.230> pull<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.470> hook<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.190> releases

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
when they pull that hook it releases

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.000 
when they pull that hook it releases
this<00:02:22.150> pin<00:02:22.420> like<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.670> boom<00:02:24.670> trapped<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
this pin like this and boom trapped and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.890 
this pin like this and boom trapped and
this<00:02:27.010> little<00:02:27.280> lock<00:02:27.490> drops<00:02:27.760> down<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.780> can

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
this little lock drops down so you can

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.449 
this little lock drops down so you can
basically<00:02:28.989> carry<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.530> around<00:02:29.620> by<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:29.920> handle

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
basically carry it around by this handle

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.720 
basically carry it around by this handle
like<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.890> door<00:02:33.160> will<00:02:33.400> no<00:02:33.520> longer

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
like this and this door will no longer

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.340 
like this and this door will no longer
open<00:02:33.910> because<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.330> opens<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> door<00:02:34.959> as<00:02:35.230> you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
open because this opens the door as you

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.380 
open because this opens the door as you
can<00:02:35.470> see<00:02:35.620> it's<00:02:35.739> locked<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.130> there<00:02:36.310> as<00:02:37.120> soon<00:02:37.300> as

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
can see it's locked in there as soon as

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.680 
can see it's locked in there as soon as
you<00:02:37.480> lift<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:39.209> reset<00:02:40.209> your<00:02:40.300> PIN<00:02:40.450> back

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
you lift this reset your PIN back

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.000 
you lift this reset your PIN back
through<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:43.450> opens<00:02:43.720> right<00:02:43.780> back<00:02:44.020> up<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.890> then

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
through it opens right back up and then

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.360 
through it opens right back up and then
you're<00:02:45.130> resetting<00:02:45.459> ready<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:47.370> set

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
you're resetting ready to go set

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.490 
you're resetting ready to go set
something<00:02:48.670> else<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.230> I'll<00:02:50.230> show<00:02:50.290> you

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
something else in there I'll show you

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.810 
something else in there I'll show you
that<00:02:50.560> action<00:02:50.890> one<00:02:50.980> more<00:02:51.160> time<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:53.290> like<00:02:53.380> that

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
that action one more time just like that

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.350 
that action one more time just like that
so<00:02:54.820> yeah<00:02:54.940> there<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.209> go

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
so yeah there you go

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.400 
so yeah there you go
that's<00:02:55.630> probably<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.959> world's<00:02:56.230> best

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
that's probably the world's best

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.190 
that's probably the world's best
mousetrap<00:02:56.800> right<00:02:56.980> there<00:02:57.600> try<00:02:58.600> one<00:02:58.840> they<00:02:59.050> even

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
mousetrap right there try one they even

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.570 
mousetrap right there try one they even
fold<00:02:59.500> up<00:02:59.680> pretty<00:03:00.070> flat

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
fold up pretty flat

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.710 
fold up pretty flat
I'm<00:03:00.640> not<00:03:00.820> going<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.030> fold<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.330> one<00:03:01.510> because

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
I'm not going to fold this one because

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.790 
I'm not going to fold this one because
I'll<00:03:01.810> probably<00:03:01.900> never<00:03:02.170> get<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:02.470> back<00:03:02.650> together

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
I'll probably never get it back together

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.390 
I'll probably never get it back together
but<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.850> pretty<00:03:03.970> cool<00:03:04.150> trap
