00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.000
Heh! Bring it! Bring it, Cirno!

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.900
You didn't just drink that, do you?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900
That's not good, that's not water.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.800
Don't move and don't breath

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.300
Don't do anything... except... pray.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.360
Just kidding! Bitch!

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.200
You may have one wish.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.200
I wish I was a sheep.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400
I just can't. I'm gonna break into his house.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400
But that's against the law.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.400
EYE AM DE LAW!!!

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.200
Ok, now. How many have of you have played musical instruments before?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.300
Do instruments of torture count?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.300
No

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.900
Is Mayonnaise an instument?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.000
No Yatsuhashi, Mayonnaise is not an
instrument.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Horseraddish in not an instrument either.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.350
Now when we go in there let's show Wriggle that we're happy for her.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.500

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.400
Well then shake it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.800
Look at me. I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount you never would have

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.400
found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.400
But I'm bigger than that.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.500
Fine. What do you want me to do?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.579
Smile.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.180
Oh crap that's terrifying.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.470
We're here to save Wriggle, not kill insects.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.020
Try less teeth.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.240
Close enough. Come on.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.680
Excuse me, I need a spu-- uagh

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.320
It's okay! I've found one!

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.320
If you take a piece of ma food

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.980
You take a piece of my heart

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.140
A.K.A.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.060
Don't do that sh*t.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.480
It's called the poison doll.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.280
Once, there was a poison doll.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.900
It was so poison that everyone died.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.800
The end

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.540
That didn't help at all.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.760
You locked the door, Kosuzu?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.500
No!

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.840
You locked the door, Kosuzu? Ya locked de door, Kosuzu?

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.660
That was a lot of waffles

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.240
Did she ate all the waffles?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.720
Yes, I did.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.760
Could have ask if you don't want any.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.400
Na ah. If I gave you the waffles I won't get any.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.820
Minoriko, would you like a waffle?

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.380
There is no more waffles. I ate them all!

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.919
I know. It's an example.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.560
Why yes sis, I think would like TWO waffles.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.940
You can't-- You want TWO of THEM?

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.360
So if she get 2 waffles--

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.780
then I get 2 waffles.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.320
That still leaves 8 waffles for you.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.440
I DON'T want 8 waffles. I want TWELVE. I want TWELVE of THEM.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.600
I you could seriously ate all of them, I'll personally drive you to Kourindou to buy some more.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.919
I just... I just don't know why you guys get all the waffles.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.599
You still have more waffles than sis and me combine.

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:41.340
They're MINE.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.380
I got them from the freezer and put it on ma plate.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.640
You guys are being selfish.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.720
Holy Shit!

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.040
Guess what guys?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.360
