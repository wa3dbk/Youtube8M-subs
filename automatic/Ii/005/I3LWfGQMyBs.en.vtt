into the kind of situation chemically
where<00:00:37.410> you're<00:00:37.620> as<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.309> said<00:00:38.610> using<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.660> wrench

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
where you're as we said using a wrench

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.280 
where you're as we said using a wrench
as<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> hammer<00:00:41.309> yes<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.540> drive<00:00:42.750> nails<00:00:43.020> with

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
as a hammer yes you can drive nails with

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.619 
as a hammer yes you can drive nails with
a<00:00:43.320> wrench<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> prefer<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> hammer<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.420> more

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
a wrench but I prefer a hammer it's more

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
a wrench but I prefer a hammer it's more
efficient<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.860> method<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> lot<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
efficient the method that I see a lot of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
efficient the method that I see a lot of
people<00:00:50.820> using<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.600> where<00:00:52.020> they're

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
people using out there where they're

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
people using out there where they're
having<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> brush<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.100> basically<00:00:53.640> using<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
having the brush is basically using a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
having the brush is basically using a
chemical<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:54.750> too<00:00:55.110> weak<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.699> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
chemical that's too weak and so that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.720 
chemical that's too weak and so that
chemical<00:00:57.570> becomes<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.530> lubricant<00:00:59.219> for

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
chemical becomes then a lubricant for

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.270 
chemical becomes then a lubricant for
the<00:00:59.910> brushes<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.350> has<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.039> car

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the brushes this this has to do with car

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.070 
the brushes this this has to do with car
washing<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> has<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.359> common<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.719> car

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
washing this has more in common with car

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.770 
washing this has more in common with car
washing<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.680> truck<00:01:04.949> washing<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
washing not truck washing but because of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
washing not truck washing but because of
the<00:01:06.960> nature<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.920> paint<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:10.250> on<00:01:11.250> fleets

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
over the road trucks tractors because of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.999 
over the road trucks tractors because of
the<00:01:14.820> paint<00:01:15.180> that's<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.780> them<00:01:16.110> emraan<00:01:16.650> paint
