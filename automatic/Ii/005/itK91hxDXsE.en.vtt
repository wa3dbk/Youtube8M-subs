iron<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.459> just<00:03:18.640> really<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.450> been<00:03:19.570> curious<00:03:20.020> to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
iron I just really have been curious to

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.979 
iron I just really have been curious to
see<00:03:20.380> how<00:03:21.070> this<00:03:21.580> compares<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> regular

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
see how this compares to a regular

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.270 
see how this compares to a regular
curling<00:03:23.230> wand<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:23.770> a<00:03:23.830> little<00:03:24.100> thicker

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
curling wand and it's a little thicker

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.620 
curling wand and it's a little thicker
so<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.610> think<00:03:24.730> it's<00:03:24.880> going<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.090> create<00:03:25.300> a<00:03:25.420> little

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
so I think it's going to create a little

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.630 
so I think it's going to create a little
bit<00:03:25.780> bigger<00:03:25.959> curls<00:03:26.350> then<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.130> curling<00:03:27.459> wand

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
bit bigger curls then the curling wand

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.880 
bit bigger curls then the curling wand
