00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.490
 I had thought about where the old PC I disposed was going 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 No longer can use the use the old product Electrical and electronic waste 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.230
 The so-called waste will be called about 5.7 kg per capita in the world 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.820
 Waste is dumped every year 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 A total of 41 million tons and paid electronics 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.680
 Waste seems to be tough up to 407.0 million tons by 2017 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:39.610
 Its weight is 10 plus Titanic in the Great Pyramid of Giza 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.720
 The Empire State Building is also 30 animals Burj Khalifa corresponds to plus 50 present 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.960
 I will 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.770
 To deal with this issue, the UNU 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:53.720
 We developed a waste world map and the amount of train waste 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:59.540
 Display the environmental impact clearly 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.680
 The world's first of this on-line tool will identify the regional government and businesses with a problem by the data provided 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.930
 The 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:14.000
 Helps to improve the management of train station objects and protect the global environment 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:20.700
 This is an example is Hyun per 10 years of our United Nations University, commonly known as research results of the United Nations University 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:27.689
 We have been working as a think tank to study the various issues facing humanity 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.100
 With headquarters in Japan and research institutes established in 12 countries around the world, the global network is sluggish 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:36.340
 doing 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:43.170
 Recognized experts in a wide range of fields are leading the way in research related to production 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:46.470
 It also plays an important role as a bridge between researchers worldwide and UN organizations . 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:54.550
 UNU is addressing the challenges facing humanity 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:59.080
 Show innovative solutions eg human security especially important in developing countries 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:03.820
 It is the case in Ghana Republic It is Ghana which is often thought that the security of the country is good. 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:08.020
 In the north we have been struggling with intense tribal conflict for decades 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:14.540
 While the economy has grown significantly in recent years 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:20.329
 In the fork club, the situation of development and poverty has not changed rapidly since 1992 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.379
 Government of Ghana and United Nations Jointly Work on Four Human Security Challenges in Northern Ghana 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:26.989
 Is out 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:31.310
 Food security o type and guarantee and 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:34.560
 Conflict prevention is limit universities and other UN agencies 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:40.140
 And the government of Ghana and the leaders of the community are buried 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:44.220
 Regional development can be greatly enhanced by eliminating tribal discord through peaceful dialogue 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:51.330
 Worked to build a more stable social infrastructure 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:54.140
 The tension has been eased since this work began, and the current government of Ghana and local communities 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.140
 I have taken over 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:06.200
 Such a number of projects form a broad knowledge base 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.200
 Applies to address issues facing the world 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:22.780
 Recently, the United Nations University Policy Research Center was established to create new security and development incidents . 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:27.050
 It is expected Oh this center will summarize the research results of UNU as a policy proposal 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:35.000
 Direct dialogue with policy makers 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:38.770
 In order to gain knowledge, to disseminate it and to use it, we, UNU, can be a force to create a brighter future 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.770
 We are continuing activities
