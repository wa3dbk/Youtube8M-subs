00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the governor beto richa criticized the action 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 demonstrators this afternoon in the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.940
 assembly was the first time that he 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.190
 He spoke about the financial crisis of the state 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.110
 in the election period only said that the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 house was in order that finances 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.910
 you were well cleaned. 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.100
 crisis with me does not hide in a way 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.560
 I'll insist again, we did. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.430
 many and many works throughout the state 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 parana 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.019
 there we had some payment problems 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.599
 It is from these works that some works today 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.969
 momentarily paralyzed what we 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.520
 obliged to present this set of 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.710
 measures which were approved by them 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.780
 at the end of the year with improvements in 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.760
 income from some 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.210
 increase some aliquots of icms 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.280
 and ipva no aberration also inside 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.860
 the average of what is practiced in the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.590
 Brazil and now the second set was 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 reduction of expenses and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.120
 cut some expenses for 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.780
 we can complement these measures 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 and ensure investment capacity 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 of the paraná state because one tried to pass 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.049
 in the general committee called regime 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.020
 to prove everything at once 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.270
 the urgency of the moment sandra grace 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.450
 explain all these questions and sound and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.090
 demonic sound this everybody knows me 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.770
 a person of the dialogue a person who 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 treats all with due respect that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.600
 deserve with cordiality 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.060
 I never missed the respect I never treated 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.369
 in no one but an advent of the law 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.829
 that makes it possible at a moment of extreme 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.570
 urgency for the state due to the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.509
 recipes we need to improve 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.390
 now the first months of the year we 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.189
 we adopt this situation of the commission 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 general in the legislative assembly because the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.500
 rich man other measures and withdrew the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.299
 project 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.310
 I repeat who was the retired 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.909
 chairman of the legislative assembly 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.130
 communicated his decision and I promptly 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.810
 means to maintain physical integrity 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.259
 of the Members who were being 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.090
 threatened by the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.570
 invaded the legislative assembly and not 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.680
 I accepted what happened today unfortunate 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.479
 marked for the history of the paraná 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.250
 Do you want to get involved in the project 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.379
 see something we are going now 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.410
 wait let's sit with our 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.920
 deputies our secretaries see what it is 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.930
 possible to do what is the driving 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.790
 deputies led by the President of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.319
 Assembly will give to go to these 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.020
 measures are not just teachers 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.000
 there are more categories on strike as it is 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.709
 intends to negotiate with the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.030
 we negotiate do what is possible 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.879
 that it is not possible we will see that it is not 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.890
 possible to do, I will insist on my 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.560
 role as governor the people who 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.750
 they elected expect me to take action 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.739
 which preserves the interests of 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.660
 paranaenses 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.180
 I can not exaggerate a certain 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.550
 segment would be comfortable screen for me 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.280
 thinking with cd everything the servers 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.319
 want to fall in the graces of it would be 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.340
 very nice and how is the 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.680
 rest of state 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.269
 in this moment of extreme difficulty 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.220
 How long do you think you're going to put it? 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.080
 state finances in order as 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.620
 as soon as possible with the approval of these 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.830
 measures we have already begun to honor some 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.150
 commitments, taking up some works that 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.629
 were systematically stopped and months 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.030
 the month we are improving the capacity 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.890
 investments for analysis 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.110
 It was a Thursday of great confusion 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.670
 in the legislative assembly was 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.099
 scheduled for this afternoon 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.530
 the creation of the general commission to approve 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.629
 the government's package of measures 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.909
 commissions but the 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.980
 protestors prevented the entry of 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.860
 deputies who arrived escorted by 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.879
 pms there was confrontation between the police and 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.709
 protesters 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.170
 We're going to live there and talk to 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.069
 reporter augusto klein who has more 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.870
 information or August 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.730
 hello barracho looks but at the moment the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.599
 situation is calmer as you 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.069
 can see here 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.019
 protesters continue to gather 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.909
 in the square in front of the assembly 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.950
 legislative but in a much smaller number 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.420
 of what we have seen in the last days 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.370
 many of them are already coming back 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.810
 home going back to the cities of 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.519
 the interior of the state and it is not only 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.200
 Outside within the assembly 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.840
 legislative we have images there for 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.040
 show in the plenary is that he got busy 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.080
 the past three days by the 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.849
 protesters are almost empty some 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.799
 people are not in there but they are already 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.840
 leaving the tents so that the 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.880
 place can be cleaned to the next 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.100
 session to be held on the 23rd 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.850
 this month after the next week that is 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.140
 recess 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.030
 carnival here in the assembly 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.370
 legislation but if the situation is 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.080
 quiet this time was a very long day 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.570
 tense here in the legislature 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.400
 we will accompany the report on the two and 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.710
 mid -afternoon hundreds of police officers 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.350
 surrounded the assembly they saw the 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.450
 side grille of the building on the 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.280
 military police were the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.320
 security secretary fernando 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.330
 francischini tried to welcome the deputies 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.330
 but was stopped by a protester 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.360
 soon after one by one the parliamentarians 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.180
 got out of the van and 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.950
 rushed into the assembly building 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.020
 deputies entered the assembly that 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.640
 side area has all the countertop 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.260
 Shock cops now do the 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.750
 isolation teachers are 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.550
 concentrate on the other side they do not 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.950
 got into this fight 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.990
 Then all the confusion started and 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.780
 who reckons is the reporter rodolfo bardini 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.880
 a lot of rush at this time noise 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.860
 very strong demonstrators running 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.080
 Everywhere in the country we see 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.720
 some people trying to burst the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.850
 of the assembly on that side 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.760
 many would rush the demonstrators there 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.680
 trying to get the grid out anyway 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.480
 bring down this grid plus a bomb 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.480
 he released it now with pepper spray 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.440
 some protesters were injured 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.750
 rubber bullets and raining a lot 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.550
 At this moment we realize many 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.180
 people here a really mess 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.180
 very large 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.180
 now at that time the policemen who 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.610
 are there from the shock crew make a 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.860
 with the shield and here behind the 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.080
 protesters in a peaceful way 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.670
 raise their arms in the form of which they 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.130
 do not have any kind of reaction 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.660
 the police using truncheons to 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.270
 push these protesters only 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.250
 really quite complicated around here 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.520
 protesters still manage to 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.520
 log in 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.250
 even with all the police blockade 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.050
 military demonstrators are able to 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.330
 enter the legislative assembly 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.129
 no more reaction the police opened 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.990
 are letting the demonstrators pass 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:46.150
 now the situation seems to have 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.520
 controlled slightly more than any 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.710
 many people entering this 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.770
 moment within the legislative assembly 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.139
 here from the personal parana as it was 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.940
 a lot of the cat he 's very much in the cat 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.940
 it's all lost, stay
