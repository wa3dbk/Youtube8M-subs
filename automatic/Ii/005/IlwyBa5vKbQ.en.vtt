just go ahead and trim this kind of like

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.270 
just go ahead and trim this kind of like
in<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.200> curve<00:01:28.880> like<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.860> dumb<00:01:31.860> thing<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
in a curve like that and dumb thing I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.649 
in a curve like that and dumb thing I
know<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.759> part<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.119> probably<00:01:33.390> be

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
know if this part will probably be

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450 
know if this part will probably be
shorter<00:01:34.049> than<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.430> ahead

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
shorter than this one so just go ahead

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460 
shorter than this one so just go ahead
and<00:01:35.700> trim<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.299> off<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.930> part<00:01:37.290> as

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and trim a little bit off this part as

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.149 
and trim a little bit off this part as
well<00:01:38.780> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.020> want<00:01:40.259> them<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> little<00:01:41.009> bit

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
well if you want them to be a little bit

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.300 
well if you want them to be a little bit
more<00:01:41.280> even<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.820> cut<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.240> both<00:01:42.540> sides

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
more even to cut on both sides

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.050 
more even to cut on both sides
so<00:01:44.310> again<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.700> trim<00:01:45.600> off<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.729> very

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.109 
so again just trim off just a very very
little<00:01:48.329> part<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.009> curve<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.399> attach<00:01:50.820> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119

on to the top here by the waist and I
try<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> same<00:01:55.409> thing<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> other

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
try to do the same thing on the other

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.600 
try to do the same thing on the other
side<00:01:56.869> here<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.680> even<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.340> both

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
side here so they can be even on both

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.170 
side here so they can be even on both
sides

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
sides

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.870 
sides
and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:01.920> ahead<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.250> pull<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and then just go ahead and pull that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.480 
and then just go ahead and pull that
apart

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.390

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
and then now your cookie will be the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.260 
and then now your cookie will be the
same<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.940> both<00:02:14.970> sides<00:02:16.580> that's<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.910> tip<00:02:18.120> I

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
same on both sides that's just a tip I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.780 
same on both sides that's just a tip I
wanted<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.660> give<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.170> way<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.410> can<00:02:19.790> cut

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
this whole piece will just be gone all

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.810 
this whole piece will just be gone all
right<00:02:25.230> guys<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.560> let's<00:02:25.890> go<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.280> with<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.730> next
