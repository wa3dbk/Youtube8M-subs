 people are considered obese today and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.340

 principle and helped me create this 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.980
 program she comes from a story 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.040
 very poor genetics with diabetes obesity 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.019
 heart disease and so on so 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.840

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.000
 she can help anyone this 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.519

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.160
 5 centimeters of waist lose 4 kilos

 in just nine days losing five 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.870
 centimeters in each leg lose two 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.569
 centimeters in each arm and decrease 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.209
 three dress sizes now 30 years 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.489
 use skirts that are shorter than those I use 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.650
 the school I know you 'll probably be 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.349
 skeptical and let me tell you not to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.760
 blame sounds so drastic that it seems 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.980
 taken from one of those magazines 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.319
 exaggerated truth but it is not 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.400
 I will in the end lost 40 kilos of 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:06.090
 fat and lowered 16 dress sizes 16 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.980
 flower and this 95 kilos step that 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.240
 true is the weight which could not be 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.370
 undo after your last pregnancy 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.590
 54 kilos and she achieved all this without 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.840
 count calories without starving or 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.970
 kill yourself in the gym and all this 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.370
 eating what he liked like ice cream 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.940
 of raspberry and cheesecake which 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.770
 she totally refused to leave 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.050
 her friends are now jealous and the 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.230
 people can not believe that there's ever 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.720
 been pregnant listen when you 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.310
 try to lose weight unfortunately 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.220
 women get the worst of the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.650
 Luck is definitely harder 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.480
 for women to lose weight in fact 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.880
 women are designed to not 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.770
 lose weight no matter how rare 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.100
 it sounds like what I say but it makes sense 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.750
 that you think about it well let me explain 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.330
 everything goes back to the days of the house of 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.710
 our ancestors the men were not 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.870
 facts to accumulate fat in what 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.820
 absolute men were made for 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.310
 be agile and quick to hunt animals 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.700
 that men go accumulating fat 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.560
 goes completely against our genetics 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.090
 On the other hand women were made 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.040
 to accumulate fat to be able to 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.380
 survive and care for their children during 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.160
 a famine its accumulation of fats 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.019
 essentials 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.540
 It's much bigger than the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.310
 men women were made for 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.800
 accumulate as much fat as possible 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.080
 and not lose it for the birth of their 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.910
 children breastfeeding and raising their 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.720
 children 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.810
 unfortunately we were made to 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.790
 not survive to see us well 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.650
 women have great obstacles to 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.350
 lose weight that keep them tied 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.660
 First of all, women have 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.820
 Larger fat cells and more 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.800
 enzymes that store fats within 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.020
 them the fat cells of the 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.230
 men have more enzymes to burn 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.360
 fats and they are honestly smaller 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.190
 women have to work hard 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.680
 more than that is why the steps that 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.780
 I will mention in this presentation 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.790
 they also work second estrogen 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.310
 multiply the enzymes that store 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.830
 fat making them gain weight around 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.100
 of the butt and legs as if they were a 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.620
 damned maternal genetics competition in 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.600
 third place the drastic diets put 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.670
 to their bodies instantly in a state 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.970
 of famine by reducing enzymes 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.660
 fat burners by 50% our 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.510
 bodies 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.210
 it literally scares 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.040
 therefore we not only tend to lose 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.410
 muscle mass with a drastic diet 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.530
 but also our ability to burn 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.600
 fat decreases can not be this 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.660
 should help you understand why it is 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.820
 harder for girls to lose weight 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.170
 then it is really possible to overcome 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.170
 these follies of genetics
