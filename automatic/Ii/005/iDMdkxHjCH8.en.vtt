00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.720
 welcome i 'm always the collaborator 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.120
 to get the game maker a fantastic one 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.309
 channel I suggest you register 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.230
 today we will show you the epic battle 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.609
 between three dragons two enemies plus one of ours 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 it will truly be a breathtaking encounter 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.470
 that will take away the blood of good and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.820
 you will like all the fine marrow or in the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.859
 bones 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:32.130
 therefore we will name the first dragon as 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:35.250
 kainan and we will make it special 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.630
 because you see it looks like a very normal one 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.649
 dragon 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.350
 in reality, a difficult speed is played 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.789
 terrible dragon 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.140
 the second dragon we will call it gorba 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.149
 first of all however it is better 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.980
 stock up on passion to play at 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.010
 this level against three of one 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.010
 time 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.940
 well it's not bullshit 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.759
 our aim will be to reach the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.680
 peak unscathed possibly thanks to 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.299
 these wonderful imperials who 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.369
 they always jump out in moments 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.299
 best 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.750
 generally when you're stealing 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.409
 something but right now we have 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.409
 had luck 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.960
 note that we are level 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.890
 very high this yes is a clash 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.890
 really ethical 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.330
 kainan launches a lunge 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.950
 well its strength is gigantic but the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.200
 ours is even more so 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.730
 let's see who we are ahead 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.170
 well china has been beaten 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.170
 but still one on the horizon 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.840
 here is the terrible corp 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.220
 fortunately we are not tabellini 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.260
 otherwise this battle would be 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:18.460
 really hard the dragons have 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.710
 peculiarities are strong fast and able but 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.170
 very stupid indeed by mistake 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.950
 some blame are given to each other and now 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.950
 I'm very pissed off 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.849
 here is our fantastic black horse 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.849
 shadow that gives us our help 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.930
 the battle becomes compelling 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.900
 above all because we will be the new ones 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.579
 winners and not for tricks but for 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:57.590
 adult strength and courage and time of the east 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:03:01.879
 the last name dragon unread the names 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.569
 terrible legendary scari dragon 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.730
 invisible that always appears in the moment 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.370
 better or together with his two 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.370
 fellow gorba is closed 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.390
 here is the deadly attempt 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.930
 help like that 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.910
 we try to hit him from behind but 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.720
 the attack does not work we believe in one 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.720
 cloud of dust 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.410
 but who is really a legendary dragon 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.420
 so much is true that most of the 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.260
 imperial I went what 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.120
 strangely it does not surprise me at all 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:14.410
 unfortunately the imperials are the law and 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.410
 so as such it should be done 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.820
 Today is who he really is invincible 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.810
 protected for months and spice it up not 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.690
 or the best stories but today 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:43.650
 let it be his day we are not so much 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:43.650
 sure ahead aismac in fell strength 

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:54.819
 and now let 's go up the stairs of le 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.819
 shadow long shadows awaits us majestic 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.230
 we ride along the interminable 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.230
 stairway and here is really the part 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:14.110
 more difficult among the dragons are nothing 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:16.300
 in comparison to this but for us the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.610
 invincible 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.240
 all this are trifles we draw 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:34.590
 the sword we are preparing to fight the 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:34.590
 enemy who will follow us and here is the altar 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:46.220
 and the triumphal arch of our heroes is 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:49.190
 came the extreme south called peak 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:54.110
 the long shadows is the most on 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.820
 skyrim is the one further south in another for 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.800
 this is truly a special place 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:03.370
 here you can also find a fantastic 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.370
 yell and beyond 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.430
 here is a small secret passage 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.680
 nothing special but so much for 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.900
 conclude in beauty 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.890
 and here is one of the wonderful landscapes 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:39.310
 Nordic skyrim hardwood forests yes 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:42.940
 they push towards the east while towards 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:46.390
 west the mountains of skyrim push 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.670
 to their even that winds between chains 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.990
 increasingly inaccessible mountain ranges up to 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.990
 get lost in the whole tambre 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.570
 thank you for joining us
