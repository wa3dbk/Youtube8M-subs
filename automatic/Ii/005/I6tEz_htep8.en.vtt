we<00:00:58.969> took<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.270> really<00:00:59.449> different<00:00:59.750> approach<00:01:00.350> to

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.539 
the design of the data center in fact
that<00:01:04.369> was<00:01:04.810> driven<00:01:05.810> by<00:01:06.259> one<00:01:07.070> of<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.280> clients

so<00:01:12.259> they<00:01:12.409> were<00:01:12.470> really<00:01:12.560> encouraging<00:01:13.520> us<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.700> be

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
so they were really encouraging us to be

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.430 
so they were really encouraging us to be
innovative<00:01:14.240> about<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.990> way<00:01:15.140> that<00:01:15.320> we

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
innovative about the way that we

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.249 
innovative about the way that we
designed<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.950> data<00:01:16.159> center<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.050> in<00:01:18.050> addition

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
designed the data center and in addition

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.990 
designed the data center and in addition
to<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.830> they<00:01:19.040> were<00:01:19.130> really<00:01:19.250> focused<00:01:19.850> on

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
to that they were really focused on

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.330 
to that they were really focused on
reducing<00:01:20.180> energy<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:21.590> was<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.890> first<00:01:22.130> time

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
reducing energy it was the first time

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.460 
reducing energy it was the first time
that<00:01:22.399> we'd<00:01:22.759> been<00:01:23.030> asked<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.049> provide<00:01:24.259> a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
that we'd been asked to provide a

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.800 
that we'd been asked to provide a
benchmark<00:01:24.890> or<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.490> measure<00:01:25.850> of<00:01:26.000> how<00:01:26.149> efficient

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
benchmark or a measure of how efficient

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
the day since was going to be and where

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:30.940 
the day since was going to be and where

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.279

and<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.429> data<00:01:31.820> center<00:01:32.240> efficiency<00:01:32.810> measurement

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
and a data center efficiency measurement

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.609 
and a data center efficiency measurement
that<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.440> included<00:01:34.130> as<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.640> design<00:01:35.149> target<00:01:35.869> and

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
that we included as a design target and

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.020 
that we included as a design target and
I<00:01:36.710> suppose<00:01:36.979> what's<00:01:37.220> really<00:01:37.490> different<00:01:37.670> is

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
I suppose what's really different is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.669 
I suppose what's really different is
that<00:01:38.060> we've<00:01:38.390> taken<00:01:38.720> this<00:01:38.990> opportunity<00:01:39.170> to

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
that we've taken this opportunity to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.760 
that we've taken this opportunity to
rethink<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.759> way<00:01:40.789> in<00:01:41.600> which<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:41.840> designed<00:01:42.409> the

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
rethink the way in which we designed the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.160 
rethink the way in which we designed the
data<00:01:43.009> center<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.789> I<00:01:44.119> guess<00:01:44.360> that's<00:01:44.690> really

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
data center and I guess that's really

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.809 
data center and I guess that's really
where<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.619> innovation<00:01:45.740> has<00:01:46.250> come<00:01:46.460> from<00:01:46.700> as

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
where the innovation has come from as

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.639 
where the innovation has come from as

cooling<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.640> that's<00:02:29.940> really<00:02:30.270> important

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
cooling and that's really important

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.890 
cooling and that's really important
because<00:02:31.010> it's<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.460> savings<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.330> people<00:02:33.750> can

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
because it's the savings that people can

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
and our approach to cooling is really

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.610 
and our approach to cooling is really
compounding<00:02:41.130> those<00:02:42.050> energy<00:02:43.050> reduction

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
