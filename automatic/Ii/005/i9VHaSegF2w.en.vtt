00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:18.810
 how to make a mini secret elevator but 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.990
 again a fool and this design that I 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 I fall as you see the law is very shared 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.150
 it's from the gentleman who was a member of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.759
 phoenix that doctor I will leave you here the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
 cardinal in the decision and I recommend 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.480
 there are very many a channel because they have 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.600
 super large and super constructions 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.430
 efficient and good let's see how 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 it works quickly as you see this is 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 the circuit are only worth and let's say 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 that when we hit the button, a 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.379
 little bit online that pulls us towards 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.149
 up and good raise us to five 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.340
 blocks is well worth how this works 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.329
 circuit as you see is very simple 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.339
 good of pretty tiny as you see and 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.019
 let's say that this block is worth the 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.059
 that drives us up 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.940
 the block is line but you must first 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.040
 remove this block cited vale and what 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 will take you here so that the block of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 Celine can go out to this position and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.409
 rise up but here is a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.270
 small problem what 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.700
 slim will stick to these four blocks and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.030
 will lower them for that we have the function 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.030
 of these normal oils is worth the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.270
 will return to their original position and this one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.000
 it will also take you back here 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.189
 As you see, I go down and up again 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.140
 this and it becomes equivalent and good I 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.189
 I think it's time to go with the tutorial 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.109
 let's start with relation of the two 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.399
 pistons that was a piston after thing by 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.770
 here and around 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.069
 we will place normal pistons such that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.479
 well this is the block of law that 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.929
 is going to push us up and here 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.079
 normal soil would be well worth 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.719
 from here we will take the input by 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.819
 up here will be for example if this 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.640
 yes it is on the wall that we want to upload 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.369
 well, it would be here the couple we went up to 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.000
 from here the input is good 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.080
 I would be two blocks high here 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.840
 perfect 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.800
 we will take a rest torch 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.930
 with this a little bit more and we 'll take it 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.500
 From here we have the power 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.630
 always active as you see 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.450
 we would lower the current with a 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.870
 a sticky piston here is worth the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.310
 problem is that we give it to you and how 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.060
 You see, it does not work, it's worth it 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.490
 we update vale to update this 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.040
 this piston as you see what we are going to 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.590
 do is put a normal one next to you and 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.440
 it will be activated without any problem 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.790
 you see well now let's go down one and two 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.600
 blocks landmarks of the line and here we go to 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.550
 put a block of reston palet well we 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.180
 we change these around here it's quickly 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.460
 OK 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.860
 perfect and here we are going to put a 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.020
 jumper looking up and here 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.550
 let's put a hopper looking towards the 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.050
 jumper ok this is a limiter of 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.810
 pulse and let's put a block here 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.180
 quoted let's put a comparator here 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.490
 so that when this item arrives I'm going 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.530
 to put here in the soldering iron when it arrives 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.150
 to the hopper detect the item worth we go to 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.000
 see how it works 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.850
 Okay, we see it, you see, it's worth, it's active 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.130
 is activated by being in blocks 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.850
 of remains in comes to the welder and gives 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.380
 current is worth perfect touch well let's go 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.030
 to put it as it was before right if 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.410
 we see here a block quoted we put here 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.870
 no reston antorchitas that will give you 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.210
 current to this normal piston and to this and 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.570
 will keep it in the state 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.250
 in activated state it is constantly worth 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.950
 ok we go down so that a block quoted 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.680
 we put here once reston that in turn 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.460
 will give current to this block that its 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.250
 current candle to this repeater if 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.530
 we are going to block an antorchitas to this 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.870
 missing piston and torch to this 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.530
 piston that was missing led and good to this already 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.590
 I would be going to see how 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.300
 and here something strange happens evidently 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.830
 missing piston harassment will 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.889
 extract this block is worth people who will go 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.430
 here each stream is obviously worth 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.500
 is in pancake you know well worth here 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.060
 very high now we are going to try to 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.190
 see how everything works fine everything 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.360
 is correct expected to be ready should 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.630
 go here there is clearly with the input 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.889
 there we go to perfect well and then not 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.160
 there were only five blocks if I did not 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.670
 I'm wrong to see let's take three 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.940
 four and five blocks 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.540
 perfect and totally hidden as you see and 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.540
 Well, I hope
