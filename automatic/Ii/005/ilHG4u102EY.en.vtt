00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:12.199
 here is where more is this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.420
 nikkei cuisine theme elsewhere 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:20.550
 more they do 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.430
 let's say traditional cooking or make a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.130
 much more commercial mix 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.380
 not thinking let's say on the subject of being 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.320
 regional or using regional products 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.530
 for example in Argentina the subject is more 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.610
 as Americanized then 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.280
 there is potential in being able to do 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.970
 very interesting things with products 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.240
 like meats 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.780
 making good interesting mixes in 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.530
 mexico I think that also for the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 variety of products that they have and 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.540
 the facilities also let's say in the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.180
 understand all things fencing systems 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.080
 for example in the market you can 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.940
 find fruit varieties 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.060
 chilli varieties then like that 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.060
 the combination is much simpler 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.479
 I think you 're worked if you have 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.700
 reason in risky because one did not know 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.450
 Well, if a chili visa was going 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.299
 to like it and not see it or be like 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.509
 now it has become a classic no no 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.469
 giving saying this traditional but it has 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.619
 become a classic in all 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.619
 restaurants 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.690
 I have to if people should not leave 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.910
 to prove are the irises in the ball of 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.920
 rice with the borrowed on that too 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.330
 we are putting him his touches this 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.659
 personal not like 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.780
 for example shrimp powder powder 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.560
 we are learning we are this too 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.170
 this adding some light sauces 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.629
 like ceviche or milk 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.239
 tiger with yellow pepper or some sauce 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.000
 anticuchara I think that is the way that 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.879
 this age cook and what should we follow 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.480
 apart from the maquis are the are the 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:25.410
 new nikkei iris that is where it looks 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.510
 also more the technique of the itama ey 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.329
 the taste for putting say things 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 interesting on or inside the 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.170
 delirium 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.750
 I would tell you that that was before now 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.750
 a Peruvian man 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.920
 You know how to ask what you say I love you like that or 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.330
 which one here 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.220
 If I was a Japanese impress, he knows how 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.460
 a Peruvian 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.500
 appreciate the raw fish you know eat with 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.630
 little sticks definitely not this 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.930
 there was a 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.180
 a big change in a radical change does not 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.210
 on the subject let's say for many years 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.150
 that people had him then this a little 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.730
 of fear of raw fish does not look now 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.629
 even children 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.830
 in your parties or meetings what good 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:31.349
 it is no longer this chicken or hamburger but 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.620
 rather what they are asking are maquis not 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.620
 these 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.940
 We have YouTube for example, which is the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.340
 Japanese lemon is a product that 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.220
 we import a tiradito based on 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.740
 this Japanese lemon we use siso that is 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.100
 a 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.190
 dehydrated Japanese plant also what 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.420
 we also care about what the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.420
 the red one you put 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.240
 we use this rice vinegar 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.000
 what you have not failed me so far is 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.520
 a just this from the whole fish not 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.530
 like the devil peje is not from 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.120
 Ugly appearance but definitely or 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.090
 be when you start to try from meat 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.670
 white meat so far no and there is not 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.670
 one that I've done that has not liked not 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.210
 h was the initial one for me means a lot 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.770
 in this restaurant is part is part of 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:34.430
 me is what I like, let's say 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.710
 I'm a cook I do not know how to make another one 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.960
 I know how to do something else and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.560
 what he wants is for people when 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.570
 come here feel at home and it's 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.820
 that's why I 'm in charge 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.610
 well to see the service part of the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.260
 part of the kitchen all complaints 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.260
 they are going to me
