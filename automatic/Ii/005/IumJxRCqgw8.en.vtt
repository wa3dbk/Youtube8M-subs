00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to be able to address problems that we

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
to be able to address problems that we
know<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.050> very<00:00:37.350> difficult<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
know are going to be very difficult and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.180 
know are going to be very difficult and
in<00:00:38.850> particular<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.629> these<00:00:39.780> emerging<00:00:40.410> types<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
in particular in these emerging types of

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.440 
in particular in these emerging types of
problems<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> blood-brain<00:00:42.420> barrier

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
problems like the blood-brain barrier

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.510 
problems like the blood-brain barrier
problem

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.580 

so<00:00:49.520> as<00:00:49.850> an<00:00:50.420> engineer<00:00:50.570> I<00:00:50.810> like<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.260> think<00:00:51.470> in

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
so as an engineer I like to think in

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.440 
so as an engineer I like to think in
engineering<00:00:52.160> terms<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:53.060> blood-brain

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
engineering terms so the blood-brain

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.690 
engineering terms so the blood-brain
barrier<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:54.080> effectively<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.920> security

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
barrier is effectively the security

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.420 
barrier is effectively the security
system<00:00:56.150> for<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.450> brain<00:00:56.690> as<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:57.830> result<00:00:58.280> of

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
system for the brain as a result of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.730 
system for the brain as a result of
eating<00:00:58.550> or<00:00:58.880> exercise<00:00:59.390> there<00:00:59.810> are<00:00:59.960> relatively

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
eating or exercise there are relatively

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.979 
eating or exercise there are relatively
large<00:01:01.040> fluctuations<00:01:01.910> in<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.239> chemistry<00:01:02.660> in

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
large fluctuations in the chemistry in

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.469 
large fluctuations in the chemistry in
our<00:01:03.110> body<00:01:03.320> in<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.620> blood<00:01:03.739> stream<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.479> if

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
our body in the blood stream and if

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.840 
our body in the blood stream and if
those<00:01:05.720> fluctuations<00:01:06.260> were<00:01:06.950> translated<00:01:07.729> into

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
those fluctuations were translated into

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.280 
those fluctuations were translated into
the<00:01:08.090> brain<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.600> would<00:01:08.660> be<00:01:08.810> something<00:01:09.110> like

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
the brain it would be something like

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.990 
the brain it would be something like
spilling<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.010> cup<00:01:10.220> of<00:01:10.370> coffee<00:01:10.580> on<00:01:10.850> your

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
spilling a cup of coffee on your

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.250 
spilling a cup of coffee on your
computer<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:12.020> wouldn't<00:01:12.410> be<00:01:12.560> good<00:01:14.020> so<00:01:15.020> there's

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
computer it wouldn't be good so there's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.469 
computer it wouldn't be good so there's
two<00:01:15.530> parts<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.310> security<00:01:16.880> system<00:01:17.300> the

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
two parts to the security system the

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.900 
two parts to the security system the
endothelial<00:01:18.410> cells<00:01:18.740> are<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.340> cells<00:01:19.550> that

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
endothelial cells are the cells that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.820 
endothelial cells are the cells that
line<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.750> micro<00:01:21.140> vessels<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.680> capillaries

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
line the micro vessels and capillaries

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.280 
line the micro vessels and capillaries
in<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.550> brain<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.060> these<00:01:23.660> are<00:01:23.869> highly

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
in the brain and these are highly

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.870 
in the brain and these are highly
specialized<00:01:24.920> cells<00:01:25.310> they're<00:01:25.580> knitted

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
specialized cells they're knitted

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.090 
specialized cells they're knitted
together<00:01:26.000> very<00:01:26.509> tightly<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.140> there's<00:01:27.560> no<00:01:27.770> gaps

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
together very tightly so there's no gaps

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.550 
together very tightly so there's no gaps
so<00:01:28.790> small<00:01:29.119> molecules<00:01:29.690> are<00:01:29.930> not<00:01:30.080> able<00:01:30.350> to

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
so small molecules are not able to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.580 
so small molecules are not able to
penetrate<00:01:30.979> between<00:01:31.910> these<00:01:32.780> gaps<00:01:33.080> in<00:01:33.440> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
penetrate between these gaps in the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.030 
penetrate between these gaps in the
cells

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
cells

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.760 
cells
the<00:01:34.940> second<00:01:35.390> way<00:01:35.509> they're<00:01:35.780> specialized<00:01:36.410> is

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
the second way they're specialized is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.420 
the second way they're specialized is
that<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:38.030> cells<00:01:38.360> are<00:01:38.630> designed<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.830> actively

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
that the cells are designed to actively

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.490 
that the cells are designed to actively
transport<00:01:41.240> molecules<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.200> brain<00:01:42.470> needs

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
transport molecules that the brain needs

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.300 
transport molecules that the brain needs
like<00:01:43.340> oxygen<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.360> glucose<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.890> at<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.100> same

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
like oxygen and glucose but at the same

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.660 
like oxygen and glucose but at the same
time<00:01:46.670> we've<00:01:47.210> evolved<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.840> system<00:01:48.320> of

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
time we've evolved a system of

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.920 
time we've evolved a system of
biological<00:01:49.670> pumps<00:01:50.150> so<00:01:50.540> these<00:01:50.690> are

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
biological pumps so these are

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.560 
biological pumps so these are
specialized<00:01:51.740> proteins<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:53.420> they

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
specialized proteins and if they

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.870 
specialized proteins and if they
recognize<00:01:54.200> molecules<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.250> shouldn't<00:01:55.640> be<00:01:55.760> on

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
recognize molecules that shouldn't be on

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.219 
recognize molecules that shouldn't be on
their<00:01:56.090> way<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.540> brain<00:01:56.780> they<00:01:56.990> will<00:01:57.110> be

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
their way to the brain they will be

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.830 
their way to the brain they will be
pumped<00:01:57.650> right<00:01:57.950> back<00:01:58.190> out<00:01:58.460> into<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:59.030> vascular

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
pumped right back out into the vascular

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.399 
pumped right back out into the vascular
system<00:02:01.120> now<00:02:02.120> this<00:02:02.270> becomes<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.780> problem<00:02:03.049> of

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
system now this becomes a problem of

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.700 
system now this becomes a problem of
course<00:02:03.710> treating<00:02:04.430> diseases<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.240> brain

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
course treating diseases of the brain

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.410 
course treating diseases of the brain
because<00:02:06.710> we<00:02:07.370> need<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.610> be<00:02:07.729> able<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.119> deliver

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
because we need to be able to deliver

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.229 
because we need to be able to deliver
drugs<00:02:08.720> from<00:02:09.260> the<00:02:09.410> vascular<00:02:09.890> system<00:02:10.120> into<00:02:11.120> the

drugs from the vascular system into the

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.220 
drugs from the vascular system into the
brain<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:13.010> at<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.580> moment<00:02:13.760> there<00:02:14.150> are<00:02:14.180> no<00:02:14.299> drug

well<00:02:35.580> we<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:36.000> I'd<00:02:36.780> say<00:02:37.019> personal<00:02:37.470> reason<00:02:37.739> to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
well we have I'd say personal reason to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.850 
well we have I'd say personal reason to
be<00:02:37.980> concerned<00:02:38.909> about<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.629> have<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> member

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
be concerned about that we have a member

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.130 
be concerned about that we have a member
of<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.980> family<00:02:41.190> who<00:02:41.519> is<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.970> person<00:02:42.629> who<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.930> now

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
of the family who is a person who is now

of the family who is a person who is now
in<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.849> initial<00:02:44.849> stages<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:46.590> course<00:02:46.799> we

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
in the initial stages and of course we

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.670 
in the initial stages and of course we
can<00:02:47.159> see<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.549> happening<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.959> horrible

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
can see this happening this horrible

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.130 
can see this happening this horrible
disease<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.549> realize<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.000> there<00:02:51.930> has<00:02:52.110> to

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
disease and I realize that there has to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.680 
disease and I realize that there has to
be<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.410> solution<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:56.060> advances<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.269> tissue

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
be a solution so advances in tissue

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.220 
be a solution so advances in tissue

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
neuroscience now mean that we're poised

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.479 
neuroscience now mean that we're poised
to<00:03:03.540> be<00:03:04.079> able<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.590> address<00:03:04.950> some<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.280> these

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
to be able to address some of these

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.990 
to be able to address some of these
problems<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.989> our<00:03:07.500> ultimate<00:03:07.799> goal<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.700> try

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
problems so our ultimate goal is to try

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.020 
problems so our ultimate goal is to try
to<00:03:09.060> build<00:03:09.989> an<00:03:10.290> artificial<00:03:10.890> brain<00:03:11.280> capillary

to build an artificial brain capillary
in<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.780> lab<00:03:12.989> if<00:03:13.260> we<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.430> do<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.879> then<00:03:15.599> we

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
in the lab if we can do that then we

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.949 
in the lab if we can do that then we
have<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.799> complete<00:03:17.549> micro<00:03:17.910> environment<00:03:18.810> that
