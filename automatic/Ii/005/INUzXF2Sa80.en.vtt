 even a little point and good as he 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.150
 I do not put myself in two machines that he 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.010

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.610
 we can practically get 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.950
 that I am being born then to the eye of the hunger 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.530
 how they are removed is one hundred percent for 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.510
