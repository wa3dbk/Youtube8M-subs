these<00:02:21.030> are<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.360> make<00:02:21.510> up<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.720> sort<00:02:21.930> of

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
these are going to make up a sort of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.280 
these are going to make up a sort of
tail<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.800> top<00:02:23.570> if<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.720> don't<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.080> this

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
tail for the top if you don't like this

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.960 
tail for the top if you don't like this
look<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:25.740> skip<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.280> step<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.790> go

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
look you can skip this step and just go

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.490 
look you can skip this step and just go
ahead<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.210> make<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> regular<00:02:27.600> tank<00:02:27.990> top<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:28.440> I

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
ahead and make a regular tank top but I

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.390 
ahead and make a regular tank top but I
like<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.830> because<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.130> makes<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.340> possible

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
like this because it makes it possible

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.290 
like this because it makes it possible
to<00:02:29.880> wear<00:02:30.090> leggings<00:02:30.600> as<00:02:31.020> pants<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:33.240> I

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
to wear leggings as pants so then I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.810 
to wear leggings as pants so then I
flipped<00:02:33.690> them<00:02:33.960> like<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:35.100> place<00:02:35.340> them<00:02:35.610> where

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
flipped them like so to place them where

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:54.740 
flipped them like so to place them where
I<00:02:35.880> want<00:02:36.030> them<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.270> end<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:53.300> then<00:02:54.300> pin<00:02:54.540> those

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
I want them to end up and then pin those

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:10.270 
I want them to end up and then pin those
down<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.990> then<00:03:04.050> sew<00:03:04.440> across<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.920> leg

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.790 

after<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.180> stretch<00:03:11.630> out<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.230> pieces<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
after that stretch out the pieces in the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.200 
after that stretch out the pieces in the
back<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.130> you've<00:03:13.220> cut<00:03:13.490> otherwise<00:03:13.940> they're

not<00:03:14.330> gonna<00:03:14.480> look<00:03:14.750> nice<00:03:15.140> or<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:15.650> gonna<00:03:15.800> be

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
not gonna look nice or just gonna be

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.010 
not gonna look nice or just gonna be
like<00:03:16.130> these<00:03:16.370> flat<00:03:16.700> strips<00:03:17.090> when<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.780> stretch

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
like these flat strips when you stretch

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.290 
like these flat strips when you stretch
them<00:03:18.230> out<00:03:18.410> t-shirt<00:03:19.130> fabric<00:03:19.550> is<00:03:19.670> super<00:03:20.000> elastic

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
them out t-shirt fabric is super elastic

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.970 
them out t-shirt fabric is super elastic
but<00:03:20.690> if<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.870> comes<00:03:21.050> these<00:03:21.230> kind<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.500> spaghetti

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
but if it comes these kind of spaghetti

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.970 
but if it comes these kind of spaghetti
things<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.420> that's<00:03:23.900> what<00:03:24.080> we<00:03:24.170> want<00:03:24.380> just<00:03:24.830> that

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
things and that's what we want just that

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.360 
things and that's what we want just that
texture<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.620> next<00:03:27.830> thing<00:03:27.950> I'm<00:03:28.040> doing<00:03:28.070> is

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
texture the next thing I'm doing is

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.100 
texture the next thing I'm doing is
recreating<00:03:28.880> that<00:03:29.209> look<00:03:29.420> from<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.720> back<00:03:29.900> on

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
recreating that look from the back on

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.710 
recreating that look from the back on
the<00:03:30.200> front<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:30.800> two<00:03:30.980> sides<00:03:31.280> just<00:03:31.880> beside

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
the front and the two sides just beside

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.340 
the front and the two sides just beside
the<00:03:33.050> print<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:35.000> folding<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.480> fabric<00:03:35.810> over<00:03:35.990> and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the print so folding the fabric over and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.830 
the print so folding the fabric over and
then<00:03:37.280> just<00:03:37.459> cutting<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.030> little<00:03:38.240> bit<00:03:38.390> into<00:03:38.720> it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
then just cutting a little bit into it

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.750 
then just cutting a little bit into it
without<00:03:39.050> cutting<00:03:39.440> into<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.190> print<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.580> then

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
without cutting into the print and then

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.610 
without cutting into the print and then
again<00:03:46.940> stretching<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.810> fabric<00:03:47.959> out<00:03:48.320> so<00:03:48.500> that

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
again stretching the fabric out so that

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.430 
again stretching the fabric out so that
I<00:03:48.650> get<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:48.830> speedy<00:03:49.340> effect<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:51.020> repeating

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
I get the speedy effect and repeating

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.199 
I get the speedy effect and repeating
that<00:03:51.560> for<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.920> other<00:03:52.070> side<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.700> front<00:03:58.209> and

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
that for the other side of the front and

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.210 
that for the other side of the front and
stretching<00:03:59.959> again<00:04:02.890> after<00:04:03.890> that

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
stretching again after that

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.000 
stretching again after that
get<00:04:04.370> out<00:04:04.459> your<00:04:04.700> safety<00:04:05.390> pins<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:05.840> pin<00:04:06.620> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
get out your safety pins and pin the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.390 
get out your safety pins and pin the
open<00:04:07.400> sighs<00:04:08.410> like<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.500> said<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:09.890> ended<00:04:10.310> up

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
open sighs like I said I ended up

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.360 
open sighs like I said I ended up
to<00:04:10.550> cutting<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:10.910> entire<00:04:11.230> sides<00:04:12.230> open<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.190> can

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
to cutting the entire sides open you can

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.180 
to cutting the entire sides open you can
lay<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.520> little<00:04:13.760> bit<00:04:13.910> if<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.060> like<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.980> just<00:04:15.980> like

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
lay a little bit if you like I just like

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.000 
lay a little bit if you like I just like
having<00:04:16.630> safety<00:04:17.630> pins<00:04:17.930> instead<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.769> sewn

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
having safety pins instead of a sewn

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.250 
having safety pins instead of a sewn
edge<00:04:19.310> because<00:04:19.729> it<00:04:19.760> makes<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.450> easy<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.810> just

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
edge because it makes it so easy to just

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.820 
edge because it makes it so easy to just
fit<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.739> your<00:04:21.919> body<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:24.470> repeat<00:04:24.740> that

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
fit it to your body so repeat that

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.000 
fit it to your body so repeat that
process<00:04:25.040> for<00:04:25.310> both<00:04:25.669> sites<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:27.560> then<00:04:27.860> you're

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
process for both sites and then you're

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.070 
process for both sites and then you're
basically<00:04:28.460> done<00:04:28.700> now<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.240> ended<00:04:29.690> up<00:04:29.780> doing<00:04:30.020> a

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
basically done now I ended up doing a

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.990 
basically done now I ended up doing a
lot<00:04:30.290> of<00:04:30.440> detail<00:04:30.770> work<00:04:30.950> on<00:04:31.100> this<00:04:31.280> top<00:04:31.490> after<00:04:31.700> I

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
lot of detail work on this top after I

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.990 
lot of detail work on this top after I
recorded<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:33.560> put<00:04:34.040> some<00:04:34.190> chains<00:04:34.520> on<00:04:34.970> and

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
recorded it I put some chains on and

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.780 
recorded it I put some chains on and
just<00:04:35.990> more<00:04:36.200> safety<00:04:36.410> pins<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:37.010> get<00:04:37.160> my<00:04:37.400> punky

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
just more safety pins to get my punky

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.790 
just more safety pins to get my punky
filled<00:04:38.090> but<00:04:38.360> yeah<00:04:38.570> this<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:39.020> basically<00:04:39.440> what

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
filled but yeah this is basically what

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.219 
filled but yeah this is basically what
the<00:04:39.890> top<00:04:40.070> looks<00:04:40.340> like<00:04:40.550> when<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:41.000> done<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:42.169> it

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
the top looks like when it's done so it

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.500 
the top looks like when it's done so it
started<00:04:42.560> out<00:04:42.680> as<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:42.979> regular<00:04:43.430> boring<00:04:43.820> t-shirt
