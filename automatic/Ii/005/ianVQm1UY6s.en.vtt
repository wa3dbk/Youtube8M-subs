related to particularly this week to the
world<00:00:45.430> of<00:00:45.610> sports<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.990> thing<00:00:47.170> that<00:00:47.290> we've

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
world of sports the thing that we've

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.960 
world of sports the thing that we've
really<00:00:47.710> seen<00:00:47.890> happening<00:00:48.400> is<00:00:48.520> that<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.760> user

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
really seen happening is that the user

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.120 
really seen happening is that the user
is<00:00:49.090> increasingly<00:00:49.630> in<00:00:49.840> control<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.560> that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
is increasingly in control of that

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.590 
is increasingly in control of that
experience<00:00:51.579> as<00:00:51.850> we<00:00:51.970> shift<00:00:52.120> from<00:00:52.270> work<00:00:52.570> the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
experience as we shift from work the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.140 
experience as we shift from work the
broadcasts<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.650> more<00:00:54.100> interactive<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:54.820> even

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
broadcasts to more interactive and even

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.569 
broadcasts to more interactive and even
more<00:00:55.720> socially<00:00:56.020> aware<00:00:56.350> models<00:00:56.920> where<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.460> end

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
more socially aware models where the end

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.670 
more socially aware models where the end
user<00:00:57.730> not<00:00:58.000> only<00:00:58.300> consumes<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.960> content<00:00:59.380> it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
user not only consumes the content it

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.990 
user not only consumes the content it
actually<00:00:59.800> has<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.250> opportunity<00:01:00.520> to<00:01:00.820> produce

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
actually has the opportunity to produce

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.850 
actually has the opportunity to produce
it<00:01:01.390> one<00:01:01.960> of<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.110> great<00:01:02.200> events<00:01:02.560> that<00:01:02.650> we<00:01:02.739> saw

it one of the great events that we saw

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.160 
it one of the great events that we saw
this<00:01:03.010> week<00:01:03.190> was<00:01:03.310> actually<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.640> video<00:01:03.970> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
this week was actually a video that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.260 
this week was actually a video that
Chris<00:01:05.170> Bosh<00:01:05.439> the<00:01:05.950> center<00:01:06.700> for<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:06.909> Toronto

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.539 
Chris Bosh the center for the Toronto
Raptors<00:01:07.659> produced<00:01:08.079> as<00:01:08.229> part<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.189> his<00:01:09.340> social

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
Raptors produced as part of his social

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.919 
Raptors produced as part of his social
network<00:01:09.969> to<00:01:10.090> increase<00:01:10.359> the<00:01:10.509> amount<00:01:10.689> of<00:01:10.749> votes

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
network to increase the amount of votes

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:14.639 
network to increase the amount of votes
for<00:01:11.229> him<00:01:12.270> actually<00:01:13.270> getting<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:14.409> third

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
for him actually getting to this third

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.819 
for him actually getting to this third
his<00:01:15.429> third<00:01:15.639> annual<00:01:15.939> all-star<00:01:16.780> game<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.259> think

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
his third annual all-star game I think

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.800 
his third annual all-star game I think
what<00:01:17.950> we're<00:01:18.069> seeing<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.569> consumers<00:01:19.569> are

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
what we're seeing is that consumers are

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.469 
what we're seeing is that consumers are
actually<00:01:20.590> driving<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:21.219> model<00:01:21.609> that's<00:01:22.179> less

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
actually driving a model that's less

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.120 
actually driving a model that's less
passive<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.200> more<00:01:23.350> interactive<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:23.979> they're

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
passive and more interactive and they're

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.940 
passive and more interactive and they're
doing<00:01:24.399> it<00:01:24.520> simultaneously<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:26.560> Cisco<00:01:26.770> is

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
doing it simultaneously what Cisco is

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.559 
doing it simultaneously what Cisco is
going<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.369> able<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.700> do<00:01:27.850> through<00:01:28.060> our<00:01:28.240> video

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
going to be able to do through our video

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.239 
going to be able to do through our video
technology<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.380> obviously<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:29.829> our<00:01:29.950> court

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
technology and obviously to our court

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:33.209 
technology and obviously to our court
networking<00:01:30.700> technologies<00:01:31.359> is<00:01:31.539> allow<00:01:32.219> people

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
networking technologies is allow people

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.010 
networking technologies is allow people
wherever<00:01:33.429> they<00:01:33.579> are<00:01:33.700> over<00:01:34.270> any<00:01:34.450> device<00:01:34.780> and

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
wherever they are over any device and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.260 
wherever they are over any device and
over<00:01:35.289> any<00:01:35.469> network<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.520> make<00:01:36.729> that<00:01:36.880> experience

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
over any network to make that experience

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.029 
over any network to make that experience
really<00:01:37.810> interactive<00:01:38.499> so<00:01:38.649> while<00:01:38.859> they<00:01:38.979> were

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
really interactive so while they were

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.309 
really interactive so while they were
watching<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.670> game<00:01:39.819> they<00:01:40.270> may<00:01:40.450> actually<00:01:40.689> be

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
watching a game they may actually be

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.739 
watching a game they may actually be
using<00:01:41.649> some<00:01:41.799> form<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.039> social<00:01:42.369> networking
