 in next January all the new 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.860
 heavyweights must respond to the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.540
 new standard euro 6 renault trucks has 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.000
 renewed on this occasion all its range 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 dulong guti to distribute it today 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.130
 we cover the full range in euro 6 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.699
 the last born is the one who is 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.810
 behind me 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.130
 here the 2 meters of icab so that comes 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.480
 really complete the range and there we have 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.710
 really all the range we can really 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.689
 offer all types of vehicles 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.489
 really suited to every need of our 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.550
 customers we actually have 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.960
 communicate about consumption 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 improved 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.930
 up to 5% compared to the range 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.930
 former 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.970
 for their six daf was inspired by 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.149
 the experience of its American engine manufacturer 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.530
 not because this technological choice that we 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.680
 have adopted on all of our 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.229
 engines was based on the experience that 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.530
 we acquired in the United States in 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.869
 effect since 2010 25% the black docks and 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.210
 fuzzy bits are equipped with the engine 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.250
 home engine not because the engines 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.850
 developed designed and developed and 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.819
 manufactured by daf our mx indeed 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.149
 behind me we have our last 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:50.209
 developments the mx1 it's a six 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:51.920
 cylinders in line of 18 places and to 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.869
 innovations and alternatives to 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.600
 fuels like electric like this 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.700
 small vehicle called move he was moved 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.080
 exists November 2, 2009 to refine our 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.820
 four years 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.490
 this site is key to development 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.740
 of urban delivery vehicles to 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.800
 motorization the clicks so our 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.570
 technology and the electric know it 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.480
 make our customers and delivery 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.860
 urban and mx both to get to 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.540
 develop our vehicles in response to 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:26.000
 need events for editing 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.890
 2013 solutrans pays tribute to Paul 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.390
 berliet gone last year paul 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.830
 berliet who has not stopped presenting 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.810
 innovations in the heavy weight over 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.970
 years belleville sadok warriors 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.900
 ben ari his son paul 20 years of advanced 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.640
 such objective 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 when working for today 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.900
 must think about 20 years perly at such time 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.850
 once again the forerunner in 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.380
 cabin material when exiting the cabin 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.770
 from 1400 in 1970 behind so eight years to 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.580
 later on has a particular idea 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.070
 someone from marketing was called jean 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.640
 augur stone tell it on the ticket with 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.320
 a rising line 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.610
 we could have an even more cabin 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.980
 high 1 m 86 under this ceiling that allows 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.330
 which is actually on this plane there the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.330
 forerunner of all modern trucks 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.020
 innovation also means 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.390
 safe equipment and 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.890
 regulatory video trucks proposes 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.319
 on the show a whole range of products 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.750
 we illustrated a whole offer of 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.000
 service and decline its different 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.250
 products to really help the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.959
 transport in its fleet management 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.820
 so you have the tachograph all 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.890
 archiving services the services of 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.770
 fleet management the telematics part 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.239
 to prepare for the future at every 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.650
 intelligent transport we are in the 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.020
 communicating side we are in the side 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.820
 security we are on an innovative system 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.320
 cameras available to the driver 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.310
 the principle is based on a system 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.260
 four cameras 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.370
 so we see the four cameras here for 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.820
 as much on a complete picture of 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.360
 vehicle 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.760
 seen from the sky at 360 Â° that we will find on 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.290
 the screen here that actually gives one drives 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.070
 by real- time information about everything 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.070
 his driving environment
