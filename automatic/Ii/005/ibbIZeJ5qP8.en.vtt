00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.150
 We borrow money from the bank because 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.930
 We believe that the bank has the money 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.610
 and who is not 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.949
 what if that's what taught us 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.460
 was not the whole truth 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.510
 how would that affect yours? 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.150
 mortgage loan or a credit card 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.890
 from they are talking about things that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.080
 do not pose the problem 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.300
 the problem we have is one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 a defective bank system 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.279
 banking system according to the minimum reserve 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 Principle where bankers can only use money 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.429
 which they do not have the 1850 in the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 USA, this was a capital crime man 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.899
 could be hanged for it 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.879
 moment banks lend money which 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.679
 he does not have how to do that 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.989
 in a working document of the 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.870
 We find international currency funds 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.030
 following in the current system 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.679
 Banks do not wait for depositors 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.319
 to lend money 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.999
 this is a fact which in many of the 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.249
 explanations on the creation of money 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.579
 central banks' systems 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.460
 becomes 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.710
 the federal reserve bank of chicago 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.530
 Explains what they do when they borrow 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.439
 It is forgiven that they accept bills 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.229
 in exchange for a positive solution to 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.909
 the account of the borrower the bank 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.369
 of england explains in her 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.710
 awarded quarter annual report banks 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.570
 Loan by creating money 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.180
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.329
 explains in its release ipad 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.490
 Immediately commercial bank like your book 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.219
 money if you forgive a loan 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.920
 they write their books up new money 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.259
 The account of the loan is good in exchange 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.969
 against debts the federal reserve 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.950
 Bank of Dallas says in her 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.950
 to publish your banks 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.969
 Banks actually create money when 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.670
 they lend it 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:53.340
 So create the Federal Reserve Bank 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.799
 from chicago new york and dallas and the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.490
 bank of england all money if you have it 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.740
 to lend 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.319
 the former lawyer of the federal reserve 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.060
 Bank of Cleveland Explains Banks 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.460
 deposit debentures with the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.420
 intension you money deposits too 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.580
 to treat 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.770
 If banks seem to blame you as 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.900
 deposit money you have the same 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.540
 pay out the balance and balance 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.030
 to balance if the sum paid out 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.520
 the use of the loan is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.040
 then the balance sheet is balanced 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.560
 So who was the owner of the money 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.890
 which finances the loan 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.140
 the federal bank of new york iwf and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.630
 explain at least four other banks 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.780
 that your debt was the source 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.209
 if your bank is doing something like this 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.769
 You have to repay it month after month 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.989
 for month after year 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.720
 if your bank does not do the same thing 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.890
 These big banks should be your bank 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.260
 be in a position 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.959
 proof of the previous title 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.790
 property and rights to the money which 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.150
 they allegedly borrowed 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.459
 to submit and remember that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.920
 working document of iwf explains it is 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.750
 for everyone, obviously, ever money 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.209
 has lent and the resulting 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.739
 resulting book entries has made 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.380
 Mr. commissioned 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.090
 They talk about the ability of the banks 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 overcome bottlenecks 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.380
 So by their definition is one 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.940
 bottleneck when people show up and 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.880
 want their money back 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.890
 So the question is, did you borrow money 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.359
 which over years through hard 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.549
 work was earned 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.680
 or do you blame your own 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.390
 seems to have its own promise as money 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.739
 which loan in milliseconds 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.500
 was created 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.090
 to put it another way , the bank has 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.040
 who lent her money which she 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.209
 already had before you to the door 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.400
 came in 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.560
 or did they lend you money? 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.510
 they created after you go to the door 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.120
 What we actually can do in here 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.190
 have is criminal activity of 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.810
 from the bank and not one 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.769
 banker is ever in jail for this 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.410
 landed 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.959
 This is a staggering million pounds 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.209
 the control numbers have been removed 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.220
 the depositors and the obligated 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.950
 Still, not a single banker 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.000
 In prison this is a shame this 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.170
 is a shame 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.319
 we have to comply with the laws of the country 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.760
 instead of always just regulating and 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.160
 Becoming a money printer is one of them 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.650
 Conscious the central banks are the same 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.320
 Guilty I would like some 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.320
 See central banks in prison and me 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.450
 in a quantitative easing 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.790
 Counterfeit money printing is illegal 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.130
 if a private individual do that 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.169
 He would go to prison 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.600
 So let's examine ours 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.820
 own heart the very uncomfortable 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.090
 relations politicians bureaucrats 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.870
 and the central bankers have each other 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.830
 discharged on the back of the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.260
 taxpayer 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.260
 let's end this, now
