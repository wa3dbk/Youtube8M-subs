those of you that I'm aware of cx1 run

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:03.710 
those of you that I'm aware of cx1 run
basically<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.450> single<00:01:55.110> ring<00:01:55.350> at<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.160> front<00:02:02.720> see

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
basically a single ring at the front see

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.920 
basically a single ring at the front see
the<00:02:03.840> rear<00:02:04.050> D<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.070> carrying<00:02:05.490> some

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
the rear D right here carrying some

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:14.030 
the rear D right here carrying some
there's<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> cap<00:02:07.170> pulling<00:02:07.560> full<00:02:07.860> mud<00:02:12.950> then<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
there's a cap pulling full mud then the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.320 
there's a cap pulling full mud then the
rear<00:02:14.190> derailleur<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.970> well<00:02:15.950> on<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.330> CX

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
rear derailleur as well on with the CX

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.230 
rear derailleur as well on with the CX
one<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.690> well<00:02:19.490> it's<00:02:20.490> actually<00:02:21.030> slightly

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
one as well it's actually slightly

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.350 
one as well it's actually slightly
heavier<00:02:21.660> than<00:02:21.900> than<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.530> regular<00:02:22.709> force<00:02:23.360> derail

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
heavier than than a regular force derail

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.690 
heavier than than a regular force derail
yeah<00:02:24.570> but<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:25.080> has<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> clever<00:02:26.100> clutch<00:02:26.400> system

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
yeah but it's has a clever clutch system

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.970 
yeah but it's has a clever clutch system
in<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.120> which<00:02:27.330> keeps<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.050> tension<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
in it which keeps the tension on the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.540 
in it which keeps the tension on the
chain<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.670> avoid<00:02:30.120> change<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:35.250> gonna<00:02:35.370> be

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
chain to avoid change so I'm gonna be

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.729 
chain to avoid change so I'm gonna be
running<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.880> 40<00:02:36.239> tooth<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:36.959> most<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.320> time<00:02:37.500> on

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
running a 40 tooth for most of time on

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.820 
running a 40 tooth for most of time on
the<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.790> then<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.239> rear<00:02:42.420> running<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.440> PG

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the and then on the rear running a PG

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.270 
the and then on the rear running a PG
and<00:02:44.209> 1070<00:02:45.209> cassette<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.260> actually<00:02:46.530> at<00:02:46.620> 11:32

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
and 1070 cassette but actually at 11:32

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.940 
and 1070 cassette but actually at 11:32
I'm<00:02:48.269> pretty<00:02:48.540> pleased<00:02:48.780> with<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.080> 1070<00:02:49.739> it's

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
I'm pretty pleased with the 1070 it's

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.190 
I'm pretty pleased with the 1070 it's
got<00:02:50.100> quite<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.310> bit<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.780> quite<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> few<00:02:51.870> holes

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
got quite a bit of quite a few holes

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.460 
got quite a bit of quite a few holes
from<00:02:52.350> my<00:02:52.530> clearance<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:54.290> even<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
from my clearance and even on the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.140 
from my clearance and even on the
muddiest<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:56.010> races<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.519> hasn't<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:56.910> been

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
muddiest of races it hasn't really been

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:10.130 
muddiest of races it hasn't really been
a<00:02:57.480> cause<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.110> an<00:02:58.320> issue<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.890> issue<00:03:09.140> cable

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
a cause of an issue of the issue cable

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.540 
a cause of an issue of the issue cable
to<00:03:10.410> hydraulic<00:03:11.300> disc<00:03:12.300> brake<00:03:12.570> system<00:03:13.550> which

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
to hydraulic disc brake system which

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.640 
to hydraulic disc brake system which
from<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.480> route<00:03:15.690> reviews<00:03:16.050> I've<00:03:16.200> read<00:03:16.470> is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
from the route reviews I've read is

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.310 
from the route reviews I've read is
supposed<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:16.950> be<00:03:17.070> excellent

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
supposed to be excellent

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.259 
supposed to be excellent
so<00:03:19.320> obviously<00:03:19.950> build<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.700> bike<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.150> then

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
so obviously build the bike and then

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:30.550 
so obviously build the bike and then
test<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:23.300> and<00:03:24.300> then<00:03:24.600> four<00:03:24.989> tires

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.410 

we're<00:03:31.560> going<00:03:31.829> with<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:33.019> FMB<00:03:34.019> super<00:03:34.980> mods

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
we're going with the FMB super mods

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.649 
we're going with the FMB super mods
which<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:37.200> should<00:03:37.700> relatively<00:03:38.700> new<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.299> wish

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
which we should relatively new I wish

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.080 
which we should relatively new I wish
you<00:03:39.750> can<00:03:39.840> see<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.349> knobs<00:03:41.250> are<00:03:41.400> pretty

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
you can see that the knobs are pretty

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.149 
you can see that the knobs are pretty
raised<00:03:42.470> certainly<00:03:43.470> if<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.590> run<00:03:43.769> your<00:03:43.920> hand

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
raised certainly if you run your hand

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.979 
raised certainly if you run your hand
over<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.549> there's<00:03:44.879> a<00:03:44.939> huge<00:03:45.359> amount<00:03:45.569> of<00:03:45.689> grip

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
over it there's a huge amount of grip

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.960 
over it there's a huge amount of grip
and<00:03:48.530> yeah<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:49.739> we'll<00:03:49.920> let<00:03:50.159> me<00:03:50.280> show<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.700> show
