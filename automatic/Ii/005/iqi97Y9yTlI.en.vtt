00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.370
 that meets with the extra shot of Menzel a small sausage and is 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.019
 Accordingly, the duel went mostly into the Taliban 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.219
 Of course we take the responsibility in the process of recovering again 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.999
 shown 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:18.470
 I understand 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.909
 and what has happened has happened 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.909
 this prophecy did not come unexpected 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.179
 b 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.800
 the EBIT is 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.159
 if they are going really well 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.550
 the 80 places their tip is they bring their complaints 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.100
 I'm a little angry 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.770
 last year 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.400
 or something happened 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.129
 perfect is fine 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.129
 the most important thing 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.020
 of course, talk 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.250
 it's bizarrely easy Tim k 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 "No, that's completely impossible 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.740
 and I know what I'm talking about 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.979
 regardless of that, the prophecy was far too late anyway 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.930
 no one can do something 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 do 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.690
 what did you do to her? 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.170
 I would see her immediately 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.210
 who remained peaceful 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 that is made this decision 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.490
 so shame is brought on me and the whole planet luck 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.150
 Then so be it 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
 that does not mean anything to me but it means something 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.479
 important for the ratio 10 to 1 7 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.720
 she is no longer in this world 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.700
 what do you mean by that? 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.740
 that's the price I pay 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.810
 who are like their fate to sit like that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 SID 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.680
 that must not be 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.110
 One day it is to understand 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 they are not made for us 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.489
 okay we have to heart several witnesses for HarmoS this diminishes 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.489
 not in this world points would be percent 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.819
 it should not be now 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.790
 but nothing Oldendorf if you can hold the game you can not do that again 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.180
 Belonging to the lucky bag of products we have something good 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:35.870
 if you all look happy to die Dutt of course then you get yes 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:39.859
 not the same way Meffert - both to convince to concepts knew 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.819
 but I want that now I'm overjoyed 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.819
 he demands Burghof 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.609
 with the help of Prof so DW and you can not leave exactly this way 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.409
 Children learned already playful 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.409
 Today, as we show, we will do more 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.419
 only for more wages 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.969
 the clock is lying Euro Plus 2 2 percent would become too 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.179
 Grosskreutz advertised so funny design 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.419
 rush 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:22.679
 Hopsten 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:26.029
 more it will take a look at it 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.830
 Copenhagen 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.940
 in the shot put and thereby would 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.840
 Change will fall silent and we will leave that for three 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:39.000
 to recognize in this belongs 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.280
 then the young Christians who then become the big goal would be 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.550
 the product as soloist percent will be to shorten the military service will 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.499
 what should we do 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.429
 Uwe Carstens led to goals 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:53.269
 can 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.790
 this value is or could destroy Dusseldorf knelt to defeat 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.110
 activated summoned but for that we need the Greeks do what they do 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.939
 according to that, they are allowed to abort 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.939
 this is a very difficult problem 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.879
 APA 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.349
 Look at an old man 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.700
 Holger Thiemann Co 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.420
 we'll be out of something 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.280
 the nation 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.539
 what are you doing to me 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.110
 Euro flow 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.340
 the title-triple 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.460
 Let's take a look here 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.779
 now he was ranked fourth 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.719
 that's serious 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.080
 Dr 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 Speaker in Frankfurt 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.009
 Wait a minute, let's kill him like Sal 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.560
 But what should that be but for us the subway is out 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.309
 Claudio ob is Europe for Europe 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.169
 quite simply they actually wanted to be in the next low blow 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.889
 Recently, players played the club should be happy because he was away from the children 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.080
 pretty much the Necromorphs UniCredit 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.080
 Goldsource court also not what is there yes 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.169
 that can not Achim Klein 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.960
 also were the next wave Innsbruck with that of March did not place
