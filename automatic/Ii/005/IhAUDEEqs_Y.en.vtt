 lead time of 50 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.420
 08 was the page where 49 like me 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.750
 had made the participants rule not 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.430
 have a reasonable time for the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.760
 dispatcher that is what makes the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.849
 thief leaves the sick 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.200

 exceptional in dance in fragile can 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.060
 say that it was tragic and helped 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.670
 very well henrique made the test nice 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.920

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.760
 cultural fish did not get in by df 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.310

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.329

 I think it did not come to a halt either. 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.110
 so tired but certainly possible 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.600
 print a stronger pace level 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.130
 speed and finished 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.320
 with the fourth place but only 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.280
 henrique rodrigues he spent some time in the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.930
 the end of 1 5420 and worsened in 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.250
 elimination, right? 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.820
 he had stayed below and 54 in the race 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.400
 5396 in pain to 1 5420 but even if he 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.710
 record the time of 53 96 there the time of 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.290
 henrique rodrigues fourth place for 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.580

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.110
 henrique rodrigues 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.670
 instead of improving the time of 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.040
 qualifying rounds and a 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.030
 and it was fatal for him to lose 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.030
 this place
