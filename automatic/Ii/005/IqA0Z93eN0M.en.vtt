00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.880
 Tell you guys, and firmness. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.880
 Lucas is here and you 're sure 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.609
 but nobody could gta 4 and another part 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.039
 here in the multiplayer of a I was playfield 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.599
 what would be the beginning is not much 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.890
 animated here of the video but what more to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.300
 forward could only see a little more 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.230
 shooting or attempting to overthrow 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.460
 helicopter and things like that and I thought 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.559
 this video that explains some things 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 about the channel on some future 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.730
 ideas here and it's basically what I 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.350
 I had to talk without anything very much 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.390
 especially if you can talk first 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.670
 first of all explaining something that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.129
 I do not know if you saw in the last video 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 is not everyone who saw there a part 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.750
 whether or not the staff understood the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.079
 people do not understand why but let's go 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.120
 over there 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 in the last video was black ops with a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.890
 part that gave birth would that equals the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.420
 first set the settler nishi o vandrÃ© pe 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.659
 those people created that father to 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.000
 play black ops is called to stop them 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.570
 then we speak was playing I saw 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.130
 not wine but me thales and carlos 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.590
 was playing we play normally 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 together and we started playing the cup 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.549
 because it 's so much better that I w3 nerd 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.320
 the system is much better known 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.500
 do not stress we ask say 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.570
 w3 then we started playing black ops and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.049
 People said let's create a wall 23 and 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.490
 then the case of the idea then participate 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.680
 now because they have always seen the video that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 The part that gave birth speaks because it is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.000
 playing with the team and Carlos 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 so it's explained and people who do not 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.869
 understood the reason for the title 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.360
 something else I said about the channel 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.619
 secondary I created it will be in the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.149
 description is called mcd and o2 and i know 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.310
 who is very creative is sheltered ii 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.380
 But that's it, that's it. 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.630
 I'll post random videos there 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.130
 probably install a little bit today 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.719
 This video was later being 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.490
 eight o'clock at night 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.009
 and hey it's been another 9 and 10 hours 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.200
 so you'll be very close to each other 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.489
 so it will come out and I'll explain a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.990
 little better than what is happening here 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.700
 channel 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.400
 Um, and you, we like video there, of course. 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.950
 Bad on the axn channel, they 'll enjoy it. I'll put it on. 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.780
 the bgn and such I'll take a right 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.610
 and I'll explain a little better in the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.060
 video on video second video today 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:41.220
 here will be no night that channel 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:43.350
 player actually asking me to buy 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.850
 the father in life 15 seconds I suffered 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.250
 So hot, but he had not told 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.230
 buy the beautiful the end of three 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.450
 so I went there with that line in the store 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.450
 buy battlefield 3 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.620
 What happens I get there at the store, right? 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.870
 It was actually in the gaming world. 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.510
 that a shop mouth the game and was a partner 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.430
 And then I went there to see a purchase. 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.830
 exchange there because they accept game exchange 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.420
 if you give so many games while 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.930
 and I was going to take three games that I did not 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.350
 I used to play there for the beautiful movie 31 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.210
 metal gear solid metal gear solid 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.700
 collection rw connection is something 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.440
 so I was going to get one of the two then 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.540
 I got there in the store I decided to do will 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.090
 stay 10 because the personal game at night and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.340
 Pause, I got there in the store. 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 It's closed so I'll see if I can 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.180
 I get back on Friday that the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.400
 single disc time that is close to home 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.060
 Until then I will spend the Friday mass 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.990
 perhaps in the afternoon a group of 30 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.550
 the account may not want to but you never 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.530

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.120

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.420
 along bf 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.340

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.370
 bf but I was convinced by Carlos the team 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.290
 convinced the day because of the daniel k 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.690
 I look at the crowd and convince 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.340
 the game is very good so give up I will 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.280
 pick up the game and I'll trade five games 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.980
 that I do not use what makes it worth it 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.500
 and maybe even videos of metal gear solid 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.049

 I'm very short I play metal gear 4 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.950
