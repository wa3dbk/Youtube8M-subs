00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.170 
I think one of the most important things
though<00:00:49.510> is<00:00:49.720> audio<00:00:50.140> because<00:00:50.860> if<00:00:51.370> people<00:00:51.610> are

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
though is audio because if people are

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.400 
though is audio because if people are
watching<00:00:52.570> this<00:00:52.630> video<00:00:52.840> and<00:00:52.870> they<00:00:52.990> can't<00:00:53.170> hear

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
you it's super frustrating because a lot

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.880 
you it's super frustrating because a lot
of<00:00:55.270> people<00:00:55.360> are<00:00:55.630> listening<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:56.560> this<00:00:56.680> stuff

most important and I think you can take
that<00:02:16.630> into<00:02:16.840> anything<00:02:17.049> you<00:02:17.410> know<00:02:17.799> for<00:02:18.160> making

that into anything you know for making

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.640 
that into anything you know for making
YouTube<00:02:18.790> videos<00:02:18.900> not<00:02:19.900> necessarily<00:02:20.320> are<00:02:20.560> they

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
YouTube videos not necessarily are they

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
YouTube videos not necessarily are they
customers<00:02:21.070> but<00:02:21.250> they're<00:02:21.370> their<00:02:21.489> viewers<00:02:21.850> and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150
