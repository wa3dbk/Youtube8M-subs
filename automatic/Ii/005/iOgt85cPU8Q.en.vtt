I<00:00:15.770> think<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> future<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.670> health<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
I think in the future in health and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.939 
I think in the future in health and
medicine<00:00:18.380> there's<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.650> many<00:00:19.770> new

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
medicine there's so many new

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.800 
medicine there's so many new
technologies<00:00:20.250> they're<00:00:21.180> getting<00:00:21.360> faster

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
technologies they're getting faster

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.929 
technologies they're getting faster
cheaper<00:00:22.079> more<00:00:22.380> powerful<00:00:22.860> they're<00:00:23.340> converging

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
cheaper more powerful they're converging

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.220 
cheaper more powerful they're converging
to<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.119> point<00:00:24.360> where<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.660> can<00:00:24.840> mash<00:00:25.199> them

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
to a point where we can mash them

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.339 
to a point where we can mash them
together<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.279> powerful<00:00:26.730> ways<00:00:27.289> it's<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
together in really powerful ways it's a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.839 
together in really powerful ways it's a
really<00:00:28.529> exciting<00:00:28.769> era<00:00:29.070> there's<00:00:29.490> lots<00:00:29.759> of

really exciting era there's lots of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.009 
really exciting era there's lots of
opportunity<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.420> innovation<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
opportunity for innovation and

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:39.890 
opportunity for innovation and

physician scientist entrepreneur looking
to<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.290> future<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.650> thought<00:00:43.949> you<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.220> what

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to the future I thought you know what

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.220 
to the future I thought you know what
better<00:00:44.789> way<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:45.870> think<00:00:46.140> about

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
better way to do that then think about

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
better way to do that then think about
the<00:00:46.559> world<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.100> my<00:00:47.550> son<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.149> my<00:00:48.480> daughter

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the world that my son and my daughter

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.779 
the world that my son and my daughter
are<00:00:48.870> gonna<00:00:48.989> grow<00:00:49.469> into<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.699> know

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
are gonna grow into which is you know

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.660 
are gonna grow into which is you know
changing<00:00:51.180> really<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.539> fast<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.520> our

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
changing really really fast you know our

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.119 
changing really really fast you know our
traditional<00:00:54.239> model<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.020> think<00:00:55.230> our<00:00:55.320> meme<00:00:55.620> for

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
traditional model I think our meme for

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
traditional model I think our meme for
the<00:00:56.850> way<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.059> practiced<00:00:57.480> healthcare<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the way we practiced healthcare is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.420 
the way we practiced healthcare is
actually<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:58.590> healthcare<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.070> been<00:00:59.190> sick

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
actually not healthcare it's been sick

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
actually not healthcare it's been sick
care<00:00:59.699> we<00:01:00.239> wait<00:01:00.539> until<00:01:00.750> often<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.859> sick<00:01:02.100> we

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
care we wait until often we get sick we

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.560 
care we wait until often we get sick we
have<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.399> heart<00:01:02.550> attack<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> stroke<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
have the heart attack the stroke the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.600 
have the heart attack the stroke the
cancer<00:01:03.929> that<00:01:04.080> pops<00:01:04.289> up<00:01:04.500> where<00:01:05.309> things<00:01:05.489> are

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
cancer that pops up where things are

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.370 
cancer that pops up where things are
sort<00:01:05.789> of<00:01:05.850> heading<00:01:06.179> I<00:01:06.300> believe<00:01:06.660> is<00:01:06.869> from

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
sort of heading I believe is from

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.020 
sort of heading I believe is from
waiting<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:07.979> disease<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> happen<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
waiting for disease to happen to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.389 
waiting for disease to happen to
wellness<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.780> prevention<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.350> 50<00:01:11.070> years<00:01:11.250> from

wellness and prevention in 50 years from

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.190 
wellness and prevention in 50 years from
now<00:01:11.640> we'll<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.539> equivalent<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.050> almost

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
now we'll have the equivalent of almost

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
now we'll have the equivalent of almost
