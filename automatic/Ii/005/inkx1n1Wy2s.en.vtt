the end and you can see thats not a
charge<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:02.309> terms<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.140> battery<00:01:04.250> capacity

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
charge in terms of the battery capacity

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
charge in terms of the battery capacity
it's<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:07.369> 1900<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> will<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:10.080> extra
