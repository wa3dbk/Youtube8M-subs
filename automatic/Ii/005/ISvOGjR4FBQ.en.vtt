00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.959 
it because the expense is so large I'll
be<00:05:01.800> buying<00:05:01.979> things<00:05:02.279> from<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.580> festival<00:05:02.729> and

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
be buying things from the festival and

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.390 
be buying things from the festival and
then<00:05:03.120> also<00:05:03.300> do<00:05:03.719> you<00:05:03.840> guys<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.469> like<00:05:04.650> ending<00:05:05.279> new

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
then also do you guys so like ending new

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.369 
then also do you guys so like ending new
tapes<00:05:05.669> or<00:05:05.939> like<00:05:06.120> if<00:05:06.300> they<00:05:06.449> have<00:05:06.479> exclusive

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
tapes or like if they have exclusive

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.990 
tapes or like if they have exclusive
things<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.800> best<00:05:07.949> we'll<00:05:08.159> all<00:05:08.310> try<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.639> pick<00:05:08.849> up

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
things the best we'll all try to pick up

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.640 
things the best we'll all try to pick up
a<00:05:09.029> few<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.509> then<00:05:09.689> they<00:05:09.960> sell<00:05:10.199> them<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.560> you

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
a few and then they sell them to you

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.050 
a few and then they sell them to you
guys<00:05:10.800> but<00:05:11.039> so<00:05:11.189> what<00:05:11.279> I'll<00:05:11.400> probably<00:05:11.430> do<00:05:11.819> is

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
guys but so what I'll probably do is

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.209 
guys but so what I'll probably do is
film<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.689> video<00:05:12.870> Friday<00:05:13.379> what<00:05:13.680> they<00:05:13.800> have<00:05:13.979> and

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
film a video Friday what they have and

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.089 
film a video Friday what they have and
then<00:05:14.370> let<00:05:14.789> us<00:05:15.000> order<00:05:15.419> with<00:05:15.629> paypal<00:05:16.439> Friday

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
then let us order with paypal Friday

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.730 
then let us order with paypal Friday
night<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.610> like<00:05:17.759> Saturday<00:05:18.439> afternoon<00:05:19.439> and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
night and like Saturday afternoon and

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.980 
night and like Saturday afternoon and
then<00:05:20.219> buy<00:05:20.699> the<00:05:20.759> products<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.330> people<00:05:21.599> ordered

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
then buy the products of people ordered

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.749 
then buy the products of people ordered
and<00:05:22.199> then<00:05:22.349> those<00:05:22.500> people<00:05:22.529> will<00:05:22.889> be<00:05:23.009> guaranteed

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
and then those people will be guaranteed

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.429 
and then those people will be guaranteed
they<00:05:24.000> get<00:05:24.150> what<00:05:24.270> they<00:05:24.389> ordered<00:05:24.719> and<00:05:24.900> then<00:05:25.139> I'll

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
they get what they ordered and then I'll

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.529 
they get what they ordered and then I'll
course<00:05:25.949> I'll<00:05:26.099> buy<00:05:26.219> a<00:05:26.250> few<00:05:26.580> extra<00:05:26.789> stuff<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.389> can

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
course I'll buy a few extra stuff I can

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:28.760 
course I'll buy a few extra stuff I can
probably<00:05:27.810> sell<00:05:28.139> those<00:05:28.319> but<00:05:28.560> they'll<00:05:28.740> probably

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
probably sell those but they'll probably

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.550 
probably sell those but they'll probably
be<00:05:29.099> at<00:05:29.190> a<00:05:29.219> higher<00:05:29.490> price<00:05:29.909> so<00:05:30.629> make<00:05:30.930> sure<00:05:30.960> you

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
be at a higher price so make sure you

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.290 
be at a higher price so make sure you
have<00:05:31.740> money<00:05:31.949> in<00:05:32.190> paypal<00:05:32.580> if<00:05:33.000> you'd<00:05:33.210> be

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
have money in paypal if you'd be

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.240 
have money in paypal if you'd be
interested<00:05:33.330> in<00:05:33.990> buying<00:05:34.050> some<00:05:34.560> links<00:05:35.009> from<00:05:35.129> the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
interested in buying some links from the

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.459 
interested in buying some links from the
festival<00:05:35.699> so<00:05:35.940> I<00:05:35.969> think<00:05:36.089> that<00:05:36.449> is<00:05:36.839> it<00:05:37.080> for<00:05:37.139> this

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469

festival so I think that is it for this
video<00:05:37.680> if<00:05:38.039> I<00:05:38.129> missed<00:05:38.460> anything<00:05:38.610> just<00:05:39.509> be<00:05:39.629> sure
