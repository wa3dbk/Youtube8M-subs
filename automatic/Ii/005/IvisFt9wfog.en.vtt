00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone made another object also 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.059
 some appeared in my work 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:16.049
 innovation let's see it 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:21.380
 conclusions to the kitchen here will be washing and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:26.210
 dishwasher washing and filter 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.539
 Now about the innovation, I switched to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:36.540
 metal sleeves metal 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:39.000
 cartridges are more reliable rehau switched from 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.270
 metal sleeves for plastic 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 only for the sake of saving 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.700
 unfortunately bad statistics went 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 liner 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 plastic liner began to burst I already 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 I know a few people who have it 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.329
 happened i happened it personally 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.629
 so make a choice 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.640
 metal side is a proven solution 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.280
 just the same with metal sleeves 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.479
 rehovota and conquered its market 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.909
 reliability so now let's move on 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.920
 directly to the note entry node 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.920
 hygienic shower 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 installation 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.730
 so the water knot turned out 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.610
 bottom left collectors top left 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.670
 bundle filter reducer with reverse 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.670
 flushing 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:52.400
 counters and module for hygienic 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.880
 the soul is a thermostat which is located 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.320
 in the sanitary closet will be out 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.119
 just go out watering here you see 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:08.770
 the output will hang gummy nothing else 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.770
 shutdown will occur from light 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.110
 can consider in more detail 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.560
 some will immediately notice no 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.810
 check valves in this 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.040
 thermostatic mixer reverse 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.410
 valve and built in american 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.430
 there was almost no such 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 devices I saw this model on 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.500
 Aquaterm exhibition there talked with 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.830
 Representatives officer riga monty 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.959
 and they said yes if there is 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.940
 buyers for this model 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.269
 thermostatic mixer we her 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.030
 carry so now in the official 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.739
 companies in the official representation 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.640
 there are such thermostatic mixers i 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.430
 I think they will not occupy their niche at all 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.590
 cool solution compact more compact 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.420
 it turns out there are not those healthy inverse 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.910
 valves with precisely small diameter 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.350
 check valve will allow 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.060
 thermostatic faucets better 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.579
 I had various experiences to work 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.350
 Suppose if you put 3 quarter 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.790
 check valve then thermostatic 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.310
 mixer and generally stops working 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.110
 perform its function if turned on 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.110
 some other consumer 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:44.190
 so here on some probably right away 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:49.080
 noticed who experienced for others 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.060
 I'll show you noticed before that american 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.520
 points they are slightly different from 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.110
 standard this 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.640
 American Jentar they go under the euro 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.880
 cone 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.880
 three quarters 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:17.709
 here is the euroconus solution 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.970
 definitely safer than standard 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.660
 rehau coupling nuts first these nuts 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.660
 turned 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.289
 and secondly the eurocone is originally 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:43.099
 disconnection is much more reliable than 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:48.590
 flat seal now let's go 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:50.690
 directly into the bathroom immediately rushes 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.449
 eyes long trail here dams 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.509
 dryer due to what i was doing 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:00.740
 lateral connection 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:01.599
 did the right pipe towel slopes 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.699
 dryer 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.099
 warming up just fine despite the 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:11.990
 that he is at the farthest 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:19.069
 the wall of the bathroom here is thermostatic 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:22.930
 mixer open a conclusion under spout 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:26.770
 hand shower there will be a bar and a customer 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.310
 wished to place the bar in the middle 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.259
 thermostatic mixer place 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:37.509
 to the right 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.509
 this route to the shells 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.780
 Well, that kind of object turned out hope 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.570
 the information in this video was for you 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.180
 useful even for a moment want 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:02.160
 restrain installation here can 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.440
 see that I installed it not only on 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.090
 hairpin 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:14.600
 but also in thrust walls the decision is very 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:17.430
 reliable worth just instantly 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.160
 below the installation of technological 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:25.880
 holes 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.880
 which is in the slab between the floors 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:34.259
 to properly place the installation 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.030
 I had to take a square pipe and already 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.030
 installation put directly on 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.860
 it will be fine too, I think the bill and 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.460
 yes here produce further finishing 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.460
 jobs fall here with mortar 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:52.250
 some will be generally excellent though 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.250
 already worth it more than reliably
