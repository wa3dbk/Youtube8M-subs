00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.840
 and 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.110
 hello dear friends today with 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.150
 you i'm alexey gordeyev national trainer 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.369
 fitness and my assistant Dmitry frolov 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.860
 champion open cup narrow area 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.020
 classic bodybuilding today we 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.629
 You will consider the most basic exercise. 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 in bodybuilding this is squatting with a barbell 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.530
 with free weight 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.820
 consider the different variations of this 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.820
 exercises 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.750
 so dmitry perform squats with 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.750
 bar with an average staging feet 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.259
 important points is the lumbar deflection 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.009
 parallel setting of legs slightly 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.720
 no side and direction 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.080
 knee above foot level i.e. 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.020
 tell me the direction 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.869
 sit down to parallel with the floor 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.490
 smoothly sitting down stretch the thigh 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.380
 inhale 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.100
 raise going up make a choice 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.100
 at the top. 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.830
 the next option is settling this meeting 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.280
 wide setting of the legs i.e. three myself 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.890
 the sum of these it shakes allows 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.720
 the most severely stretch the buttock and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.720
 stretch the inner thigh 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.409
 Again, I will answer why exercise 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.780
 squats 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.390
 is it important is 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.770
 the most basic bodybuilding exercise 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.600
 precisely because it is an exercise 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.610
 increases blood circulation in the pelvis 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.289
 thereby stimulates secretion 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.500
 testosterone that is increases 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.420
 endogenous testosterone production that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.060
 allows you to achieve the maximum 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.970
 maximum success increase total 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.310
 body mass very often beginners 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.310
 ignore this exercise is very vain 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.709
 we will look further 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.280
 doing squats with narrow 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.280
 staging legs 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.190
 its meaning is that we allow 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.380
 load as much as possible external 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.650
 the part on the triceps is exactly the bottom not 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.770
 external part to the address and also works 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.090
 outer buttock 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.780
 Work with the inner surface of the femur 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.780
 this is minimal 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.720
 so doing the exercise we will reverse 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.970
 attention that the knees look at us by 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.300
 to sending us to we sit down 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:02.490
 floor parallels lowest point will land 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.490
 we breathe the top point were 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.310
 not the final option for yourself 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.120
 some we will look at it today 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.120
 chest squat 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.590
 this preset so popular that good 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.570
 so that it loads as well as possible 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.410
 quadriceps and minimizes the load on 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.900
 share on 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.210
 gluteus muscle that is anyone 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.690
 dominated buttocks tell big 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.130
 butt and little legs are not small 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.410
 especially the lower thigh 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.410
 I recommend doing just such gave 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.130
 we also sit down to the pillow knee parallel 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.470
 are looking us towards heels not 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.770
 tearing off your heels are the most important 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.090
 points of support in this exercise 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:02.190
 women do not injure the ankle 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:05.230
 joint subscribe to channel i am training 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.610
 put likes and play sports for 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.610
