probably<00:00:24.600> could've<00:00:24.990> had<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.109> few<00:00:25.350> more<00:00:25.470> assists

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
probably could've had a few more assists

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.920 
probably could've had a few more assists
but<00:00:25.949> overall<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.670> wasn't<00:00:27.119> crossing<00:00:27.599> too<00:00:27.779> much

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
but overall I wasn't crossing too much

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
but overall I wasn't crossing too much
with<00:00:28.080> meez<00:00:28.260> crossing<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:28.740> good<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
with meez crossing was good but as you

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.070

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.940 
I didn't explain it start probably
could've<00:02:32.989> had<00:02:33.019> more<00:02:33.230> assists<00:02:33.530> but<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.739> wasn't

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
could've had more assists but I wasn't

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.470 
could've had more assists but I wasn't
really<00:02:34.219> crossing<00:02:34.519> with<00:02:34.639> him<00:02:34.730> too<00:02:34.909> much<00:02:35.090> but

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
really crossing with him too much but

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.119 
really crossing with him too much but
he's<00:02:35.599> crossing<00:02:35.840> was<00:02:36.170> decent<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.889> he's

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
he's crossing was decent and he's

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.319 
he's crossing was decent and he's
dribbling<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.700> feel<00:02:37.819> like<00:02:37.909> a<00:02:37.969> big<00:02:38.180> upgrade

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
dribbling just feel like a big upgrade

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.569 
dribbling just feel like a big upgrade
from<00:02:38.900> his<00:02:39.109> normal<00:02:39.260> card<00:02:39.530> negatives<00:02:39.950> me<00:02:40.129> what's

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
from his normal card negatives me what's

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.000 
from his normal card negatives me what's
his<00:02:40.790> position<00:02:41.019> it's<00:02:42.019> sometimes<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:42.709> wasn't

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
his position it's sometimes this wasn't

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.809 
his position it's sometimes this wasn't
in<00:02:43.099> right<00:02:43.219> position<00:02:43.489> which<00:02:43.609> is<00:02:43.669> a<00:02:43.700> bit

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
in right position which is a bit

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.099 
in right position which is a bit
frustrating<00:02:44.239> but<00:02:44.299> as<00:02:44.389> I<00:02:44.480> said<00:02:44.629> he<00:02:44.750> did<00:02:44.930> make<00:02:45.079> it

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
frustrating but as I said he did make it

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.330 
frustrating but as I said he did make it
up<00:02:45.349> of<00:02:45.469> his<00:02:45.590> peace<00:02:45.799> with<00:02:45.829> his<00:02:46.099> strength

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
up of his peace with his strength

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.920 
up of his peace with his strength
getting<00:02:46.639> back<00:02:46.819> up<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.060> field<00:02:47.269> once<00:02:47.719> he<00:02:47.780> did

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
getting back up the field once he did

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.599 
getting back up the field once he did
have<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.139> ball<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.530> also<00:02:49.040> his<00:02:49.159> balance<00:02:49.430> did

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
have the ball and also his balance did

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.220 
have the ball and also his balance did
let<00:02:49.760> him<00:02:49.790> down<00:02:49.879> although<00:02:50.629> he's<00:02:50.750> pretty<00:02:50.959> strong

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
let him down although he's pretty strong

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.689 
let him down although he's pretty strong
on<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.379> ball<00:02:51.560> when<00:02:51.680> he<00:02:51.769> did<00:02:51.919> get<00:02:52.400> shoved

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:52.699 
on the ball when he did get shoved

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.550 
on the ball when he did get shoved
around<00:02:52.939> too<00:02:53.269> much<00:02:53.419> he<00:02:53.870> did<00:02:54.079> hit<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.379> deck

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
around too much he did hit the deck

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.110 
around too much he did hit the deck
which<00:02:54.709> is<00:02:54.739> a<00:02:54.859> bit<00:02:54.980> no<00:02:55.129> I'm<00:02:55.189> overall<00:02:55.579> very<00:02:56.000> good

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
which is a bit no I'm overall very good

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.089
