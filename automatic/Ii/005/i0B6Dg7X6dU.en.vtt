00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.810 

not<00:02:16.150> bad<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.950> believe<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
not bad and I believe this is the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.520 
not bad and I believe this is the
charger<00:02:20.430> very<00:02:21.430> interesting<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:23.320> apparently

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
charger very interesting so apparently

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.390 
charger very interesting so apparently
how<00:02:26.530> does<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:27.010> work<00:02:31.290> okay<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.040> is

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
how does this work okay there it is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.300 
how does this work okay there it is
I<00:02:33.430> believe<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.570> USB<00:02:35.050> cable<00:02:35.560> goes<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.040> there

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
I believe the USB cable goes in there

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.020 
I believe the USB cable goes in there
and<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:41.130> believe<00:02:42.130> that's<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.550> external

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
and I believe that's the external

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.870 
and I believe that's the external
charger<00:02:45.210> extra<00:02:46.210> ear<00:02:46.450> tip<00:02:47.340> I'll<00:02:48.340> get<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.790> the
