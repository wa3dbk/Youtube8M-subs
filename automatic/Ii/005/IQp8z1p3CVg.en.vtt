00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.960
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.420
 xia is the theme of this time 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.210
 I would like to work on this 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.320
 About the back drive tips from the apse to the apse 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.060
 If you would like to see this video you would like to introduce 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.060
 If you are sticking the back with a pen though 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.330
 It is when it is lowered next time 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 How to deal with being lowered If you want to know how to return a ball 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.450
 How to make a surge when it is lowered last 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.140
 For those who want to know 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.780
 Master this technology that you would like to see 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.070
 Though it is point or trick 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.940
 The first thing is that let's strike with the right foot axis 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.731
 Backhand centered on the right foot 

00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:04.219
 First of all, let's shake it. 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:10.279
 Next is the second one, but it is more than just the front 

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:16.170
 I'm half-handed so I'm right-handed 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.009
 If you hit the body to the left slightly 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.560
 It is easy to enter the apse drive and this is a video 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.369
 I'm doing but after jumping 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.560
 It is easy to do backhand 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.599
 Finally it is the third one 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.749
 It is an image like hitting a bending drive 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:42.450
 It is good to hit straight though 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 I already turned half 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.749
 It means that I hit it while bending a little 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.279
 Then the deformation probability itself 

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.829
 After all it is high and when it comes back 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.399
 It is easy to come back once more 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.679
 The next play will be easier if you play videos 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:03:05.249
 Please watch 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.030
 Yes How was the video 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.640
 After all if it is a pen folder, the frequency of shaking the fore 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.260
 When it comes to more and more, it's time to move and strike 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.299
 Just by all means 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.290
 When there was a big jump, there was 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.970
 The rest is going down a little 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.621
 I will never do it 

00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:28.901
 At that time put this back side 

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:34.389
 A few cars in the back part 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.340
 If you have the skill to shake, 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.999
 It is blocked to the other party at a stretch again and advantageous development 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.319
 The other party is only blocked again 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.731
 What does this mean to attack? 

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:50.560
 I can make it, so by all means 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.459
 Please refer to the back drive as a reference
