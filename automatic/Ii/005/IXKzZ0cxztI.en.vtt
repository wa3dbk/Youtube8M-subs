00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
force fields and can protect a chunk

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.690 
force fields and can protect a chunk
with<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.860> now<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.010> don't<00:05:08.220> have<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.370> be<00:05:08.460> able<00:05:08.640> to

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
with it now you don't have to be able to

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.510 
with it now you don't have to be able to
stop<00:05:09.210> an<00:05:09.360> antimatter<00:05:09.870> bomb<00:05:09.900> I'm<00:05:10.380> not<00:05:10.500> gonna<00:05:10.650> as

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
stop an antimatter bomb I'm not gonna as

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.800 
stop an antimatter bomb I'm not gonna as
far<00:05:11.670> as<00:05:11.760> I<00:05:11.820> know<00:05:11.880> there's<00:05:12.120> no<00:05:12.210> way<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.390> do<00:05:12.600> that

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
far as I know there's no way to do that

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.710 
far as I know there's no way to do that
but<00:05:13.200> if<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:14.190> are<00:05:14.640> good<00:05:14.970> enough<00:05:15.000> with<00:05:15.510> force

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
but if you are good enough with force

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.030 
but if you are good enough with force
fields<00:05:16.140> that<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.380> think<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.680> can<00:05:16.860> protect

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
fields that you think you can protect

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.140 
fields that you think you can protect
protect<00:05:17.460> one<00:05:17.880> chunk<00:05:18.210> fairly<00:05:18.840> well<00:05:19.220> then<00:05:20.220> let

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
protect one chunk fairly well then let

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.110 
protect one chunk fairly well then let
me<00:05:21.330> know<00:05:21.360> let<00:05:22.260> me<00:05:22.320> know<00:05:22.670> you<00:05:23.670> will<00:05:23.820> have<00:05:23.970> to

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
me know let me know you will have to

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.020 
me know let me know you will have to
demonstrate<00:05:24.620> your<00:05:25.620> force<00:05:26.100> field<00:05:26.160> eNOS<00:05:26.670> and<00:05:26.970> I

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
demonstrate your force field eNOS and I

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.700 
demonstrate your force field eNOS and I
will<00:05:27.210> cover<00:05:27.450> your<00:05:27.870> force<00:05:28.140> field<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:28.620> your

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
will cover your force field and your

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.530 
will cover your force field and your
force<00:05:28.920> field<00:05:28.980> implementation<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.000> we<00:05:30.390> will

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
force field implementation and we will

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.240 
force field implementation and we will
test<00:05:30.780> your<00:05:31.230> force<00:05:31.500> field<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.980> your<00:05:32.040> force

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
test your force field and your force

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.940 
test your force field and your force
field<00:05:32.310> implementation<00:05:33.260> in<00:05:34.260> a<00:05:34.530> YouTube<00:05:34.830> video

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
field implementation in a YouTube video

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.010 
field implementation in a YouTube video
so<00:05:35.430> if<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:35.820> there's<00:05:36.450> two<00:05:36.600> or<00:05:36.690> three<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:36.930> you
