00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.559
 why not 8 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.320
 I think I wish we could be happy 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.320
 All day long 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.939
 for the example 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.660
 in France we set fire to chance 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.910
 Caesar 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.550
 when 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.550
 yet it is defending him 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.740
 everything seems to go on the street these cons 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
 in the same village 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 a different story 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.830
 the substitute of the al-jazeira chain 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 one thing is sure 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 some relatives 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.170
 these archives 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.120
 why rubin 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.270
 pity the very beginning 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.160
 besides for him the kingdom of peace in the street 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.860
 while the market of big names in the art of the world 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.970
 at the project bar the deal and the banks collapse 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.730
 however long 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.960
 the future 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.720
 in the wake of the dollar 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.090
 all service weapons in the focused 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.870
 so it's there 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.530
 several fire cells 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 even worse 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 speaking no sense l at the end of the year 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.570
 Qobuz 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.299
 Let's go 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.439
 on the sidelines of the tournament
