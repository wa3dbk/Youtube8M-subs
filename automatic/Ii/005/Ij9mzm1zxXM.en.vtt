won't be fitting on this camera which is
a<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.489> rubbish<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.480> already<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.230> saw<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.800> this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
a bit rubbish the already I saw on this

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
a bit rubbish the already I saw on this
this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.489> no<00:01:02.760> game<00:01:03.210> pretty<00:01:03.480> old<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.290> saw

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this is no game pretty old and if I saw

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.969 
this is no game pretty old and if I saw
only<00:01:04.739> goes<00:01:05.010> up<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.780> 1600<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> has<00:01:07.740> its

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
only goes up to 1600 and then it has its

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.850 
only goes up to 1600 and then it has its
high<00:01:08.939> levels<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.780> wherever<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
high levels or wherever they are and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.310 
high levels or wherever they are and
that<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.119> pretty<00:01:12.750> rubbish<00:01:13.200> in

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that is actually pretty rubbish in

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.280 
that is actually pretty rubbish in
comparison<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.189> even<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.110> well<00:01:16.110> what

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
comparison to more even the well what

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.690 
comparison to more even the well what
you've<00:01:16.439> got<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.979> whole<00:01:17.130> camera<00:01:17.369> which<00:01:17.580> I'm

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you've got this whole camera which I'm

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.010 
you've got this whole camera which I'm
filming<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> camera<00:01:18.540> which<00:01:18.659> I'm<00:01:18.720> filming

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
filming on the camera which I'm filming

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.920 
filming on the camera which I'm filming
on<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.140> 550d<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.759> go<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> 6400

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
on the 550d that can go up to 6400

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
on the 550d that can go up to 6400
before<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.070> becomes<00:01:23.400> its<00:01:23.580> high<00:01:23.759> levels

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
before it there becomes its high levels

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.560 
before it there becomes its high levels
which<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> huge<00:01:24.900> difference<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
which is a huge difference so in the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.480 
which is a huge difference so in the
three<00:01:27.869> years<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.740> camera<00:01:29.310> has<00:01:29.430> been

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
three years that this camera has been

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.240 
three years that this camera has been
around<00:01:29.880> new<00:01:30.750> cameras<00:01:31.200> cheaper<00:01:31.829> cameras

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
around new cameras cheaper cameras

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.679 
around new cameras cheaper cameras
smaller<00:01:32.670> cameras<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.240> come<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
smaller cameras have come out and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.770 
smaller cameras have come out and
totally<00:01:34.470> blown<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.040> guy's<00:01:35.579> ISO<00:01:36.210> capability

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
totally blown this guy's ISO capability

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.350 
totally blown this guy's ISO capability
underwater<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> frames<00:01:38.130> per<00:01:38.549> second<00:01:39.180> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
underwater also the frames per second is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.870 
underwater also the frames per second is
pretty<00:01:39.780> slow<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.400> listen<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
pretty slow on this if you listen to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.149 
pretty slow on this if you listen to
this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.979> 400<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.189> second<00:01:44.579> listen

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.899 

so<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.340> sports-wise

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so for sports-wise

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.620 
so for sports-wise
is<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> great<00:01:52.380> camera<00:01:53.630> landscape

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
is not really a great camera landscape

so<00:03:41.450> that's<00:03:42.170> how<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:42.920> can<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.310> see<00:03:43.489> the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
so that's how I can I see the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.160 
so that's how I can I see the
differences<00:03:43.970> here<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.570> other<00:03:44.690> problem<00:03:45.050> with

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
differences here the other problem with

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.810 
differences here the other problem with
whenever<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.709> go<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:45.860> fill<00:03:46.280> frame<00:03:46.670> this

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
whenever you go to fill frame this

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.970 
whenever you go to fill frame this
doesn't<00:03:47.120> have<00:03:47.300> any<00:03:47.540> form<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.900> crop<00:03:48.290> with<00:03:48.709> Nick

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
doesn't have any form of crop with Nick

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.340 
doesn't have any form of crop with Nick
on<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.250> can<00:03:49.400> least<00:03:49.610> use<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.940> crop<00:03:50.350> center

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
on you can least use the crop center

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.370 
on you can least use the crop center
part<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.270> sensor<00:03:53.270> so<00:03:53.900> if<00:03:53.959> you've<00:03:54.080> got<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
part of the sensor so if you've got the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.040 
part of the sensor so if you've got the
cheaper<00:03:54.739> lenses<00:03:54.920> then<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.340> can<00:03:55.459> actually<00:03:55.610> see

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
cheaper lenses then you can actually see

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.780 
cheaper lenses then you can actually see
like<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.080> proper<00:03:57.560> image<00:03:57.800> but<00:03:58.430> if<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:58.640> you've

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
like a proper image but if this you've

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.060 
like a proper image but if this you've
always<00:03:59.030> got<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.450> full<00:03:59.780> frame<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.530> if<00:04:00.950> you

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
always got the full frame and if you

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.199 
always got the full frame and if you
don't<00:04:01.250> have<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.489> base<00:04:01.700> lens<00:04:01.970> you're

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
don't have the base lens you're

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.699 
don't have the base lens you're
definitely<00:04:02.570> gonna<00:04:02.930> be<00:04:03.050> having<00:04:03.380> some<00:04:03.530> pretty

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
definitely gonna be having some pretty

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.830 
definitely gonna be having some pretty
serious<00:04:04.010> thing<00:04:04.370> getting<00:04:04.640> going<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.150> in<00:04:05.390> the

serious thing getting going on in the

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.170 
serious thing getting going on in the
corners<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.500> image<00:04:06.650> where<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.670> gets<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.970> lot

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
corners of the image where it gets a lot

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.050 
corners of the image where it gets a lot
darker<00:04:08.450> by<00:04:08.780> x1x<00:04:09.620> but<00:04:09.800> one<00:04:10.060> evaluative

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
those cameras really blow it out of the

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.270 
those cameras really blow it out of the
water<00:04:37.240> maybe<00:04:38.139> not<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.530> much<00:04:38.650> with<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:38.949> canon

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
water maybe not so much with the canon

5d mark ii but if you're looking for a
budget<00:04:41.680> filtering<00:04:42.520> camera<00:04:43.300> then<00:04:43.600> this<00:04:43.810> is

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
budget filtering camera then this is

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.360 
budget filtering camera then this is
really<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.289> only<00:04:44.410> option<00:04:44.500> you've<00:04:44.800> got<00:04:44.949> second

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
hand 5d and personally I would rather go

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.210 
hand 5d and personally I would rather go
with<00:04:49.479> the<00:04:49.510> newer<00:04:49.960> slightly<00:04:50.710> lower<00:04:50.919> level

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
with the newer slightly lower level

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.920 
with the newer slightly lower level
cameras<00:04:52.169> just<00:04:53.169> because<00:04:53.530> they're<00:04:54.010> there<00:04:54.930> every

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
cameras just because they're there every

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.950 
cameras just because they're there every
year<00:04:55.960> they<00:04:56.380> get<00:04:56.530> about<00:04:56.860> five<00:04:57.250> times<00:04:57.580> better

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
year they get about five times better

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.120 
year they get about five times better
even<00:04:58.960> with<00:04:59.110> like<00:04:59.260> scrolling<00:04:59.590> through<00:05:00.010> the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
even with like scrolling through the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.590 
even with like scrolling through the
images<00:05:00.520> of<00:05:00.669> this<00:05:00.820> trying<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.240> go<00:05:01.300> from<00:05:01.419> picture

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
images of this trying to go from picture

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.390 
images of this trying to go from picture
to<00:05:01.750> picture<00:05:01.840> really<00:05:02.530> really<00:05:02.860> slow<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
to picture really really slow that the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.360 
to picture really really slow that the
workings<00:05:04.120> inside<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.720> are<00:05:04.900> slow<00:05:05.370> compared

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
workings inside this are slow compared

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.100 
workings inside this are slow compared
to<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.520> modern<00:05:06.789> cameras<00:05:07.120> so<00:05:07.360> yeah<00:05:07.539> that's

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
to the modern cameras so yeah that's

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.770 
to the modern cameras so yeah that's
just<00:05:08.169> my<00:05:08.380> little<00:05:08.500> idea<00:05:08.680> um<00:05:09.419> you<00:05:10.419> may<00:05:10.570> have

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
just my little idea um you may have

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.850
