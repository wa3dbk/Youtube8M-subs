00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 You were away from Argentina but not with 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.870
 the intention to space emiliano with the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.469
 head well on the dakar and with 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.849
 many and nice projects I do not know if already in 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.300
 so far this year, I sometimes travel to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.880
 South Africa 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.960
 thankfully and thanks to the help of reindeer 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.529
 sports 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.650
 we have an incorporation in the team 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.029
 of a group of South African technicians who 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.980
 they have a lot of experience in cross jandri 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.960
 who have run a few days ago many 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.020
 years before he comes to South America 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.809
 also reigned by us incorporating an engine 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.090
 Largest most powerful 18 cylinders of 5 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.530
 liters 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.540
 and with the experience we have 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.970
 us of these last two dakar with 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.340
 the duster and the last one that was mostly 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.650
 very good we are working on making a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.620
 new car with that most powerful engine and 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.600
 with a little advice from these 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.190
 technicians have much experience 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.540
 crispy and we think it 's better to do 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.580
 a new car for the amount of changes 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.229
 what to do and well let's come to a 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.520
 new car which is already almost in its 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.340
 final part only part of end 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.850
 some parts of the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.310
 bodywork 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.370
 basically it's almost all the rudeness 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.080
 all original duster 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.260
 when we finish channeling 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.780
 around back and not much else even the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.460
 another little thing some other and another little thing 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.500
 more we are already to calculate that in 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.970
 20 more days we will see this to try 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.590
 if you are going to be traveling again 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.830
 South Africa to South Africa for science 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.690
 try and finish with the car and you can 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.190
 bring it here to also be able to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.820
 bring other mechanics are working 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.130
 already a few months ago there 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.870
 and good power to start trying on 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.060
 everything in the roads that we are going to use 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.180
 to run the dakar year after year 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.240
 we were growing growing as a team 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.860
 growing personally as a pilot and 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.810
 the last two years the two years that 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.700
 I ran with the duster evolved a lot 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.280
 as a team in the knowledge of the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.950
 career in the knowledge of the car in 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.250
 the technical part and that helps us a lot 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.920
 for today to be able to believe that we are in a 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.090
 very good situation is a situation of 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.790
 be able to fight with the most teams 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.520
 important of this career that we 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.040
 little we know here and it is very legendary 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.030
 in europe where are the best 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.890
 teams the best teams maybe the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.420
 world in this kind of competitions and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.709
 I think this year we're going to be at 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.709
 height of the pe√±ar equal with them
