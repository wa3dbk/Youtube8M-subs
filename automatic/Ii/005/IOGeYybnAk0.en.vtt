00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
shades you'll get flare in the photo and

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.190 
shades you'll get flare in the photo and
the<00:01:41.340> shade<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:41.700> protects<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.420> from<00:01:42.450> banging

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.160 
an icon 10 to 20 for the Canon fisheye
is<00:01:52.439> pretty<00:01:52.979> much<00:01:53.189> most<00:01:53.869> wide-angle<00:01:54.869> lenses
