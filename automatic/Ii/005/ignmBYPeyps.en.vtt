hello this is Dave Kim dancin and I am

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.840 
hello this is Dave Kim dancin and I am
doing<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> review<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.990> Lego<00:00:04.290> 8080<00:00:04.950> Lego

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
doing a review for the Lego 8080 Lego

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.100 
doing a review for the Lego 8080 Lego
set<00:00:06.710> it's<00:00:07.710> motorized<00:00:08.309> when<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.940> don't<00:00:09.929> know

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
set it's motorized when I don't know

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.290 
set it's motorized when I don't know
about<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.250> larger<00:00:11.639> one<00:00:11.790> but<00:00:11.969> i<00:00:12.000> think<00:00:12.240> this

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
about the larger one but i think this

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.509 
about the larger one but i think this
one<00:00:12.360> prop<00:00:13.170> might<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> little<00:00:14.009> bit<00:00:14.160> smaller

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
one prop might be a little bit smaller

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.609 
one prop might be a little bit smaller
but<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> little<00:00:15.960> bit<00:00:16.170> larger<00:00:16.289> than<00:00:16.500> I

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
but this is a little bit larger than I

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.529 
but this is a little bit larger than I
thought<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.250> camera<00:00:17.609> section<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.300> other

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
thought on the camera section on other

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
thought on the camera section on other
reviews<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.410> probably<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.580> does

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
reviews and probably on this one it does

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.050 
reviews and probably on this one it does
look<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> little<00:00:21.330> bit<00:00:21.510> smaller<00:00:21.869> than<00:00:23.060> it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
look a little bit smaller than it

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.810 
look a little bit smaller than it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the head it's nice and spins around but

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
the head it's nice and spins around but
if<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> want<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> make<00:02:00.810> us<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.140> motion<00:02:01.500> video

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
if you want to make us that motion video

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
if you want to make us that motion video
for<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> legs<00:02:02.790> moving<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.360> can

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
for this with the legs moving that can

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.270 
for this with the legs moving that can
be<00:02:03.750> kind<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.049> hard<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.890> when<00:02:05.159> you're

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
be kind of hard like when you're

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.690 
be kind of hard like when you're
supposed

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
supposed

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.859 
supposed
looked<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.270> legs<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.600> they<00:02:06.689> take<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
looked up the legs and they take a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.180 
looked up the legs and they take a
picture<00:02:07.310> because<00:02:08.569> they<00:02:09.569> don't<00:02:09.750> move<00:02:10.190> there

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
picture because they don't move there

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.820 
picture because they don't move there
they<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.870> don't<00:02:13.140> move<00:02:13.379> because<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
they just really don't move because the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.360 
they just really don't move because the
motor<00:02:14.040> holds<00:02:14.790> them<00:02:14.910> into<00:02:15.090> place<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:16.370> stuff

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
motor holds them into place and stuff

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.430 
motor holds them into place and stuff
vent<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.300> motor<00:02:18.480> turns<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:19.019> then<00:02:19.260> they

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
vent and the motor turns on then they

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.690 
vent and the motor turns on then they
will<00:02:19.620> move<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:20.010> now<00:02:20.129> we'll<00:02:20.280> show<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.459> that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
will move but now we'll show you that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.729 
will move but now we'll show you that
right<00:02:20.910> now<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.810> here's<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.140> little<00:02:22.230> thing<00:02:22.470> with

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
right now and here's a little thing with

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.070 
right now and here's a little thing with
them<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:24.060> Leigh<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.510> don't<00:02:24.630> know<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.810> anyone

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.199 
them the Leigh I don't know if anyone
else<00:02:25.200> noticed<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.400> legs<00:02:26.610> move<00:02:26.819> two<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.180> a

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
else noticed but the legs move two at a

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.180 
else noticed but the legs move two at a
time<00:02:27.300> when<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> movies<00:02:28.560> they<00:02:28.739> moved<00:02:28.920> out

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
time when in the movies they moved out

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.420 
time when in the movies they moved out
one<00:02:29.760> at<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> time<00:02:30.380> I'm<00:02:31.380> not<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.920> not<00:02:32.069> really<00:02:32.400> a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
one at a time I'm not it's not really a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.860 
one at a time I'm not it's not really a
problem<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:32.880> me<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.060> wanted<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.840> just

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
problem for me I just wanted I just

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.190 
problem for me I just wanted I just
noticed<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.940> criticized<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.989> set

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
noticed that and I criticized the set

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.360 
noticed that and I criticized the set
for<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.500> before<00:02:37.830> anywhere<00:02:38.099> I<00:02:38.190> actually

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
for that before anywhere I actually

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.580 
for that before anywhere I actually
wanted<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:39.989> I'll<00:02:40.080> show<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.319> how<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
wanted it so here I'll show you how it

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.170 
wanted it so here I'll show you how it
moves<00:02:40.799> some<00:02:41.099> here's<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.709> lid<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.640> usually

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
moves some here's the lid that usually

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.539 
moves some here's the lid that usually
comes<00:02:45.390> off<00:02:45.599> but<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:46.049> behaving<00:02:46.290> today<00:02:46.799> and

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
comes off but it's behaving today and

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.350 
comes off but it's behaving today and
this<00:02:48.090> door<00:02:48.690> usually<00:02:49.140> likes<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.620> come<00:02:49.860> off

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
this door usually likes to come off

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.140 
this door usually likes to come off
you're<00:02:51.360> obviously<00:02:51.480> that'll<00:02:52.170> be<00:02:53.030> butters<00:02:54.030> are

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you're obviously that'll be butters are

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.550 
you're obviously that'll be butters are
a<00:02:54.209> little<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.470> little

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
a little on it so it's going a little

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.620 
a little on it so it's going a little
bit<00:02:55.709> slower<00:02:56.010> than<00:02:56.310> normal<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.880> he's<00:02:57.360> kind<00:02:57.599> of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
bit slower than normal and he's kind of

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.930 
bit slower than normal and he's kind of
shaky<00:02:58.049> right<00:02:58.170> now<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.590> he<00:02:59.519> looks<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.760> he

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
shaky right now and he looks like he

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.000 
shaky right now and he looks like he
could<00:02:59.970> fall<00:03:00.660> over<00:03:00.690> almost<00:03:01.230> any<00:03:01.560> time<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:01.829> now

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
could fall over almost any time but now

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.949 
could fall over almost any time but now
he<00:03:02.700> hasn't<00:03:03.000> fallen<00:03:03.120> over<00:03:03.480> for<00:03:03.660> me<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.870> I've

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
he hasn't fallen over for me and I've

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.229 
he hasn't fallen over for me and I've
had<00:03:04.110> him<00:03:04.200> for<00:03:04.260> quite<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.560> while<00:03:04.819> so<00:03:05.819> yeah<00:03:06.120> he

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
had him for quite a while so yeah he

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.600 
had him for quite a while so yeah he
doesn't<00:03:06.420> really<00:03:06.630> fall<00:03:06.840> over<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.370> there's<00:03:08.579> a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
doesn't really fall over so if there's a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.420 
doesn't really fall over so if there's a
little<00:03:08.760> yellow<00:03:09.030> switch<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.599> here<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.310> move

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
little yellow switch in here if you move

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.390 
little yellow switch in here if you move
it<00:03:11.579> towards<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.150> head<00:03:12.299> or<00:03:12.780> forward<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.160> set

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
it towards the head or forward the set

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.780 
it towards the head or forward the set
will<00:03:14.670> move<00:03:14.850> forward<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:17.010> stop<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.489> by

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
will move forward and you stop it by

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.059 
will move forward and you stop it by
putting<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.299> middle<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:19.799> make<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
putting it in the middle and to make the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.949 
putting it in the middle and to make the
set<00:03:20.250> go<00:03:20.370> backwards<00:03:20.850> which<00:03:21.209> I'll<00:03:21.420> talk<00:03:21.750> but

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
set go backwards which I'll talk but

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.809 
set go backwards which I'll talk but
really<00:03:22.230> likes<00:03:22.410> going<00:03:22.620> backwards<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.250> looks<00:03:23.489> a

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
really likes going backwards it looks a

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.030 
really likes going backwards it looks a
little<00:03:23.970> more<00:03:24.180> like<00:03:24.359> this<00:03:24.510> kind<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.859> truth<00:03:25.859> when

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
little more like this kind of truth when

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.979 
little more like this kind of truth when
it<00:03:26.100> goes<00:03:26.250> backwards<00:03:26.730> but<00:03:27.450> if<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.720> move<00:03:27.870> it

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
it goes backwards but if you move it

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.440 
it goes backwards but if you move it
towards<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.380> but<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.910> will<00:03:30.239> go

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
towards the but then it will go

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.970 
towards the but then it will go
backwards<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:32.010> there's<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.760> ooh<00:03:33.980> vegetable

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
backwards so there's the ooh vegetable

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.410 
backwards so there's the ooh vegetable
table<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.530> there's<00:03:37.530> stuff<00:03:38.060> horrible<00:03:39.060> you're

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
them that well and they'll spin around

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.550 
them that well and they'll spin around
and<00:06:39.340> then<00:06:39.580> that<00:06:39.729> most<00:06:39.909> back<00:06:40.150> legs<00:06:40.449> so<00:06:40.990> that's

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
and then that most back legs so that's

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.820 
and then that most back legs so that's
pretty<00:06:41.860> much<00:06:42.039> the<00:06:42.370> whole<00:06:42.490> set<00:06:43.380> they<00:06:44.380> have<00:06:44.650> it

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
pretty much the whole set they have it

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.300 
pretty much the whole set they have it
kind<00:06:45.370> of<00:06:45.550> pretty<00:06:46.060> much<00:06:46.150> and<00:06:46.810> guess<00:06:47.530> it<00:06:47.740> does<00:06:47.919> it

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
kind of pretty much and guess it does it

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.589 
kind of pretty much and guess it does it
usually<00:06:48.490> looks<00:06:48.789> like<00:06:48.970> it's<00:06:49.120> gonna<00:06:49.270> fall<00:06:49.360> over

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 
usually looks like it's gonna fall over

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:51.390 
usually looks like it's gonna fall over
but<00:06:49.990> it<00:06:50.199> doesn't<00:06:50.590> so<00:06:50.770> you<00:06:50.889> don't<00:06:51.039> really<00:06:51.190> need

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
but it doesn't so you don't really need

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.790 
but it doesn't so you don't really need
to<00:06:51.550> worry<00:06:51.599> with<00:06:52.599> the<00:06:52.750> whole<00:06:52.960> oh<00:06:53.229> no<00:06:53.440> whoo<00:06:53.770> no

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.250 
to worry with the whole oh no whoo no

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
head moves too that's the only thing I

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.640 
head moves too that's the only thing I
