00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
came in a big box about that size that's

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.150 
came in a big box about that size that's
what<00:05:59.620> it<00:05:59.710> tastes<00:05:59.920> like

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
what it tastes like

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.790 
what it tastes like
I<00:06:00.280> wonder<00:06:00.820> if<00:06:01.000> that<00:06:01.030> was<00:06:01.360> indeed<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:02.050> same

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
I wonder if that was indeed the same

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.530 
I wonder if that was indeed the same
thing<00:06:03.070> because<00:06:03.250> that's<00:06:03.640> what<00:06:03.790> it's<00:06:04.030> exactly

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
thing because that's what it's exactly

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.350 
thing because that's what it's exactly
the<00:06:04.750> same<00:06:05.100> hmm

the same hmm

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.880 
the same hmm
it's<00:06:07.360> funny<00:06:07.570> how<00:06:07.780> things<00:06:07.930> spark<00:06:08.320> off<00:06:08.500> memories

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
it's funny how things spark off memories

it's funny how things spark off memories
doesn't<00:06:09.100> it<00:06:09.220> because<00:06:09.460> that<00:06:09.580> was<00:06:09.700> four<00:06:09.850> years

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
doesn't it because that was four years

I<00:07:23.960> think<00:07:24.170> it's<00:07:24.290> one<00:07:24.440> of<00:07:24.530> those<00:07:24.620> ones<00:07:24.860> that<00:07:24.950> I

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070 
I think it's one of those ones that I

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.640 
I think it's one of those ones that I
think<00:07:25.370> you<00:07:25.460> have<00:07:25.670> to<00:07:25.850> have<00:07:26.840> a<00:07:26.870> few<00:07:27.170> bits<00:07:27.350> of<00:07:27.500> it

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
think you have to have a few bits of it

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.230 
think you have to have a few bits of it
before<00:07:27.920> you<00:07:28.010> really<00:07:28.370> sort<00:07:28.550> of<00:07:28.640> get<00:07:28.910> used<00:07:29.090> to

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
before you really sort of get used to

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.580 
before you really sort of get used to
the<00:07:29.360> flavor<00:07:29.600> of<00:07:29.780> it<00:07:30.050> I<00:07:30.140> think<00:07:30.230> it<00:07:30.410> might<00:07:30.560> be

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.590 
the flavor of it I think it might be

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.850 
the flavor of it I think it might be
something<00:07:30.920> you'd<00:07:31.070> grow<00:07:31.340> up<00:07:31.370> with<00:07:32.590> yeah<00:07:33.590> I'm

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
something you'd grow up with yeah I'm

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.770 
something you'd grow up with yeah I'm
sort<00:07:34.100> of<00:07:34.160> into<00:07:34.610> mines<00:07:34.880> I<00:07:35.090> think<00:07:35.270> I<00:07:35.360> might<00:07:35.540> try<00:07:35.690> a

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:35.780
