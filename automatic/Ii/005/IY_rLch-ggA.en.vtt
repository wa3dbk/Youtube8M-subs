I<00:00:37.370> ran<00:00:37.820> mines<00:00:38.090> down<00:00:38.420> here<00:00:38.720> by<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:38.989> radio

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
I ran mines down here by the radio

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.440 
I ran mines down here by the radio
because<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:40.640> can<00:00:41.090> run<00:00:41.210> them<00:00:41.300> directly<00:00:41.780> down

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.660 

we're<00:00:47.450> all<00:00:47.480> due<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:49.100> all<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.340> different

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
we're all due to all the different

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.190 
we're all due to all the different
connections<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.330> have<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.570> go<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:53.200> so

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
connections that I have to go and so

is the light that's in the RPM gauge and
the<00:01:23.630> black<00:01:23.840> ones<00:01:24.109> are<00:01:24.259> ground<00:01:24.609> so<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:26.630> red<00:01:26.810> one

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
the black ones are ground so the red one

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.020 
the black ones are ground so the red one
you<00:01:27.649> want<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:27.979> hook<00:01:28.039> up<00:01:28.219> to<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.399> power<00:01:28.700> source

I<00:01:33.109> found<00:01:34.039> one<00:01:34.340> that's<00:01:34.609> up<00:01:34.880> under<00:01:35.299> my<00:01:35.740> dash

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
I found one that's up under my dash

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.480 
I found one that's up under my dash
which<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:38.060> fuse<00:01:38.479> box<00:01:38.679> it's<00:01:39.679> the<00:01:40.130> number

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
which is in the fuse box it's the number

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.260 
which is in the fuse box it's the number
three<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.409> that's<00:01:42.409> why<00:01:42.619> we've<00:01:42.829> been<00:01:42.950> up<00:01:43.099> at<00:01:43.310> UM

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
three and that's why we've been up at UM

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.469 
three and that's why we've been up at UM
the<00:01:44.869> next<00:01:45.380> wire<00:01:45.530> would<00:01:45.739> be<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.009> ground<00:01:46.479> which

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
the next wire would be the ground which

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.529 
the next wire would be the ground which
I<00:01:47.659> hooked<00:01:47.929> up<00:01:48.079> back<00:01:48.590> here<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.189> just<00:01:50.119> found<00:01:50.270> a

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
I hooked up back here I just found a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.199 
I hooked up back here I just found a
ball<00:01:50.989> and<00:01:51.319> I<00:01:51.770> put<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.520> wire<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.939> it<00:01:53.060> and

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
ball and I put the wire to it and

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.490 
ball and I put the wire to it and
tightened<00:01:53.989> it<00:01:54.049> up<00:01:55.629> the<00:01:56.629> next<00:01:56.929> wire<00:01:57.110> would<00:01:57.349> be

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
tightened it up the next wire would be

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.010 
tightened it up the next wire would be
the<00:01:57.679> green<00:01:57.950> one<00:01:58.420> next<00:01:59.420> one<00:01:59.569> it<00:01:59.689> has<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.869> be

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the green one next one it has to be

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.520 
the green one next one it has to be
hooked<00:02:00.259> up<00:02:00.379> it's<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.709> green<00:02:00.920> one<00:02:01.099> and<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.530> what

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
hooked up it's a green one and so what

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.050 
hooked up it's a green one and so what
you're<00:02:03.619> going<00:02:03.739> to<00:02:03.799> do<00:02:04.009> is<00:02:04.340> run<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.849> through<00:02:04.969> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
you're going to do is run it through the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
hook it up at and I had to run it

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.520 
hook it up at and I had to run it
through<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.450> firewall<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.080> ran<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.380> through

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530

right<00:02:26.680> here<00:02:26.980> there<00:02:27.670> was<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.820> little<00:02:28.090> plastic

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
right here there was a little plastic

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.660 
right here there was a little plastic
piece<00:02:29.170> on<00:02:29.410> here<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.100> had<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.280> pull<00:02:30.550> it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
piece on here so I just had to pull it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.140 
piece on here so I just had to pull it
out<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.840> already<00:02:31.990> had<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> hole<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.560> it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
and the little blue piece was just right

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.240 
and the little blue piece was just right
here<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.660> add<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> little<00:02:53.500> rubber<00:02:53.709> bundle<00:02:54.130> and

I haven't hooked it up yet so where you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.710 
I haven't hooked it up yet so where you
hook<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.110> up<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:11.040> place<00:03:11.880> where<00:03:12.300> when

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
hook this up at is a place where when

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.290 
hook this up at is a place where when
you<00:03:12.810> turn<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.200> your<00:03:13.349> lights<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:14.670> would<00:03:14.880> come<00:03:15.120> on

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
up and so you would just run it into a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.970 
up and so you would just run it into a
power<00:03:25.860> source<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:27.349> all<00:03:28.349> right<00:03:28.470> best

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
power source like that all right best

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.400 
power source like that all right best
thing<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.280> do<00:03:29.580> before<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.390> mount<00:03:30.690> your<00:03:30.870> RPM

thing to do before you mount your RPM
gauge<00:03:31.590> anything<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.700> tested<00:03:33.390> which<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.810> where

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
gauge anything is tested which is where

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.580 
gauge anything is tested which is where
you<00:03:34.650> hook<00:03:34.890> up<00:03:35.040> all<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.220> wires<00:03:35.310> like<00:03:35.760> normal

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you hook up all the wires like normal

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.110 
you hook up all the wires like normal
then<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.920> just<00:03:37.160> go<00:03:37.430> ahead<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.760> turn<00:03:37.940> on<00:03:38.090> your

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
then you just go ahead and turn on your

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.240 
then you just go ahead and turn on your
car<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.720> test<00:03:39.349> to<00:03:39.560> make<00:03:39.709> sure<00:03:39.769> it's<00:03:40.099> working

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
car and test to make sure it's working

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.910 
car and test to make sure it's working
properly

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
properly

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.290

after<00:03:42.160> you've<00:03:42.280> done<00:03:42.490> that<00:03:42.550> then<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.150> go

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
after you've done that then you can go

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.780 
after you've done that then you can go
ahead

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
ahead

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.520 
ahead
from<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.180> wires<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.569> everything<00:03:45.629> and<00:03:46.409> after

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
from the wires and everything and after

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.990 
from the wires and everything and after
you<00:03:46.709> run<00:03:46.860> all<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.099> wires<00:03:47.310> then<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:47.849> ahead

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
you run all the wires then you go ahead

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.660 
you run all the wires then you go ahead
and<00:03:48.150> test<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.510> again<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.769> at<00:03:50.010> first<00:03:50.040> it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
and test it again and so at first it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.729 
and test it again and so at first it
should<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.329> like<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:51.750> before<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.379> turn<00:03:52.650> on

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
should be like this before you turn on

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.960 
should be like this before you turn on
the<00:03:52.860> ignition<00:03:53.010> switch<00:03:53.549> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
the ignition switch and
