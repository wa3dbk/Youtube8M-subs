so<00:00:04.990> what<00:00:05.169> is<00:00:05.290> critical<00:00:05.620> race<00:00:05.740> theory<00:00:06.299> right

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:09.629 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.940 

you<00:00:10.629> know<00:00:10.750> I<00:00:10.780> actually<00:00:11.080> came<00:00:11.440> to<00:00:11.500> critical

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
you know I actually came to critical

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.560 
you know I actually came to critical
race<00:00:12.070> theory<00:00:12.400> I'm<00:00:12.969> not<00:00:13.089> going<00:00:13.210> to<00:00:13.299> show<00:00:13.419> that

newspaper where they used the word
critical<00:00:29.259> race<00:00:29.380> theory<00:00:29.619> I<00:00:29.710> never<00:00:29.920> heard<00:00:30.099> of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
critical race theory I never heard of

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.130 
critical race theory I never heard of
the<00:00:30.279> heard<00:00:30.609> the<00:00:30.699> word<00:00:30.849> before<00:00:31.150> when<00:00:31.810> I<00:00:31.839> read

the heard the word before when I read

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.350 
the heard the word before when I read
the<00:00:32.259> article<00:00:32.650> I<00:00:32.710> realized<00:00:33.160> this<00:00:34.150> is<00:00:34.330> something

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
the article I realized this is something

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.680 
the article I realized this is something
important<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:36.489> also<00:00:36.729> may<00:00:36.970> recognize<00:00:37.570> this

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
important but I also may recognize this

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.780 
important but I also may recognize this
is<00:00:37.809> something<00:00:38.049> familiar<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.760> familiar

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
is something familiar and the familiar

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.060 
is something familiar and the familiar
part<00:00:40.390> of<00:00:40.479> it<00:00:40.570> was<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:41.350> research<00:00:41.710> that<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:41.920> have

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
part of it was the research that I have

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.829 
part of it was the research that I have
been<00:00:42.190> doing<00:00:42.309> in<00:00:42.519> ethnic<00:00:42.820> studies<00:00:42.879> African

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
been doing in ethnic studies African

been doing in ethnic studies African
American<00:00:44.170> Studies<00:00:44.409> Chicano<00:00:44.589> Studies<00:00:45.059> and

American Studies Chicano Studies and

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.719 
American Studies Chicano Studies and
that<00:00:46.269> was<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.570> familiar<00:00:46.930> part<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.260> it<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:48.460> but

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
that was the familiar part of it but but

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.899 
that was the familiar part of it but but
critical<00:00:49.150> race<00:00:49.269> Theory<00:00:50.339> this<00:00:51.339> is<00:00:51.489> a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
critical race Theory this is a

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.359 
critical race Theory this is a
polarizing<00:00:52.390> filter<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:54.010> those<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.220> you<00:00:54.280> who

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
polarizing filter for those of you who

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:55.979 
polarizing filter for those of you who
are<00:00:54.430> photographers<00:00:54.549> and<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.689> know<00:00:55.809> that<00:00:55.960> a

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
are photographers and you know that a

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.270 
are photographers and you know that a
polarizing<00:00:56.439> filter<00:00:56.710> does<00:00:56.949> a<00:00:56.979> number<00:00:57.129> of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
polarizing filter does a number of

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.130 
polarizing filter does a number of
things<00:00:57.460> but<00:00:57.729> one<00:00:57.879> of<00:00:57.909> the<00:00:58.030> it<00:00:58.299> saturates<00:00:58.869> color

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
things but one of the it saturates color

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.710 
things but one of the it saturates color
it<00:00:59.290> really<00:00:59.379> it<00:01:00.369> brings<00:01:00.640> out<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.820> color<00:01:00.970> in<00:01:01.479> a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
it really it brings out the color in a

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.929 
it really it brings out the color in a
particular<00:01:01.960> scene<00:01:02.379> but<00:01:03.189> what<00:01:03.309> it<00:01:03.400> also<00:01:03.580> does

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
particular scene but what it also does

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.490 
particular scene but what it also does
have<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.239> ever<00:01:04.330> been<00:01:04.420> in<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.629> situation<00:01:04.809> like

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
have you ever been in a situation like

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.530 
have you ever been in a situation like
in<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.740> back<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.490> window<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:06.880> that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
in the back that window that that

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.690 
in the back that window that that
reflection<00:01:07.960> off<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.229> mirror<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:09.159> can't<00:01:09.460> see

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
reflection off the mirror we can't see

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.919 
reflection off the mirror we can't see
what's<00:01:09.909> on<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.119> other<00:01:10.240> side<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:10.659> mirror

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
what's on the other side of that mirror

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.510 
what's on the other side of that mirror
because<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.320> reflection<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:12.159> I<00:01:12.189> won't

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
because of the reflection the I won't

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.429 
because of the reflection the I won't
let<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.789> allow<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.240> do<00:01:13.329> that<00:01:13.509> but<00:01:14.289> what<00:01:14.409> a

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
let you allow you to do that but what a

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.109 
let you allow you to do that but what a
polarizing<00:01:14.979> filter<00:01:15.280> does<00:01:15.579> in<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.820> front<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.060> a

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
polarizing filter does in the front of a

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.109 
polarizing filter does in the front of a
single<00:01:16.390> lens<00:01:16.479> reflex<00:01:16.570> camera<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.890> twist<00:01:18.399> this

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
single lens reflex camera you twist this

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.310 
single lens reflex camera you twist this
ring<00:01:19.689> right<00:01:19.899> here

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
ring right here

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.609 
ring right here
and<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.670> can<00:01:21.909> see<00:01:22.179> what<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.570> I<00:01:22.600> can't<00:01:23.140> see<00:01:23.380> it

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
and you can see what the I can't see it

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.649 
and you can see what the I can't see it
takes<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.340> glare<00:01:24.549> out<00:01:24.759> you<00:01:24.999> can<00:01:25.119> see<00:01:25.270> inside

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
takes the glare out you can see inside

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.469 
takes the glare out you can see inside
right<00:01:26.560> so<00:01:26.979> it's<00:01:27.130> an<00:01:27.189> amazing<00:01:27.460> tool<00:01:28.090> for

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
right so it's an amazing tool for

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.770 
right so it's an amazing tool for
photographers<00:01:29.609> but<00:01:30.609> for<00:01:30.789> as<00:01:30.969> a<00:01:30.999> researcher<00:01:31.600> a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
photographers but for as a researcher a

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.789 
photographers but for as a researcher a
theory<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:32.859> a<00:01:32.890> lens<00:01:33.219> through<00:01:33.969> which<00:01:34.030> we

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
theory is a lens through which we

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.209 
theory is a lens through which we
observe<00:01:35.799> and<00:01:36.039> interpret<00:01:36.280> social<00:01:36.609> social<00:01:37.149> life

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
observe and interpret social social life

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.209 
observe and interpret social social life
that's<00:01:39.219> what<00:01:39.399> theory<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.850> as<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:41.079> sociologist<00:01:41.770> a

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
that's what theory is as a sociologist a

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.039 
that's what theory is as a sociologist a
social<00:01:42.520> scientist<00:01:42.939> that's<00:01:43.179> how<00:01:43.359> that's<00:01:43.749> how<00:01:43.929> I

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
social scientist that's how that's how I

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.300 
social scientist that's how that's how I
use<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.530> tool<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.829> theory

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
use the tool of theory

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.179 
use the tool of theory
it<00:01:45.369> helps<00:01:46.090> me<00:01:46.210> interpret<00:01:46.749> social<00:01:47.560> phenomena

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
it helps me interpret social phenomena

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.379 
it helps me interpret social phenomena
when<00:01:48.999> I<00:01:49.030> see<00:01:49.329> something<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:50.609> fear<00:01:51.609> II<00:01:51.639> often

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
when I see something I fear II often

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:55.200 
when I see something I fear II often
comes<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:53.499> mind<00:01:53.740> how<00:01:54.249> do<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.429> explain<00:01:54.819> what<00:01:55.119> I'm

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
comes to mind how do I explain what I'm

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.569 
comes to mind how do I explain what I'm
seeing<00:01:55.539> when<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.409> work<00:01:56.679> with<00:01:56.710> young<00:01:57.009> people<00:01:57.399> as

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
seeing when I work with young people as

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.020 
seeing when I work with young people as
young<00:01:57.909> as<00:01:58.090> elementary<00:01:58.420> school<00:01:59.079> kids<00:01:59.409> children

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
young as elementary school kids children

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.779 
young as elementary school kids children
students<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.209> asked<00:02:01.990> them<00:02:02.139> to<00:02:03.130> interpret<00:02:03.520> what

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
students I asked them to interpret what

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.120 
students I asked them to interpret what
they're<00:02:03.880> seeing<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.329> they're<00:02:04.509> theorizing

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
they're seeing and they're theorizing

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.260 
they're seeing and they're theorizing
right<00:02:06.130> they're<00:02:06.369> theorizing<00:02:06.969> there's<00:02:07.119> some

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
right they're theorizing there's some

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.609 
right they're theorizing there's some
amazing<00:02:07.450> theories<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.080> come<00:02:08.229> out<00:02:08.350> of<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
amazing theories that come out of the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.040 
amazing theories that come out of the
minds<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.610> miles<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.940> young<00:02:10.179> young<00:02:10.660> scholars

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
minds and miles of young young scholars

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.900 
minds and miles of young young scholars
and<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.380> kindergarten<00:02:12.370> through<00:02:12.490> third<00:02:12.670> grade

but<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:14.020> but<00:02:14.380> theory<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.850> lens<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.300> which<00:02:16.420> we

but but but theory is a lens to which we

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.210 
but but but theory is a lens to which we

observe and interpret social life

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.030 
observe and interpret social life
as<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.880> turn<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.210> lens<00:02:19.540> things<00:02:20.290> become<00:02:20.680> clear

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
as you turn the lens things become clear

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.960 
as you turn the lens things become clear
I<00:02:21.630> would<00:02:22.630> argue<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.290> rate<00:02:24.160> as<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.520> turn<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
I would argue that rate as you turn the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.180 
I would argue that rate as you turn the
critical<00:02:25.330> user<00:02:25.570> critical<00:02:26.020> race<00:02:26.170> lens<00:02:26.440> race

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
and racism come into focus because

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.980 
and racism come into focus because
they're<00:02:29.950> essential<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.640> analysis<00:02:31.270> right

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
they're essential to the analysis right

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.110 
they're essential to the analysis right
and<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.710> have<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.980> say<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.970> my

and I have to say this is that in my

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
race and racism in the work that I do

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.500 
race and racism in the work that I do
right<00:02:40.950> that's<00:02:41.950> not<00:02:42.100> all<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.460> do<00:02:42.610> because

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
right that's not all that I do because

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.270 
right that's not all that I do because
if<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.200> if<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.560> look<00:02:44.740> at<00:02:44.830> my<00:02:44.950> working

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
if you if you if you look at my working

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.700 
if you if you if you look at my working
definition<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:46.110> critical<00:02:47.110> race<00:02:47.380> theory<00:02:47.620> in

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
definition of critical race theory in

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.860 
definition of critical race theory in
education<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.430> argue<00:02:49.210> that<00:02:49.360> critical<00:02:49.720> race

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
education I argue that critical race

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.310 
education I argue that critical race
theory<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.350> wake<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.620> work<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.160> scholars

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
theory is the wake of work of scholars

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.260 
theory is the wake of work of scholars
like<00:02:53.320> many<00:02:53.500> people<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:53.950> room<00:02:54.090> who<00:02:55.090> are

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
like many people in this room who are

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.820 
like many people in this room who are
who<00:02:55.570> are<00:02:55.630> attempting<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.260> develop<00:02:56.590> an

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
who are attempting to develop an

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.730 
who are attempting to develop an
explanatory<00:02:57.160> framework<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:58.709> accounts<00:02:59.709> for

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
explanatory framework that accounts for

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.120 
explanatory framework that accounts for
the<00:02:59.860> role<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.250> race<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.670> racism<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.300> education

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
the role of race and racism in education

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.790 
the role of race and racism in education
see<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.160> developed<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:04.660> definition<00:03:05.110> for

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
see I developed this this definition for

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.380 
see I developed this this definition for
education<00:03:06.520> scholars<00:03:06.910> because<00:03:07.030> that's<00:03:07.240> what<00:03:07.360> I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
education scholars because that's what I

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.020 
education scholars because that's what I
was<00:03:07.600> working<00:03:07.840> at<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.050> time<00:03:08.280> right<00:03:09.280> it's<00:03:09.820> now

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
was working at the time right it's now

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.790 
was working at the time right it's now

using the humanities it's used in social

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.740 
using the humanities it's used in social
sciences<00:03:17.680> but<00:03:18.640> it's<00:03:18.760> an<00:03:18.850> important<00:03:19.360> what<00:03:19.720> I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
sciences but it's an important what I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.270 
sciences but it's an important what I
think<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.080> really<00:03:20.230> important<00:03:20.680> framework<00:03:20.890> to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
think a really important framework to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.820 
think a really important framework to
use<00:03:21.459> as<00:03:21.670> we<00:03:22.060> do<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.330> work<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.840> works<00:03:23.440> towards

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
use as we do this work and works towards

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.100 
use as we do this work and works towards
identifying<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.670> challenging<00:03:25.150> racism<00:03:25.600> so

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
identifying and challenging racism so

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.470 
identifying and challenging racism so
there's<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.500> social<00:03:26.709> justice<00:03:27.150> element<00:03:28.150> to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
there's a social justice element to

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.570 
there's a social justice element to
critical<00:03:28.840> race<00:03:28.959> theory<00:03:29.260> it's<00:03:30.010> just<00:03:30.220> not<00:03:30.370> about

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
critical race theory it's just not about

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.490 
critical race theory it's just not about
observing<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.269> interpreting<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:32.320> about

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
observing and interpreting it's about

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.000 
observing and interpreting it's about
engaging<00:03:33.780> as<00:03:34.780> part<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.320> larger<00:03:35.739> goal<00:03:35.860> of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
engaging as part of a larger goal of

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.620 
engaging as part of a larger goal of
identifying<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.640> challenging<00:03:37.090> all<00:03:37.209> forms<00:03:37.600> of

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
identifying and challenging all forms of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.380 
identifying and challenging all forms of
subordination<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:39.130> race<00:03:39.430> might<00:03:39.730> get<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.360> a

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
subordination so race might get you to a

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.199 
subordination so race might get you to a
place<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.070> can<00:03:42.160> be<00:03:42.280> about<00:03:42.610> gender<00:03:43.860> class

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
place but it can be about gender class

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.410 
place but it can be about gender class
sexuality<00:03:46.680> immigrant<00:03:47.680> status<00:03:47.890> etc<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.299> it's

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
sexuality immigrant status etc so it's

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.720 
sexuality immigrant status etc so it's
that<00:03:49.540> intersection<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:51.340> critical

that intersection that that critical

that intersection that that critical

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
race Theory takes us through but BIA by

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.699 
race Theory takes us through but BIA by

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
focus so that's my working definition of

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.250 
focus so that's my working definition of
critical<00:03:59.170> race<00:03:59.440> theory<00:03:59.709> in<00:03:59.799> education
