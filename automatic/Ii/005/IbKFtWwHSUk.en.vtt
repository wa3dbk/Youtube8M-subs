in this converted milk flow in five

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.269 
in this converted milk flow in five
weeks<00:00:19.950> we<00:00:20.880> had<00:00:21.060> absolutely<00:00:21.330> no<00:00:22.080> money<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.950> we

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
weeks we had absolutely no money and we

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.430 
weeks we had absolutely no money and we
could<00:00:23.369> only<00:00:23.460> use<00:00:23.610> renewable<00:00:24.180> energy<00:00:27.440> very

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
could only use renewable energy very

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.849 
could only use renewable energy very
difficult<00:00:28.830> no<00:00:29.520> resources<00:00:30.000> no<00:00:30.119> louder<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:31.680> van

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
difficult no resources no louder the van

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.619 
difficult no resources no louder the van
kept<00:00:32.070> breaking<00:00:32.610> where<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.180> wasn't<00:00:33.300> great

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
kept breaking where there wasn't great

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.890 
kept breaking where there wasn't great
and<00:00:33.840> all<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.830> was<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> bit<00:00:35.160> struggle<00:00:35.900> but

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
and all in all was a bit struggle but

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.410 
and all in all was a bit struggle but
then<00:00:37.190> we<00:00:38.190> had<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> good<00:00:38.519> time<00:00:38.730> started<00:00:39.210> getting

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
then we had a good time started getting

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.689 
then we had a good time started getting
in<00:00:39.510> our<00:00:39.629> groove<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.320> built<00:00:40.680> our<00:00:40.800> larder<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.400> we

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
in our groove we built our larder up we

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.639 
in our groove we built our larder up we
found<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> much<00:00:42.360> easier<00:00:42.630> to<00:00:42.899> find<00:00:43.079> places<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
found it much easier to find places that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.520 
found it much easier to find places that
have<00:00:43.980> renewable<00:00:44.430> energy<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:45.110> now<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.410> at

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
have renewable energy and now we are at

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440 
have renewable energy and now we are at
the<00:00:46.620> end<00:00:46.770> yeah<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:47.850> last<00:00:48.000> week<00:00:48.270> we've

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
groove with finding where to get

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000 
groove with finding where to get
renewable<00:00:54.210> energy<00:00:54.480> from<00:00:54.710> making<00:00:55.710> sure<00:00:55.860> that
