00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.970 
much anymore as a practicing my
precision<00:03:42.240> becoming<00:03:42.780> better<00:03:42.930> at<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.290> which<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
precision becoming better at it which I

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.880 
precision becoming better at it which I
definitely<00:03:44.520> have<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> long<00:03:45.150> way<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.630> go<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.140> lot

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
definitely have a long way to go a lot

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.830 
definitely have a long way to go a lot
of<00:03:46.920> shots<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.430> I'm<00:03:48.030> not<00:03:48.330> making<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.780> I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
of shots that I'm not making that I

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.320 
of shots that I'm not making that I
definitely<00:03:49.230> should<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:50.150> think<00:03:51.150> I'm<00:03:51.210> getting

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
definitely should and think I'm getting

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.790 
definitely should and think I'm getting
better<00:03:51.450> are<00:03:51.750> taking<00:03:52.020> quicker<00:03:52.230> shots<00:03:52.530> and

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
better are taking quicker shots and

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.950 
better are taking quicker shots and
getting<00:03:52.830> more<00:03:53.070> headshots<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.810> things<00:03:54.810> of

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
getting more headshots and things of

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.400 
getting more headshots and things of
that<00:03:55.020> nature<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:56.840> constantly<00:03:57.840> moving<00:03:58.050> forward

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
that nature so constantly moving forward

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.740 
that nature so constantly moving forward
and<00:03:58.560> back<00:03:59.100> up<00:03:59.280> here<00:03:59.550> as<00:04:00.000> some<00:04:00.240> safe<00:04:00.450> up<00:04:00.600> here

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
and back up here as some safe up here

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.930 
and back up here as some safe up here
again<00:04:00.870> from<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.650> rooftop<00:04:02.190> being<00:04:02.310> clear<00:04:02.610> which

again from the rooftop being clear which

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.640 
again from the rooftop being clear which
is<00:04:03.090> really<00:04:03.690> your<00:04:03.930> biggest<00:04:04.350> threat<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.620> that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650

bullets<00:04:53.610> into<00:04:53.760> someone<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.240> can<00:04:54.390> take<00:04:54.510> shot

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
bullets into someone and I can take shot

on them and kill them put the one shot
to<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.169> body<00:04:58.290> so<00:04:58.790> I<00:04:59.870> guess<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.200> team<00:05:01.590> play<00:05:01.800> this

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
to the body so I guess in team play this

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.159 
to the body so I guess in team play this
rifle<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.460> little<00:05:02.820> bit<00:05:02.910> better<00:05:03.030> but<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:04.020> no

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
rifle is a little bit better but the no

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.930 
rifle is a little bit better but the no
silencer<00:05:04.650> thing<00:05:04.830> does<00:05:05.160> disturb<00:05:05.610> me<00:05:05.730> a<00:05:05.790> little

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
silencer thing does disturb me a little

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.070 
silencer thing does disturb me a little
bit<00:05:06.120> just<00:05:06.390> because<00:05:06.480> I<00:05:07.550> can<00:05:08.630> there's<00:05:09.630> countless

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
bit just because I can there's countless

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.870 
bit just because I can there's countless
moments<00:05:10.440> where<00:05:10.830> I'll<00:05:11.160> take<00:05:11.220> a<00:05:11.430> shot<00:05:11.640> and<00:05:11.820> then

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
moments where I'll take a shot and then

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.490 
moments where I'll take a shot and then
you<00:05:12.150> know<00:05:12.270> here<00:05:12.750> comes<00:05:12.930> somebody<00:05:13.169> off<00:05:13.380> from

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
you know here comes somebody off from

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.390 
you know here comes somebody off from
the<00:05:13.620> side<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:14.100> right<00:05:15.030> to<00:05:15.150> my<00:05:15.240> red<00:05:15.419> dot<00:05:15.600> and

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
the side just right to my red dot and

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.520 
the side just right to my red dot and
like<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.490> should<00:05:17.730> be<00:05:17.850> moving<00:05:18.000> on<00:05:18.240> but<00:05:18.570> the

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
like I should be moving on but the

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.830 
like I should be moving on but the
sniper<00:05:19.770> I<00:05:20.100> don't<00:05:20.310> know<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.580> just<00:05:20.760> have<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:20.940> get

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
sniper I don't know you just have to get

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.170 
sniper I don't know you just have to get
the<00:05:21.990> whole<00:05:22.140> despot<00:05:22.470> down<00:05:22.650> really<00:05:22.860> well<00:05:22.980> and<00:05:23.970> I

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
the whole despot down really well and I

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.680 
the whole despot down really well and I
guess<00:05:24.360> it's<00:05:24.960> going<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.169> come<00:05:25.290> from<00:05:26.600> using<00:05:27.600> the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
guess it's going to come from using the

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.390 
guess it's going to come from using the
secondaries<00:05:28.230> really<00:05:28.590> well<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:28.950> using<00:05:29.310> them

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
secondaries really well and using them

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.170 
secondaries really well and using them
properly<00:05:29.540> I've<00:05:30.540> been<00:05:30.660> practicing<00:05:30.720> with<00:05:31.230> that

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
properly I've been practicing with that

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.499 
properly I've been practicing with that
just<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.050> I'm<00:05:33.410> not<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.830> defenseless<00:05:34.610> when

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
just so I'm not so defenseless when

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:37.090 
just so I'm not so defenseless when
somebody's<00:05:35.960> close<00:05:36.259> quarters<00:05:36.590> with<00:05:36.620> me<00:05:36.830> which

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
somebody's close quarters with me which

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.150 
somebody's close quarters with me which
I<00:05:37.250> suck<00:05:37.520> at<00:05:37.699> anyway<00:05:38.180> just<00:05:38.870> because<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.560> mean

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
I suck at anyway just because I mean

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.159 
I suck at anyway just because I mean
someone<00:05:40.550> like<00:05:40.600> jumps<00:05:41.600> over<00:05:41.780> your<00:05:41.930> head<00:05:42.139> and

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
someone like jumps over your head and

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.689 
someone like jumps over your head and
turn<00:05:42.470> and<00:05:42.650> you<00:05:42.740> turn<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.039> wrong<00:05:43.160> way<00:05:43.220> and

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
turn and you turn the wrong way and

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:44.830 
turn and you turn the wrong way and
they're<00:05:43.910> running<00:05:44.060> around<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.509> other<00:05:44.600> way<00:05:44.720> and

they're running around the other way and
you<00:05:45.680> know<00:05:45.800> it<00:05:46.039> becomes<00:05:46.310> easy<00:05:46.550> to<00:05:46.669> lose<00:05:46.850> people

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180
