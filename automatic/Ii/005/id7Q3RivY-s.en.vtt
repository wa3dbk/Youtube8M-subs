time that you vote on another person's

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.230 
time that you vote on another person's
item<00:02:02.460> or<00:02:02.670> picture<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.220> as<00:02:05.220> far<00:02:05.580> as<00:02:05.790> how<00:02:06.030> many

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
item or picture and as far as how many

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.669 
item or picture and as far as how many
points<00:02:06.979> equal<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.189> dollar<00:02:08.519> it's<00:02:09.530> 3,000<00:02:10.530> points

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
points equal a dollar it's 3,000 points

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.610 
points equal a dollar it's 3,000 points
equals<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.159> dollar<00:02:11.569> yeah<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.080> lot<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
equals a dollar yeah that's a lot so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.930 
equals a dollar yeah that's a lot so
you'd<00:02:13.769> have<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.950> put<00:02:14.099> three<00:02:14.310> thousand<00:02:14.730> times

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
you'd have to put three thousand times

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.309 
you'd have to put three thousand times
to<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.410> dollar<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.980> then<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:18.030> redeem

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
to get a dollar and then you can redeem

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.190 
to get a dollar and then you can redeem
I<00:02:19.379> think<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.829> least<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.519> redeem<00:02:20.849> is<00:02:21.200> five

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
I think the least you can redeem is five

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.679 
I think the least you can redeem is five
dollars<00:02:22.650> which<00:02:23.069> would<00:02:23.280> then<00:02:23.400> be<00:02:23.689> 15,000

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
dollars which would then be 15,000

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.449 
dollars which would then be 15,000
points<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.349> that's<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.680> lot<00:02:25.889> it's<00:02:26.249> going<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
points so that's a lot it's going to

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.800 
points so that's a lot it's going to
take<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.849> while<00:02:26.969> to<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:27.540> point

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
take you a while to get to that point

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.720 
take you a while to get to that point
where<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.139> can<00:02:28.290> actually<00:02:28.469> redeem<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.579> what

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
where you can actually redeem so what

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.849 
where you can actually redeem so what
kind<00:02:29.909> of<00:02:29.969> rewards<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.749> you<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.139> on<00:02:31.379> image<00:02:31.680> oh

doesn't make any sense to me and the

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.679 
doesn't make any sense to me and the
tokens<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.449> the<00:03:48.900> other<00:03:49.019> hand<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.739> can<00:03:49.949> use<00:03:50.159> to

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
tokens on the other hand you can use to

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.409

it<00:03:54.659> I<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.379> thought<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.709> was<00:03:55.769> pretty

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
it I know I thought it was pretty

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.670 
it I know I thought it was pretty
strange<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.879> can<00:03:57.030> also<00:03:57.180> use<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:58.259> tokens

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
strange but you can also use the tokens

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.390 
strange but you can also use the tokens
to<00:03:58.889> get<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.069> powerup<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.900> powerup<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.889> you

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
to get a powerup and the powerup is you

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.959 
to get a powerup and the powerup is you
get<00:04:02.549> double<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.389> points<00:04:04.489> for<00:04:05.489> voting<00:04:05.669> on

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.569 
get double the points for voting on
pictures<00:04:06.419> for<00:04:06.659> 30<00:04:06.870> minutes<00:04:07.079> so<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.099> do<00:04:08.549> the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
pictures for 30 minutes so you do the

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.879 
pictures for 30 minutes so you do the
math<00:04:08.699> can<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.209> make<00:04:09.569> enough<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.139> get<00:04:10.680> back

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
math can you make enough to get back

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.469 
math can you make enough to get back
what<00:04:11.099> you<00:04:11.189> purchase<00:04:11.579> there<00:04:11.790> because<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.180> mean

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
what you purchase there because I mean

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.959 
what you purchase there because I mean
100<00:04:12.659> tokens<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.829> can<00:04:13.979> get<00:04:14.159> a<00:04:14.189> hundred<00:04:14.400> tokens

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
100 tokens you can get a hundred tokens

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.439 
100 tokens you can get a hundred tokens
by<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:17.190> know<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:17.519> opening<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:17.909> app<00:04:18.090> every

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
by you know just opening the app every

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.999 
by you know just opening the app every
day<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.049> hundred<00:04:19.289> days<00:04:19.500> because<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.889> get

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
day for a hundred days because you get

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.760 
day for a hundred days because you get
one<00:04:20.219> token<00:04:20.599> every<00:04:21.599> day<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.810> open<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.229> app<00:04:22.259> but

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
one token every day you open the app but

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.409 
one token every day you open the app but
then<00:04:22.919> again<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.430> also<00:04:23.550> purchase<00:04:23.880> tokens

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
then again you can also purchase tokens

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.969 
then again you can also purchase tokens
and<00:04:24.539> those<00:04:24.690> are<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.930> only<00:04:25.020> two<00:04:25.320> ways<00:04:25.500> as<00:04:25.800> of

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
and those are the only two ways as of

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.330 
and those are the only two ways as of
now<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.190> can<00:04:26.520> get<00:04:26.669> tokens<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.889> don't<00:04:29.250> know

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
now you can get tokens so I don't know

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.279 
now you can get tokens so I don't know
up<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.789> you<00:04:29.969> you<00:04:30.180> do<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.419> math<00:04:30.630> can<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:30.930> make

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
up to you you do the math can you make

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.390 
up to you you do the math can you make
enough

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
enough

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.040 
enough
