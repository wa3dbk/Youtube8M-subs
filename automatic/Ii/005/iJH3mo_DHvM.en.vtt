around all the time it will be awkward

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.410

job in some workplaces I've been in hmm

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.729 
job in some workplaces I've been in hmm
I'm<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.690> person<00:03:48.870> who<00:03:49.110> wears<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.380> lot<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.650> makeup

I'm the person who wears a lot of makeup

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.199 
I'm the person who wears a lot of makeup
and<00:03:50.340> people<00:03:50.700> seem<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.090> be<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> bit<00:03:51.630> like<00:03:51.959> why

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
and people seem to be a bit like why

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.070 
and people seem to be a bit like why
there's<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.269> lot<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.480> stigma<00:03:54.630> around<00:03:54.840> it

there's a lot of stigma around it

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.449 
there's a lot of stigma around it
because<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.320> think<00:03:55.380> people<00:03:55.890> assume<00:03:56.130> that

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
because I think people assume that

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.370 
because I think people assume that
you're<00:03:56.610> insecure<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.780> then<00:03:58.110> they<00:03:58.170> start

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
you're insecure and then they start

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.420 
you're insecure and then they start
talking<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.070> won't<00:03:59.130> stop

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
talking to you and you won't stop

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.259 
talking to you and you won't stop
talking<00:03:59.760> and<00:03:59.880> they're<00:04:00.000> like<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.209> don't

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
talking and they're like I don't

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.759 
talking and they're like I don't
understand<00:04:00.690> what<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:01.440> this

also<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.280> lot<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.489> my<00:04:02.700> friends<00:04:03.239> from<00:04:03.420> back<00:04:03.780> home

also a lot of my friends from back home
like<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.489> about<00:04:05.850> half<00:04:06.269> of<00:04:06.450> them<00:04:06.690> don't

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
like I think about half of them don't

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.199 
like I think about half of them don't
wear<00:04:07.410> any<00:04:07.620> makeup<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.220> will<00:04:08.400> never<00:04:08.610> wear<00:04:08.910> any

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
wear any makeup and will never wear any

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.449 
wear any makeup and will never wear any
makeup<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:10.110> like<00:04:10.170> literally<00:04:10.590> nothing<00:04:11.070> and

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
makeup just like literally nothing and

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.610 
makeup just like literally nothing and
then<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.150> other<00:04:12.300> half<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:13.320> bit<00:04:13.530> of

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
then the other half is like a bit of

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.500 
then the other half is like a bit of
eyeliner

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
eyeliner

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.780 
eyeliner

a bit of mascara so I've gotten to the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.189 
a bit of mascara so I've gotten to the
point<00:04:16.940> now<00:04:17.060> like<00:04:17.449> slowly<00:04:17.720> over<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.019> years

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199
