00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.910
 not 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.910
 and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.560
 that gentlemen here is our frame assembled 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.140
 let's do it now 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.719
 making flooring I him 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.159
 do only from the river before doing the grid 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.309
 and I liked it much more 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:48.920
 that we will need a drill and 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:53.159
 drill on 35 screwdriver with ph2 nozzle 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:59.299
 understandable themselves duck river and samoreziki on 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.299
 40 with a wide bonnet let's start i 

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:08.340
 reiki sawed because they are obtained 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.430
 more than the width of the frame itself because I 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.880
 just throw diagonally save 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.880
 material 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:25.909
 strong about sizes and not 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.409
 bother i just put the first one 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.860
 so that we do not they did not advocate 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.860
 the limits 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.750
 drilling done so that the testicle is not 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:02:00.179
 split up if we start not herself 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:00.179
 didn't know about needlessly spill do 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.929
 see what I'm doing next on 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.709
 chatroulette i don't bother from u 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.860
 I am taking just two rack rail we are 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.680
 24 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:23.579
 at 12 look I just take between 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:28.440
 I put all these two on me 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.440
 create a ready need to zoo 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:10.940
 squeezed and 9 2 remove shifts 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.360
 just further in this way 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.360
 chase to the end 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.879
 this is now literally 20 minutes later 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.190
 more we have already asked for the first time 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:31.310
 we have here is our these trees they have 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.970
 a pair have 48 millimeters i.e. 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.400
 the distance here goes 4850 plus or minus 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.760
 then we run here now 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.080
 in this way these trimming 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.569
 we go down to the third rail with us 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.940
 it turns out here the gap plus minus 12 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.940
 millimeters I do it by sight without 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.459
 believe any markers if you 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.790
 straight she will it ok let's 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.790
 let's continue 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.650
 try on the following we also from waste 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.360
 wiki is also suitable 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.360
 future series 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.520
 when you lay the rail at an angle 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.130
 how he showed you on the basis of the waste 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.800
 practically will remain 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.800
 literally matches matches and dust 

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:06.919
 now they don't need these spirals 

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:12.409
 we can keep exactly the same 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:22.939
 use and drove I prune 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:25.569
 the tips here are at the very end on the markup 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:29.719
 I do not recommend exactly bother 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:43.269
 You lose a lot of time and so it is 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:43.269
 this is all and so we continue to the end 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.410
 time come 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.410
 mode all surplus 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.300
 here's another beauty 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.610
 well gentlemen 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.550
 here is our 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.340
 you are still fully prepared 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.370
 account that we put our river on 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.800
 diagonals here we waste practically 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:44.180
 not left 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:47.199
 stayed small change to rick we 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.900
 used 24 repeat again at 12 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:55.939
 screws 40 millimeters with a wide 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:58.189
 hat show you closer next time I 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:01.069
 show you how we will be exactly the same 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:05.389
 the section is already finally assembled here 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:07.789
 throw nets reinforce attach throw 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:12.400
 lintel bases for roof and bed 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:12.400
 already the sum of the roofs all good luck everyone
