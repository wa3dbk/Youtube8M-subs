00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.440
 I will now explain some basic principles of music theory that they are 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.369
 essential to pass the practice 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.269
 first of all we learn to know the notes of the musical scale 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.779
 we all know the seven notes of the musical scale 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.509
 only they 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.839
 but the first thing necessary to understand 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.169
 and that to the notes are 12 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.649
 yes, because the intermediate notes are interspersed with the seven notes 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.430
 ibs iss obweb springs 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 these take the name of the immediately preceding note 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.790
 with the addition of the essence symbol 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.359
 or of the note 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.469
 immediately following with the demodÃ¨ symbol 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.340
 the symbols of flat exist are called alterations 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.750
 these notes are those that correspond to the black keys of the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.880
 piano 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.810
 and also for the guitar 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.560
 they are completely equivalent to the seven commonly known notes are therefore 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.890
 essential 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.010
 but look at the image below 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.810
 in practice after the 110th c that can also be called a flat king 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.840
 after r 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.580
 cierre sharps 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.580
 u me flat and so on 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.950
 it is necessary to remember also among my lphant there are not intermediate notes that is 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.060
 alterations 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.299
 pens also between the yes hey do of the next scale 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.110
 once arrived at the si the scale repeats itself starting from the do c sharp e 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.170
 so on to infinity 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 the space between one note and the next is called semitone 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.840
 ie helldorado sharps there is a warm semitone ds sr there is a semitone 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.750
 while between do r there are two semitones 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.229
 the semitone is therefore the smallest interval and if held by two notes 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.340
 a tone instead kelly interval between two notes and whose distance 3d2 semitones 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.359
 for example between dott r there are two semitones or a tone 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.869
 as well as 3 rows only 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:25.869
 and so also the three elms that the F sharp 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:37.399
 the entony distance must be measured in the following way starting with the note of 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.879
 departure 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.349
 for example we start from the dott 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.529
 at the distance of four tony we find the sharp sharps with the flat 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.549
 while the distance of four semitones we find the meet 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:57.299
 if instead we start from the king at the distance of four trony we find the B flat 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.459
 left school 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.990
 while the distance of four semitones 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.990
 we find the F sharp or sol flat 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.459
 the note that we find the distance of twelve semitones in the tones of that of 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.599
 departure 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.180
 it will again be the same note only pior qta 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.459
 this note is called the octave 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.509
 that is seen an octave from the starting note 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:28.769
 the set of these twelve notes is called the chromatic scale
