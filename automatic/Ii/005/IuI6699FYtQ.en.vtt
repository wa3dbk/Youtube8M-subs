this<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.100> ran<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.430> clear<00:01:38.610> tape

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this because I ran out of clear tape

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
this because I ran out of clear tape
that<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.030> wanted<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> make<00:01:39.600> something<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that I wanted to make something but I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
that I wanted to make something but I
have<00:01:40.740> clear<00:01:40.950> tube<00:01:41.100> again<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.840> just

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
have clear tube again now so it's just

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.560 
have clear tube again now so it's just
all<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.520> border<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.360> here

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
all this and then the border up here

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.789 
all this and then the border up here
isn't<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.079> even<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
isn't really that even because when I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.249 
isn't really that even because when I
was<00:01:46.920> lining<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.549> was<00:01:47.700> kind<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.090> like

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
was lining it up I was kind of just like

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.569 
was lining it up I was kind of just like
cutting<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.409> trimming<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.829> hacking<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> off

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
cutting and trimming and hacking it off

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.749 
cutting and trimming and hacking it off
just<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> ziplock<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.549> all

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.790 
of these awkward e mullets let me just
this<00:02:15.390> one<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.690> four<00:02:15.870> inches<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.590> didn't

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
this one is four inches if you didn't

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.780 
this one is four inches if you didn't
just<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> stripe<00:02:17.400> on<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.310> put<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.489> made

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
on both of these two but I didn't do it

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.690 
on both of these two but I didn't do it
on<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.730> peace<00:04:09.209> love<00:04:09.389> and<00:04:09.510> happiness<00:04:09.569> one<00:04:10.019> so

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
on the peace love and happiness one so

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.240 
on the peace love and happiness one so
the<00:04:11.700> coin<00:04:12.150> pouch<00:04:12.359> here<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:12.840> rounded<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.650> then

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
the coin pouch here is rounded and then

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.589 
the coin pouch here is rounded and then
right<00:04:14.489> here<00:04:14.519> it's<00:04:15.060> rounded<00:04:17.180> I'm<00:04:18.180> it's<00:04:18.510> not

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
right here it's rounded I'm it's not

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.779 
right here it's rounded I'm it's not
perfect<00:04:18.900> because<00:04:19.799> it's<00:04:20.130> likely<00:04:20.430> first<00:04:20.640> time

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
perfect because it's likely first time

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.790 
perfect because it's likely first time
and<00:04:21.030> then<00:04:21.539> this<00:04:21.690> one<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.930> not<00:04:22.260> over<00:04:22.590> dealer

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
and then this one is not over dealer

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.780 
and then this one is not over dealer
because<00:04:23.039> you<00:04:23.520> know

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
because you know

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.660 
because you know
still<00:04:23.940> didn't<00:04:24.150> really<00:04:24.300> know<00:04:24.390> how<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.570> doing

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
still didn't really know how to doing

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.380 
still didn't really know how to doing
but<00:04:26.670> it<00:04:26.790> um<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.770> this<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.490> lined<00:04:29.700> up<00:04:29.850> and

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
but it um is this and it's lined up and

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.920 
but it um is this and it's lined up and
I<00:04:30.510> really<00:04:30.690> like<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.020> when<00:04:31.140> it<00:04:31.260> lines<00:04:31.410> up<00:04:31.560> oh<00:04:32.930> and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
I really like it when it lines up oh and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.180 
I really like it when it lines up oh and
it's<00:04:34.110> got<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.410> color<00:04:34.590> shape<00:04:34.800> again<00:04:34.980> I'll

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
it's got the color shape again I'll

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.060 
it's got the color shape again I'll
clear<00:04:35.400> taped<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.440> you<00:04:37.440> might<00:04:37.620> notice<00:04:37.830> that

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
clear taped and you might notice that

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.500 
clear taped and you might notice that
sometimes<00:04:38.280> it's<00:04:38.670> a<00:04:38.730> little<00:04:38.760> bit<00:04:39.030> bigger<00:04:39.240> or

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
sometimes it's a little bit bigger or

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.940 
sometimes it's a little bit bigger or
smaller<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:40.170> that's<00:04:40.320> just<00:04:40.530> because<00:04:40.650> it

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
smaller and that's just because it

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.680 
smaller and that's just because it
depends<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.400> size<00:04:41.640> of<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.360> tape<00:04:42.660> because

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
depends on the size of this tape because

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.080 
depends on the size of this tape because
you<00:04:43.500> guys<00:04:43.710> probably<00:04:43.980> know<00:04:44.220> duck<00:04:44.580> brain<00:04:44.790> is<00:04:44.910> not

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
you guys probably know duck brain is not

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.360 
you guys probably know duck brain is not
consistent<00:04:45.600> with<00:04:45.690> their<00:04:45.900> sizes<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.950> sometimes

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
consistent with their sizes so sometimes

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.740 
consistent with their sizes so sometimes
these<00:04:47.550> end<00:04:47.760> up<00:04:47.880> being<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.120> little<00:04:48.240> bit<00:04:48.360> bigger

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
these end up being a little bit bigger

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.440 
these end up being a little bit bigger
than<00:04:49.050> one<00:04:49.230> point<00:04:49.470> age<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.980> 8h<00:04:50.700> not<00:04:51.360> 1.88<00:04:52.430> so

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
than one point age and 8h not 1.88 so

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.290 
than one point age and 8h not 1.88 so
well<00:04:54.450> Ricky<00:04:54.780> Dillon<00:04:55.170> new<00:04:55.530> video<00:04:55.920> yeah<00:04:56.340> sorry

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
messing up because I don't think that's

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.750 
messing up because I don't think that's
possible<00:05:30.330> but<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:31.140> know<00:05:31.260> what<00:05:31.500> it's<00:05:32.250> possible
