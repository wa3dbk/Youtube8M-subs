00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.820
 hello today pheasant you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.230
 remodel the attic which is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.029
 at the same time bedrooms for young 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.550
 person and living room for his parents 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.920
 not an easy task all cottage interiors with 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.160
 lining trim 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.230
 the same we remove it without regret 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.760
 we get rid of the pantry under the ceiling in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.830
 Our project should have a lot of air 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.920
 these beams we leave part of the carrier 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.050
 constructions designer Irina depth 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.910
 I wanted to leave this project 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.430
 the traditional form of a broken roof 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.100
 so under all new surfaces we 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.150
 make the frame and in the room we will 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.150
 low podium 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.570
 for roughing the walls fit 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.150
 moisture resistant building panels 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:19.670
 rabbeted chipboard as draft 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.670
 floor panels with double kraft coating 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.260
 our podium was conditionally stripped into the room on 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.860
 two spaces united by one 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.740
 theme who said that putty walls 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.150
 boring exercise turn it into a sport 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.310
 wide spatula 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.120
 according to the rule hold in your hand also 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.040
 like a table tennis racket 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:49.590
 layer by layer but do it 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 go over the floor 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.780
 warm golden brown wood 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.970
 teak with a clear textured pattern come from 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.940
 from the rainforests of Southeast Asia 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.090
 very solid board is not afraid of damp 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.010
 not frost as required for sex but her 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.800
 can be used for the ceiling 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.200
 we are finishing the niches with the floorboard 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.570
 By the way, the wings of the first aircraft were also 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.570
 from wood more precisely from birch plywood and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.820
 the attic on the second floor was shared 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.220
 living room and room boys at the same time we 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.709
 divided the room into two parts in one 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.790
 arranged everything for Anton sleeper 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.830
 and desktop 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.690
 and now you can receive guests in another 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.690
 and arrange family gatherings
