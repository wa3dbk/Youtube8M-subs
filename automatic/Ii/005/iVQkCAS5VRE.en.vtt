00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Greetings, I'm the one I think and I 'm going to 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.190
 show how we are going to make a necklace of 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.379
 Chicken with a delicious Greek salad 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.630
 that besides everything is super healthy 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.889
 very simple I have here a breast 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.780
 of chicken what I did was simply 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.790
 flatten it using a kitchen hammer 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.160
 you can use if you do not have a hammer 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.590
 pot the bottom part you hit against 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.380
 a table and it stays like that, planet the idea 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.449
 this is cooking it in a much longer time 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.840
 fast and at a higher temperature for 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.699
 that in that way we develop a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.439
 caramelized texture and golden brown 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.290
 top part almost crunchy then 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.840
 let's meet with a little bit of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.260
 olive oil 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.120
 Salt 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.519
 and when we cook the way we 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.899
 let's cook we have to use 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.129
 liberally salt and pepper because 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.469
 remember that many of them stay 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.809
 in the pan as such in this case the 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.739
 iron in which we are going to cook 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.989
 then we season then what we do 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.879
 is we distribute the seasoning well and what 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.619
 let's do now is take it and 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.570
 place it directly on an iron 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.699
 I have this iron ready here 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.500
 nowadays you get them in any 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.840
 kitchen store in supermarkets 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.810
 They are wonderful to cook like 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.570
 we are doing it at this moment 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.570
 and it's going to cook very, very, very fast 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.220
 then now let's make a 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.220
 very simple salad that we are going to serve 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.140
 above the chicken breast for 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.020
 that in this way we have a contrast 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.549
 of two things something cool with the chicken in 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.929
 this case our protein but at the same 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.039
 healthy time and with a tremendous 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.409
 amount of flavor 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.789
 Many people tend to say how healthy 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.450
 It's not rich I'm going to show you that if 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.850
 let's start with a touch of garlic 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.679
 I will place the garlic only for 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.229
 give flavor but not too much prominence 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.350
 what I'm going to do is press it 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.990
 little bit at the bottom of the bowl to take out 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.569
 oils natural oils 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.720
 garlic and crush it a little bit more there is 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:58.799
 now I'm going to add a little touch of 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.799
 red wine vinegar 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.539
 a little touch of olive oil for 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.649
 form a little vinaigrette what I'm going 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.649
 to do is start mixing 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.679
 a simple and simple vinaigrette in the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.330
 background that will later season 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.450
 perfectly all the ingredients 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.580
 very rich now I have here a 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.710
 very delicious fresh ingredient super 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.260
 healthy that is the cucumber 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.180
 we add the cucumber then I have herbs 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.060
 aromatic I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.410
 fresh parsley to give us that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.250
 perfume that aroma I'm going to use a little bit of 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.100
 romaine lettuce what he did was 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.440
 just chop the little one for 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.300
 that to have that texture and also 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.970
 that look when it comes to serving you 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.130
 on top of the chicken then I have a little 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.110
 of kalamata olives one of my 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.970
 favorites I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.290
 onion 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.330
 there is then some capers that stops 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.860
 they are like a bombita of flavor when 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.080
 the deaths have that amount of 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.000
 vinegar and a date that is spectacular 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.600
 and we are going to finish with a little bit of 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 feta cheese feta cheese already has a 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.890
 significant salt level that's why it's 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.890
 very important to balance at the time of 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.290
 park the salt and then let's see 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.940
 how is our chicken breast look 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.610
 how fast it is cooked and what we are 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.970
 looking is to caramelization that's what 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.770
 I want a crispy crust 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.690
 delicious that has been developed by the 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.270
 amenizaciÃ³n car as such and heat 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.709
 has the iron then we put a 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.470
 sightly over here olive oil 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.310
 a little bit more than vinegar and season 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.310
 with black pepper 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.270
 I feel that if everything is salt there they are 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.500
 we mix well and we already have our 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.840
 salad practically ready 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.000
 then our chicken is 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.220
 practically ready because because it 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.410
 cooked from the bottom up because it was so 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.360
 fine the top part is cooked without 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.430
 have direct contact with our 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.470
 iron then in this case already with 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.120
 just give it a little touch 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.830
 perfectly known how can you 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.050
 give an account and what we are going to do is 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.410
 serve it to not dry it too much 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.910
 then a super fast recipe in 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.280
 how much time can they do it in time 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.930
 record we're going to serve with the salad 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.250
 above that we're going to have two 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.579
 things that particularly I 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.109
 one love chicken protein and 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.940
 salad but in this case we're going to have 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.310
 a set of temperatures also 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.630
 hot chicken with cold salad that 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.400
 the truth is wonderful and how are we going 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.290
 to serve the best kitchen utensil 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.790
 that could have been invented are the 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.900
 Look carefully, let's take a little 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.940
 of our 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.699
 We are going to put it in this way 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.919
 over and look at you just one more 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.259
 recipe that can serve you in 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.060
 any restaurant but today you can 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.699
 serve you at home why because it is 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.650
 super simple plus rich super 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.020
 healthy and there they have it and of course 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.729
 I could not leave without trying the truth 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.270
 so good for you 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.270
 Y
