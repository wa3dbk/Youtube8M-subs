cooling fan so I'm willing to give it a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.380 
cooling fan so I'm willing to give it a
shot<00:02:17.110> here<00:02:17.470> anyhow<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.030> where<00:02:19.209> we're

and the hard drive should be held down
by<00:03:12.069> three<00:03:12.549> screws<00:03:14.250> there's<00:03:15.250> one

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.710

easy<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.580> hard<00:03:33.849> drive<00:03:34.030> comes<00:03:34.720> out<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.170> here

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
easy this hard drive comes out of here

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.539 
easy this hard drive comes out of here
so<00:03:36.400> somebody<00:03:36.849> was<00:03:37.269> sinking<00:03:37.720> ahead<00:03:38.370> not<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
so somebody was sinking ahead not the

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.740 
so somebody was sinking ahead not the
cooling<00:03:40.120> team<00:03:40.420> for<00:03:40.750> certain<00:03:41.640> but<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:43.239> should

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
cooling team for certain but that should

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.050 
cooling team for certain but that should
dislodge<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.530> hard<00:03:45.340> drive<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.879> just

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
dislodge the hard drive and it just

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.750 
dislodge the hard drive and it just
slides<00:03:46.209> back<00:03:46.569> that's<00:03:46.900> it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
slides back that's it

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.430
