00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello my creative friends, all right then 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.309
 I'm going to save you today, how you do it? 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.320
 a sewing reform, in which case the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.170
 cut the legs of the pants 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 This is a channel sewing modeling and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.789
 fashion design you learn to take the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.859
 molds through measurements but the workbench 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.500
 because sew but there are many 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.970
 seamstresses this profession to do 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.670
 only renovations and you can also 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.980
 renovate your part or customers and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.050
 also what is the service so do not be 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 now my mother is going to do the reform I 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 I'll tell you how to adjust. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.190
 cause in this case will be a jeans 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.190
 but can be other pants is also good 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.129
 so now you're going to put the machine on 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.870
 Machine case above the hook 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.870
 the middle of the legs of the pants 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 you give a setback and this movement 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.700
 from back to front 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.380
 I already showed you some videos that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.890
 You've scored so much that you're going to want it. 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.780
 tighten at the moment 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.780
 usually a little finger and two little fingers 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 Only you will start to tighten on the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.000
 even from the bottom up or from the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.220
 pants bar 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 the same as calling the necklace that durant 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.790
 did that kicker 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.760
 You do here in the beginning, too. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.410
 kickback 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:39.500
 and come to the card is to keep the same 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:45.170
 So much space if bread kiss a kiss 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.670
 little finger is drawn on top is in the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.920
 start when you are starting to 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.640
 to sew their postures can become a 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.340
 little pies but I spoke with a 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.440
 creator goes training that you do not 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.229
 I care about the plans I 've already learned that 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:06.020
 Already going to hit it rather than do a lot 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.490
 of sewing exercise goes there and begins 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.580
 to sew your pieces the first ones do not 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.700
 leaves the carton, but then the other 17 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.310
 years are raising the whole bar and 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.620
 now the goose has come that the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.050
 legs with Judith had set in 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.590
 start and that's what we'll do in the other 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.800
 also 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.709
 now it 's just that straight on the other leg of the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.630
 trousers 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.959
 So we're already finishing the other one. 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:39.050
 bar at the end you give back to 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:41.450
 behind the front of the little screen 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.130
 You saw that the surplus was 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.700
 this part you did 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.390
 so you're going to cut op we cut the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.519
 this excess leaving seam allowance 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.880
 leaves this much of sewing image 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:59.739
 for you to pass in an overlock that 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.239
 machine that helps the fabric not to break 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.950
 You do this in all cause. 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.250
 now that you've just cut your 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.250
 value 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.319
 I've already been asked what I put three 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.010
 children in my machine overloque of 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.900
 kisses and two more lines is that what I 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.450
 spent - so you can do this 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.420
 also put three wires will spend 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.720
 the less you will save anyone else 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:43.190
 We're just renegotiating the pants. 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:45.709
 be careful not to cut looks and only 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.769
 Here is a video that I speak of him. 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.650
 I teach to pass the line and I cried to clean it 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.019
 it is very good and you find it being used 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.260
 like new but see the video before when 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.260
 some price tips and everything else 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:08.870
 the cause is already tight and we will turn 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.420
 right side with the room inside out 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.840
 to tighten and now let's make the bar 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.299
 you fold twice to one time two 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.709
 times and let's make the bar and let's go 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:26.020
 Enjoy what we played in this video 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:29.750
 also that, that normal bar is 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.479
 for those starting you 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.220
 starts making bars like that 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.979
 I 'll teach other types of 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.979
 bar as false bar invisible belly 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.760
 this one is easier than time 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.200
 you no longer use to do with the 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.200
 your clients or for you too 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.700
 the process ends sewing 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:11.090
 I do not see how that was ready and bar 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.840
 already tight that now a skinny pants 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.880
 but it 's true then I hope 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.130
