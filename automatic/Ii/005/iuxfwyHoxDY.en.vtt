does food reviews on YouTube right and
he<00:02:26.310> was<00:02:26.460> saying<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.840> know<00:02:28.020> when<00:02:28.710> he<00:02:28.950> goes

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
he was saying that you know when he goes

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.490 
he was saying that you know when he goes
and<00:02:29.940> gets<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.450> food<00:02:30.720> he<00:02:30.990> actually<00:02:31.170> has

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
and gets the food he actually has

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.590 
and gets the food he actually has
someone<00:02:31.860> else<00:02:32.040> go<00:02:32.340> get<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.850> him<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
someone else go get it for him the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.470 
someone else go get it for him the
reason<00:02:33.960> being<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:35.040> he<00:02:35.700> goes<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.090> gets<00:02:36.210> it
