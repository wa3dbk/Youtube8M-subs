00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.199 

from<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.980> time<00:03:38.190> they<00:03:38.340> opened<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:38.849> I<00:03:38.970> first

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
from the time they opened it and I first

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.800 
from the time they opened it and I first
went<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.540> 2002<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:41.160> then<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.790> 2004<00:03:42.569> they

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
went in 2002 and then to 2004 they

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.190 
went in 2002 and then to 2004 they
changed<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.530> stadium<00:03:43.890> up<00:03:44.900> when<00:03:45.900> they<00:03:45.989> first

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
changed the stadium up when they first

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.070 
changed the stadium up when they first
opened<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.800> flagpole<00:03:47.569> for<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.690> United

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
opened the flagpole for the United

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.750 
opened the flagpole for the United
States<00:03:49.140> flag<00:03:49.500> was<00:03:49.709> actually<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.520> playing

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
States flag was actually on the playing

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.059 
States flag was actually on the playing
field<00:03:51.180> then<00:03:51.599> they<00:03:51.720> put<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.110> fence<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.770> front<00:03:52.800> of

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
field then they put a fence in front of

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.059 
field then they put a fence in front of
it<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.610> it's<00:03:53.730> fenced<00:03:54.180> off<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.870> guess<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:55.950> was

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
it so it's fenced off I guess that was

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.590 
it so it's fenced off I guess that was
because<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.520> liability<00:03:56.700> issues<00:03:57.450> that

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
because of liability issues that

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.000 
because of liability issues that
couldn't<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:57.930> players<00:03:58.170> crashing<00:03:58.739> into<00:03:58.980> a

couldn't have players crashing into a
metal<00:03:59.310> pole<00:03:59.600> makes<00:04:00.600> sense<00:04:00.900> all<00:04:01.560> right<00:04:01.590> let's

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830
