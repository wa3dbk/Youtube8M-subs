new stuff we want to see what you have
now<00:00:45.910> what<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:46.210> this<00:00:46.420> it's<00:00:47.230> my<00:00:47.440> latest<00:00:47.890> version

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
now what is this it's my latest version

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.329 
now what is this it's my latest version
this<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:49.230> they<00:00:50.230> call<00:00:50.410> it<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.589> 40<00:00:50.890> 70

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
this is a they call it the 40 70

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.110 
this is a they call it the 40 70
overdrive<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.940> switchable<00:00:54.940> between

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
overdrive and it's a switchable between

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.810 
overdrive and it's a switchable between
40<00:00:55.600> watts<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:56.019> 70<00:00:56.409> watts<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:56.800> it's<00:00:57.400> got<00:00:57.610> a

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
40 watts and 70 watts and it's got a

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.010 
40 watts and 70 watts and it's got a
foot<00:00:58.809> switchable<00:00:59.110> overdrive<00:00:59.620> in<00:00:59.829> it<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
foot switchable overdrive in it and the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.249 
foot switchable overdrive in it and the
other<00:01:02.949> addition<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.910> this<00:01:04.259> that

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
other addition to this that

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.130 
other addition to this that
interestingly<00:01:05.680> enough<00:01:06.310> mate<00:01:06.550> kind<00:01:07.509> of<00:01:07.630> adds<00:01:07.899> a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
interestingly enough mate kind of adds a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.900 
interestingly enough mate kind of adds a
lot<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.470> character<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:09.009> app<00:01:09.130> because<00:01:09.789> of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
lot of character to the app because of

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.310 
lot of character to the app because of
the<00:01:09.970> circuitry<00:01:10.390> involved<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.810> make<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:11.020> happen

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
the circuitry involved to make it happen

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.380 
the circuitry involved to make it happen
is<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:12.070> if<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.490> has<00:01:12.610> an<00:01:12.729> effects<00:01:12.970> loop<00:01:13.060> built

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
is the if it has an effects loop built

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.109 
is the if it has an effects loop built
in<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.920> provides<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.640> lot<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:15.820> buffering

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
in but it provides a lot of buffering

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.480 
in but it provides a lot of buffering
that<00:01:16.300> gives<00:01:16.479> kazoo<00:01:17.110> cleanliness<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.369> the

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
that gives kazoo cleanliness to the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.700 
that gives kazoo cleanliness to the
sound<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:18.820> I'm<00:01:18.940> really<00:01:19.210> liking<00:01:19.420> so<00:01:19.780> I'm<00:01:20.530> real

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
sound that I'm really liking so I'm real

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.779 
sound that I'm really liking so I'm real
happy<00:01:20.800> with<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.130> so<00:01:21.250> far<00:01:21.280> let's<00:01:21.880> check<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.210> out

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
happy with it so far let's check it out

00:01:23.789 --> 00:02:16.250 
happy with it so far let's check it out
okay<00:01:24.789> so<00:01:26.520> leader<00:01:27.520> setting

know<00:03:12.250> copy<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.790> other<00:03:13.570> people's<00:03:13.930> stuff<00:03:14.230> the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
know copy of other people's stuff the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.250 
know copy of other people's stuff the
ones<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.580> mentioned<00:03:15.970> yeah<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.750> know<00:03:16.840> it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
ones that you mentioned yeah you know it
