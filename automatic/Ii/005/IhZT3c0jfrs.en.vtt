God<00:00:30.810> -<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.439> had<00:00:31.769> no<00:00:31.949> idea<00:00:32.070> exactly<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.850> was

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
God - I had no idea exactly what was

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.040 
God - I had no idea exactly what was
going<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.480> still<00:00:33.719> haven't<00:00:33.989> even

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
going on because I still haven't even

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
hopefully I get to see the summer which

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.069 
hopefully I get to see the summer which
I<00:00:37.770> can't<00:00:38.010> fucking<00:00:38.280> wait<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.210> I'm

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I can't fucking wait for that but I'm

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
I can't fucking wait for that but I'm
baffled<00:00:40.829> because<00:00:41.340> first<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.760> always

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
baffled because first of all we always

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.610 
baffled because first of all we always
you<00:00:42.239> know<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.629> always<00:00:42.780> progressively<00:00:43.379> gets

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
you know it always progressively gets

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.869 
you know it always progressively gets
strong<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.070> always<00:00:44.280> go<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> another

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
strong we always go from one to another

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.630 
strong we always go from one to another
and<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:45.930> make<00:00:46.140> sense<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.430> far

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and it would make sense in a way as far

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.670 
and it would make sense in a way as far
as<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.000> from<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.780> heard<00:00:48.989> about<00:00:49.140> Super

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
as like from what we heard about Super

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.990 
as like from what we heard about Super
Saiyan<00:00:49.860> God<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.820> all

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
Saiyan God you have to have like all

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.430 
Saiyan God you have to have like all
these<00:00:51.239> sayings<00:00:51.480> around<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.050> whatever<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
these sayings around you or whatever to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.770 
these sayings around you or whatever to
get<00:00:52.559> into<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.860> mode<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.789> seemingly<00:00:54.270> Super

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
get into that mode so seemingly Super

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.180 
get into that mode so seemingly Super
Saiyan<00:00:55.050> God<00:00:55.170> Super<00:00:55.230> Saiyan<00:00:55.620> from<00:00:55.980> my

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
Saiyan God Super Saiyan from my

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
Saiyan God Super Saiyan from my
understanding<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.910> potentially<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:57.989> going

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
understanding is potentially like going

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
understanding is potentially like going
regular<00:00:59.039> Super<00:00:59.340> Saiyan<00:00:59.579> with<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> key<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.809> God

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
regular Super Saiyan with the key of God

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.680 
regular Super Saiyan with the key of God
mode<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:01.949> I'm<00:01:02.160> guessing<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.539> just

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
mode in a way I'm guessing and it's just

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.210 
mode in a way I'm guessing and it's just
kind<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.899> again<00:01:04.140> baffles<00:01:04.589> me<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
kind of again baffles me because you

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.870 
kind of again baffles me because you
would<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.760> would<00:01:05.820> be

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
would think that it would be

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
would think that it would be
progressively<00:01:06.450> getting<00:01:06.720> stronger<00:01:06.990> whatnot

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
progressively getting stronger whatnot

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
progressively getting stronger whatnot
but<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.680> again<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.280> freezes<00:01:08.790> return<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.479> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
but then again it's freezes return so it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.350 
but then again it's freezes return so it
kind<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> makes<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.650> little<00:01:10.890> bit<00:01:11.189> more<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.760> an

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
kind of makes a little bit more of an

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
kind of makes a little bit more of an
level<00:01:12.900> playing<00:01:13.200> field<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.830> way<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.010> guess<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
level playing field in a way I guess I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.130 
level playing field in a way I guess I
would<00:01:14.580> say<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.000> far<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.689> freezer

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
would say as far as like freezer

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.929 
would say as far as like freezer
returning<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.950> even<00:01:17.340> though<00:01:17.460> already<00:01:17.729> like

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
returning and even though already like

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.370 
returning and even though already like
the<00:01:18.060> Z<00:01:18.299> Warriors<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.750> surpassed<00:01:19.020> him<00:01:19.320> in

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the Z Warriors have surpassed him in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.410 
the Z Warriors have surpassed him in
every<00:01:19.590> given<00:01:19.920> instance<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.460> whatnot<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
every given instance and whatnot but the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480 
every given instance and whatnot but the
fact<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.720> he<00:01:21.840> could<00:01:21.990> catch<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.409> god<00:01:22.680> mode<00:01:23.009> was

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
fact that he could catch up god mode was

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
fact that he could catch up god mode was
a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.790> stronger<00:01:24.119> than<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.780> Super<00:01:25.049> Saiyan

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
a lot stronger than what Super Saiyan

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
a lot stronger than what Super Saiyan
God<00:01:25.320> Super<00:01:25.680> Saiyan<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.340> regardless<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.939> all

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060

God Super Saiyan is regardless of all
that<00:01:27.240> whatever<00:01:27.450> okay<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.409> weirdest<00:01:28.860> shit

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that whatever okay so it's weirdest shit

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.460 
that whatever okay so it's weirdest shit
but<00:01:29.340> basically<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.509> powerup<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.290> in

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
but basically the powerup that we got in

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
but basically the powerup that we got in
the<00:01:31.680> freezer<00:01:31.950> movie<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.700> even<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.030> strong

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the freezer movie is not even as strong

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
the freezer movie is not even as strong
as<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.780> from<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> battle<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.320> gods<00:01:34.470> movie

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
as the one from the battle of gods movie

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.420 
as the one from the battle of gods movie
but<00:01:35.369> Toriyama's<00:01:36.409> explanation<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.740> just

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
but Toriyama's explanation of this just

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.310 
but Toriyama's explanation of this just
kind<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.729> seems<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.119> honestly<00:01:39.780> he<00:01:39.930> wakes<00:01:40.140> up

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
kind of seems like honestly he wakes up

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.649 
kind of seems like honestly he wakes up
in<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> morning<00:01:40.799> takes<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.729> nice<00:01:41.970> shit<00:01:42.450> and

Toriyama<00:01:59.399> apparently<00:01:59.969> said<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> he<00:02:00.450> thought

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
Toriyama apparently said that he thought

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.530 
Toriyama apparently said that he thought
red<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.530> stronger<00:02:02.100> color<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.880> blue<00:02:03.119> was

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
red was a stronger color but blue was

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.569 
red was a stronger color but blue was
weaker<00:02:03.869> simply<00:02:04.350> put<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> red

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
weaker simply put it's because the red

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.760 
weaker simply put it's because the red
hair<00:02:05.820> looks<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.240> strong<00:02:06.570> said<00:02:06.930> Toriyama<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
hair looks so strong said Toriyama the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440 
hair looks so strong said Toriyama the
color<00:02:08.009> yellow<00:02:08.220> has<00:02:08.459> already<00:02:08.759> been<00:02:08.849> used<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
color yellow has already been used and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.449 
color yellow has already been used and
blue<00:02:09.840> isn't<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.410> strong<00:02:10.860> looking<00:02:11.280> so

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
blue isn't really that strong looking so

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.260 
blue isn't really that strong looking so
visually

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
visually

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.990 
visually
that<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.660> easy<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.110> understand<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.700> sense

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that is easy to understand so in a sense

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.050 
that is easy to understand so in a sense
if<00:02:15.960> I'm<00:02:16.320> making<00:02:16.800> any<00:02:17.130> logic<00:02:17.580> out<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.940> he

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
if I'm making any logic out of this he

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.670 
if I'm making any logic out of this he
basically<00:02:18.360> said<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.750> Super<00:02:19.410> Saiyan<00:02:19.650> God

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
basically said that Super Saiyan God

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.620 
basically said that Super Saiyan God
Super<00:02:19.830> Saiyan<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.460> weaker<00:02:20.880> than<00:02:20.910> Super<00:02:21.450> Saiyan

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
Super Saiyan is weaker than Super Saiyan

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.500 
Super Saiyan is weaker than Super Saiyan
God<00:02:21.690> because<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.920> color<00:02:23.190> blue<00:02:23.670> looks<00:02:24.030> weaker

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
God because the color blue looks weaker

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.680 
God because the color blue looks weaker
than<00:02:24.630> red<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.500> mean<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.580> guess<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.330> way<00:02:27.360> also

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
than red I mean I guess in a way also

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.360 
than red I mean I guess in a way also
you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.050> interpret<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:28.620> he<00:02:28.770> chose<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you can interpret that as he chose the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.100 
you can interpret that as he chose the
color<00:02:29.550> blue<00:02:29.820> for<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> weaker<00:02:30.450> transformation

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
color blue for the weaker transformation

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.890 
color blue for the weaker transformation
because<00:02:31.710> in<00:02:31.980> his<00:02:32.250> mind<00:02:32.280> blue<00:02:33.120> doesn't<00:02:33.390> look<00:02:33.690> as

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
because in his mind blue doesn't look as

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.500 
because in his mind blue doesn't look as
outstanding<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.010> red<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.340> whatever<00:02:35.490> but<00:02:35.850> some

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
outstanding as red or whatever but some

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.110 
outstanding as red or whatever but some
of<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.720> times<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.380> kind<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> wonder<00:02:37.950> like

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
of the times I just kind of wonder like

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.820 
of the times I just kind of wonder like
Dragon<00:02:39.120> Ball<00:02:39.330> Z<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.990> still<00:02:40.290> say<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> lot

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
Dragon Ball Z and I still say that a lot

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.170 
Dragon Ball Z and I still say that a lot
of<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.010> content<00:02:41.280> stands<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:41.970> itself

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
of that content stands for itself

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.120 
of that content stands for itself
because<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> just<00:02:42.750> recently<00:02:42.990> rewatched<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.860> lot

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
because I just recently rewatched a lot

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.710 
because I just recently rewatched a lot
of<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> cel<00:02:44.610> games<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.150> whole<00:02:45.300> power

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
of the cel games and the whole power

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.940 
of the cel games and the whole power
struggle<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.410> should<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.680> still

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
struggle and that should have still

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.090 
struggle and that should have still
really<00:02:47.190> strong<00:02:47.430> content<00:02:47.940> or<00:02:48.090> whatever<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.540> I

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
really strong content or whatever so I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.590 
really strong content or whatever so I
constantly<00:02:50.100> go<00:02:50.310> back<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.700> think<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.240> it

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
constantly go back and think like is it

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.150 
constantly go back and think like is it
just<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:52.020> we<00:02:52.140> were<00:02:52.260> blinded<00:02:52.740> because<00:02:53.010> we

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
just that we were blinded because we

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.460 
just that we were blinded because we
were<00:02:53.280> younger<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:54.090> Dragon<00:02:54.600> Ball<00:02:54.750> Z<00:02:55.020> isn't

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
were younger that Dragon Ball Z isn't

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.410 
were younger that Dragon Ball Z isn't
really<00:02:55.800> as<00:02:55.920> incredible<00:02:56.520> as<00:02:56.580> we<00:02:57.210> had

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
really as incredible as we had

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.910 
really as incredible as we had
previously<00:02:57.840> thought<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.290> then<00:02:58.410> again<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:58.770> I

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
previously thought but then again like I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.560 
previously thought but then again like I
said<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.280> recently<00:02:59.640> read<00:03:00.000> Watson<00:03:00.390> it's

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
said I just recently read Watson it's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.060 
said I just recently read Watson it's
like<00:03:00.660> no<00:03:00.960> this<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.230> really<00:03:01.620> good<00:03:01.770> stuff
