00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
beautiful colors hit the source again

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.500 
beautiful colors hit the source again
now<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:53.039> math<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> plugged<00:00:54.329> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
now we have my math which is plugged in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.290 
now we have my math which is plugged in
with<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.219> DVI<00:00:56.219> cable<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.030> both

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
with this DVI cable so that both

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.849 
with this DVI cable so that both
computers<00:00:57.750> hooked<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> exact<00:00:58.680> same

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
computers hooked up at the exact same

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.349 
computers hooked up at the exact same
time<00:00:59.780> hit<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> source<00:01:01.050> again<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> TV

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
time hit the source again we get the TV

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.789 
time hit the source again we get the TV
now<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.629> order<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.019> since<00:01:04.379> everything

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
now in order to get since everything

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.060 
now in order to get since everything
else<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> composite<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:06.000> gamecube<00:01:07.070> ps2

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
else is composite like my gamecube ps2

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
else is composite like my gamecube ps2
cetera<00:01:08.909> cetera<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> had<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> do

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
cetera cetera it's all what I had to do

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.390 
cetera cetera it's all what I had to do
is<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.049> an<00:01:13.170> RF<00:01:13.470> modulator<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:14.220> turn

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is it just use an RF modulator to turn

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.929 
is it just use an RF modulator to turn
the<00:01:14.640> composite<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.500> TV<00:01:16.939> coaxial

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the composite into just the TV coaxial

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.749 
the composite into just the TV coaxial
plug-in<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.619> streaming<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> way<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
plug-in and streaming all that way so

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.320 
plug-in and streaming all that way so
that<00:01:21.030> way<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> channel<00:01:22.259> 4<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.150> have

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that way if I go to channel 4 so I have

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:33.580 
that way if I go to channel 4 so I have
it<00:01:24.450> set<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:26.750> I<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> ability<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:31.970> second

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
it set at I have the ability to second

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.260 
it set at I have the ability to second
stretching<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> cable<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.369> closer

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
