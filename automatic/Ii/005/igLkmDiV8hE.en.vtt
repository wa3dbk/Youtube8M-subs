00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.110
 hello everyone at all who pays and 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.150
 we find ourselves for a new video 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.360
 today new snapshot between 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.670
 quotation marks then the one at 32b you can 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.180
 see it 32b but there are new ones 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.870
 blocks so the barriers and the fans 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.600
 gatefin the equality the fans gates 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.360
 the leaves it does and colorful fengate 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.820
 my case is different wood and kraft 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.049
 who changed to kraft and a face 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.790
 now you need 2-4 woods 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:54.530
 jungle and sticks 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.650
 there is no new stick in fact and 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.449
 it gives you exactly three barriers 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:05.330
 and for the fans it's exactly 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.950
 the inverted capstick and planks and that 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.030
 gives you a barrier a woman who is 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.890
 a Bahrain one door 100 so leaves 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:22.280
 so here they are in the inventory 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:26.930
 here and and his name remains here is the raid 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.750
 so here is then another little to 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.300
 you no I laugh 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.580
 a command that was added not just 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.870
 before the pinnacle now when finally 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.480
 in the week the stubborn one appears where one 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.840
 wants to make it appear there I do it 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.390
 appear on at 0.5 so shifted to 0.5 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.280
 it's here it's right in the middle before 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.140
 when we were doing this pony an entity 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.210
 you may remember to ring everything 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.170
 time in the middle of the block but now 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.080
 it's more the case we can do them 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.090
 ring on the sides anywhere at 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.729
 precise places now is enough 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.020
 accurate there are more than two batteries on 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.869
 blocks and the other little addition a little 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.720
 order does not make it a small 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.370
 command this is the in titi data all 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.269
 just for those who do not know it 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.459
 as a mom in quotation marks I 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.470
 wait for a long time it allows 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.890
 a lot of things like a villager 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.180
 who jumps or not we sucks but it 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.030
 allows a lot of things we can 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.250
 quote tags an entity so the tags 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.480
 you go on time for match you will 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.140
 there would be no description you have 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.569
 all sizes 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.760
 we can almost every summer of course 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.980
 not all new for example I tried 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.450
 we can pass such idea of ​​the mob 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.190
 it would allow for example 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.650
 turn a villager into creepers 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.910
 years she command block can not but 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.269
 for example there may be mentioned are 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.019
 motion there I know the NPC motion 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.870
 simply both of the same 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.129
 thematic 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.129
 I can but I remain skeptical 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.680
 j7 his motion in 0.5 in height 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.000
 so that makes us jump we can do too 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.220
 many other things for example if I 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.220
 throw a cube on it you see who 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.690
 change is not the texture that changes 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.260
 it's downright block that change 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:26.220
 giants have changed the idea of ​​the block 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.220
 here it is here if I get it back 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:40.019
 that's it if we get it back at the right time 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.939
 can for example I have coban there 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.590
 I'm out of luck if I get it back 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.719
 older hair such a long scene etc 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.750
 when I did this simply a 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:51.209
 anti data for coordinates and items 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.810
 points requiring change of Laïdi 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:58.049
 leatt of the item so here I go 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.790
 block her then for example another 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.500
 thing I did that is totally stupid 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.500
 I think it's cool we can do 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.950
 to sit down and get up a dog that's 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.650
 totally stupid I'm proud of myself 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.200
 in addition to the funny key so how did I 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.160
 do it simply with the tag 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.669
 sitting that I do to 0 and here I am 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.280
 stop the word I'll just make you 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.810
 something I 'm going to cut them off and 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.599
 when I come back right now 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.389
 we are on child formate wallace and 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.310
 his good form there are all the dates 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.250
 attack the game if you do not know 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.080
 for example the taxi thing he's here 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.000
 here you take the dog sitting it 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.310
 is here you want it to 0 between or 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.039
 fall this of course it's all in English 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.349
 sorry there is no it exists in 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.789
 French but how do you say you 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.919
 imagine this page in two more times 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.229
 little he misses a lot of things by 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.979
 example there are already all the god tags 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.510
 larmor stands that are already there ah yes 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.330
 also in the Norman snap shot there was 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.620
 additions on larmor penguin stand a 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.680
 discovered that 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.919
 the tag of isabelle this lot had changed 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.970
 so that's probably so 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:15.540
 So here is really everything can not 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.850
 no longer a trick we can change the 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.160
 painting a painting him it was a 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.639
 size so that will allow those who 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.729
 want a predefined painting down from 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.310
 know to choose it so you ask a 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.190
 painting and you it was with the name 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.419
 who is there aztec kebab aztec holbein 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.340
 of good and it is to make great 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:46.080
 things like that was the item in a 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:48.060
 iframe I have no idea a little bit 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.280
 so many things here so I want 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.110
 do not let you hang around too much 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.860
 a long time and I'll tell you next time 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.860
 clearance sale
