00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
so I've been using mine ways to make

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.970 
so I've been using mine ways to make
models<00:00:03.120> for<00:00:03.300> other<00:00:03.330> people<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.990> finally<00:00:04.920> I

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
models for other people and finally I

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.470 
models for other people and finally I
made<00:00:05.100> some<00:00:05.279> models<00:00:05.549> for<00:00:05.670> myself<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.299> are<00:00:06.390> in

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
made some models for myself that are in

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.950 
made some models for myself that are in
color<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.960> got<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.069> see<00:00:08.250> what<00:00:08.400> they<00:00:08.519> look<00:00:08.550> like

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
color and got to see what they look like

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.160 
color and got to see what they look like
so<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.380> just<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.820> rundown<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.840> models

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
so this is just a rundown of the models

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.849 
so this is just a rundown of the models
that<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:14.059> so<00:00:15.059> let's<00:00:15.360> pull<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.020> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
that I got so let's pull this one up and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.340 
that I got so let's pull this one up and
i'm<00:00:17.850> totally<00:00:18.060> not<00:00:18.300> used<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.720> camera<00:00:19.140> so

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
i'm totally not used to this camera so

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.070 
i'm totally not used to this camera so
we'll<00:00:19.590> try<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> focus<00:00:21.050> there<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.199> go<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:24.080> yeah

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
we'll try to focus there we go and yeah

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.269 
we'll try to focus there we go and yeah
so<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.390> teapot<00:00:27.980> which<00:00:28.980> i<00:00:29.099> did<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so this one is a teapot which i did a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.389 
so this one is a teapot which i did a
cutaway<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.769> outside<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
cutaway of and so that's the outside the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.650 
cutaway of and so that's the outside the
teapot<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.380> then<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.649> other<00:00:34.829> half<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
teapot and then the other half is the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.170 
teapot and then the other half is the
cutaway<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.850> unfortunately<00:00:38.850> i<00:00:38.910> don't<00:00:39.090> know

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
cutaway so unfortunately i don't know

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.520 
cutaway so unfortunately i don't know
how<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> zoom<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> camera<00:00:39.989> very<00:00:40.140> well<00:00:40.320> let's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
how to zoom this camera very well let's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.940 
how to zoom this camera very well let's
give<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> shot<00:00:41.930> this<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.260> son's<00:00:43.559> camera

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
it's a lot better camera than my camera

it's a lot better camera than my camera
there<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.489> go<00:00:47.579> anyway<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.200> inside<00:00:49.469> did<00:00:50.219> say

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
there we go anyway so the inside did say

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
different kinds of blocks in it and I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.479 
different kinds of blocks in it and I
wish<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.289> could<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:55.860> zoomed<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> there

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
wish I could really get zoomed in there

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
little brick patterns and you can pick

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.590 
little brick patterns and you can pick
out<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.989> Pumpkin<00:01:01.620> face<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.340> and

vertical<00:02:02.620> model<00:02:03.090> 3d<00:02:04.090> model<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:04.600> this<00:02:04.930> guy

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
vertical model 3d model is this guy

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.240 
vertical model 3d model is this guy
which<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:05.890> my<00:02:06.250> little<00:02:06.670> X<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.210> unknown<00:02:08.250> perturb

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
which is my little X the unknown perturb

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.330 
which is my little X the unknown perturb
scientist<00:02:09.880> lab<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:11.160> there's<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
scientist lab and there's the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.550 
scientist lab and there's the
hollowed-out<00:02:12.640> view<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:14.080> inside<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.380> this

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
hollowed-out view and the inside of this

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.530 
hollowed-out view and the inside of this
thing<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.100> again<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.550> cutaway<00:02:15.850> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
thing this again is a cutaway the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.270 
thing this again is a cutaway the
outside<00:02:16.900> actually<00:02:17.230> forms<00:02:17.560> from<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.950> top<00:02:18.130> it

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
outside actually forms from the top it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.980 
outside actually forms from the top it
forms<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.580> whole<00:02:18.730> X<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.300> cut<00:02:19.540> off<00:02:19.630> one<00:02:19.780> little

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
forms a whole X so I cut off one little

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.710 
forms a whole X so I cut off one little
piece<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.410> X<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:22.240> there's<00:02:22.390> all<00:02:22.510> kinds

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
piece of the X and so there's all kinds

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.560 
piece of the X and so there's all kinds
of<00:02:22.780> little<00:02:22.840> things<00:02:23.020> going<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.650> like<00:02:23.860> there's<00:02:24.100> a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
of little things going on like there's a

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.530 
of little things going on like there's a
secret<00:02:25.570> lava<00:02:25.840> entrance<00:02:26.380> here<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.180> all<00:02:28.180> kinds

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
secret lava entrance here and all kinds

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.410 
secret lava entrance here and all kinds
of<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:29.010> water<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.310> sort<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.820> hadn't<00:02:31.390> planned

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
of a water that sort of I hadn't planned

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.030 
of a water that sort of I hadn't planned
on<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:31.990> kind<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.290> burst<00:02:32.500> over<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.890> edge<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
on but kind of burst over the edge and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.250 
on but kind of burst over the edge and
looks<00:02:33.550> pretty<00:02:33.730> cool<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.540> little<00:02:35.020> little

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
looks pretty cool and a little little

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.350 
looks pretty cool and a little little
bridge<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.310> why<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:37.030> then<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.270> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
bridge and why not and then on the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.390 
bridge and why not and then on the
inside<00:02:37.480> there's<00:02:37.930> uh<00:02:38.080> there's<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:39.130> place

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
inside there's uh there's this place

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.640 
inside there's uh there's this place
where<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.720> rails<00:02:40.930> come<00:02:41.230> up<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.500> rails

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
where the the rails come up the rails

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.200 
where the the rails come up the rails
didn't<00:02:41.950> come<00:02:42.130> out<00:02:42.160> real<00:02:42.430> strong<00:02:42.760> as<00:02:42.970> far<00:02:43.150> as

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
didn't come out real strong as far as

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.230 
didn't come out real strong as far as
texturing<00:02:44.070> there<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> letter<00:02:45.580> on<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.000> back

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
texturing there is a letter on this back

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.890 
texturing there is a letter on this back
wall<00:02:46.270> let's<00:02:46.960> see<00:02:47.080> if<00:02:47.170> i<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.380> get<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:47.710> focus

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
wall let's see if i can get this focus

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.850 
wall let's see if i can get this focus
because<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:49.990> can<00:02:50.110> see<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.440> pretty<00:02:50.620> well

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
because you can see that pretty well

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.320 
because you can see that pretty well
actually<00:02:52.920> see<00:02:53.920> how<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:54.220> do<00:02:54.370> here<00:02:54.700> there<00:02:55.120> we<00:02:55.210> go

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
actually see how we do here there we go

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.050 
actually see how we do here there we go
that's<00:02:55.720> pretty<00:02:55.960> good<00:02:56.080> okay<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.580> on<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> back

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
that's pretty good okay so on the back

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.630 
that's pretty good okay so on the back
wall<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.420> can<00:02:58.510> see<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:58.870> ladder<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.770> that's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
wall you can see this ladder and that's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.510 
wall you can see this ladder and that's
actually<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.000> fairly<00:03:01.150> nice<00:03:01.420> textured<00:03:01.960> ladder

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
actually a fairly nice textured ladder

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.950 
actually a fairly nice textured ladder
what<00:03:03.520> i<00:03:03.550> did<00:03:03.790> for<00:03:03.820> this<00:03:04.120> place<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.570> just<00:03:04.750> make<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
what i did for this place is just make a

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.600 
what i did for this place is just make a
little<00:03:05.170> interior<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.220> there's<00:03:06.400> sort<00:03:06.520> of

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
little interior like so there's sort of

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.070 
little interior like so there's sort of
a<00:03:06.700> sunset<00:03:06.910> in<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.209> background<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.870> little

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
a sunset in the background and a little

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.920 
a sunset in the background and a little
hill<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.650> trees<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.550> whatnot<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.150> then<00:03:10.750> in

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
hill and trees and whatnot and then in

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.449 
hill and trees and whatnot and then in
the<00:03:11.020> middle<00:03:11.170> was<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.709> mad<00:03:11.950> scientist

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
the middle was this the mad scientist

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.180 
the middle was this the mad scientist
lab<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.970> again<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.780> can<00:03:13.810> kind<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.170> pick<00:03:15.040> it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
lab and again you can kind of pick it

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.320 
lab and again you can kind of pick it
out<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.340> little<00:03:15.520> bit<00:03:15.610> but<00:03:15.880> there's<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.120> nice

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
out a little bit but there's a nice

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.360 
out a little bit but there's a nice
bookcase<00:03:16.840> there<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.320> there's<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.560> jukebox<00:03:17.860> and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
bookcase there and there's a jukebox and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.820 
bookcase there and there's a jukebox and
anyway<00:03:19.270> it's<00:03:19.660> amazing<00:03:20.050> actually<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.500> some

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
anyway it's amazing actually that some

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.080 
anyway it's amazing actually that some
of<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:20.980> textures<00:03:21.310> came<00:03:21.489> out<00:03:21.610> really<00:03:21.790> really

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
of the textures came out really really

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.130 
of the textures came out really really
nicely<00:03:22.480> surprisingly<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:24.340> know<00:03:24.459> strong<00:03:24.910> oh

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
nicely surprisingly you know strong oh

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.420 
nicely surprisingly you know strong oh
and<00:03:26.140> surprisingly<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.800> rails<00:03:26.950> didn't<00:03:27.310> come

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and surprisingly the rails didn't come

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.070 
and surprisingly the rails didn't come
off<00:03:27.550> that<00:03:27.580> strong<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.209> there's<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.510> oh<00:03:28.630> there's

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
off that strong and there's a oh there's

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.140 
off that strong and there's a oh there's
a<00:03:29.140> portal<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.680> middle<00:03:29.920> anyway<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.030> that's

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
a portal in the middle anyway so that's

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.259 
a portal in the middle anyway so that's
what<00:03:31.330> that<00:03:31.360> guy's<00:03:31.630> about<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:33.030> finally<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.060> did

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
what that guy's about and finally I did

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.690 
what that guy's about and finally I did
this<00:03:34.390> just<00:03:34.660> as<00:03:34.840> an<00:03:34.959> experiment<00:03:35.340> kind<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.519> I

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
this just as an experiment kind of a I

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.949 
this just as an experiment kind of a I
don't<00:03:36.820> know<00:03:36.940> if<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.269> great<00:03:37.630> experiment

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
don't know if it's a great experiment

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.500 
don't know if it's a great experiment
but<00:03:38.260> hey<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:38.410> tried<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.910> idea<00:03:40.060> was<00:03:40.480> that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
but hey I tried it is this idea was that

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.830 
but hey I tried it is this idea was that
I<00:03:41.019> would<00:03:41.830> do<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.070> cross<00:03:42.519> section<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.180> our<00:03:43.420> spawn

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
I would do a cross section of our spawn

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.160 
I would do a cross section of our spawn
area<00:03:44.110> so<00:03:44.920> for<00:03:45.730> people<00:03:45.910> actually<00:03:46.420> no<00:03:46.570> vox<00:03:46.840> Elia

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
area so for people actually no vox Elia

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.070 
area so for people actually no vox Elia
this<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.590> pie<00:03:48.459> in<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.700> sky<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.750> then

there's the underground tree farm

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.780 
there's the underground tree farm
there's<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.720> desert<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.250> sort<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.519> spawn

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
there's the desert this is sort of spawn

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.600 
there's the desert this is sort of spawn
central<00:03:55.470> there's<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.739> fountain<00:03:57.100> area<00:03:57.220> and

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
central there's the fountain area and

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.120 
central there's the fountain area and
then<00:03:58.209> there's<00:03:58.390> this<00:03:58.630> big<00:03:58.870> community<00:03:59.590> station

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
then there's this big community station

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.430 
then there's this big community station
right<00:04:00.280> here<00:04:00.510> that's<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.720> glass<00:04:01.900> top<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.350> the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
right here that's the glass top of the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.340 
right here that's the glass top of the
community<00:04:02.830> station<00:04:04.080> focus<00:04:05.080> a<00:04:05.140> little<00:04:05.200> bit

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
community station focus a little bit

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.190 
community station focus a little bit
better

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
better

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.860 
better
and<00:04:07.090> that's<00:04:08.090> about<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.300> i<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:08.540> thought<00:04:08.750> i'd

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
and that's about it i just thought i'd

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.170 
and that's about it i just thought i'd
try<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.080> do<00:04:09.349> that<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:10.250> mean<00:04:10.760> two<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.060> those

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
try to do that and I mean two of those

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.570 
try to do that and I mean two of those
so<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.569> could<00:04:11.720> give<00:04:11.870> one<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.140> someone<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.650> the

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
so I could give one to someone and the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.580 
so I could give one to someone and the
so<00:04:14.450> it's<00:04:14.629> actually<00:04:14.750> sort<00:04:15.080> of<00:04:15.170> two<00:04:15.379> blocks

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
so it's actually sort of two blocks

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.460 
so it's actually sort of two blocks
thick<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:17.060> on<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.450> side<00:04:17.720> you're<00:04:18.260> seeing

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
thick like on this side you're seeing

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.870 
thick like on this side you're seeing
the<00:04:18.590> other<00:04:18.620> side<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.100> trees<00:04:19.310> basically<00:04:19.850> I

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
the other side of the trees basically I

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.270 
the other side of the trees basically I
sort<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.410> did<00:04:21.410> one<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:21.650> then<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.010> other<00:04:22.040> on

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
sort of did one and then the other on

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.719 
sort of did one and then the other on
the<00:04:22.430> other<00:04:22.580> side<00:04:22.790> just<00:04:23.540> flipping<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:24.020> over<00:04:24.110> and

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
the other side just flipping it over and
