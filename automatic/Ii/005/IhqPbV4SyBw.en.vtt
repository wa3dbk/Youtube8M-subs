we're going to go over here and I want

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.200 
we're going to go over here and I want
to<00:00:33.329> show<00:00:33.900> you<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.310> is<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.520> typical

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
to show you this here this is a typical

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.960 
to show you this here this is a typical
setup<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.050> aquatic<00:00:37.620> animal<00:00:38.100> life<00:00:38.610> support

setup of a aquatic animal life support

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.420 
setup of a aquatic animal life support
system<00:00:39.510> where<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.770> sort<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.100> sump

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
system where you have some sort of sump

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.270 
system where you have some sort of sump
here<00:00:42.170> within<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> sump<00:00:43.680> usually<00:00:44.070> that's<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
here within the sump usually that's a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.890 
here within the sump usually that's a
filtration<00:00:44.550> system<00:00:44.910> maybe<00:00:45.570> we'll<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:45.810> the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
filtration system maybe we'll put the

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.630 
filtration system maybe we'll put the
heater<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.380> here<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
heater in here I don't have the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.800 
heater in here I don't have the
filtration<00:00:48.000> system<00:00:48.150> in<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.660> you're

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
filtration system in here so you're

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.780 
filtration system in here so you're
going<00:00:48.900> to<00:00:48.990> imagine<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.400> have<00:00:50.490> a<00:00:50.550> pump

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
going to imagine that you have a pump

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.540 
going to imagine that you have a pump
here<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:52.020> will<00:00:52.470> take<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> water<00:00:52.860> from<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
here that will take the water from that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.820 
here that will take the water from that
system<00:00:53.880> and<00:00:54.300> shoot<00:00:54.990> it<00:00:55.080> up<00:00:55.170> into<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.650> main

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
system and shoot it up into the main

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.780 
system and shoot it up into the main
tank<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:57.000> tank<00:00:57.620> will<00:00:58.620> fill<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.280> overflow

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
tank the tank will fill then overflow

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.940 
tank the tank will fill then overflow
and<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.570> comes<00:01:00.720> back<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
and it comes back down here so we have a

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.530 
and it comes back down here so we have a
recirculating<00:01:02.760> system<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.330> an<00:01:03.390> ongoing

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
recirculating system it's an ongoing

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.609 
recirculating system it's an ongoing
system<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:05.189> key<00:01:05.369> points<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.619> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
system some key points to this is the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.590 
system some key points to this is the
pump<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.189> pumps<00:01:08.969> come<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.179> different<00:01:09.299> sizes

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
pump here pumps come in different sizes

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.700 
pump here pumps come in different sizes
different<00:01:10.259> flow<00:01:10.469> rates<00:01:12.530> which<00:01:13.530> will

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
different flow rates which will

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.069 
different flow rates which will
determine<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.460> circulation<00:01:14.969> rate<00:01:15.329> so<00:01:15.719> you<00:01:15.749> can

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
determine a circulation rate so you can

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.289 
determine a circulation rate so you can
imagine<00:01:16.289> water<00:01:17.159> coming<00:01:17.579> in<00:01:17.700> through<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.149> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
imagine water coming in through here and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.899 
imagine water coming in through here and
I<00:01:19.289> have<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.469> spray<00:01:19.829> bar<00:01:20.069> across<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.670> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
I have a spray bar across here so that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.660 
I have a spray bar across here so that
water<00:01:21.119> comes<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.749> and<00:01:21.929> it<00:01:22.079> goes<00:01:22.109> across<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.950> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
water comes in and it goes across and so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.370 
water comes in and it goes across and so
we<00:01:23.819> have<00:01:23.999> water<00:01:24.299> circulating<00:01:24.929> from<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
we have water circulating from this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.069 
we have water circulating from this
point<00:01:25.649> over<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.789> point<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.719> common

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
point over to this point one common

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.440 
point over to this point one common
mistake<00:01:28.170> people<00:01:28.439> make<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
mistake people make is they put this the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.289 
mistake people make is they put this the
inlet<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.619> next<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.249> outlet<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.149> your

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
inlet right next to the outlet so your

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.819 
inlet right next to the outlet so your
circulation<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.020> basically<00:01:34.409> goes<00:01:34.590> right

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
circulation just basically goes right

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.300 
circulation just basically goes right
here<00:01:34.859> not<00:01:35.429> a<00:01:35.460> good<00:01:35.700> thing<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.179> this<00:01:36.659> reason

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
here not a good thing for this reason

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
here not a good thing for this reason
fish<00:01:38.310> live<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> system<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.420> eat<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
fish live in the system they eat and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.809 
fish live in the system they eat and
they<00:01:41.179> give<00:01:42.179> off<00:01:42.210> fish<00:01:42.569> waste<00:01:42.869> okay<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
they give off fish waste okay so the

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.300 
they give off fish waste okay so the
point<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> circulation<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.929> one<00:01:46.259> get<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.069> food

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
point of circulation is one get the food

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
point of circulation is one get the food
to<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> fish<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.689> get<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.139> fish<00:01:49.289> waste

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
to the fish and to get the fish waste

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.580 
to the fish and to get the fish waste
out<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.429> system<00:01:50.999> and<00:01:51.179> in<00:01:51.959> to<00:01:52.469> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
out of the system and in to the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.679 
out of the system and in to the
filtration<00:01:52.920> system<00:01:53.219> clean<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> water<00:01:54.209> up<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
filtration system clean the water up and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.959 
filtration system clean the water up and
take<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.899> back<00:01:55.139> in<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.520> circulation

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
take it back in here so that circulation

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.239 
take it back in here so that circulation
is<00:01:57.209> it<00:01:57.329> partially<00:01:57.990> determined<00:01:58.560> by<00:01:58.649> two<00:01:58.979> main

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
is it partially determined by two main

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.279 
is it partially determined by two main
points<00:01:59.520> here<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.359> is<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.659> size<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> pump

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
points here one is the size of the pump

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.629 
points here one is the size of the pump
and<00:02:01.520> two<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:03.149> size<00:02:03.389> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.869> outlet<00:02:04.319> here

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
and two is the size of the outlet here

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:10.550 
and two is the size of the outlet here
okay<00:02:05.639> so<00:02:07.850> these<00:02:08.850> pieces<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.110> are<00:02:10.289> called

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
okay so these pieces here are called

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.710 
okay so these pieces here are called
bulkheads

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
bulkheads

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.480 
bulkheads
as<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:12.770> see<00:02:12.890> there's<00:02:13.070> different<00:02:13.310> sizes

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
as you can see there's different sizes

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.000 
as you can see there's different sizes
to<00:02:13.670> ball<00:02:13.790> kids<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:15.380> don't<00:02:15.440> have<00:02:15.710> one<00:02:15.890> with

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
to ball kids and I don't have one with

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.590 
to ball kids and I don't have one with
me<00:02:16.070> but<00:02:16.340> I've<00:02:16.580> seen<00:02:16.790> them<00:02:16.940> up<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.120> six<00:02:17.390> inches

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
me but I've seen them up to six inches

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.280 
me but I've seen them up to six inches
in<00:02:18.170> diameter<00:02:18.730> okay<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.050> that's<00:02:21.050> what<00:02:21.170> we're

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
in diameter okay so that's what we're

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.600 
in diameter okay so that's what we're
really<00:02:21.380> talking<00:02:21.530> about<00:02:21.650> here<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:22.010> both<00:02:22.340> heads

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
really talking about here is both heads

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.250 
really talking about here is both heads

fitting where you can take water out of

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.470 
fitting where you can take water out of
a<00:02:26.360> system<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.110> hook<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.860> into<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.480> plumbing

disaster don't get sub gaskets on them

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.140 
disaster don't get sub gaskets on them
they<00:02:39.260> tighten<00:02:39.590> up<00:02:39.680> really<00:02:39.950> nicely<00:02:40.190> they're

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
they tighten up really nicely they're

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.050 
they tighten up really nicely they're
very<00:02:41.330> common<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:41.960> this<00:02:42.440> trade<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.820> the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
very common in this trade so that the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.900 
very common in this trade so that the
challenge<00:02:45.020> here<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.260> what<00:02:45.890> size<00:02:46.100> bulkhead<00:02:46.790> do

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
challenge here is what size bulkhead do

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.210 
challenge here is what size bulkhead do
we<00:02:47.060> want<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.360> use<00:02:47.390> okay<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.800> when<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.040> want

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
we want to use okay and so when I want

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.030 
we want to use okay and so when I want
to<00:02:49.280> show<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.430> then<00:02:49.640> over<00:02:49.850> here<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:51.590> here<00:02:51.890> is

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
to show you then over here this here is

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.260 
to show you then over here this here is
a<00:02:52.570> pump<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.660> has<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.780> one<00:02:54.080> inch<00:02:54.290> outlet<00:02:54.590> size<00:02:55.270> one

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
a pump it has a one inch outlet size one

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.240 
a pump it has a one inch outlet size one
inch

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250

pumps<00:02:58.250> like<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.670> typically<00:02:59.510> on<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.470> average

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
pumps like this typically on the average

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.220 
pumps like this typically on the average
will<00:03:01.010> pump<00:03:01.190> around<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.120> thousand<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.690> 1500

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
will pump around a thousand to 1500

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.490 
will pump around a thousand to 1500
gallons<00:03:03.350> per<00:03:03.770> hour<00:03:04.120> okay<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:06.410> know

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
gallons per hour okay and so you know

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.420 
gallons per hour okay and so you know
that's<00:03:06.620> probably<00:03:06.950> more<00:03:07.100> than<00:03:07.220> what<00:03:07.340> we<00:03:07.400> need

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
that's probably more than what we need

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.460 
that's probably more than what we need
for<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.910> system<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:08.990> a<00:03:09.080> real<00:03:09.260> common

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
for this system but it's a real common

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.160 
for this system but it's a real common
pump<00:03:09.860> it's<00:03:10.130> real<00:03:10.310> common<00:03:10.520> fitting<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.240> so<00:03:11.780> you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
pump it's real common fitting and so you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.050 
pump it's real common fitting and so you
have<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.530> much<00:03:12.770> water<00:03:13.370> coming<00:03:13.670> through<00:03:13.880> here

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
have that much water coming through here

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
have that much water coming through here
it's<00:03:14.150> going<00:03:14.240> to<00:03:14.330> come<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.510> through<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.690> one<00:03:14.900> inch

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
it's going to come in through a one inch

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.370 
it's going to come in through a one inch
pipe<00:03:15.580> typically<00:03:16.580> what<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.140> student<00:03:18.140> will<00:03:18.260> do

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
pipe typically what the student will do

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.410 
pipe typically what the student will do
or<00:03:18.590> new<00:03:18.739> person<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.310> trade<00:03:19.550> will<00:03:19.730> do<00:03:19.880> will

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
or new person to the trade will do will

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.479 
or new person to the trade will do will
have<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.570> 1<00:03:20.780> inch<00:03:20.959> coming<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.410> here<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.459> just

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
have a 1 inch coming in here so it just

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.640 
have a 1 inch coming in here so it just
makes<00:03:22.790> sense<00:03:22.910> let's<00:03:23.750> take<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.930> 1<00:03:24.170> inch<00:03:24.320> coming

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
makes sense let's take a 1 inch coming

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.850 
makes sense let's take a 1 inch coming
out<00:03:24.770> here<00:03:25.190> okay<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.270> so<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:27.290> here<00:03:27.530> against

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
out here okay and so this here against

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.220 
out here okay and so this here against
our<00:03:27.950> bulkhead<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:28.850> little<00:03:29.080> tool<00:03:30.080> we

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
our bulkhead and this little tool we

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.470 
our bulkhead and this little tool we
have<00:03:30.380> here<00:03:30.650> I've<00:03:31.100> just<00:03:31.310> downsized<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.270> with

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
have here I've just downsized it with

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.960 
have here I've just downsized it with
these<00:03:32.660> reducer<00:03:33.200> fittings<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.860> simulate<00:03:34.730> a

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
these reducer fittings to simulate a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.979 
these reducer fittings to simulate a
one-inch<00:03:35.570> bulkhead<00:03:36.440> opening<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.900> is

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
one-inch bulkhead opening and so this is

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.390 
one-inch bulkhead opening and so this is
what<00:03:39.110> happens<00:03:39.470> when<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.800> do<00:03:40.220> this

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
what happens when you do this

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.310 
what happens when you do this
arrangement<00:03:40.820> again<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.180> real<00:03:41.390> typical<00:03:41.630> error

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
arrangement again a real typical error

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.170 
arrangement again a real typical error
you<00:03:43.010> have<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.130> one<00:03:43.280> inch<00:03:43.430> line<00:03:43.610> coming<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:44.030> we

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
you have a one inch line coming in we

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.699 
you have a one inch line coming in we
want<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.390> have<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> one<00:03:44.750> inch<00:03:44.900> hole<00:03:45.140> coming<00:03:45.470> out

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
want to have a one inch hole coming out

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.979 
want to have a one inch hole coming out
or<00:03:46.010> one<00:03:46.250> inch<00:03:46.400> bulkhead<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.570> this<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.870> what

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
or one inch bulkhead and this is what

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.000 
or one inch bulkhead and this is what
happens<00:03:48.440> here<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.959> if<00:03:51.019> you<00:03:51.080> can<00:03:51.200> imagine<00:03:51.410> this

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
happens here so if you can imagine this

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.880 
happens here so if you can imagine this
is<00:03:52.070> your<00:03:52.310> tank<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.760> your<00:03:53.170> your<00:03:54.170> setup<00:03:54.560> above

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
is your tank and your your setup above

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.130 
is your tank and your your setup above
you<00:03:55.820> know<00:03:55.910> some<00:03:56.150> really<00:03:56.239> nice<00:03:56.450> carpeting<00:03:56.989> or

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
you know some really nice carpeting or

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.229 
you know some really nice carpeting or
wood<00:03:57.350> floor<00:03:57.650> now<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.310> have<00:03:58.550> water<00:03:58.760> all<00:03:59.209> over

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
wood floor now you have water all over

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.030 
wood floor now you have water all over
your<00:03:59.570> floor<00:03:59.690> obviously<00:04:00.500> it's<00:04:00.620> not<00:04:00.709> what<00:04:00.920> we

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
your floor obviously it's not what we

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.690 
your floor obviously it's not what we
want<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.370> do<00:04:01.550> so<00:04:02.239> we<00:04:02.630> need<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.840> figure<00:04:03.019> out<00:04:03.700> what

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
want to do so we need to figure out what

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.440 
want to do so we need to figure out what
size<00:04:04.930> bulkhead<00:04:05.930> opening<00:04:06.440> would<00:04:07.160> work<00:04:08.090> best

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
size bulkhead opening would work best

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.190 
size bulkhead opening would work best
with<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:09.440> size<00:04:10.010> outlet<00:04:10.610> okay<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.690> it's

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
with this size outlet okay and so it's

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.690 
with this size outlet okay and so it's
really<00:04:12.320> nice<00:04:12.530> here<00:04:12.860> we<00:04:12.890> start<00:04:13.310> doing<00:04:13.459> this

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
really nice here we start doing this

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.910 
really nice here we start doing this
taking<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.180> off<00:04:14.390> we'll<00:04:15.110> see<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.410> water<00:04:15.620> flow

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
taking this off we'll see the water flow

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.860 
taking this off we'll see the water flow
starting<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.370> come<00:04:16.519> down<00:04:16.549> now<00:04:17.480> we're<00:04:17.630> at<00:04:17.750> about

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
starting to come down now we're at about

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.330 
starting to come down now we're at about
I<00:04:18.019> think<00:04:18.560> it's<00:04:18.739> an<00:04:18.799> inch<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.100> quarter

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
I think it's an inch and a quarter

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.780 
I think it's an inch and a quarter
opening<00:04:20.020> this<00:04:21.020> here<00:04:21.460> would<00:04:22.460> represent

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.060 

an<00:04:26.790> inch<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.180> half<00:04:27.210> opening<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.500> see<00:04:28.740> well

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
an inch and a half opening you see well

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.290 
an inch and a half opening you see well
we're<00:04:29.250> getting<00:04:29.400> pretty<00:04:29.640> close<00:04:29.790> here<00:04:30.060> water

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
we're getting pretty close here water

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300 
we're getting pretty close here water
level<00:04:30.570> starting<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.870> come<00:04:31.020> down<00:04:31.260> if<00:04:32.040> we<00:04:32.160> go

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
level starting to come down if we go

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.530 
level starting to come down if we go
here<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.940> next<00:04:33.210> size<00:04:35.030> now<00:04:36.030> we're<00:04:36.180> at<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.300> two

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
here to the next size now we're at a two

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.760 
here to the next size now we're at a two
inch<00:04:36.720> opening<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.200> can<00:04:37.290> see<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.470> water<00:04:37.680> level

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
inch opening you can see the water level

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.760 
inch opening you can see the water level
comes<00:04:38.160> down<00:04:38.370> quite<00:04:38.700> substantially<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.590> this

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
comes down quite substantially so this

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.980 
comes down quite substantially so this
was<00:04:40.920> your<00:04:41.040> tank<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:42.300> could<00:04:42.420> probably<00:04:42.660> run

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
was your tank you could probably run

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.500 
was your tank you could probably run
this<00:04:43.260> pretty<00:04:43.500> safely<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.850> know<00:04:44.910> that<00:04:45.270> noise

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
this pretty safely you know that noise

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.480 
this pretty safely you know that noise
is<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:45.900> siphon<00:04:46.530> effect<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:47.010> occurs<00:04:47.100> and

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
is a siphon effect that occurs and

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.060 
is a siphon effect that occurs and
that's<00:04:47.640> why<00:04:48.080> instead<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.320> going<00:04:49.620> just<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.920> two

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
that's why instead of going just a two

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.650 
that's why instead of going just a two
inch<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.520> might<00:04:50.700> even<00:04:50.790> want<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.060> go<00:04:51.180> back<00:04:51.210> up

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
inch you might even want to go back up

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.990 
inch you might even want to go back up
to<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.930> next<00:04:52.140> size<00:04:52.340> which<00:04:53.340> is<00:04:53.460> two<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:53.670> a<00:04:53.820> half

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
to the next size which is two and a half

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.080 
to the next size which is two and a half
inch<00:04:55.040> now<00:04:56.040> you're<00:04:56.250> safe<00:04:56.520> if<00:04:56.760> something

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
inch now you're safe if something

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.990 
inch now you're safe if something
happens<00:04:57.540> something<00:04:57.750> clogs<00:04:58.170> it's<00:04:58.350> opening

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
happens something clogs it's opening

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.610 
happens something clogs it's opening
you're<00:05:00.000> still<00:05:00.150> going<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.300> have<00:05:00.420> room<00:05:00.660> to

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
you're still going to have room to

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.060 
you're still going to have room to
prevent<00:05:02.040> overflow<00:05:02.700> so<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:04.650> like<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.860> say<00:05:05.040> a

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
prevent overflow so you like to say a

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.370 
prevent overflow so you like to say a
good<00:05:05.340> basic<00:05:05.850> rule<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.390> whatever<00:05:06.600> size<00:05:06.990> coming

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
good basic rule is whatever size coming

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.700 
good basic rule is whatever size coming
in<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:08.400> double<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.850> size<00:05:09.060> going<00:05:09.870> out<00:05:10.050> so<00:05:10.590> if<00:05:10.680> I

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
in you double the size going out so if I

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.950 
in you double the size going out so if I
have<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:10.890> one<00:05:11.040> inch<00:05:11.190> line<00:05:11.400> coming<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.030> I<00:05:12.270> do<00:05:12.870> a

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
have a one inch line coming in I do a

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.040 
have a one inch line coming in I do a
two<00:05:13.260> inch<00:05:13.470> opening<00:05:14.180> going<00:05:15.180> out<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.840> then<00:05:15.930> to

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
two inch opening going out and then to

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.750 
two inch opening going out and then to
be<00:05:16.170> safe<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.620> like<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:16.920> go<00:05:17.010> up<00:05:17.130> one<00:05:17.310> half<00:05:17.490> inch

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
be safe I like to go up one half inch

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.100 
be safe I like to go up one half inch
farthest<00:05:18.210> now<00:05:18.420> we're<00:05:18.600> at<00:05:18.660> three<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:18.990> half

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
farthest now we're at three and a half

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.430 
farthest now we're at three and a half
inch<00:05:19.380> this<00:05:19.620> way<00:05:20.160> allows<00:05:20.900> maximum<00:05:21.900> flow<00:05:22.230> out<00:05:22.410> of

inch this way allows maximum flow out of

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.440 
inch this way allows maximum flow out of
this<00:05:22.650> pump<00:05:22.950> going<00:05:23.430> through<00:05:23.640> this<00:05:23.760> system<00:05:24.030> and

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
this pump going through this system and

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.630 
this pump going through this system and
the<00:05:25.230> point<00:05:25.440> being<00:05:25.500> there<00:05:26.070> is<00:05:26.160> another<00:05:26.400> option

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
the point being there is another option

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.910 
the point being there is another option
I<00:05:27.030> could<00:05:27.270> come<00:05:27.420> over<00:05:27.450> here<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.320> turn<00:05:28.500> my<00:05:28.650> valve

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
I could come over here and turn my valve

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.460 
I could come over here and turn my valve
and<00:05:29.250> I<00:05:29.310> could<00:05:29.430> turn<00:05:29.520> my<00:05:29.580> valve<00:05:29.910> down<00:05:30.290> so<00:05:31.290> now<00:05:31.440> I

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
and I could turn my valve down so now I

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.320 
and I could turn my valve down so now I
valve<00:05:31.860> my<00:05:32.040> water<00:05:32.250> down<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.580> where<00:05:32.940> let's<00:05:33.240> say

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
valve my water down to where let's say

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.390 
valve my water down to where let's say
half<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.810> water<00:05:33.960> is<00:05:34.110> coming<00:05:34.230> out<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:35.160> that<00:05:35.340> I

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
half the water is coming out and that I

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.830 
half the water is coming out and that I
could<00:05:35.580> reattach<00:05:35.790> all<00:05:36.210> those<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:36.510> probably<00:05:36.750> go

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
could reattach all those and probably go

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.630 
could reattach all those and probably go
back<00:05:36.990> down<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.470> one<00:05:37.680> inch<00:05:37.920> opening<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.490> it

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
back down to one inch opening and it

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.630 
back down to one inch opening and it
probably<00:05:38.940> would<00:05:39.060> work<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:40.620> problem<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.610> that

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
probably would work the problem of that

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.090 
probably would work the problem of that
is<00:05:41.760> you've<00:05:42.300> reduced<00:05:42.630> circulation<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.590> our

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
is you've reduced circulation and our

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.220 
is you've reduced circulation and our
goal<00:05:44.340> is<00:05:44.640> to<00:05:44.670> get<00:05:44.940> as<00:05:45.090> much<00:05:45.360> circulation<00:05:46.020> as

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
goal is to get as much circulation as

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.900 
goal is to get as much circulation as
possible<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:47.190> other<00:05:47.280> thing<00:05:47.490> I<00:05:47.550> want<00:05:47.700> to<00:05:47.760> grab

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
possible the other thing I want to grab

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.760 
possible the other thing I want to grab
a<00:05:47.940> bulkhead<00:05:48.360> right<00:05:48.570> here<00:05:48.870> the<00:05:49.350> other<00:05:49.470> thing<00:05:49.620> to

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
a bulkhead right here the other thing to

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.800 
a bulkhead right here the other thing to
consider<00:05:49.890> too<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.580> know<00:05:50.670> you<00:05:50.730> might<00:05:51.030> say<00:05:51.300> why

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
consider too you know you might say why

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.600 
consider too you know you might say why
not<00:05:51.840> just<00:05:52.140> goes<00:05:52.260> big<00:05:52.710> as<00:05:52.830> bulkhead<00:05:53.220> as<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.430> can

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
not just goes big as bulkhead as I can

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.870 
not just goes big as bulkhead as I can
go<00:05:53.790> well<00:05:54.450> the<00:05:54.510> problem<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:54.900> is<00:05:55.110> is<00:05:55.440> size<00:05:56.040> the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
go well the problem that is is size the

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.400 
go well the problem that is is size the
bigger<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.210> bulkhead<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.750> farther<00:05:57.990> down<00:05:58.260> I'm

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
bigger the bulkhead the farther down I'm

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.820 
bigger the bulkhead the farther down I'm
going<00:05:58.560> to<00:05:58.590> have<00:05:58.770> to<00:05:58.920> go<00:05:59.070> on<00:05:59.340> my<00:05:59.790> aquarium<00:06:00.330> and

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
going to have to go on my aquarium and

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.960 
going to have to go on my aquarium and
cost<00:06:01.830> of<00:06:02.070> course<00:06:02.220> costs<00:06:02.460> are<00:06:02.550> going<00:06:02.640> to<00:06:02.700> go<00:06:02.820> up

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
cost of course costs are going to go up

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.060 
cost of course costs are going to go up
the<00:06:03.210> bigger<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:03.540> bulkhead<00:06:03.960> so<00:06:04.590> you<00:06:04.710> can<00:06:04.920> see

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
the bigger the bulkhead so you can see

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.740 
the bigger the bulkhead so you can see
with<00:06:05.190> this<00:06:05.280> one<00:06:05.520> here<00:06:05.850> we<00:06:06.270> made<00:06:06.450> a<00:06:06.480> lot<00:06:06.600> of

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
with this one here we made a lot of

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.000 
with this one here we made a lot of
extra<00:06:06.960> room<00:06:06.990> just<00:06:07.350> so<00:06:07.470> we<00:06:07.590> can<00:06:07.680> show<00:06:07.830> the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
extra room just so we can show the

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.190 
extra room just so we can show the
overflow<00:06:08.460> but<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.720> would<00:06:09.840> have<00:06:09.960> to<00:06:10.050> go<00:06:10.170> down

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
overflow but you would have to go down

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.380 
overflow but you would have to go down
at<00:06:10.470> least<00:06:10.620> that<00:06:10.860> much<00:06:11.220> to<00:06:11.550> make<00:06:11.670> this<00:06:11.850> bulkhead

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
at least that much to make this bulkhead

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.110 
at least that much to make this bulkhead
work<00:06:12.810> if<00:06:13.530> you<00:06:13.650> go<00:06:13.770> a<00:06:13.800> four<00:06:14.130> inch<00:06:14.370> or<00:06:14.610> six-inch

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
work if you go a four inch or six-inch

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.240 
work if you go a four inch or six-inch
bulkhead<00:06:15.690> you're<00:06:15.840> going<00:06:16.140> down<00:06:16.260> this<00:06:16.470> far<00:06:16.770> and

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
bulkhead you're going down this far and

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.310 
bulkhead you're going down this far and
what<00:06:17.400> happens<00:06:17.820> is<00:06:18.030> water<00:06:18.360> is<00:06:18.660> going<00:06:18.840> to<00:06:18.960> go<00:06:19.170> out

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
what happens is water is going to go out

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.960 
what happens is water is going to go out
through<00:06:19.500> this<00:06:19.740> hole<00:06:19.800> and<00:06:20.280> probably<00:06:20.820> never

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
through this hole and probably never

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.090 
through this hole and probably never
fill<00:06:21.270> up<00:06:21.420> to<00:06:21.540> here<00:06:21.840> so<00:06:22.530> if<00:06:22.590> I<00:06:22.680> have<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:22.800> bulkhead

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
fill up to here so if I have a bulkhead

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.370 
fill up to here so if I have a bulkhead
down<00:06:23.430> here<00:06:23.970> this<00:06:24.690> is<00:06:24.810> all<00:06:24.900> going<00:06:25.050> to<00:06:25.110> be<00:06:25.200> empty

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
down here this is all going to be empty

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.590 
down here this is all going to be empty
it's<00:06:26.220> going<00:06:26.370> to<00:06:26.430> really<00:06:26.610> waste<00:06:26.820> my<00:06:27.060> space<00:06:27.360> so<00:06:27.540> I

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
it's going to really waste my space so I

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.460 
it's going to really waste my space so I
want<00:06:27.840> to<00:06:27.930> go<00:06:28.080> as<00:06:28.800> big<00:06:29.160> as<00:06:29.220> I<00:06:29.460> need<00:06:29.700> but<00:06:30.470> no

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
want to go as big as I need but no

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.230 
want to go as big as I need but no
smaller<00:06:31.830> and<00:06:32.130> no<00:06:32.250> bigger<00:06:32.460> you<00:06:32.850> want<00:06:33.000> to<00:06:33.060> get<00:06:33.150> as

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
smaller and no bigger you want to get as

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.980 
smaller and no bigger you want to get as
close<00:06:33.390> as<00:06:33.450> you<00:06:33.600> can<00:06:33.780> to<00:06:33.840> the<00:06:34.020> right<00:06:34.230> side

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
close as you can to the right side

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.880 
close as you can to the right side
that<00:06:36.990> way<00:06:37.110> you'll<00:06:37.260> show<00:06:37.410> yourself

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
that way you'll show yourself

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.340 
that way you'll show yourself
circulation<00:06:38.730> and<00:06:38.970> you'll<00:06:39.150> assure<00:06:39.900> yourself

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
circulation and you'll assure yourself

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.050 
circulation and you'll assure yourself
having<00:06:41.010> healthy<00:06:41.250> fish<00:06:41.460> for<00:06:41.730> plenty<00:06:41.970> of

circulation for them again take waste

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:54.450 
circulation for them again take waste
away<00:06:45.180> and<00:06:45.300> bring<00:06:45.600> food<00:06:45.810> to<00:06:45.960> them
