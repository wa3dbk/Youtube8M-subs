00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.390
 well here what we will do is I'm going to 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:06.950
 try to show already I think many 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.080
 problems for people who do not know the 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.530
 program the chips how the program is programmed 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.540
 chip the ice b2 b1 and b2 is the same ok 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.320
 here what we come to you 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.330
 and connect the cable d 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.930
 nothing else stays 5 volts and the one 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.430
 earth to the chip and the other side all what 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.700
 what are we going to do with him this is let's 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.310
 occupy and then this way an old chin 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.379
 that does not serve you in this case this one 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.850
 remove the pins that come in the chip 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.300
 we dry here here they come we take off 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.020
 these 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.540
 and we proceed to do this 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.000
 this you have to do either 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.440
 colors that you said but that 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.920
 agree with those inside ok 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.300
 here in this is black red moli blue 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.350
 White 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.870
 and in this I have them in a sequence 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.160
 they were like this 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.360
 ok and now these long slabs and you put them 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.610
 here we have sequence 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.040
 red black yellow blue this is the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.300
 white and the other one that follows although here 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.990
 I already have different colors 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.900
 whereby they are here 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.270
 here what we do this 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.370
 let's connect is today to program with 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.370
 1 in x connect unam x 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.160
 and we connect this 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:49.030
 here we connect 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.030
 there it is connected is it says 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.550
 in this case here is the one that says ve cc 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.790
 it is the current that says on the axis of 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.590
 land so that they also know here 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.100
 current and earth so that it does not 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.350
 wrong they did not connect reverse is already 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.479
 connected to our chip this turns on 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.580
 automatically as soon as it connects 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.650
 this without turning on the power to the console 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.870
 but we are going to put the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.099
 current because if you need it 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.099
 up to the current 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.060
 we are going to do it using 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:34.530
 the car hehe and he 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:37.020
 j here we give you are scheduled 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.220
 to see how his body some trinity the 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.790
 based on trinity 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.319
 that with that grille h2a that you put on 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.999
 the first box 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.999
 and here I am going to assume the protection 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.220
 here it must be because 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.080
 it's an x we 're not going to schedule 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.240
 I have it in this folder to all 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.840
 files in this folder can download 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.300
 from the page on the other side dot net 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.870
 we open here there for color which 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.770
 with gas per trinity and the other one we are going to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.570
 use the trinity 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:19.170
 you're going to put it in 300 of gears we open 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.450
 let's use this the 60 03 and here we see 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.050
 that there is nothing here what we do is 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.050
 delete here 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.750
 we delete and we put the letter t we are going to 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.060
 go out 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.910
 here they are they do not appear invisible but 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.320
 can only talk try and leave here I 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.980
 has worked very well for trinity is 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.680
 this 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.269
 the one who made the 0-5 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.890
 of 60.6 we give you click and we give in 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.760
 open 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.099
 here we will see how to give it open 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.680
 start learning another chip we are going to 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.560
 I'll open it and turn it on 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.280
 trichet that is programming there that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.340
 program what the gray program says 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.129
 is scheduled, we are going to accept 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.129
 she leaves you without a new program or 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:14.510
 everything makes a mistake you go out and you already have 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:18.139
 the chip programmed for a dye that's 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.449
 for any plate you choose the team 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.240
 that you want and it is for any plate 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.370
 and now let's do with him with this 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.130
 another one that is easier 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.430
 this is a little easier here we are going to 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.430
 give him 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.389
 in this window and in the first 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.090
 after the first one that comes out to this 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.169
 another window 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.490
 and here we will give in this to them 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.190
 here 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.220
 and here they all come out easier 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.409
 I do not see back to see 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.169
 it's the same gift folder 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.880
 to keiko which with the same files of the 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.940
 water of 20 300 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.610
 in 60 06 and here if you get the 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.370
 files as they are and we already choose the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.430
 same or the one that you want this one also 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.850
 works well this also I have 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.670
 done with this one more double clicks and the 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.020
 you will return the role 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.889
 and this starts to program 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.750
 where saws are already programmed and 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.930
 it is also the same as it is already programmed 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.580
 that I never do to program 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.000
 this the folder in the files that 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.000
 they call 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.370
 of these 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.270
 what is the ms of times 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.630
 efe mc that the truth I do not know how to use them for 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.310
 that they are but I have worked 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.510
 well as I'm planning the brooch 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.510
 so I do not blame them 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.840
 Here are the ones recommended for 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.960
 you do it 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.139
 tiny tim crown was with gaspar falcon 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.590
 spend and the other and this also allows 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.590
 these 2 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:20.910
 that 's how they connect 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:25.430
 in the c b1 b2 it is the same 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:27.410
 FAT connections 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.570
 here you have to remove this when you go to 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:33.210
 put me for you and from here the bridge of 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.759
 here grab you for the point 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.600
 well I remember what a point it is but 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.860
 the farc 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.860
 there in the tutorial he will say 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.830
 this is a fac connection 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.650
 this is a v12 in fa 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.919
 and a b 12 in trinity 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:57.190
 and the same the two programmed here 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.930
 comes an explanation of how you do it and 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.509
 all this you find on the page of 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.759
 other side dot net wait serve you 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:06.550
 all chips are programmed equal 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:09.669
 it is also the same there is a sequence 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.229
 with the porridge reprogram the cables 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.840
 they come in the same color 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:16.860
 here they are attracted by gender names 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.550
 cable in the red says 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.699
 sometimes in the black it says in egb and so 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.500
 successively in this part it is easier 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.349
 still to see the strange stimulus by 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.259
 that I put this piece to tell you compare 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:33.750
 to know what is the top part and 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:36.620
 well this Monday has served them all 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:41.210
 the guys you have to put to 5 volts 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.210
 and earth 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.910
 for life to be scheduled now 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:53.120
 programmed you already removed these and local 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:56.000
 Well, it's going to talk perfectly, I hope 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.320
 serve them and then every time again 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.330
 the in the team that occupies for your console 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.330
 the peoples of that help
