00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.399 
polish in dark matter this is one of the
smaller<00:01:47.369> sizes<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> got<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.750> set<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
smaller sizes that I got in a set and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.990 
smaller sizes that I got in a set and
when<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> first<00:01:49.890> try<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.520> i<00:01:50.580> thought<00:01:50.939> i

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
when I first try this on i thought i

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
when I first try this on i thought i
would<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.390> more<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> blue<00:01:51.990> tone<00:01:52.289> to<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
would have more of a blue tone to it

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350 
would have more of a blue tone to it
because<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.310> look<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:53.909> closely

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
because if you look at it really closely

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.320 
because if you look at it really closely
it<00:01:54.899> does<00:01:55.439> look<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:56.220> it<00:01:56.460> might<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.970> really

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
it does look like it might be a really

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.779 
it does look like it might be a really
really<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.899> dark<00:01:58.229> blue<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:59.399> it

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
really really dark blue but it

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.790 
really really dark blue but it
definitely<00:02:00.090> looks<00:02:00.659> black<00:02:00.929> on<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.140> nails<00:02:01.470> but

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
definitely looks black on the nails but

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.370 
definitely looks black on the nails but
it's<00:02:01.950> such<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.520> great<00:02:02.729> formula<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.720> its<00:02:04.050> really

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it's such a great formula and its really

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620 
it's such a great formula and its really
really<00:02:04.590> shiny<00:02:05.039> which<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.640> nice<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.390> just

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
really shiny which is nice and it's just

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.509 
really shiny which is nice and it's just
a<00:02:06.720> really<00:02:06.750> wearable<00:02:07.409> black<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.190> I've
