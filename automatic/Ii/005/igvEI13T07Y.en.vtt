00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.700 

so<00:00:03.689> this<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.790> the<00:00:05.790> Pulsar<00:00:06.420> pompton<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.109> no<00:00:07.170> idea

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
so this is the Pulsar pompton a no idea

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.110 
so this is the Pulsar pompton a no idea
so<00:00:08.519> basically<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.179> would<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> Trump

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
so basically you would have a Trump

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.870 
so basically you would have a Trump
section<00:00:12.120> which<00:00:12.570> 7<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> 15<00:00:13.530> centimeter<00:00:14.460> pipe

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
section which 7 to 15 centimeter pipe

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.290 
section which 7 to 15 centimeter pipe
that<00:00:15.330> will<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:16.650> say<00:00:16.980> 1/2<00:00:17.279> meter<00:00:17.670> head<00:00:17.940> or

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
that will have say 1/2 meter head or

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.830 
that will have say 1/2 meter head or
less<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.750> could<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.080> say<00:00:19.560> from<00:00:20.150> 35<00:00:21.150> centimeters

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
less it could be say from 35 centimeters

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.880 
less it could be say from 35 centimeters
to<00:00:22.369> half<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.519> meter<00:00:23.670> ahead<00:00:24.590> you'll<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.769> about

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
to half a meter ahead you'll have about

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.169 
to half a meter ahead you'll have about
1<00:00:26.310> meter<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:27.740> depth<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.010> your<00:00:29.189> Trump<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
1 meter of depth to your Trump so it's a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.690 
1 meter of depth to your Trump so it's a
very<00:00:30.420> low<00:00:30.599> pressure<00:00:31.070> Trump<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> that's<00:00:32.489> why

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
very low pressure Trump and that's why

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.630 
very low pressure Trump and that's why
I'm<00:00:32.820> telling<00:00:33.000> as<00:00:33.239> possible<00:00:33.809> nano<00:00:34.070> anyway<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
I'm telling as possible nano anyway the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.049 
I'm telling as possible nano anyway the
Trump<00:00:35.910> produces<00:00:36.480> air<00:00:36.750> under<00:00:37.020> pressure<00:00:38.059> comes

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
Trump produces air under pressure comes

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.869 
Trump produces air under pressure comes
up<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.390> pipe<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.489> goes<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:43.879> your

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
up this pipe here and goes to your your

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.170 
up this pipe here and goes to your your
airlift<00:00:45.300> section<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:47.340> pipe<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:47.910> could

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
airlift section and this pipe here could

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.890 
airlift section and this pipe here could
be

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.760 

Garan<00:00:51.590> holes<00:00:51.800> you<00:00:52.130> know<00:00:52.220> something

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
Garan holes you know something

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.790 
Garan holes you know something
and<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.930> 10<00:00:55.930> or<00:00:55.960> 12<00:00:57.900> millimeter<00:00:58.900> diameter<00:00:59.170> pipe

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
and a 10 or 12 millimeter diameter pipe

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.840 
and a 10 or 12 millimeter diameter pipe
and<00:01:00.730> then<00:01:00.880> we<00:01:01.290> split<00:01:02.290> up<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:02.800> you'll<00:01:02.950> have<00:01:03.220> a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
and then we split up and you'll have a

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.630 
and then we split up and you'll have a
bundle<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:06.240> quarter-inch<00:01:07.240> or<00:01:07.570> six<00:01:08.470> or<00:01:09.370> five

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
bundle of quarter-inch or six or five

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.090 
bundle of quarter-inch or six or five
millimeter<00:01:10.360> pipes<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:11.620> will<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:13.450> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
millimeter pipes that will do the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.580 
millimeter pipes that will do the
pumping<00:01:15.100> by<00:01:15.310> slope<00:01:15.610> flow<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:17.229> height<00:01:17.410> that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
pumping by slope flow to the height that

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.160 
pumping by slope flow to the height that
you<00:01:17.650> need<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.220> will<00:01:19.120> have<00:01:19.270> your<00:01:19.390> tea<00:01:19.690> joints

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
you need and will have your tea joints

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.179 
you need and will have your tea joints
here<00:01:20.470> sorry<00:01:21.250> for<00:01:21.310> some<00:01:21.750> tea<00:01:22.750> joints

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
here sorry for some tea joints

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.249 
here sorry for some tea joints
taking<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.909> water<00:01:26.090> from<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.509> reservoir<00:01:26.630> and

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
taking the water from the reservoir and

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.539 
taking the water from the reservoir and
the<00:01:27.920> bundle<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.420> pipes<00:01:29.420> going<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:30.170> height<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.520> I

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
the bundle of pipes going to height so I

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.289 
the bundle of pipes going to height so I
can't<00:01:31.909> do<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.180> myself<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.110> if<00:01:33.259> anyone<00:01:34.299> wants

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
can't do this myself so if anyone wants

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.700 
can't do this myself so if anyone wants
to<00:01:35.479> try<00:01:35.689> it<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.079> would<00:01:36.229> be<00:01:37.810> tall<00:01:38.810> intensive

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
to try it it would be tall intensive

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.039 
to try it it would be tall intensive
purposes<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.399> would<00:01:40.700> be<00:01:40.899> totally<00:01:41.899> new

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
purposes it would be totally new

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.309 
purposes it would be totally new
research<00:01:42.439> but<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:43.070> have<00:01:43.340> done<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:43.579> few<00:01:44.319> trials

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
research but I have done a few trials

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.910 
research but I have done a few trials
that<00:01:45.590> indicate<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.720> six<00:01:47.720> five<00:01:48.289> four

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that indicate that six five four

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.889 
that indicate that six five four
millimeter<00:01:49.490> pipes<00:01:49.819> would<00:01:50.149> be<00:01:50.299> ideal<00:01:50.630> for

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
millimeter pipes would be ideal for

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.540 
millimeter pipes would be ideal for
pumping<00:01:52.299> with<00:01:53.299> this

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.140 

this<00:01:57.180> idea<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.750> guess<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.760> certainly<00:01:59.760> can<00:01:59.970> be

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
this idea I guess and certainly can be

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.760 
this idea I guess and certainly can be
done<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.520> Eileen<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.730> Texas<00:02:03.120> has<00:02:03.390> done<00:02:03.900> hardly

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
done and Eileen in Texas has done hardly

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.660 
done and Eileen in Texas has done hardly
-<00:02:04.830> models<00:02:05.250> -<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.890> she<00:02:07.890> thinks<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.490> done

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
- models - and she thinks it can be done

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.340 
- models - and she thinks it can be done
-<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:09.240> go<00:02:10.170> ahead<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:10.560> try<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:12.350> basically

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
- so go ahead and try it and basically

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.540 
- so go ahead and try it and basically
you'll<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:14.660> its<00:02:15.660> new<00:02:16.170> research<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.620> big

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
you'll be its new research that big

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.610 
you'll be its new research that big
science<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.000> never<00:02:18.270> ever<00:02:18.570> going<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:19.050> I've

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
science is never ever going to do I've

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.530 
science is never ever going to do I've
waited<00:02:19.920> 20<00:02:20.340> years<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.640> them<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> even<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.420> look

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
waited 20 years for them to even to look

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.770 
waited 20 years for them to even to look
at<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:23.150> it's<00:02:24.150> not<00:02:24.270> going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> happen

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
at this so it's not going to happen

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.460 
at this so it's not going to happen
unless<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.240> others<00:02:27.360> get<00:02:28.020> down<00:02:28.230> to

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
unless you and I and others get down to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.450 
unless you and I and others get down to
the<00:02:29.220> nitty-gritty<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:31.040> produce<00:02:32.040> some

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
the nitty-gritty and produce some

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.160 
the nitty-gritty and produce some
working<00:02:33.030> models<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.370> basically<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:36.170> show

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
working models and basically just show

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
working models and basically just show
that<00:02:37.200> what's<00:02:37.740> possible<00:02:38.570> thank<00:02:39.570> you
