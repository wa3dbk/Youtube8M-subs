contact<00:02:51.570> with<00:02:51.720> water<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.260> as<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.740> see

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
contact with water so as you can see

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.310 
contact with water so as you can see

there we go as you see what pops out was
an<00:04:14.640> eye<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.540> ender<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.680> usually<00:04:17.220> a

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
an eye of ender so that is usually a

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.009 
an eye of ender so that is usually a
really<00:04:17.700> really<00:04:18.120> difficult<00:04:18.239> thing<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.810> come

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
really really difficult thing to come

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.380 
really really difficult thing to come
across<00:04:19.229> and<00:04:19.580> yeah<00:04:20.580> you've<00:04:20.940> gotta<00:04:21.090> get<00:04:21.299> an

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
across and yeah you've gotta get an

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.640 
across and yeah you've gotta get an
ender<00:04:21.600> pearl<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:21.930> then<00:04:22.049> combine<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.620> with

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
ender pearl and then combine it with

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.770 
ender pearl and then combine it with
blaze<00:04:22.950> powder<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.400> believe<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:24.150> get<00:04:24.390> these

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
blaze powder I believe to get these

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.150 
blaze powder I believe to get these
normally<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.410> what<00:04:25.530> these<00:04:25.620> allow<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.010> do

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
normally and what these allow you to do

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.650 
normally and what these allow you to do
is<00:04:26.370> kind<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.729> search<00:04:26.940> for<00:04:27.120> strongholds<00:04:27.360> so

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
is kind of search for strongholds so

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.820 
is kind of search for strongholds so
this<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:27.840> going<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.020> show<00:04:28.200> us<00:04:28.290> where<00:04:28.800> a

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
this is going to show us where a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.159 
this is going to show us where a
stronghold<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.880> you'll<00:04:30.570> be<00:04:30.750> able<00:04:30.840> to

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
stronghold is and you'll be able to

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.530 
stronghold is and you'll be able to
locate<00:04:31.620> them<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:31.979> lot<00:04:32.190> easier<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.610> also<00:04:33.180> farm

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
locate them a lot easier and also farm

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.850 
locate them a lot easier and also farm
them<00:04:33.660> easier<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.140> another<00:04:34.410> thing<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.680> can

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
them easier and another thing you can

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.219 
them easier and another thing you can
farm<00:04:35.070> easier<00:04:35.430> with<00:04:35.550> these<00:04:35.700> guys<00:04:35.940> is<00:04:36.229> ender

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
farm easier with these guys is ender

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.600 
farm easier with these guys is ender
pearls<00:04:37.440> because<00:04:37.620> these<00:04:37.830> leyenda<00:04:38.400> poles

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
pearls because these leyenda poles

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.279

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
instead of eggs so these are really good

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.020 
instead of eggs so these are really good
for<00:04:40.350> getting<00:04:40.590> ender<00:04:41.010> pearls<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.400> eyes<00:04:41.789> of

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
for getting ender pearls and eyes of

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.029 
for getting ender pearls and eyes of
Enders<00:04:42.419> -<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.080> really<00:04:43.440> cool<00:04:43.560> feature
