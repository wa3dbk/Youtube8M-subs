property you zoom out here a little it's

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.410 
property you zoom out here a little it's
a<00:00:35.399> nice<00:00:35.550> looking<00:00:35.880> thing<00:00:37.040> it's<00:00:38.040> around<00:00:38.420> eight

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
a nice looking thing it's around eight

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.860 
a nice looking thing it's around eight
to<00:00:39.660> ten<00:00:39.840> feet<00:00:40.079> wide<00:00:40.340> maybe<00:00:41.340> around<00:00:41.870> eighteen

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
to ten feet wide maybe around eighteen

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.590 
to ten feet wide maybe around eighteen
to<00:00:42.989> twenty<00:00:43.260> feet<00:00:43.440> long<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.210> center<00:00:45.539> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
to twenty feet long in the center it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260 
to twenty feet long in the center it
goes<00:00:45.750> down<00:00:45.960> four<00:00:46.289> feet<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.860> bedrock<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:48.180> have

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
goes down four feet to bedrock we have

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.670 
goes down four feet to bedrock we have
very<00:00:48.480> shallow<00:00:48.690> bedrock<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.559> it's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
very shallow bedrock here so it's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.979 
very shallow bedrock here so it's
actually<00:00:50.010> pure<00:00:50.340> shale<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.510> bottom<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
actually pure shale at the bottom like a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.139 
actually pure shale at the bottom like a
bottom<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> swimming<00:00:52.949> pool<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.000> has

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
bottom of a swimming pool and it has

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.510 
bottom of a swimming pool and it has
little<00:00:54.420> ledges<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.020> go<00:00:55.829> around<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.370> can

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
little ledges that go around you can

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.689 
little ledges that go around you can
vaguely<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.840> him<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.230> was<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.620> dug<00:00:58.800> maybe

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
vaguely see him this was just dug maybe

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
vaguely see him this was just dug maybe
five<00:00:59.910> or<00:00:59.940> six<00:01:00.059> days<00:01:00.300> ago<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.440> still<00:01:01.710> kind

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
five or six days ago so it's still kind

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.950 
five or six days ago so it's still kind
of<00:01:01.949> cloudy<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.769> ledges<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
of cloudy but there are ledges so if it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.429 
of cloudy but there are ledges so if it
gets<00:01:06.960> lower<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.710> walk<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> why

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
gets lower you can walk into it so why

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.090 
gets lower you can walk into it so why
did<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.799> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
did we do it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.929 
did we do it
what's<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> idea<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.909> property<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
what's the idea this is a property that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.179 
what's the idea this is a property that
is<00:01:15.119> prone<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.500> flooding<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
is prone to a lot of flooding in the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.609 
is prone to a lot of flooding in the
early<00:01:17.490> spring<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.200> winter<00:01:19.200> thaw<00:01:19.590> that

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
early spring the winter thaw that

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.940 
early spring the winter thaw that
happens<00:01:20.189> creates<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.850> tremendous<00:01:21.390> amount<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
happens creates a tremendous amount of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.570 
happens creates a tremendous amount of
pools<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.430> watering<00:01:24.560> lulls<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.979> over<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
pools and watering lulls all over the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.190 
pools and watering lulls all over the
property<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.210> over<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> last<00:01:27.570> few<00:01:27.780> years<00:01:27.810> have

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
property so over the last few years have

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.100 
property so over the last few years have
been<00:01:28.229> digging<00:01:29.119> drainage<00:01:30.119> ways<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.570> letting

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
been digging drainage ways of letting

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.690 
been digging drainage ways of letting
this<00:01:31.229> water<00:01:31.500> escape<00:01:32.009> down<00:01:32.280> through<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
this water escape down through the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.420 
this water escape down through the
property<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.299> ultimately<00:01:33.950> originally<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
property and ultimately originally it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.319 
property and ultimately originally it
went<00:01:35.820> through<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.400> hit<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.640> berm<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
went through here and hit a berm and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.679 
went through here and hit a berm and
went<00:01:39.689> out<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.470> ditch<00:01:41.460> along<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> road

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
went out to the ditch along the road

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.289 
went out to the ditch along the road
line<00:01:42.930> away<00:01:43.649> from<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.950> property<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:45.090> thought

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
line away from the property the thought

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.340 
line away from the property the thought
was<00:01:45.479> well<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.680> nutrient

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
was well all that nutrient

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.290 
was well all that nutrient
that's<00:01:48.890> available<00:01:49.190> in<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.550> early<00:01:49.700> spring<00:01:50.090> is

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
that's available in the early spring is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.370 
that's available in the early spring is
just<00:01:50.420> getting<00:01:50.660> washed<00:01:50.870> out<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
just getting washed out of the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.770 
just getting washed out of the
property's<00:01:51.860> going<00:01:52.100> away<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:53.540> I'm<00:01:53.600> going<00:01:53.720> to

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
property's going away so I'm going to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.560 
property's going away so I'm going to
catch<00:01:53.930> it<00:01:53.960> hold<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.270> can<00:01:56.270> see<00:01:56.420> this

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
catch it hold on to it you can see this

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.240 
catch it hold on to it you can see this
is<00:01:56.720> where<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:56.900> original<00:01:57.080> cut<00:01:57.530> was<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.130> it

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
is where the original cut was and it

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.040 
is where the original cut was and it
just<00:01:58.430> dumped<00:01:58.730> right<00:01:58.910> down<00:01:59.120> and<00:01:59.330> go<00:01:59.840> away

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
just dumped right down and go away

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.240 
just dumped right down and go away
making<00:02:00.950> for<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.610> very<00:02:02.150> very<00:02:02.420> fertile<00:02:02.840> ditch<00:02:05.050> so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
making for a very very fertile ditch so

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.460 
making for a very very fertile ditch so
last<00:02:07.250> week<00:02:08.649> we<00:02:09.649> plugged<00:02:10.009> up<00:02:10.930> this<00:02:11.930> section

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
last week we plugged up this section

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.560 
last week we plugged up this section
that<00:02:12.620> connected<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.700> here<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:16.570> instead

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
that connected to here and instead

I have some perennial sunflowers potted
up<00:03:35.690> as<00:03:35.959> well<00:03:36.350> as<00:03:36.440> some<00:03:36.590> hops<00:03:36.799> which<00:03:37.040> actually

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
up as well as some hops which actually

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.340 
up as well as some hops which actually
need<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.360> get<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.660> shade<00:03:38.870> they're<00:03:39.140> going

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
need to get in the shade they're going

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.120 
need to get in the shade they're going
through<00:03:39.530> some<00:03:39.680> transplant<00:03:40.190> shock<00:03:40.430> and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
through some transplant shock and

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.979 
through some transplant shock and
there's<00:03:43.130> some<00:03:43.280> fun<00:03:43.459> features<00:03:43.820> about<00:03:44.090> this<00:03:44.269> so

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
there's some fun features about this so

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.310 
there's some fun features about this so
this<00:03:45.350> was<00:03:45.530> dug<00:03:46.630> connected<00:03:47.630> with<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.140> any

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
this was dug connected with this so any

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.340 
this was dug connected with this so any
surface<00:03:48.620> flow<00:03:49.040> can<00:03:49.580> dump<00:03:49.850> into<00:03:50.000> here<00:03:50.480> when

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
surface flow can dump into here when

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.699 
surface flow can dump into here when
it's<00:03:51.500> full<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:52.250> can<00:03:52.910> overflow<00:03:53.450> back<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.590> the

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
it's full it can overflow back to the

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.800 
it's full it can overflow back to the
road<00:03:54.950> but<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.760> can<00:03:55.880> see<00:03:56.180> I've<00:03:56.299> got<00:03:56.419> a<00:03:56.480> cast

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
road but you can see I've got a cast

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.409 
road but you can see I've got a cast
iron<00:03:57.049> lid<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:57.889> there<00:03:58.519> right<00:03:58.700> now<00:03:58.850> which<00:03:59.090> blocks

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
iron lid in there right now which blocks

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.290 
iron lid in there right now which blocks
it<00:03:59.630> just<00:03:59.959> enough

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
it just enough

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.590 
it just enough
to<00:04:02.300> let<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.570> overflow<00:04:02.900> to<00:04:03.200> this<00:04:03.650> little<00:04:04.040> guy

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
to let it overflow to this little guy

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.010 
to let it overflow to this little guy
which<00:04:05.600> comes<00:04:05.930> over<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:07.000> hits<00:04:08.000> this<00:04:08.390> contour

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
which comes over and hits this contour

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.560 
which comes over and hits this contour
so<00:04:09.920> in<00:04:10.010> other<00:04:10.100> words<00:04:10.340> when<00:04:10.760> this<00:04:10.910> is<00:04:11.090> flowing

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
so in other words when this is flowing

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.250 
so in other words when this is flowing
in<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.380> can<00:04:12.620> fill<00:04:13.060> these<00:04:14.060> beds<00:04:14.390> with<00:04:14.660> water<00:04:14.960> so

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
in it can fill these beds with water so

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.080 
in it can fill these beds with water so
it<00:04:15.350> waters<00:04:15.680> them<00:04:15.860> from<00:04:16.100> below<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.820> figure

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
it waters them from below and the figure

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.030 
it waters them from below and the figure
capillary<00:04:17.600> action<00:04:17.810> will<00:04:18.140> draw<00:04:18.380> that<00:04:18.620> water<00:04:18.829> up

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
capillary action will draw that water up

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.640 
capillary action will draw that water up
and<00:04:19.190> into<00:04:19.459> them<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:20.269> can<00:04:20.450> change<00:04:20.750> what's

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
and into them and I can change what's

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.400 
and into them and I can change what's
happening<00:04:22.070> by<00:04:22.220> either<00:04:22.900> taking<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.050> out<00:04:24.230> or

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
happening by either taking that out or

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.500 
happening by either taking that out or
putting<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.710> back<00:04:24.830> in<00:04:25.130> or<00:04:25.370> capping<00:04:26.150> this<00:04:26.330> if

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
putting it back in or capping this if

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.390 
putting it back in or capping this if
there's<00:04:26.660> too<00:04:26.810> much<00:04:26.960> water<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.530> eventually

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
there's too much water and eventually

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.690 
there's too much water and eventually
I'll<00:04:28.850> do<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.120> again<00:04:29.860> over<00:04:30.860> here<00:04:30.890> as<00:04:31.220> well<00:04:31.430> so

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
I'll do that again over here as well so

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.170 
I'll do that again over here as well so
that<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:32.570> nutrient<00:04:33.020> comes<00:04:33.260> flying<00:04:33.650> in<00:04:34.180> falls

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
that the nutrient comes flying in falls

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.240 
that the nutrient comes flying in falls
out<00:04:35.420> a<00:04:35.450> solution<00:04:36.020> gets<00:04:36.200> held<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:36.920> the<00:04:37.010> water

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
out a solution gets held in the water

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.580 
out a solution gets held in the water
and<00:04:37.580> then<00:04:38.060> overflow<00:04:38.600> comes<00:04:38.900> back<00:04:39.170> into<00:04:39.410> the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
and then overflow comes back into the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.010 
and then overflow comes back into the
Gardens<00:04:40.240> this<00:04:41.240> will<00:04:41.390> be<00:04:41.480> an<00:04:41.570> excellent<00:04:41.870> place

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
Gardens this will be an excellent place

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.680 
Gardens this will be an excellent place

just that one south side of the garage
we<00:06:06.770> get<00:06:06.890> enough<00:06:07.160> to<00:06:07.850> keep<00:06:08.000> that<00:06:08.210> thing

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
we get enough to keep that thing

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.360 
we get enough to keep that thing
constantly<00:06:09.169> overflowing<00:06:09.860> it's<00:06:09.979> actually<00:06:10.340> a

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
constantly overflowing it's actually a

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.820 
constantly overflowing it's actually a
nuisance<00:06:10.789> because<00:06:11.720> it<00:06:11.840> ends<00:06:12.080> up<00:06:12.140> creating<00:06:12.410> a

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
nuisance because it ends up creating a

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.550
