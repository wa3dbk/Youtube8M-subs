00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.840
 for everyone good in this video is a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.520
 sunny 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 that is, a few horse games 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:20.990
 to play on the internet if one day it is 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.990
 bored you want to try new things 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:32.239
 good are the three games I bring 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.710
 and the first one that I think is the one 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.130
 plus 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.290
 you can play is crystal 'stable' 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:46.070
 that this is a game in 13 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.500
 and it's this line you can see three 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.120
 players like they are running with their 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.120
 horses 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.120
 sorry 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 we would give to play we have to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.790
 to download 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.470
 in quotes what is the game because 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.890
 because so you can visualize / 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.890
 efe stay a few things for him 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.300
 the second 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.990
 puntocom is also horses but 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.960
 This does not have animations as 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.680
 I could have this video 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.680
 good 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.920
 goal but you are only going to see the images 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.590
 of horses you will not be able to 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.980
 galloping with them because it brings us to 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.750
 visualize 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.550
 but I think it's very good you can 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.550
 send messages to your friends 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.890
 well this is the last 12 is very 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.890
 similar to horse 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.610
 as to what moves 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.210
 I have never played but 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.710
 I think it will be fine 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.200
 good 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.070
 you have already shown the others on the pages 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.990
 if you know any more firm interest 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.990
 because sometimes also some 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.540
 you told me 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.120
 If you have any doubt with some 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.120
 you put it in the comments 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.830
 i 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.400
 in this game we record I wanted 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:00.540
 make videos when 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.599
 but I could not because with the program that 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.750
 recorded was not seen on the black screen and 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.280
 yes 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.280
 add a solution to this problem 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.760
 If anyone has any doubts about this 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.760
 game 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.230
 well this is all 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.329
 or not
