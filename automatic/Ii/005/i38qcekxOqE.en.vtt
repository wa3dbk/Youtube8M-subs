the<00:04:37.240> research<00:04:37.539> lab<00:04:37.750> are<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> important<00:04:38.350> ones

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
the research lab are the important ones

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.960 
the research lab are the important ones
really<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:39.100> summoning<00:04:39.400> portal<00:04:39.669> lets<00:04:39.850> you

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
really the summoning portal lets you

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.820 
really the summoning portal lets you
summon<00:04:40.210> monsters<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.930> traps<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.470> put<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.740> your

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.320 
summon monsters and traps to put in your
castle<00:04:42.220> but<00:04:42.340> your<00:04:42.520> castle<00:04:43.000> also<00:04:43.090> has<00:04:43.300> a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
castle but your castle also has a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.180 
castle but your castle also has a
defense<00:04:43.660> rating<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.590> will<00:04:44.860> have<00:04:45.039> to

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
defense rating so you will have to

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.860 
defense rating so you will have to
choose<00:04:45.370> your<00:04:45.520> defense<00:04:45.789> wisely<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.360> can't<00:04:46.600> put

too much in one area and this area here
is<00:04:49.690> actually<00:04:50.110> specifically<00:04:51.010> designed<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:52.120> put

try and make it so that baddies get
aggro<00:05:04.110> at<00:05:04.259> once<00:05:04.529> and<00:05:04.739> you'll<00:05:04.860> see<00:05:04.889> what<00:05:05.099> I<00:05:05.159> mean

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
aggro at once and you'll see what I mean

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.919 
aggro at once and you'll see what I mean
as<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:05.639> get<00:05:05.909> into<00:05:06.119> higher<00:05:06.300> level<00:05:06.599> dungeons

as you get into higher level dungeons

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:09.259 
as you get into higher level dungeons
because<00:05:07.469> higher<00:05:07.709> level<00:05:08.009> dungeons<00:05:08.369> these<00:05:09.059> guys

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:09.269 
because higher level dungeons these guys

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:10.999 
because higher level dungeons these guys
are<00:05:09.509> like<00:05:09.599> masters<00:05:10.139> at<00:05:10.289> this<00:05:10.469> and<00:05:10.709> I'll<00:05:10.860> give

are like masters at this and I'll give
you<00:05:11.069> a<00:05:11.129> taste<00:05:11.279> of<00:05:11.399> what<00:05:11.519> that's<00:05:11.699> like<00:05:11.789> at<00:05:12.029> the

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:12.089 
you a taste of what that's like at the

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:13.969 
you a taste of what that's like at the
end<00:05:12.179> of<00:05:12.239> the<00:05:12.330> video<00:05:12.509> so<00:05:13.409> anything<00:05:13.889> that

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
end of the video so anything that

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.499 
end of the video so anything that
everything<00:05:14.309> requires<00:05:14.639> one<00:05:14.909> resource<00:05:15.300> of<00:05:15.419> the

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
everything requires one resource of the

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:16.669 
everything requires one resource of the
other<00:05:15.629> so<00:05:15.869> it<00:05:15.989> takes<00:05:16.199> a<00:05:16.289> little<00:05:16.409> while<00:05:16.619> to

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:16.679 
other so it takes a little while to

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:18.679 
other so it takes a little while to
gather<00:05:16.949> these<00:05:17.279> resources<00:05:17.879> you<00:05:18.029> can<00:05:18.179> always

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:18.689 
gather these resources you can always

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.629 
gather these resources you can always
check<00:05:19.019> your<00:05:19.080> minds<00:05:19.649> that<00:05:19.800> take<00:05:20.219> a<00:05:20.249> short<00:05:20.489> while

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
check your minds that take a short while

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.189 
check your minds that take a short while
to<00:05:20.669> mind<00:05:21.029> a<00:05:21.209> small<00:05:21.449> amounts<00:05:21.689> of<00:05:21.749> gold<00:05:21.989> and

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
to mind a small amounts of gold and

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.139 
to mind a small amounts of gold and
whatnot<00:05:22.439> or<00:05:22.949> you<00:05:23.459> can<00:05:23.580> pick<00:05:23.669> up<00:05:23.789> the<00:05:23.849> goal<00:05:24.029> from

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:24.149 
whatnot or you can pick up the goal from

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:25.969 
whatnot or you can pick up the goal from
fallen<00:05:24.509> heroes<00:05:24.809> who<00:05:24.959> have<00:05:25.229> failed<00:05:25.559> to<00:05:25.769> beat

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
fallen heroes who have failed to beat

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.070 
fallen heroes who have failed to beat
your<00:05:26.159> defenses<00:05:26.759> if<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:27.419> get<00:05:27.569> good<00:05:27.749> at<00:05:27.779> setting

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
your defenses if you get good at setting

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.480 
your defenses if you get good at setting
up<00:05:28.229> your<00:05:28.349> castle<00:05:28.769> then<00:05:28.919> there<00:05:29.039> will<00:05:29.129> be<00:05:29.159> a<00:05:29.249> lot

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
up your castle then there will be a lot

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.519 
up your castle then there will be a lot
of<00:05:29.669> these<00:05:29.759> and<00:05:30.449> the<00:05:30.569> cool<00:05:30.779> part<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.110> is<00:05:31.379> that

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
of these and the cool part is is that

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:32.899 
of these and the cool part is is that
you<00:05:31.619> can<00:05:31.769> watch<00:05:31.949> replays<00:05:32.399> of<00:05:32.429> other<00:05:32.669> players

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
you can watch replays of other players

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.089 
you can watch replays of other players
either<00:05:33.119> beating<00:05:33.599> or<00:05:33.749> dying<00:05:34.199> to<00:05:34.439> your<00:05:34.559> defenses

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
either beating or dying to your defenses

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.709 
either beating or dying to your defenses
so<00:05:35.669> you<00:05:35.759> can<00:05:35.879> figure<00:05:36.029> out<00:05:36.149> what<00:05:36.360> works<00:05:36.569> and

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
so you can figure out what works and

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:50.680 
so you can figure out what works and
what<00:05:36.869> doesn't

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.690 

that<00:05:51.690> obviously<00:05:52.290> works<00:05:52.500> you<00:05:53.160> can<00:05:53.280> also<00:05:53.430> run

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
that obviously works you can also run

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.670 
that obviously works you can also run
through<00:05:53.880> your<00:05:54.030> own<00:05:54.210> castle<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:54.840> I'd<00:05:54.930> say<00:05:55.200> you

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
through your own castle and I'd say you

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.900 
through your own castle and I'd say you
pretty<00:05:55.920> much<00:05:56.070> want<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.280> make<00:05:56.430> it<00:05:56.550> so<00:05:56.670> that<00:05:56.820> way

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
pretty much want to make it so that way

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.450 
pretty much want to make it so that way
you<00:05:56.970> can't<00:05:57.270> even<00:05:57.420> beat<00:05:57.720> your<00:05:57.930> own<00:05:58.110> castle<00:05:58.460> see

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
you can't even beat your own castle see

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.100 
you can't even beat your own castle see
for<00:05:59.730> a<00:05:59.790> short<00:06:00.000> time<00:06:00.180> there<00:06:00.450> the<00:06:00.600> developers

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
for a short time there the developers

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.450 
for a short time there the developers
made<00:06:01.290> it<00:06:01.380> to<00:06:01.470> where<00:06:01.560> players<00:06:01.800> could<00:06:02.070> just<00:06:02.250> buy

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
made it to where players could just buy

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.070 
made it to where players could just buy
their<00:06:02.760> way<00:06:02.880> out<00:06:03.090> of<00:06:03.120> waiting<00:06:03.660> for<00:06:03.690> things<00:06:04.020> to

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
their way out of waiting for things to

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.380 
their way out of waiting for things to
complete<00:06:04.410> a<00:06:04.680> pay<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.340> win<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:05.790> race<00:06:06.090> if<00:06:06.360> you

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
complete a pay to win the race if you

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.970 
complete a pay to win the race if you
will<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:06.930> don't<00:06:07.260> particularly<00:06:07.560> think<00:06:07.860> that

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
will I don't particularly think that

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.620 
will I don't particularly think that
it's<00:06:08.130> a<00:06:08.220> straight-up<00:06:08.550> pay<00:06:08.820> to<00:06:08.880> win<00:06:09.060> method<00:06:09.420> but

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
it's a straight-up pay to win method but

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.810 
it's a straight-up pay to win method but

pretty much the gist of the mighty quest
for<00:06:50.010> epic<00:06:50.130> loot<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:50.640> game<00:06:50.760> is<00:06:50.910> actually

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
for epic loot the game is actually

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.940 
for epic loot the game is actually
really<00:06:51.300> addicting<00:06:52.050> until<00:06:52.500> you<00:06:52.650> get<00:06:52.770> to<00:06:52.860> the

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
really addicting until you get to the

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.350 
really addicting until you get to the
point<00:06:53.130> where<00:06:53.340> there's<00:06:53.880> not<00:06:54.000> really<00:06:54.180> any

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
point where there's not really any

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.760 
point where there's not really any
castles<00:06:54.810> you<00:06:54.870> can<00:06:55.020> actually<00:06:55.290> get<00:06:55.500> through

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
castles you can actually get through

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.280 
castles you can actually get through
until<00:06:55.950> you<00:06:56.130> come<00:06:56.760> across<00:06:56.940> some<00:06:57.270> sort<00:06:57.450> of<00:06:57.510> epic

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
until you come across some sort of epic

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.050 
until you come across some sort of epic
piece<00:06:58.470> of<00:06:58.620> gear<00:06:58.950> but<00:06:58.980> that<00:06:59.520> might<00:06:59.760> actually

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
piece of gear but that might actually

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.460 
piece of gear but that might actually
take<00:07:00.390> a<00:07:00.420> little<00:07:00.600> while<00:07:00.780> until<00:07:01.140> they<00:07:01.230> get<00:07:01.350> the

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
take a little while until they get the

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.080 
take a little while until they get the
balance<00:07:01.800> you<00:07:01.920> just<00:07:02.190> right<00:07:02.430> in<00:07:02.550> the<00:07:02.610> game<00:07:02.820> I

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
balance you just right in the game I

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.220 
balance you just right in the game I
think<00:07:03.450> that's<00:07:03.570> actually<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.930> biggest

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
think that's actually the biggest

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.239 
think that's actually the biggest
challenges<00:07:04.800> that<00:07:04.860> they

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:05.249 
challenges that they

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:07.159 
challenges that they
right<00:07:05.549> now<00:07:05.699> but<00:07:06.359> then<00:07:06.509> again<00:07:06.599> you<00:07:06.779> also<00:07:06.929> have

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
right now but then again you also have

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.299 
right now but then again you also have
that<00:07:07.259> whole<00:07:07.469> their<00:07:07.649> aspect<00:07:08.009> of<00:07:08.069> the<00:07:08.159> game

00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:08.309 
that whole their aspect of the game

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:09.379 
that whole their aspect of the game
where<00:07:08.459> you<00:07:08.489> can<00:07:08.549> just<00:07:08.819> go<00:07:08.939> and<00:07:09.149> make<00:07:09.269> your

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389 
where you can just go and make your

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:10.779 
where you can just go and make your
defense<00:07:09.779> is<00:07:09.899> better<00:07:10.079> so<00:07:10.259> you<00:07:10.349> can<00:07:10.439> get

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
defense is better so you can get

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.639 
defense is better so you can get
upgraded<00:07:11.789> beyond<00:07:12.089> that<00:07:12.329> it's<00:07:13.139> been<00:07:13.319> mentioned

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:13.649 
upgraded beyond that it's been mentioned

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:14.749 
upgraded beyond that it's been mentioned
that<00:07:13.679> the<00:07:13.829> loot<00:07:14.009> of<00:07:14.099> the<00:07:14.189> game<00:07:14.369> isn't<00:07:14.729> really

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 
that the loot of the game isn't really

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.899 
that the loot of the game isn't really
that<00:07:15.359> epic<00:07:15.899> and<00:07:16.169> that<00:07:16.979> may<00:07:17.099> be<00:07:17.159> the<00:07:17.339> case<00:07:17.549> I<00:07:17.759> but

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:17.909 
that epic and that may be the case I but

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:19.039 
that epic and that may be the case I but
I<00:07:17.969> haven't<00:07:18.119> really<00:07:18.359> leveled<00:07:18.629> up<00:07:18.689> high<00:07:18.869> enough

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:19.049 
I haven't really leveled up high enough

00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:20.659 
I haven't really leveled up high enough
to<00:07:19.109> be<00:07:19.289> able<00:07:19.439> to<00:07:19.499> see<00:07:19.769> that<00:07:19.979> but<00:07:20.459> then<00:07:20.549> again

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
to be able to see that but then again

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:21.739 
to be able to see that but then again
that's<00:07:20.849> something<00:07:21.179> that<00:07:21.299> they<00:07:21.419> can<00:07:21.569> really

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:21.749 
that's something that they can really

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:24.469 
that's something that they can really
easily<00:07:22.379> change<00:07:23.099> so<00:07:23.969> the<00:07:24.059> last<00:07:24.209> thing<00:07:24.329> I<00:07:24.359> want
