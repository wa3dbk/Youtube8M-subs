00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello I would call me Paula saucer 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.900
 here to explain a little how it works 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.510
 My job, I'm a therapist. 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.630
 Holistic for those who know do not have a 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.539
 Professional holistic therapist I go 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.460
 explain a bit what a 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.279
 holistic therapist is a professional 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.160
 who will always try to find the cause 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.279
 of an imbalance in the human being not only 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.280
 in an aspect of it not only in the physical or 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.210
 emotional mental but spiritual in 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.640
 will try to see where there really is that 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.820
 relation between these aspects is 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.150
 taking what is influencing what 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.820
 because these aspects are always 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.530
 interrelating and causing things between 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.530
 both 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.020
 so sometimes you can waste time 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.910
 if you only focus on one aspect because 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.710
 origin of that problem that the person 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.190
 is having in that aspect is in another 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.980
 place 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.130
 the fledgling here is a root that is in 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.150
 another place can be in only one 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.440
 be in two 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.140
 sometimes there are people who are 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.290
 problems in all aspects in the physical 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.660
 emotional mental and spiritual 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.170
 I have always believed that not only 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.110
 therapist is responsible for 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.120
 always help that being who is 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.960
 seeking a holistic therapist has 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.870
 have a disposition an intention to 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.630
 self-transform or know the 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.300
 portion is the responsibility he 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.520
 has a process of rebalancing 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.340
 No one can help the other if the other 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.909
 does not want to be helped if the other is not 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.310
 This will also make it possible for 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.110
 symbol and won by a high path 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.979
 conscious transformation it does not 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.140
 realized that everything depends on him before 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.930
 but nothing that is not just someone 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.430
 that will make everything work 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.190
 then the holistic therapist is going to be a 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.260
 catalyst it will organize things 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.679
 make it clearer what 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.299
 needs to be worked as work with 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.269
 various techniques 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.400
 I get my coverage 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.730
 work becomes greater 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.310
 so if I 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.860
 It's a job with only one technique, my 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.170
 acting would be somewhat limited 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.890
 so that the more techniques a 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.379
 holistic therapist is able to act more 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.410
 he can cover these diverse 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:38.510
 aspects I mentioned earlier are not 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.690
 physical emotional mental and spiritual 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.569
 Good is too much to talk about and it 's a 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.459
 broad subject I can here talking to 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.910
 people who for the first time do not have 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.510
 contact with this type of subject 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.910
 then it would really be a lot 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.109
 I could stay here for hours talking about 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.209
 various subjects 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.549
 because of this within the site there is 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.400
 a session that is called easy to 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.250
 balance where in the videos item 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.700

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.769
