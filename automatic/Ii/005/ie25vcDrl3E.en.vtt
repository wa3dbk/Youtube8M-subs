00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.929 
don't worry it's not as tough as you
think<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.519> matter<00:00:23.789> of

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
think it's just a matter of

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.900 
think it's just a matter of
understanding<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.630> basics<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.859> what<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.699> would

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
understanding the basics so what I would

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120 
understanding the basics so what I would
suggest<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.539> before<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.650> get

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
suggest is that before you actually get

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.700 
suggest is that before you actually get
yourself<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.849> domain<00:00:30.240> name<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.689> put<00:00:31.529> your
