00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
first part of this gameplay because I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
first part of this gameplay because I
actually<00:01:35.430> died<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.210> off<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> my<00:01:36.630> dog<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.259> I

actually died one off of my dog so I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.960 
actually died one off of my dog so I
would<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.530> had<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> set<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> dogs<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.490> swarm<00:01:38.850> I
