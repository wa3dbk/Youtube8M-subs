00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.190
 here is a milky mushroom he matured 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.560
 there is almost no water it matures 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.349
 cans 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.539
 which is covered on top with a marlechka and 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.079
 there is a lid in which there is a large 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.449
 a hole for a milky mushroom to breathe a milky 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.759
 the mushroom has ripened as you see you are ready to eat 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.739
 Vodicka impetus was born in Monica 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.140
 yogurt 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.629
 to clean the dairy mushroom and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.150
 pour it again you will need a cup 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.699
 Spoon can be iron but better of course 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.460
 wooden wooden not iron and 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:50.280
 plastic sieve which no 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.089
 Iron 1 sieve put on a plate 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.409
 open milk mushroom here look 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:01.350
 plenochka formed formed 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.909
 plenochka well, in principle, someone takes 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.460
 takes out two spoons of the top washes and fills 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:13.009
 milk well i do like this i pour 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.009
 milk mushroom in this sieve is completely whole 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 jar 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:39.150
 and the fungus is starting to quietly 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:43.860
 twirl to interfere so that he would go and decant 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.850
 and since the milk mushroom did not stand 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.880
 more than 7 somewhere around 20 22 o'clock here 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.550
 easy to pour out 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.960
 officer chick here if you carefully pay 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.720
 my attention there are bits of flu already 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.490
 who love the surface table 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.980
 preceded here to the surface 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.200
 remains a mushroom a bit of flu media nothing 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.500
 doesn't happen how many times his attack in 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.490
 her 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.120
 wiped on this sieve remains completely 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.090
 a little bit 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.590
 one teaspoon is just 1 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.430
 a teaspoon is enough to 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.800
 longer than two to 700 make a new 7 weave 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.770
 I take a new spoon because in that spoon 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.430
 glue mushroom particles I clean it 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:39.240
 bottom so you want from 1 more 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.880
 product to eat here 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.820
 turned out kefirchik good thick 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.680
 kefir what cooking consumers poured 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.900
 milk and a day later the nose is true 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.360
 such kevin was formed in a day 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.390
 in twenty hours in a day he 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.480
 ki starts to merge not very tasty he ate 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.320
 water that is clean from the filter 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.830
 clear water then you are my mushroom which is 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.830
 us stayed 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.290
 deliver this fungus 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:24.630
 brushed here wherever water-in-law's 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:27.990
 this is a fungus with us now we will put in 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.100
 squeeze a jar before pressing start 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.280
 wash the jar of course you need to wash understood 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.230
 jar washed someone and and sterilized I 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.840
 don't sterilize my mushroom at all 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.120
 accustomed to such conditions he survives with 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.370
 any conditions the milk must be 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.800
 sterilized but must be purchased 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.370
 usually either mister either three with 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.220
 half percent he 's sterilized and 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.400
 should be room temperature but my 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.950
 mushroom accustomed to any conditions I take with 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.810
 the fridge and pour it in the fridge he 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:10.410
 it is in the door that is why milk is not strong 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:14.390
 always poured cold a little bit 1 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.390
 1 liter is enough for two times 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.239
 we cover with a little girl with us 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.860
 folded in several layers but mostly 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.650
 in 3 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:28.020
 why should the neck breathe but 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.039
 this was not what he got 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.199
 muck can neither flies and dust here 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.150
 the mushroom breathes with the cap so in 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.710
 cover hole 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.240
 so that nothing gets to no one 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.210
 inadvertently did not throw off 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.229
 the fungus 's cap is covered 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.419
 put in dhaka light dark corner 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.160
 when the light turns off here is dark from 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:55.979
 the windows are far and everything is ready kefirchik 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.810
 to use just this one 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.580
 jars enough for 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.430
 about somewhere in one single mug and 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.539
 maybe another half for two 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.930

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:13.940
