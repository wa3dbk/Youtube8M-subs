00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
can be terribly confusing when most

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.060 
can be terribly confusing when most
games<00:03:28.540> including<00:03:29.230> rare<00:03:29.380> zone<00:03:29.650> do<00:03:29.950> the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
little reason to do them so I'd

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.620
