lot<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.130> great<00:02:02.490> teams<00:02:02.930> that

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.990 

that<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:07.490> becomes<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:09.679> wheel<00:02:09.920> who<00:02:10.610> was<00:02:10.819> it

but<00:02:16.489> still<00:02:16.630> clear<00:02:17.630> up<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:17.870> didn't<00:02:18.140> game<00:02:18.459> but

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
but still clear up so didn't game but

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.520 
but still clear up so didn't game but
it's<00:02:19.610> much<00:02:19.760> easier<00:02:20.180> for<00:02:20.390> these<00:02:20.540> Eastern
