00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.089
 everyone knows the problem like you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.059
 a lot goes with glue and with such a pot 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.519
 big or small if you go then you go me 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.340
 if you sit bottom of heaven here goes 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.650
 that's nice then you explain yourself more or you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.490
 put it up and you start again 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.140
 again 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 then there's a sky and then you have to 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.880
 Shake before that line it is again 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.050
 and then you can continue again but if you 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 it is gluing 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.279
 we are always in a hurry because you want 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.279
 that that comes together quickly 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.360
 now I had a solution for that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 for this air problem i buy one 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 large stock exchange line 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.489
 and then I throw at that little one 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
 that is full 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.110
 so you can enjoy it but we 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.760
 of course it also gets full 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.829
 and you have that problem again and then you have to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 fill you up again 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.000
 that is a solution but I also thought of it 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.070
 if I do a standard often in 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.619
 a move I had thought of such a tub 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.869
 proactively good for your prostate and if 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.350
 you put a plan that we 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.220
 and I put that thing without a cap with a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 little 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.500
 look at that tip and then i am life 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.549
 if i go next you where i put it 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.200
 here 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 does that line on my shelf you can there 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 I remove it with a brush and and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.869
 use it again 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.700
 So then I would drop him here 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.930
 where I want it and then I use it 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.610
 him like that 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.619
 now i have a very cheap standard 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.049
 Google make him a nice hole here 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 in that it stays in it then we go 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.850
 try again now 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.890
 so i got your knife and i'm afraid that 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.010
 plastic that also cuts very easily 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 is once in it so 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.680
 just have to be careful that I have a break 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.680
 keep control how I'm going to cut it now 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.130
 all right 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:10.300
 shake it oh maybe it should be right 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.550
 just do not use a tear 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.880
 only those are standing 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.790
 no that is not strong enough just up 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.540
 just try another place 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.900
 give a slice and I put it in that 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.900
 slice that does not help 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.740
 so we are not going well my idea that is going 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.740
 not good 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.920
 You can also hold a bobbin 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.080
 take with a very thin and slit in it 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.080
 that it is too tight like this one 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:53.140
 then it then comes that who that 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.630
 hour if that is how high it makes you 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.300
 If you go then close it right the trick you 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.400
 off like that and then he won't go either 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.100
 moss that line look like that upside down 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.550
 That is perhaps a good idea 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:14.130
 I am going to look at well it is one 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.130
 hoses hear obtain just a piece of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:29.220
 type is that well to weigh with one 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:41.459
 awl 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:44.579
 yes can call stroke deeper look like me 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.220
 chop it a little lengthwise 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:54.810
 look there is here 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:57.269
 that goes for you and that must be tight here 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.639
 so i am going lengthwise and bit 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.639
 in a row that you would 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.169
 remains standing 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.809
 that he is a little crooked but then no 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:56.119
 not actually 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.119
 when I turn it around it stands up 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.230
 who goes to so naughty dinos g states 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.300
 he who as much as who remains myself 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.100
 stand 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.770
 so I also simply grab a piece of wood 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.410
 and then you belong and I my state 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.930
 who briefly and then see I think I am 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.300
 ready after i throw it away and then the 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:24.530
 next time i'm just gagging 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.530
 skiing very quickly here so you go beautiful 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.010
 Done with it
