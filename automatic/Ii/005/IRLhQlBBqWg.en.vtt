00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.799
 we need to shorten the length of 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.350
 knit sports pants try on 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:27.580
 pants and pin up poboku 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:28.599
 needles to the desired length then we can 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.170
 bottom line 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:35.890
 baste and try on try on again 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.160
 must stand 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.760
 shoes with which you will wear the heel 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:53.430
 should be covered and in front should 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:01:04.840
 form one room we transfer 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:10.630
 bending pins on the sides the rest 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.960
 you can break off your pants 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.960
 inside out 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.380
 then we fold their seam to shock 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.850
 take a square 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:46.080
 draw a straight line and then add 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:56.259
 on the back half 0 5 centimeters and 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:58.119
 hold a new line then you measure out 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:03.119
 hem width 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.119
 and draw a line for bending 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.700
 then we can cut off either annealed pants 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:30.420
 so to cut off 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:30.420
 at the same time two pants fit two 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:49.440
 parts together can be cut off 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:49.440
 first one then another 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:18.500
 you need to move the line 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:26.310
 on the second part of this line to lay 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:30.349
 straight line thread not to 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.349
 was visible on the facial that 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:45.109
 we lay a bright thread through the hand 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:52.019
 in order to copy 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:55.790
 line to the front side along this line 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:59.389
 it will be very convenient for us then to bend and 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.389
 make toe 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:13.500
 after laying the thread 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:17.030
 can by using pins about 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.870
 pin along the fold 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:27.050
 then there are several ways like 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:32.039
 you can cut the product 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:36.320
 tuck in twice and lay straight 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.320
 line on the sewing machine 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.180
 second way if you process the bottom 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.610
 products 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:53.710
 and on overlock 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:56.630
 or zigzag possible manually 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.690
 if you are not able to work on 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:09.290
 milk and process the bottom line of the secret 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:12.980
 line manually if you have overlock 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:19.820
 you can sweep the slice and lay one 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:23.020
 or two lines of our car 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.440
 professional ways will 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:34.690
 processing on flat knitted 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.690
 cars and so on honey you bottom line 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.320

 ploskoshovnye you need to baste 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.810
 line from cut 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:11.500
 not processing probably ke exactly 0 5 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.500
 centimeters on the seamy side 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:07:14.950
 we start the line with the middle step 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:07:17.919
 seam gently pass the edge then 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.290
 remove the mark we seam done 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:22.960
 flex 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:26.650
 knitted sports trousers by eye to 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.680
 noisy and thinking it gives elasticity 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:33.430
 fabric lays simultaneously two 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.660
 lines on the front and overlaid 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.790
 cut from the wrong side at the same time 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.770
 if you donâ€™t have one 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.680
 I advise you to buy this if you

 handle a lot of knitwear you can 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.100
 process 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:53.590
 cut on overlock to lay out and lay 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:57.030
 one or a long line on the usual 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.030
