00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
using this deer season have a rage this

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.980 
using this deer season have a rage this
is<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.360> two<00:00:18.360> blade

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.540 

have<00:00:21.500> it<00:00:21.620> set<00:00:21.800> up<00:00:21.830> this<00:00:21.980> to<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:22.160> practice

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
have it set up this to the practice

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.540 
have it set up this to the practice
arrow<00:00:22.790> right<00:00:23.030> here<00:00:23.060> they<00:00:23.510> give<00:00:23.690> you<00:00:24.550> so

arrow right here they give you so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.310 
arrow right here they give you so
doesn't<00:00:25.910> actually<00:00:26.090> have<00:00:26.360> sharp<00:00:26.660> razor<00:00:26.870> edges

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
doesn't actually have sharp razor edges

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.370 
doesn't actually have sharp razor edges
seen<00:00:27.920> here<00:00:28.070> is<00:00:28.160> extremely<00:00:28.760> sharp<00:00:29.170> here<00:00:30.170> it<00:00:30.290> is

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
seen here is extremely sharp here it is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.440 
seen here is extremely sharp here it is
right<00:00:30.560> here

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
right here

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.960 
right here
get<00:00:32.450> that<00:00:32.570> focused<00:00:33.080> I<00:00:36.430> like<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:37.610> because<00:00:37.730> it's

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
get that focused I like it because it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.960 
get that focused I like it because it's
got<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.420> cut<00:00:38.780> on<00:00:38.930> impact<00:00:39.820> tip<00:00:40.820> right<00:00:41.030> here<00:00:41.059> and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
got the cut on impact tip right here and

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.140 
got the cut on impact tip right here and
these<00:00:43.970> reasons<00:00:44.420> they<00:00:44.540> don't<00:00:44.780> fail<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:45.470> open

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
these reasons they don't fail to open

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.500 
these reasons they don't fail to open
but<00:00:47.150> just<00:00:47.570> say<00:00:47.720> hypothetically<00:00:48.199> if<00:00:48.800> they<00:00:49.070> did

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
but just say hypothetically if they did

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.420 
but just say hypothetically if they did
this<00:00:50.510> is<00:00:50.690> going<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:50.989> cut<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.100> you're<00:00:52.250> at<00:00:52.340> least

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
this is going to cut so you're at least

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.670 
this is going to cut so you're at least
gonna<00:00:52.610> have<00:00:52.820> some<00:00:53.120> wound<00:00:53.360> damage<00:00:53.810> I

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
gonna have some wound damage I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.770 
gonna have some wound damage I
definitely<00:00:55.280> like<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.430> cut<00:00:55.700> on<00:00:55.880> impact<00:00:56.329> I<00:00:56.630> think

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
definitely like to cut on impact I think

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.340 
definitely like to cut on impact I think
that's<00:00:57.460> important<00:00:58.750> you<00:00:59.750> know<00:00:59.870> and<00:00:59.899> there's<00:01:00.260> a

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
that's important you know and there's a

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.819 
that's important you know and there's a
lot<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.739> lot<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.340> people<00:01:02.020> it's<00:01:03.020> a<00:01:03.079> pretty<00:01:03.380> hotly

lot a lot of people it's a pretty hotly
debated<00:01:04.460> topic<00:01:05.410> mechanical<00:01:06.410> broadheads<00:01:06.860> or

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
debated topic mechanical broadheads or

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.330 
debated topic mechanical broadheads or
fixed<00:01:07.430> broadheads<00:01:08.830> this<00:01:09.830> would<00:01:09.950> be<00:01:10.009> my<00:01:10.100> first

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
fixed broadheads this would be my first

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.670 
fixed broadheads this would be my first
year<00:01:10.460> trying<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:11.000> mechanical<00:01:11.869> broadhead<00:01:12.229> I've

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
year trying a mechanical broadhead I've

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.639 
year trying a mechanical broadhead I've
heard<00:01:12.890> really<00:01:13.100> good<00:01:13.280> things<00:01:13.340> about<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.850> rage

to trying it and I wanted to show you I
don't<00:01:22.729> know<00:01:22.850> if<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.060> experiment<00:01:23.690> is<00:01:23.930> gonna

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
don't know if this experiment is gonna

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.420 
don't know if this experiment is gonna
work<00:01:24.350> here<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:24.680> I<00:01:24.710> kind<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:24.920> wanted<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.220> show

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
work here but I kind of wanted to show

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.500 
work here but I kind of wanted to show
you<00:01:25.490> how<00:01:25.729> they<00:01:25.850> open<00:01:27.850> all<00:01:28.850> right<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.299> let's<00:01:29.420> do

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
you how they open all right so let's do

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.789 
you how they open all right so let's do
a<00:01:29.540> little<00:01:29.720> demonstration<00:01:29.900> here<00:01:30.470> I'm<00:01:30.650> gonna

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
a little demonstration here I'm gonna

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.930 
a little demonstration here I'm gonna
try<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:30.950> do<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.220> without<00:01:31.340> cutting<00:01:31.700> my<00:01:31.760> hand

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
try to do this without cutting my hand

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.100 
try to do this without cutting my hand
so<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.020> blade<00:01:33.320> enters<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.640> deer<00:01:34.940> put<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:35.960> cut

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
so the blade enters the deer put the cut

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.270 
so the blade enters the deer put the cut
on<00:01:36.200> impact<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.700> let<00:01:38.360> me<00:01:38.510> try<00:01:38.810> not<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.320> sever<00:01:40.010> my

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
on impact and let me try not to sever my

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.679 
on impact and let me try not to sever my
hand<00:01:43.330> there<00:01:44.330> we<00:01:44.420> go

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
hand there we go

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.109 
hand there we go
now<00:01:45.320> see<00:01:45.530> how<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.680> arrow<00:01:45.920> is<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.820> the

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
now see how the arrow is just the the

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.380 
now see how the arrow is just the the
blades<00:01:47.360> just<00:01:47.570> popped<00:01:47.869> open<00:01:48.369> that<00:01:49.369> was<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.490> the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
blades just popped open that was a the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.090 
blades just popped open that was a the
rage<00:01:50.600> was<00:01:50.810> one<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.110> first<00:01:51.259> fixed<00:01:51.950> or

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
rage was one of the first fixed or

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.679 
rage was one of the first fixed or
excuse<00:01:52.340> me<00:01:52.369> mechanical<00:01:53.000> brought<00:01:53.180> has<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.540> do

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
excuse me mechanical brought has to do

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.950 
excuse me mechanical brought has to do
that<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.350> when<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.100> hits<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.640> has<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.810> open

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that so that when it hits it has to open

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.929 
that so that when it hits it has to open
there's<00:01:57.530> no<00:01:57.770> other<00:01:57.860> way<00:01:58.040> for<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.790> go

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
there's no other way for it to go

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.749 
there's no other way for it to go
through<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.360> has<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.750> open<00:01:59.900> so<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.189> this<00:02:01.640> is

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
through it has to open so and this is

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.070 
through it has to open so and this is
cardboard<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.390> really<00:02:02.600> don't<00:02:02.720> want<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.900> dull<00:02:03.049> my

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
cardboard I really don't want to dull my

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.690 
cardboard I really don't want to dull my
blade<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:03.860> not<00:02:04.040> gonna<00:02:04.250> go<00:02:04.430> all<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:04.610> way

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
blade so I'm not gonna go all the way

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.569 
blade so I'm not gonna go all the way
through<00:02:04.970> but<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.570> see<00:02:05.780> how<00:02:06.770> fast<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.130> open

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
through but you see how fast that open

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.650 
through but you see how fast that open
now<00:02:07.970> these<00:02:08.149> here<00:02:08.509> they<00:02:08.750> will<00:02:09.079> not<00:02:09.320> they<00:02:10.660> will

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
now these here they will not they will

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.420 
now these here they will not they will
not<00:02:11.840> pass<00:02:12.140> through<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.890> cutting<00:02:13.250> I

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
not pass through it out to cutting I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.770 
not pass through it out to cutting I
mean<00:02:13.670> they<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.030> cut<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.420> get<00:02:14.510> through

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
mean they have to cut to get through
