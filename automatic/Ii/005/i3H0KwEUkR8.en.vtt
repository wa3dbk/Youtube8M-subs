00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
think this was probably my second or

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.509

amazing<00:00:11.969> i<00:00:12.450> love<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.769> rate<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.040> fire<00:00:14.309> i<00:00:14.340> think

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
amazing i love the rate of fire i think

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.939 
amazing i love the rate of fire i think
it<00:00:14.820> has<00:00:14.969> probably<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.630> rate<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.230> highest

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
it has probably the rate of the highest

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.349 
it has probably the rate of the highest
rate<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.160> fire<00:00:17.460> out<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.789> any<00:00:17.910> gun<00:00:18.180> in

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
rate of fire out of any gun in

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.400 
rate of fire out of any gun in
battlefield<00:00:18.920> by<00:00:19.920> far<00:00:20.449> i<00:00:21.449> haven't<00:00:21.810> unlocked<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
battlefield by far i haven't unlocked a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.140 
battlefield by far i haven't unlocked a
whole<00:00:22.710> lot<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.039> attachments<00:00:23.310> with<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.910> gun

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
whole lot of attachments with this gun

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.620 
whole lot of attachments with this gun
but<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:24.720> i<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.990> say<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.680> does<00:00:26.359> it<00:00:27.359> does

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
but all i can say is as it does it does

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.460 
but all i can say is as it does it does
out<00:00:27.840> shoot<00:00:28.140> day<00:00:28.680> 91<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.429> does<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.760> shoot<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
out shoot day 91 it does out shoot the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
out shoot day 91 it does out shoot the
famas<00:00:32.000> i'm<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.210> sure<00:00:33.420> about<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> reload<00:00:34.079> time

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
famas i'm not sure about the reload time

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.049 
famas i'm not sure about the reload time
i<00:00:34.469> know<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.710> course<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.160> reload<00:00:35.430> time<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.940> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
i know of course the reload time if you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.060 
i know of course the reload time if you
don't<00:00:36.090> empty<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> clip<00:00:36.809> completely<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> lot

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
don't empty the clip completely is a lot

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
don't empty the clip completely is a lot
shorter<00:00:38.329> take<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> half<00:00:39.870> seconds<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
shorter take two and a half seconds and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.979 
shorter take two and a half seconds and
then<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> full<00:00:41.820> clip<00:00:42.090> reload<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.719> probably

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
then for a full clip reload is probably

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.450 
then for a full clip reload is probably
I<00:00:43.110> think<00:00:43.230> three<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> half<00:00:43.770> seconds<00:00:44.309> don't

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
I think three and a half seconds don't

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
I think three and a half seconds don't
quote<00:00:44.700> me<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.149> I'm<00:00:45.390> pretty<00:00:45.809> sure

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
quote me on that but I'm pretty sure

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.860 
quote me on that but I'm pretty sure
that's<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.760> gun<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.360> pretty

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.609 
with it i haven't unlocked a scope that
would<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.280> best<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.619> long

would be like the best for you know long

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.950 
would be like the best for you know long
distance<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.640> know<00:01:17.790> medium<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
distance and then you know medium to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
distance and then you know medium to
long<00:01:19.500> distance<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.130> pretty<00:01:20.340> good<00:01:20.520> gun<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
long distance it's pretty good gun it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.700 
long distance it's pretty good gun it
reaches<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> lot<00:01:21.420> further<00:01:21.570> than<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> size<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
reaches a lot further than the size of

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.670 
reaches a lot further than the size of
g36c<00:01:24.020> reaches<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> hell<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.380> lot<00:01:25.470> further

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
g36c reaches a hell of a lot further

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
g36c reaches a hell of a lot further
than<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.040> a91<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> famas<00:01:27.509> i'd<00:01:27.840> say<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
than the a91 and the famas i'd say it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.280 
than the a91 and the famas i'd say it
reaches<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.310> ism<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> mosque<00:01:30.290> maybe

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
reaches a lot of ism at the mosque maybe

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.530 
reaches a lot of ism at the mosque maybe
not<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.820> my<00:01:33.030> opinion<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
not but that's just my opinion is that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
not but that's just my opinion is that
it<00:01:33.840> does<00:01:34.049> reach<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.009> lot<00:01:35.159> further<00:01:35.310> than<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it does reach a lot further than the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.030 
it does reach a lot further than the
famas<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:36.960> gun<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.380> use<00:01:37.590> when

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.759 
seems like you could shoot 10 bullets
faster<00:02:09.399> then<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.569> know<00:02:10.690> any<00:02:10.959> other<00:02:11.170> gun<00:02:11.410> in

faster then you know any other gun in

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.350 
faster then you know any other gun in
the<00:02:11.920> game<00:02:12.099> but<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.670> know<00:02:12.760> maybe<00:02:12.940> that's<00:02:13.150> not

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
the game but you know maybe that's not

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.820 
the game but you know maybe that's not
true<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:13.840> that's<00:02:13.930> that's<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.440> way<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.650> feels

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
true but that's that's the way it feels

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.180 
true but that's that's the way it feels
when<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.190> use<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.489> gun<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:17.650> I've<00:02:17.920> gotten

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
when you use the gun I know I've gotten

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.160 
when you use the gun I know I've gotten
a<00:02:18.250> lot<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.430> kills<00:02:18.730> with<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.690> seems<00:02:19.989> like

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
a lot of kills with it but it seems like

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.170 
a lot of kills with it but it seems like
the<00:02:20.290> reload<00:02:20.620> time<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:21.069> what<00:02:21.280> what<00:02:21.940> kind<00:02:22.120> of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the reload time is what what kind of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.729 
the reload time is what what kind of
screws<00:02:22.480> me<00:02:22.660> over<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.900> little<00:02:23.080> bit<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.620> can

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
screws me over a little bit as you can

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.589

course like I said the famas is probably

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.180 
course like I said the famas is probably
a<00:02:49.120> lot<00:02:49.269> more<00:02:49.299> popular<00:02:49.900> than<00:02:50.079> this<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.590> you

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
a lot more popular than this but you

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.890 
a lot more popular than this but you
know<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.610> good<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.849> good<00:02:52.180> secondary

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
know this is a good a good secondary

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.300 
know this is a good a good secondary
option<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.440> you're<00:02:53.560> trying<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.829> level<00:02:54.160> up

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
option if you're trying to level up

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.650 
option if you're trying to level up
assault<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.879> rest<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.209> way<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.510> can

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
assault the rest of the way and you can

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.780 
assault the rest of the way and you can
get<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:55.930> far<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:57.069> this<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.400> one<00:02:57.609> of<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
get this far I think this is one of the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.910 
get this far I think this is one of the
last<00:02:58.420> guns<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.019> unlock<00:02:59.379> in<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> assault

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
last guns you unlock in the assault

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.119 
last guns you unlock in the assault
class<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.549> you're<00:03:00.700> leveling<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.390> up<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.129> it's

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
class as you're leveling it up and it's

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.160 
class as you're leveling it up and it's
it's<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.180> very<00:03:04.209> good<00:03:04.629> gun<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.739> gun<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.220> uh

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
it's a very good gun the the gun is uh

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.970 
it's a very good gun the the gun is uh
competes<00:03:08.170> up<00:03:08.349> there<00:03:08.530> with<00:03:08.680> just<00:03:08.859> about

competes up there with just about
everything<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.639> think<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:09.940> out<00:03:10.030> beats<00:03:10.299> the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
everything I think it out beats the
