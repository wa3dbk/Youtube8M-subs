really heavy it's 220 pounds without the
fuel<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.129> put<00:00:47.309> fuel<00:00:47.610> ready<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> run

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
fuel when you put fuel ready to run

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.750 
fuel when you put fuel ready to run

with everything set
it's<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.680> 233<00:00:53.340> maybe<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:55.100> pretty<00:00:56.100> heavy

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it's about 233 maybe so pretty heavy
