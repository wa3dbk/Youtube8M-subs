00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
not good even though it seems very

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.300 
not good even though it seems very
convenient<00:01:23.930> it's<00:01:24.229> not<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:24.859> the<00:01:24.920> middle<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.250> the

convenient it's not in the middle of the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.969 
convenient it's not in the middle of the
night<00:01:25.520> what<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.270> suggest<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.840> do<00:01:27.109> is<00:01:27.409> look<00:01:27.680> for

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979

sleepers<00:01:28.909> with<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> zipper<00:01:30.079> now<00:01:30.829> my<00:01:31.369> guess<00:01:31.640> is

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
sleepers with a zipper now my guess is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.039 
sleepers with a zipper now my guess is
they<00:01:32.030> don't<00:01:32.119> put<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.329> lot<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.630> zippers<00:01:32.929> because

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
they don't put a lot of zippers because

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.260 
they don't put a lot of zippers because
they're<00:01:33.259> afraid<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.649> getting<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.939> baby's

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
they're afraid of getting the baby's

they're afraid of getting the baby's
skin<00:01:35.509> caught<00:01:35.899> in<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.140> zipper<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.710> it's<00:01:37.189> super

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
skin caught in the zipper and it's super

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.880 
skin caught in the zipper and it's super
easy<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:38.000> avoid<00:01:38.390> all<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.200> have<00:01:39.289> to<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.649> put

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
easy to avoid all you have to do is put

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.440
