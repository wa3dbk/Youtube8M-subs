we<00:00:02.970> spell<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> little<00:00:03.870> liquid<00:00:04.170> nitrogen<00:00:04.470> the

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.259 

reaction<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.080> sometimes<00:00:10.410> get<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.250> did<00:00:12.120> they

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
reaction we sometimes get is did they

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.600 
reaction we sometimes get is did they
deport<00:00:12.599> liquid<00:00:12.809> nitrogen<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.349> floor<00:00:13.610> yes

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
deport liquid nitrogen on the floor yes

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.950 
deport liquid nitrogen on the floor yes
yes<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.420> did

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
yes we did

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.900 
yes we did
one<00:00:16.470> thing<00:00:16.680> people<00:00:16.980> seem<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.520> problem

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
one thing people seem to have a problem

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.470 
one thing people seem to have a problem
with<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.539> mess<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.320> liquid<00:00:19.650> nights

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
with is the mess that liquid nights

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.040 
with is the mess that liquid nights
happily<00:00:21.500> there<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.710> no<00:00:23.010> mess<00:00:23.689> liquid<00:00:24.689> nitrogen

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
happily there is no mess liquid nitrogen

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
happily there is no mess liquid nitrogen
boils<00:00:25.380> at<00:00:25.650> 77<00:00:26.580> Kelvin<00:00:26.760> that's<00:00:27.740> 196<00:00:28.740> degrees

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
boils at 77 Kelvin that's 196 degrees

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.840 
boils at 77 Kelvin that's 196 degrees
below<00:00:29.310> zero<00:00:29.789> Celsius<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:31.279> 321<00:00:32.279> degrees<00:00:32.430> below

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
below zero Celsius or 321 degrees below

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.720 
below zero Celsius or 321 degrees below
zero<00:00:33.180> Fahrenheit<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:34.680> room<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.399> hotter

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
zero Fahrenheit the room is way hotter

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
zero Fahrenheit the room is way hotter
when<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> nitrogen<00:00:37.079> touches<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> rug<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
when the nitrogen touches the rug it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
when the nitrogen touches the rug it
boils<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> changes<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.480> jackal

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
boils and changes to a jackal

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.400 
boils and changes to a jackal
so<00:00:40.530> no<00:00:41.129> mess<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.090> rug<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.390> also<00:00:42.840> useful<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so no mess the rug is also useful and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.690 
so no mess the rug is also useful and
that<00:00:43.500> keeps<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> liquid<00:00:44.190> nitrogen<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.579> one

if we poured the liquid National Service

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.709

caused trouble elsewhere it does this

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
caused trouble elsewhere it does this
because<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.350> liquid<00:00:52.500> ends<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.949> floating<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.430> a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.630 
19.5% if you take a look around you'll
see<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.509> we're<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> fairly<00:01:25.200> big<00:01:25.380> space<00:01:25.640> we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
see that we're in a fairly big space we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
see that we're in a fairly big space we
know<00:01:26.820> how<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.180> nice<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.570> expands<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
know how much nice and expands when it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
know how much nice and expands when it
changes<00:01:28.500> from<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> liquid<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.040> gas<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.579> we

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
changes from a liquid to a gas and we

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.030 
changes from a liquid to a gas and we
know<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> volume<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> room<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.890> can

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
know the volume of the room so we can

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
know the volume of the room so we can
calculate<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.579> much<00:01:32.640> nitrogen<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.329> bring

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
calculate how much nitrogen we can bring

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.810 
calculate how much nitrogen we can bring
in<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.680> room<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> works<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> 30

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
in here for this room it works out to 30

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.270 
in here for this room it works out to 30
liters<00:01:36.439> typically<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.650> don't<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.159> than

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
liters typically we don't have more than

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
liters typically we don't have more than
10<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.540> were<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> spill<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.259> nice<00:01:40.740> we

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
10 if we were to spill all the nice we

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
10 if we were to spill all the nice we
brought<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.090> we'd

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
brought in here all at one time we'd

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020 
brought in here all at one time we'd
still<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.350> well<00:01:43.740> above<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.310> odh<00:01:44.759> alarm

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
still be well above the odh alarm

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.960 
still be well above the odh alarm
threshold<00:01:46.130> thanks<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.310> watching<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.880> hope

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
threshold thanks for watching I hope

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.350 
threshold thanks for watching I hope
you'll<00:01:48.360> join<00:01:48.390> us<00:01:48.600> again<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> what's<00:01:50.759> next

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you'll join us again so what's next

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.120 
you'll join us again so what's next
well<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:52.350> thinking<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.860> could<00:01:53.009> do

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
well I was thinking we could do

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
well I was thinking we could do
something<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.520> lasers<00:01:54.060> oh<00:01:54.299> I'll<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.810> father

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
something with lasers oh I'll be father

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.310 
something with lasers oh I'll be father
uh-huh<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.420> we<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:57.540> even<00:01:57.780> look<00:01:57.869> at<00:01:57.990> nice<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
