00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.249
 of the operating system either xp windows 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.899
 vista windows 7 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:53.469

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.350
 title is first aid record and in the 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.440

 we are going to repair all those 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.979
 failures that our operating system to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.409
 go storing junk files or the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.360
 records are damaged as we can 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.070
 cool down the truth is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.320
 they'll ask, hey, why do not we 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.820
 Bring good friends in my case like 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.580
 you can see always I bring 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.899
 antivirus programs and time 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.700
 uninstall and install another program 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.220
 good are all records left 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.819
 of all these programs the truth that a 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.360
 sometimes it is difficult for me to apply 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:41.670
 again said program then with 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 this tool friends in my case I 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.990
 I repair all those records all these 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.159
 tickets the truth that works for me 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.450
 pretty good ok 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.020
 and we will go to what is 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.000
 his official website is worth repairing what is 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.549
 the registry manage the system and 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.520
 we get what is one more system 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.070
 Stable and fast erase and repair the base 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.549
 of record data optimize and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.690
 fragment what is the record 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.510
 manage the registry securely 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.310
 thanks to backup copies 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.400
 automatic controls get more control over 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.500
 Numerous system parameters like 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.500
 are the start programs - of 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.480
 internet etcetera etcetera and then here 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.090
 is the alternative to download them 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.799
 but remember that already inside the file 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.230
 I've left them for mediafire and 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.900
 by force it will already be what is the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.730
 installer or that here tells us you're 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.099
 tired of your computer crashing 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.829
 again and again your programs take longer 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.019
 than normal to start may the 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.510
 cause of the problem are in the entrances 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.480
 incorrect at the base of regions ok 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.910
 how well is that said to me sometimes I 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.000
 it usually happens well it 's pretty 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.600
 simple or what simple use advantages 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.060
 pretty nice interface accessible 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.230
 even for beginners they find 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.840
 file or folder references 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.030
 orphans corrects your mistakes 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.850
 record deleted entries are valid 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.700
 of the system and as I told you they are 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.890
 the other options ok that we will 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.840
 erase and that will correct us the routes 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.600
 Invalid sources invalid 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.910
 obsolete Start Menu items the 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.160
 dll invalid help files 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.550

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.550
 unwanted program entries 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.550
 Association with 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.260
 not all the files that are not valid 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.840

 uncompress right click extract here and 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.790
 is going to leave these two folders or that 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.340
 these two folders and we go with what 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.829
 what is the installer we open it we give 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.150
 right click run as administrator 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:06.060
 in windows 7 we have all the permissions 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.090
 and here it tells us that if we want to install 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.420
 what is this program here we give that 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.630
 yes 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.450
 here we accept or we put the language of 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.440
 our preference is worth 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.660
 next we accept what is the agreement 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.240
 following 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.430
 well here all this if you what 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.370
 they want to read further let's go to the next 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.630
 again next 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.810
 next and let's give what is the the 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.080
 help file in my case what we give 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.150
 following 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.280
 ok if you want to create the folder 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.830
 in the start menu you can do it in 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.840
 my case I want it again following 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.730
 I will create with the desktop what 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.120
 let's what we're going to do next 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.060
 again install as you can see is 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.930

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.060
 click on final 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.910
 it is very important 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.249
 and you see here tells us version of 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.309
 evaluation ok 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:20.650
 if for example here we go inside that 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:23.470
 I 'll make it a little bigger 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.590
 Ok, it's all big, it 's good here 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.050

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.560
 which do not just go to the menu 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.750

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.640
 very important we minimize what is the 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.790
 program okay I think you can not 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.270
 cancel we minimize the program we 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.790

 friends I do not have what it is now 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.370

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.550
 turn it off 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.780
 it contains absolutely nothing but it is 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.409
 fort 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:03.839
