cameras<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.820> there<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.000> times<00:00:12.360> where<00:00:12.660> you

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
cameras but there are times where you

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.959 
cameras but there are times where you
don't<00:00:13.139> want<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.740> look<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> I'm<00:00:14.400> standing<00:00:14.849> in

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
don't want that look and I'm standing in

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.779 
don't want that look and I'm standing in
one<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.150> those<00:00:15.360> excellent<00:00:16.230> examples<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.520> I'm

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
one of those excellent examples so I'm

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.580 
one of those excellent examples so I'm
mostly<00:00:18.090> talking<00:00:18.300> about<00:00:18.570> video<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.230> now<00:00:19.260> but

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
mostly talking about video right now but

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.140 
mostly talking about video right now but
this<00:00:19.650> works<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.100> photo<00:00:20.310> too<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> I've<00:00:20.850> talked

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
this works for photo too and I've talked

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
this works for photo too and I've talked
about<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.689> past<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> photo<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
about it in the past with a photo a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.150 
about it in the past with a photo a
video<00:00:23.939> about<00:00:24.180> taking<00:00:24.990> pictures<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.830> scenic

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
video about taking pictures at scenic

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.689 
video about taking pictures at scenic
locations<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.910> setting<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.779> small

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
locations and setting a really small

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.589 
locations and setting a really small
aperture<00:00:29.699> which<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> give<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
aperture which is going to give you a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.380 
aperture which is going to give you a
very<00:00:30.779> large<00:00:31.260> depth<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.189> field<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:33.059> want<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.300> do

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
very large depth of field you want to do

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.680 
very large depth of field you want to do
the<00:00:33.510> same<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.320> case<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.980> video<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.030> it's

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the same in this case for video and it's

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.069 
the same in this case for video and it's
even<00:00:37.020> more<00:00:37.940> important<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.570> because

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
even more important to do that because

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
even more important to do that because
as<00:00:40.410> you're<00:00:40.860> panning<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.430> camera<00:00:41.550> across<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
as you're panning the camera across a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690 
as you're panning the camera across a
beautiful<00:00:42.750> scene<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.460> going

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
beautiful scene like this you are going

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.729 
beautiful scene like this you are going
to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.910> able<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> keep<00:00:45.329> everything<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.170> focus

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to be able to keep everything in focus

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
to be able to keep everything in focus
if<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.399> start<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.390> nice<00:00:48.690> large

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
if you start with a really nice large

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
if you start with a really nice large
depth<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.430> field<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.449> small

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
depth of field which is that small

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
depth of field which is that small
aperture<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> those<00:00:53.610> times<00:00:53.670> i

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
aperture so this is one of those times i

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.600 
aperture so this is one of those times i
recommend<00:00:54.420> shooting<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.809> em<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.649> AV<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.579> i

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
recommend shooting on em or AV but i

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
recommend shooting on em or AV but i
really<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.120> em<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> camera<00:00:58.079> isn't

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
really like em so that the camera isn't

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.410 
really like em so that the camera isn't
changing<00:00:58.949> any<00:00:59.129> exposure<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.120> while

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
changing any exposure on you while

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
changing any exposure on you while
you're<00:01:00.719> panning<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> look<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.100> start<00:01:02.399> with

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you're panning the look you start with

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.100 
you're panning the look you start with
is<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.270> finish<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
is the look you finish with and the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
is the look you finish with and the
camera's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.470> brightening<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.100> dark<00:01:05.430> areas

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
camera's not brightening the dark areas

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
camera's not brightening the dark areas
I<00:01:06.000> find<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.020> distracting<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:07.920> are

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
I find that distracting but there are

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.310 
I find that distracting but there are
times<00:01:08.280> where<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.670> useful<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
times where it's useful to do that and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
times where it's useful to do that and
if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.560> watch<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:10.860> other<00:01:11.040> video<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.000> talked

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
if you watch my other video I talked

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.870 
if you watch my other video I talked
about<00:01:12.299> auto<00:01:12.689> ISO<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> iso<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
about auto ISO really it's the iso is

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.280 
about auto ISO really it's the iso is
the<00:01:15.000> only<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> i<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.750> allow<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> be

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the only one that i would allow to be

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.679 
the only one that i would allow to be
changed<00:01:17.009> while<00:01:17.580> I'm<00:01:17.850> shooting<00:01:18.030> video<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.630> I'm

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
changed while I'm shooting video but I'm

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
changed while I'm shooting video but I'm
getting<00:01:18.930> off<00:01:19.020> topic<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.680> shooting<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.430> em

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
getting off topic so shooting with em

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.480 
getting off topic so shooting with em
here<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> recommend<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.979> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
here and what I recommend you do is you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.480 
here and what I recommend you do is you
shoot<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.750> small<00:01:25.140> aperture<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> am

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
shoot at a really small aperture I am

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
shoot at a really small aperture I am
shooting<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:28.369> f-22<00:01:29.720> it's<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.810> little

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
shooting right now at f-22 it's a little

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.390 
shooting right now at f-22 it's a little
too<00:01:31.259> dark<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> bring<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> down

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
too dark so I'm going to bring that down

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.730 
too dark so I'm going to bring that down
to<00:01:32.460> f-18<00:01:33.299> which<00:01:33.509> brightens<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> scene<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
to f-18 which brightens up the scene a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.359 
to f-18 which brightens up the scene a
little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.369> i'm<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:35.909> iso<00:01:36.390> 401<00:01:37.290> 50th<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
little bit and i'm at iso 401 50th of a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.120 
little bit and i'm at iso 401 50th of a
second<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> pan<00:01:40.619> across<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.060> area

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
second and now as I pan across this area

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.560 
second and now as I pan across this area
everything<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:45.000> focus<00:01:45.210> so
