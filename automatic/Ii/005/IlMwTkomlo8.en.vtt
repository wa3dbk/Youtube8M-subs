00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.060
 how are you 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.620
 use what you been up to filming with 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.120
 the digital single-lens reflex camera with this one 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.790
 hobby then it all starts of course 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.510
 with the language choice reflex with 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.330
 video function 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.430
 we buy it with a kit lens and in this 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.280
 case I use a human with a wat 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.130
 larger zoom range 18 to 250 mm 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.340
 what an extended zoom range is where you 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.629
 a lot more can it just start 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.379
 a room alone is of course completely possible 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.690
 nothing 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.710
 there you also need something more buy there 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.030
 sufficient because it is always whole 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.070
 annoying if you are at the end of the day 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.080
 without a battery, then serve yourself 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.589
 your most beautiful rare and at least that way 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.320
 important 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.519
 buy more than enough memory cards 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.330
 There are many memory cards 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.770
 shapes and sizes 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.170
 look that you are buying good tickets for 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.880
 your camera and buy them quickly enough because 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.990
 you have at least class 6 for filming 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.970
 required 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.710
 speed class 6 the moment you 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.890
 who purchased things 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.330
 the following things come into view and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.979
 video light 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.520
 otherwise a lamp to battery 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:28.140
 use it everywhere and the better lamps 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.140
 are also also dimmable 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.930
 for video of course the sound is too 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.790
 very important i have one here 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.110
 special directional microphone you can take in two 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.600
 different positions 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.240
 who can record the sound more focused 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.890
 and super focused an ordinary camera 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.049
 microphone takes the sound terribly 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.640
 round about you a lot 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.820
 ambient noise this is much nicer than 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.579
 your speakers started it have an image 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.820
 Good next purchase is a bigger one 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.170
 object is but have the wide-angle lens 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.060
 you not only have much more space in you 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.859
 image but also the perspective for all 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.670
 thereby and you can be very dynamic 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.670
 experience recording 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.500
 after the wide-angle lens 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.360
 could be a logical choice and 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.970
 angle finder with which we view the image 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.349
 can accurately focus this work 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.430
 not for all the room next to their the 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.800
 namely cameras in that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.230
 have an electronic viewfinder such as the 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.209
 sony camera that I use on one 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.880
 given moment you get the need for it 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.590
 more stability 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.050
 this is and combined photo video 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.640
 tripod with tripod has a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.380
 fluid head 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.970
 you can move smoothly whatever is important 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.299
 on panorama 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.019
 and counts recording such a tripod you can also 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.980
 use it vertically to stand the recording 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.959
 of course important that you do it alone 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.430
 used for photography because video is 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.019
 always horizontal picture 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.590
 otherwise the television would be on its side 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.590
 have to move 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.560
 if you have a tripod one time is one 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.860
 fantastic accessory with the cams 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.630
 live cam slider is the system that comes 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.849
 on top of your tripod 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.819
 and with that you can take the camera with the farmers 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.799
 follow total movement 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.380
 makes incredibly dynamic recording and 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.720
 with a lot of depth in the picture 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.920
 the following accessory is a super 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.030
 expandable professional 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.000
 shoulder tripod 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.859
 even though Rick called such a rig lies on you 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.510
 shoulder and has relative to one 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.870
 just tripod the advantage that it is not 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.819
 is stable but also very mobile 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:34.069
 camera comes on this and can free through the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:36.319
 exercise room and movie then you from 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.519
 buy all kinds of stuff if you have a little 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.109
 you can be handy on a lot of things 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.180
 to make 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.340
 i have an example here this is the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.590
 famous grill god is that he what you 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.329
 for example , can fold around a branch 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.160
 I've made it to in order to 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.269
 also on a table surface for example 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.980
 can turn 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.680
 And then you can make small objects beautiful 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.870
 take a look at it from all sides 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.739
 also the cam slider that we see here is 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.150
 home-made 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.889
 so if you are a bit handy and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.930
 you are inventive all sorts of things yourself 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.190
 on youtube and on vimeo you can 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.190
 there for a lot of example video 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.900
 my tip even though you can pay anything 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.850
 with a very large budget 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.190
 you see the excess harm you share 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.230
 a break you can start much better with 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.400
 the little bit of equipment and good there 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.630
 learn to work more and then the next 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.630
 step the next rover
