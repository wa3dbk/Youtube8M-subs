00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
break from the conventions of past games

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.130 
break from the conventions of past games
in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> Zelda<00:00:53.940> series<00:00:53.969> where<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.870> had<00:00:55.050> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
can be quite peaceful however it is a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.160 
can be quite peaceful however it is a
Zelda<00:01:14.250> game<00:01:14.280> after<00:01:14.790> all<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.240> strong<00:01:15.720> enemies

Zelda game after all so strong enemies

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
Zelda game after all so strong enemies
will<00:01:16.409> certainly<00:01:16.890> appear<00:01:17.310> even<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.939> this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
will certainly appear even in this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210 
will certainly appear even in this
setting<00:01:18.450> powerful<00:01:19.259> enemies<00:01:19.650> appearing<00:01:20.130> in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
setting powerful enemies appearing in

such<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> peaceful<00:01:20.700> world<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
such a peaceful world is one of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.109 
such a peaceful world is one of the
defining<00:01:22.409> features<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.280> Zelda<00:01:23.430> series<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
defining features of the Zelda series I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.499 
defining features of the Zelda series I
think<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.860> convention<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.270> keep

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
think that one convention we can keep

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.290 
think that one convention we can keep
right
