00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
as you can see the circular alignment

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.590 
as you can see the circular alignment
has<00:01:32.549> been<00:01:32.790> created<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.790> outer<00:01:35.970> carriageway

alignment will be created using the
offset<00:01:38.670> alignment<00:01:39.420> tool<00:01:39.920> firstly<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.310> select

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
offset alignment tool firstly we select

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.630 
offset alignment tool firstly we select
the<00:01:41.940> inner<00:01:42.200> alignment<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.740> run<00:01:44.070> offset

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the inner alignment and then run offset

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.440 
the inner alignment and then run offset
alignment<00:01:45.270> from<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> ribbon

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.289 

we'll<00:01:52.020> use<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.799> naming<00:01:53.280> template<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.119> name

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
we'll use the naming template to name

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.410 
we'll use the naming template to name
the<00:01:54.509> offset<00:01:54.869> alignment<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.090> we're<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the offset alignment and we're going to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.990 
the offset alignment and we're going to
create<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:58.080> offset<00:01:58.650> alignment<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.400> right

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
create one offset alignment on the right

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.630 
create one offset alignment on the right
hand<00:02:00.299> side<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:02.240> left<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.540> set<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> zero

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
hand side so left will be set to zero

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.850 
hand side so left will be set to zero
one<00:02:05.640> alignment<00:02:06.180> created<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.560> hand

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
one alignment created on the right hand

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.150 
one alignment created on the right hand
side<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.489> we'll<00:02:09.420> specify<00:02:09.720> an<00:02:10.410> initial<00:02:10.950> offset

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
side and we'll specify an initial offset

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.650 
side and we'll specify an initial offset
of<00:02:11.850> five<00:02:12.150> meters<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.790> alignment<00:02:15.209> style<00:02:15.510> will

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
of five meters the alignment style will

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.500 
of five meters the alignment style will
be<00:02:15.690> set<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.020> string<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.800> no<00:02:17.790> labels<00:02:18.330> will<00:02:18.480> be

be set to string and no labels will be
turned<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:20.030> as<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:23.099> can<00:02:23.220> see<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:24.209> offset

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
turned on as you can see the offset

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.240 
turned on as you can see the offset
alignment<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.319> created<00:02:27.560> when<00:02:28.560> changes<00:02:29.130> are
