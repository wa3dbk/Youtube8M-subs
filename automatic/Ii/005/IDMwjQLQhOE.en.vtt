00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
but I think that there's other

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.670 
but I think that there's other
alternatives<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.380> natural

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
alternatives that are a little natural

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.340 
alternatives that are a little natural
and<00:01:32.310> who<00:01:32.820> wants<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.360> blemishes<00:01:33.780> I'm<00:01:34.200> not

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
saying you live with it and get over it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.440

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
what I'm saying is look at an
alternative<00:01:40.200> way<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> more

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
alternative way of going up to a more

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.639 
alternative way of going up to a more
natural<00:01:42.180> reproach<00:01:42.509> because<00:01:42.960> there's<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.439> many
