00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.690 
can do this every couple of months so
that's<00:02:34.709> going<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.980> be<00:02:35.040> around<00:02:35.190> like<00:02:35.400> six

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that's going to be around like six

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.449 
that's going to be around like six
hundred<00:02:36.060> maybe<00:02:36.299> 800<00:02:36.989> million<00:02:37.200> per<00:02:37.470> year<00:02:37.500> drop
