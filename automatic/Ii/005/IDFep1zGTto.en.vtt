so<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.920> next<00:00:02.070> thing<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.280> want<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.460> talk<00:00:02.610> about

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
so the next thing I want to talk about

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.940 
so the next thing I want to talk about
is<00:00:03.570> learning<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:05.210> control<00:00:06.210> inputs<00:00:06.859> you<00:00:07.859> have

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
is learning the control inputs you have

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.049 
is learning the control inputs you have
to<00:00:08.069> think<00:00:08.250> about<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.550> fact<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.880> you're

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
to think about the fact that you're

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.820 
to think about the fact that you're
gonna<00:00:09.150> be<00:00:09.360> learning<00:00:09.809> you're<00:00:10.260> gonna<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:10.590> moving

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
gonna be learning you're gonna be moving

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.339 
gonna be learning you're gonna be moving
your<00:00:11.460> right<00:00:11.700> hand<00:00:12.000> you're<00:00:12.660> gonna<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.960> moving

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
your right hand you're gonna be moving

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.259 
your right hand you're gonna be moving
your<00:00:13.679> left<00:00:13.950> hand<00:00:14.280> you're<00:00:14.849> gonna<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.120> moving

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
your left hand you're gonna be moving

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.300 
your left hand you're gonna be moving
your<00:00:15.599> pedals<00:00:16.020> left<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.130> you're

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
your pedals left and right so you're

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.279 
your pedals left and right so you're
moving<00:00:17.490> your<00:00:17.820> right<00:00:17.970> hand<00:00:18.300> make<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> small

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
moving your right hand make a small

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.230 
moving your right hand make a small
adjustments<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.100> you're<00:00:20.699> moving<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.060> left

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
adjustments here you're moving your left

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.170 
adjustments here you're moving your left
hand<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.900> up<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.500> down<00:00:22.619> also<00:00:23.130> turn<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.060> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
hand going up going down also turn it a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.939 
hand going up going down also turn it a
little<00:00:24.300> bit<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.930> way<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.380> little<00:00:25.710> bit<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
little bit this way a little bit this

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.220 
little bit this way a little bit this
way<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> top<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.510> you're<00:00:28.080> also

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
way and then on top of that you're also

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.589 
way and then on top of that you're also
controlling<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.670> pedals<00:00:30.029> down<00:00:30.150> here<00:00:30.480> with

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
controlling the pedals down here with

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.630 
controlling the pedals down here with
your<00:00:30.779> feet<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> trick<00:00:31.830> really<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
your feet so the trick really is to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.380 
your feet so the trick really is to
learn<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> fly<00:00:33.149> these<00:00:33.210> things<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:34.430> working<00:00:35.430> all

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
learn to fly these things is working all

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
learn to fly these things is working all
the<00:00:36.690> controls<00:00:37.110> together<00:00:37.469> learning<00:00:38.340> that

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the controls together learning that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.049 
the controls together learning that
coordination<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.110> smooth<00:00:41.100> gentle

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
coordination and that smooth gentle

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.799 
coordination and that smooth gentle
touch<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> takes<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.620> fly<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> aircraft

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
touch that it takes to fly the aircraft

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.440 
touch that it takes to fly the aircraft
in<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.469> smooth<00:00:46.739> manner<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.210> start

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
in a smooth manner when we first start

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.240 
in a smooth manner when we first start
teaching<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.840> fly<00:00:49.020> these<00:00:49.230> things<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:50.129> going

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
teaching to fly these things we're going

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.860 
teaching to fly these things we're going
to<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.340> out<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.610> let<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.879> work<00:00:51.090> each<00:00:51.329> control

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to go out and let you work each control

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020 
to go out and let you work each control
independently<00:00:52.680> give<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.520> practice

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
independently give you a little practice

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.240 
independently give you a little practice
with<00:00:54.239> each<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.590> example<00:00:55.680> we'll<00:00:56.160> start

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
with each one for example we'll start

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
with each one for example we'll start
usually<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> pedals<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.660> we'll<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.899> out

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
usually with the pedals and we'll go out

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.260 
usually with the pedals and we'll go out
and<00:00:58.079> hover<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.710> I'll<00:00:59.160> say<00:00:59.399> okay<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and hover and I'll say okay I want you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.729 
and hover and I'll say okay I want you
to<00:01:00.329> point<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> aircraft<00:01:01.140> at<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.469> tree<00:01:01.710> over

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
to point the aircraft at that tree over

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
to point the aircraft at that tree over
there<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> nose<00:01:03.000> starts<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
there and if the nose starts to go a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.759 
there and if the nose starts to go a
little<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.140> you're<00:01:04.650> gonna

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
little bit to the right you're gonna

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010 
little bit to the right you're gonna
push<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.519> left<00:01:05.700> pedal<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
push a little bit of left pedal if the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.210 
push a little bit of left pedal if the
nose<00:01:07.200> starts<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.799> bit<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
nose starts to go a little bit to the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
nose starts to go a little bit to the
left<00:01:08.460> you're<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> push<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.869> little

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
left you're gonna want to push a little

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.160 
left you're gonna want to push a little
bit<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.500> pedal<00:01:11.540> then<00:01:12.540> we're<00:01:13.080> probably

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
bit of right pedal then we're probably

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.719 
bit of right pedal then we're probably
going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> give<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.100> collective<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
going to give you the collective and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.310 
going to give you the collective and
we're<00:01:14.850> gonna<00:01:14.939> say<00:01:15.150> okay<00:01:15.450> we're<00:01:15.659> three<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> five

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
we're gonna say okay we're three to five

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.929 
we're gonna say okay we're three to five
feet<00:01:16.350> above<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.860> ground<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> aircraft

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
feet above the ground if the aircraft

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.020 
feet above the ground if the aircraft
starts<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> rise<00:01:19.280> just<00:01:20.280> push<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> collective

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
starts to rise just push the collective

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.870 
starts to rise just push the collective
down<00:01:21.210> very<00:01:21.630> gently<00:01:22.070> aircraft<00:01:23.070> starts<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.520> sink

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
down very gently aircraft starts to sink

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.660 
down very gently aircraft starts to sink
pull<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> collective<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.080> very<00:01:25.320> gently<00:01:25.670> then

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
pull the collective up very gently then

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
pull the collective up very gently then
we're<00:01:26.790> gonna<00:01:26.880> move<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> cyclic<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> this

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
we're gonna move to the cyclic and this

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
we're gonna move to the cyclic and this
is<00:01:28.470> by<00:01:28.650> far<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.790> hardest<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is by far I think the hardest one to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
is by far I think the hardest one to
learn<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> hardest<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.280> me<00:01:32.520> to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
learn and it's the hardest one for me to

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.080 
learn and it's the hardest one for me to
teach<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> try<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.159> explain<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> people<00:01:35.369> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
teach what I try to explain to people is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.850 
teach what I try to explain to people is
the<00:01:36.689> helicopter<00:01:36.930> wants<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> act<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the helicopter wants to act like a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.460 
the helicopter wants to act like a
pendulum<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.970> when<00:01:39.119> you're<00:01:39.270> hanging<00:01:39.720> by<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
pendulum so when you're hanging by the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.690 
pendulum so when you're hanging by the
rotor<00:01:40.770> system<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> weight<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
rotor system the weight of the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.100 
rotor system the weight of the
helicopter<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.240> suspended<00:01:42.720> by<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> rotor

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
helicopter is suspended by the rotor

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.289 
helicopter is suspended by the rotor
system<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:44.159> helicopter<00:01:44.700> wants<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.149> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
system the helicopter wants to do this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020 
system the helicopter wants to do this
it's<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.110> call<00:01:46.259> pendulum<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:47.880> why

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it's what we call pendulum so that's why

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.389 
it's what we call pendulum so that's why
when<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.470> go<00:01:49.470> by<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.740> airport<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.250> see

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
when you go by an airport you see

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.590 
when you go by an airport you see
somebody<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> field<00:01:51.210> learning<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
somebody out in the field learning to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.450 
somebody out in the field learning to
fly<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> helicopter<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.890> seem<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.280> they're

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
fly a helicopter you seem like they're

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
fly a helicopter you seem like they're
going<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.259> yeah<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:55.829> do

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
going like this yeah that's what they do

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.859 
going like this yeah that's what they do
and<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.490> totally<00:01:56.880> normal<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.420> everybody

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
and it's totally normal and everybody

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.859 
and it's totally normal and everybody
does<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.880> takes<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.659> time

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
does it so it takes a little bit of time

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.039 
does it so it takes a little bit of time
it<00:02:01.200> takes<00:02:01.469> learning<00:02:02.280> those<00:02:02.729> reactions<00:02:03.210> it's

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it takes learning those reactions it's

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.899 
it takes learning those reactions it's
all<00:02:04.229> about<00:02:04.469> muscle<00:02:04.710> memory<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.640> learned

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
all about muscle memory and we learned

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.300 
all about muscle memory and we learned
through<00:02:06.119> repetition<00:02:06.560> nobody<00:02:07.560> jumps<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.039> here

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
through repetition nobody jumps in here

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
through repetition nobody jumps in here
in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> first<00:02:08.819> hour<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.569> their<00:02:09.899> first<00:02:10.170> lesson

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
in the first hour of their first lesson

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.830 
in the first hour of their first lesson
and<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.800> masters<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.750> believe

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and just masters it I don't believe

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.880 
and just masters it I don't believe
there's<00:02:13.349> any

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
there's any

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.530 
there's any
natural<00:02:14.430> helicopter<00:02:15.000> pilots<00:02:15.360> out<00:02:15.480> there

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
natural helicopter pilots out there

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.300 
natural helicopter pilots out there
there's<00:02:16.410> probably<00:02:16.650> some<00:02:16.770> people<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.130> think

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
there's probably some people that think

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640 
there's probably some people that think
they<00:02:17.490> are<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.000> haven't<00:02:18.840> seen<00:02:19.170> one<00:02:19.410> and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
they are but I haven't seen one and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.559 
they are but I haven't seen one and
training<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> couple<00:02:20.670> hundred<00:02:20.790> people<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.360> over

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
training a couple hundred people in over

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.840 
training a couple hundred people in over
ten<00:02:21.750> years

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
ten years

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.480 
ten years
it's<00:02:23.850> all<00:02:24.090> about<00:02:24.450> repetition<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:26.160> about

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
it's all about repetition it's about

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.320 
it's all about repetition it's about
practice

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
practice

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.420 
practice
it's<00:02:27.810> about<00:02:28.020> being<00:02:28.260> calm<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> aircraft

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
it's about being calm in the aircraft

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.460 
it's about being calm in the aircraft
and<00:02:29.700> that's<00:02:30.480> very<00:02:30.720> hard<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.020> do<00:02:31.170> because<00:02:31.350> when

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and that's very hard to do because when

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.600 
and that's very hard to do because when
you're<00:02:31.590> learning<00:02:31.709> you're<00:02:32.010> nervous<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.459> we

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you're learning you're nervous and we

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.190 
you're learning you're nervous and we
all<00:02:32.790> want<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.000> tense<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:33.300> on<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> controls<00:02:33.900> and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
all want to tense up on the controls and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.870 
all want to tense up on the controls and
you<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.860> constantly<00:02:35.010> tell<00:02:35.459> yourself

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
you have to constantly tell yourself

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.770 
you have to constantly tell yourself
relax<00:02:36.750> relax<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.770> monster<00:02:38.220> drip<00:02:38.520> breathe<00:02:39.300> in

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
relax relax that monster drip breathe in

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.170 
relax relax that monster drip breathe in
and<00:02:39.959> out<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:42.470> bottom<00:02:43.470> line<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.000> say

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
and out so bottom line is I like to say

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.550 
and out so bottom line is I like to say
I<00:02:45.209> should<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.630> sometimes<00:02:45.989> wear<00:02:46.170> something

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
I should just sometimes wear something

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.040 
I should just sometimes wear something
around<00:02:46.770> my<00:02:46.980> chest<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:48.000> says<00:02:48.300> smooth<00:02:48.570> control

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
around my chest that says smooth control

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.470 
around my chest that says smooth control
inputs<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:50.310> that's<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.910> biggest<00:02:51.239> thing

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
inputs because that's the biggest thing

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.870 
inputs because that's the biggest thing
the<00:02:52.380> hardest<00:02:52.800> thing<00:02:52.950> about<00:02:52.980> learning<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.550> fly

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
the hardest thing about learning to fly

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.449 
the hardest thing about learning to fly
is<00:02:54.209> over<00:02:54.930> controlling<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.709> making<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
is over controlling and making the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.699 
is over controlling and making the
movements<00:02:56.880> too<00:02:57.030> big<00:02:57.300> when<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.110> go<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.320> adjust

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
movements too big when you go to adjust

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.770 
movements too big when you go to adjust
this<00:02:58.950> control<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.790> affects<00:03:00.090> those<00:03:00.269> controls

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
this control it affects those controls

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.509 
this control it affects those controls
so<00:03:00.930> then<00:03:01.050> when<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> move<00:03:01.380> those<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:02.190> affects

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
so then when you move those it affects

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.070 
so then when you move those it affects
this<00:03:02.700> control<00:03:03.150> when<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.480> affect<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.900> and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
this control when you affect that and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.690 
this control when you affect that and
then<00:03:04.200> you're<00:03:04.320> back<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.680> one<00:03:04.890> again<00:03:05.130> and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
then you're back to this one again and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.020 
then you're back to this one again and
it's<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.000> constant<00:03:06.720> flow<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.709> always<00:03:08.610> making

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
it's a constant flow of always making

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:19.559 
it's a constant flow of always making
tiny<00:03:09.570> tiny<00:03:10.580> minut

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.629 

you
