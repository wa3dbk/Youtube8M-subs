wide<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:10.490> around<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:12.740> beginning<00:02:13.130> plate<00:02:13.340> 6

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
wide it's around the beginning plate 6

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.680 
wide it's around the beginning plate 6
by<00:02:13.760> 16<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.210> have<00:02:14.750> not<00:02:14.960> measured<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.700> exact

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
by 16 I have not measured the exact

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.110 
by 16 I have not measured the exact
length<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:19.100> looks<00:02:19.340> pretty<00:02:19.550> accurate

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
length but it looks pretty accurate

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.550 
length but it looks pretty accurate
compared<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:21.340> my<00:02:22.340> other<00:02:22.370> brick<00:02:22.820> mania<00:02:23.120> tanks

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
compared to my other brick mania tanks

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.890 
compared to my other brick mania tanks
so<00:02:24.910> yep<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.150> uses<00:02:26.360> 2<00:02:26.660> treads

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
so yep it uses 2 treads

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.120 
so yep it uses 2 treads
there's<00:02:29.900> hatches<00:02:30.410> right<00:02:30.590> there<00:02:30.830> there's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.160 

let's<00:02:41.380> get<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.210> top<00:02:44.210> right<00:02:44.420> here<00:02:46.630> but<00:02:47.630> okay

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
let's get to the top right here but okay

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.930 
let's get to the top right here but okay
so<00:02:48.230> there's<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:50.120> turret<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:51.640> what<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.760> can

you can add the take driver gunner it's
just<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:04.940> driver<00:03:05.290> back<00:03:06.290> there

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
just a driver back there

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.080 
just a driver back there
then<00:03:07.730> there's<00:03:08.000> room<00:03:08.270> for<00:03:08.300> an<00:03:08.600> engine<00:03:10.090> back

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
then there's room for an engine back

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.110 
then there's room for an engine back
there<00:03:11.360> too<00:03:11.890> so<00:03:12.890> if<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.280> wanted<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.640> customize

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.130 

there's<00:03:25.280> one<00:03:25.850> there's<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.600> couple<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.930> problems

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
there's one there's a couple of problems

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.600 
there's one there's a couple of problems
with<00:03:27.470> this<00:03:27.560> tank<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.070> found<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.910> found<00:03:30.610> there's

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
with this tank I found I found there's

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.300 
with this tank I found I found there's
no<00:03:31.820> stopper<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.140> if<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.500> accidentally<00:03:34.100> press

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
no stopper so if you accidentally press

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.699 
no stopper so if you accidentally press
these<00:03:34.640> in<00:03:35.000> too<00:03:35.450> far<00:03:35.660> these<00:03:36.020> little<00:03:36.350> hatches

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
these in too far these little hatches

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.790 
these in too far these little hatches
they<00:03:37.220> just<00:03:37.430> go<00:03:37.580> straight<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.690> without<00:03:39.440> too

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
they just go straight in without too

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.790 
they just go straight in without too
much<00:03:39.950> pressure<00:03:40.660> but<00:03:41.660> yeah<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.530> could<00:03:42.680> be

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
much pressure but yeah that could be

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.280 
much pressure but yeah that could be
easily<00:03:43.010> modified<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:44.510> gotta<00:03:44.720> turn<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.110> goes

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
easily modified you gotta turn it goes

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.170 
easily modified you gotta turn it goes
up<00:03:45.470> down<00:03:45.980> up<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.850> down<00:03:46.940> up<00:03:47.360> down<00:03:48.940> turret<00:03:49.940> came

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
up down up and down up down turret came

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.550 
up down up and down up down turret came
off<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:50.390> because<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.959> did<00:03:51.140> put<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.380> on

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
off just because I did put it on

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.970 
off just because I did put it on
correctly<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:56.560> seamless<00:03:57.580> here's<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.670> turret

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
correctly and seamless here's the turret

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.750 
correctly and seamless here's the turret
good<00:04:00.980> turret<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.550> could<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.450> all<00:04:03.170> this<00:04:03.760> it's

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
good turret you could and all this it's

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.690 
good turret you could and all this it's
not<00:04:05.030> quite<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.540> durability<00:04:06.110> set<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:06.769> I<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:07.220> would

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
not quite a durability set but I I would

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.880 
not quite a durability set but I I would
consider<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.780> kind<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.380> because<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.769> can

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
consider it kind of because you can

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.090 
consider it kind of because you can
customize<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.430> if<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:11.450> decided<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:12.440> you

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
customize it if you decided that you

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.390 
customize it if you decided that you
wanted<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.700> make<00:04:13.850> your<00:04:13.910> own

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
wanted to make your own

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.229 
wanted to make your own
variation<00:04:16.660> here's<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.780> bottom<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:19.459> modified

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
variation here's the bottom I modified

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.510 
variation here's the bottom I modified
this<00:04:20.450> right<00:04:20.690> here<00:04:20.959> because<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:22.220> see<00:04:22.400> these
