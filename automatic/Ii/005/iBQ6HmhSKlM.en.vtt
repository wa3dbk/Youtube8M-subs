you a funny story a battle or the funny

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.529 
you a funny story a battle or the funny
reason<00:01:34.959> that<00:01:35.950> i<00:01:35.979> discovered<00:01:36.579> this<00:01:36.909> is<00:01:37.179> because

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
reason that i discovered this is because

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.449 
reason that i discovered this is because
of<00:01:37.569> all<00:01:37.869> my<00:01:38.169> years<00:01:38.469> working<00:01:38.770> with<00:01:39.039> customers

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
of all my years working with customers

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:41.879 
of all my years working with customers
and<00:01:40.029> I<00:01:40.209> would<00:01:40.359> see<00:01:40.539> customers<00:01:41.049> coming<00:01:41.289> towards

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
and I would see customers coming towards

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.949 
and I would see customers coming towards
me<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.429> I<00:01:43.029> would<00:01:43.179> know<00:01:43.359> they<00:01:43.539> would<00:01:43.689> want<00:01:43.810> me

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
me and I would know they would want me

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.030 
me and I would know they would want me
to<00:01:43.989> recommend<00:01:44.380> live

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
to recommend live

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.590 
to recommend live
so<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.340> realized<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:46.060> part<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:46.570> reason

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
so I realized that part of the reason

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.870 
so I realized that part of the reason
why<00:01:47.050> I've<00:01:47.200> grown<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.710> be<00:01:47.860> quite<00:01:48.130> good<00:01:48.430> at<00:01:48.550> doing

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
why I've grown to be quite good at doing

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.090 
why I've grown to be quite good at doing
that<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.450> because<00:01:49.930> i<00:01:50.230> was<00:01:50.380> looking<00:01:50.770> at<00:01:50.920> their

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
that is because i was looking at their

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.500 
that is because i was looking at their
lips<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.430> thinking<00:01:51.790> about<00:01:52.000> their<00:01:52.210> whole

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
lips and thinking about their whole

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.500 
lips and thinking about their whole
personality<00:01:53.430> when<00:01:54.430> i<00:01:54.460> started<00:01:54.910> to<00:01:55.090> realize

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
personality when i started to realize

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.230 
personality when i started to realize
that<00:01:55.540> i<00:01:55.990> was<00:01:56.260> reading<00:01:56.620> in<00:01:56.980> their<00:01:57.190> lips<00:01:57.490> what

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
that i was reading in their lips what

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.480 
that i was reading in their lips what
their<00:01:58.480> personality<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.890> then

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
their personality is and then

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.760 
their personality is and then
recommending<00:02:01.180> colors<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.810> go<00:02:01.840> with<00:02:02.080> what<00:02:02.740> i

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
recommending colors to go with what i

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.950 
recommending colors to go with what i
felt<00:02:03.040> their<00:02:03.340> personality<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:04.420> try<00:02:04.930> it
