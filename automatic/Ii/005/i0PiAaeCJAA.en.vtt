00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
brawn part was like took so long to

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.140 
brawn part was like took so long to
bleach<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.530> again<00:04:45.919> this<00:04:46.310> was<00:04:46.520> actually<00:04:46.940> quite

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
bleach it again this was actually quite

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.460 
bleach it again this was actually quite
quick<00:04:47.389> it<00:04:47.659> was<00:04:47.780> a<00:04:47.810> little<00:04:48.020> bit<00:04:48.139> concerned

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
quick it was a little bit concerned

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.379 
quick it was a little bit concerned
about<00:04:48.710> like<00:04:49.009> my<00:04:49.250> hair<00:04:49.490> picking<00:04:49.849> up<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.120> color
