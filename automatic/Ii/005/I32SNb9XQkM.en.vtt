00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:19.030
 hello everyone with you channel sega tv and co 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.880
 I got into the hands of the game console 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.029
 it can be said fake on dendy 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.029
 junior 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.650
 that's called on video game systems 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:39.020
 like a key l 235 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:46.910
 I'll tell you why in the first place 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:50.090
 here one port is a prefix going together 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.660
 with joysticks incessantly here are the wires 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.080
 joysticks they were cut off 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:00.310
 here's the console from the console at all 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.410
 did not disconnect when I disassembled 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.350
 the prefix then this input could have been 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.310
 open only by disassembling and and I do not know 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.799
 why it was like that but i opened it i 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.119
 I will test further and think the joystick of the court 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.060
 it will be impossible to think this is for 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.020
 the gun but why the entrance was closed i 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.109
 I do not understand this is a complete copy 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.020
 say money and new color lettering it 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:32.479
 all clear 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:42.819
 buttons all that's gizmo not working but 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:42.819
 and just moves on under ca-300 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:53.530
 further this prefix is ​​connected through 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:57.170
 video and audio further 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.889
 adapter probably 10 volts I don't know 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.690
 we did not get empty we can say here 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:09.580
 So 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:12.260
 he is still with this 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.490
 fake on dendy to me fell into the hands 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:22.460
 one joystick 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:25.580
 Now second, here he is, honestly, I 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.120
 no he, too, for no reason I do not know why 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.820
 he i think if you know you write in 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.630
 comments here select buttons wounds 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:40.580
 turbo button well lettering 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:44.980
 here and another cross there cross on 8 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.650
 at 8 how to say action yet 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:54.520
 supports cross actions here and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:58.280
 there is a hole in the back for the word 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.850
 slow down the un of the toggle switch 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.120
 the switch itself is not the first time I see 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.640
 such a joystick reminds dandy joystick 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.700
 because four keys is also a tube 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.150
 here they from here did not approach 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:23.150
 by the way this console like a dandy place 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:27.560
 for joysticks there is a full copy 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.780
 how could I not know such a prefix by the way 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.959
 many had me when I was little 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.410
 often saw her not exactly dandy exactly 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.840
 such a 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.840
 but the joystick joystick something 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.600
 strange and do not know what he wrote in 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.720
