00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
let's talk about the touch display link

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.770 
let's talk about the touch display link
2.0<00:00:07.710> software<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:09.059> new<00:00:09.240> Sharp<00:00:09.570> Aquos

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.870 
2.0 software on the new Sharp Aquos
board<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.559> how<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.250> can<00:00:11.370> effectively

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
board and how it can effectively

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.910 
board and how it can effectively
communicate<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.870> mobile<00:00:13.170> device<00:00:13.290> running

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920

the<00:00:14.099> TD<00:00:14.460> link<00:00:14.700> app<00:00:15.139> so<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.350> can<00:00:16.470> see<00:00:16.529> we're

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the TD link app so as you can see we're

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.340 
the TD link app so as you can see we're
running<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.580> touch<00:00:17.970> display<00:00:18.240> link<00:00:18.779> 2.0

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.679 
running the touch display link 2.0
software<00:00:19.619> I'm<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> start<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.090> board

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
software I'm going to start this board

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050 
software I'm going to start this board
up<00:00:21.869> as<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> host<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.859> then<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.640> course<00:00:23.670> I'm

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
up as the host and then of course I'm

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.880 
up as the host and then of course I'm
going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.630> connect<00:00:25.050> my<00:00:25.350> mobile

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
going to have to connect my mobile

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.839 
going to have to connect my mobile
device<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.750> participant<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:29.220> Aquos

participant joining us and I'm just

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.740 
participant joining us and I'm just
going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.260> minimize<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.980> screen<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.600> this

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
going to minimize this screen so at this

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.360 
going to minimize this screen so at this
point<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.410> start<00:00:43.649> writing<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> board

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
point I can start writing on the board

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.430 
point I can start writing on the board
with<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.730> finger<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.170> pens

with my finger or with one of the pens

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
with my finger or with one of the pens
and<00:00:46.770> you'll<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> simultaneously<00:00:48.170> showing

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and you'll see it simultaneously showing

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.400 
and you'll see it simultaneously showing
up<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> mobile<00:00:50.100> device<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.110> I'll<00:00:55.230> do

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
up on the mobile device so what I'll do

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.369 
up on the mobile device so what I'll do
now<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> I'll<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.660> go<00:00:57.660> through<00:00:57.960> some<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
now is I'll just go through some of the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
now is I'll just go through some of the
features<00:00:58.890> of<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> new<00:01:02.190> Aquos<00:01:02.789> board<00:01:03.120> and

features of the new Aquos board and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240 
features of the new Aquos board and
you'll<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:03.840> changes<00:01:04.409> being<00:01:04.619> made<00:01:04.979> at

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you'll see those changes being made at

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
you'll see those changes being made at
the<00:01:05.309> mobile<00:01:06.240> device<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.500> other<00:01:07.530> thing<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the mobile device the other thing that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.800 
the mobile device the other thing that
we<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:09.000> tell<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> mobile

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
we can do is we can tell the mobile

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.130 
we can do is we can tell the mobile
device<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.760> part<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> host<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.930> go

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
device to be part of the host so if I go

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.890 
device to be part of the host so if I go
into<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> mobile<00:01:13.799> device<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:15.240> choose<00:01:15.540> host

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
into the mobile device and I choose host

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
into the mobile device and I choose host

control on the mobile device now I can

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
control on the mobile device now I can
use<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> mobile<00:01:18.810> device<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.530> add<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:22.400> I'll

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
use the mobile device to add to I'll

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.390 
use the mobile device to add to I'll
choose<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> different<00:01:24.210> color<00:01:24.390> pen<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.979> add<00:01:26.159> to
