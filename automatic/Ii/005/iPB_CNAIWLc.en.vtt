this<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.349> less<00:02:37.620> than<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.890> thousand<00:02:38.340> how

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
this is one of less than a thousand how

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.340 
this is one of less than a thousand how
many<00:02:38.670> are<00:02:38.819> left<00:02:39.030> how<00:02:39.269> many<00:02:39.450> are<00:02:39.630> like<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.110> and

how<00:02:40.440> many<00:02:40.620> restored<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.299> how<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.900> do

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
how many restored this is how you do

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.960 
how many restored this is how you do
well<00:02:43.350> with<00:02:43.920> these<00:02:44.040> kind<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> cars<00:02:44.519> these<00:02:44.819> are

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
well with these kind of cars these are

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.610 
well with these kind of cars these are
the<00:02:45.030> kind<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.330> cars<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.540> escalate<00:02:46.140> faster

the kind of cars that escalate faster

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.880 
the kind of cars that escalate faster
then<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> mixed<00:02:47.580> up<00:02:47.730> cars<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.470> top<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.709> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
then the mixed up cars and on top of it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.770 
then the mixed up cars and on top of it
I<00:02:50.069> think<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.580> colors<00:02:50.880> are<00:02:50.910> smokin<00:02:51.420> handsome

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
you something that's kind of interesting

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.020 
you something that's kind of interesting
that<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:46.170> trunk<00:03:46.470> lid<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.549> has<00:03:47.850> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
that the trunk lid here it has the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.430 
that the trunk lid here it has the
proper<00:03:48.359> springs<00:03:48.720> in<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:48.959> which<00:03:49.079> means<00:03:49.290> it

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
proper springs in it which means it

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.800 
proper springs in it which means it
probably<00:03:49.590> came<00:03:49.920> from<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.220> factory<00:03:50.639> with<00:03:50.810> with

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
probably came from the factory with with

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.940 
probably came from the factory with with
the<00:03:51.930> going<00:03:52.290> on<00:03:52.470> it

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
the going on it

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.190 
the going on it
the<00:03:53.340> rear<00:03:53.489> wing<00:03:53.670> because<00:03:54.389> it's<00:03:54.690> staying<00:03:54.989> up

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
the rear wing because it's staying up

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.140 
the rear wing because it's staying up
the<00:03:55.829> reason<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.160> say<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.549> because<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the reason I say that is because the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.460 
the reason I say that is because the
wing<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.450> heavy<00:03:57.690> if<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.079> don't<00:03:58.260> have<00:03:58.380> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
wing is heavy if you don't have the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.990 
wing is heavy if you don't have the
right<00:03:58.620> springs<00:03:58.980> from<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.220> factory<00:03:59.670> or<00:03:59.819> you've

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
restoring the car the trunk will not

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.240 
restoring the car the trunk will not
