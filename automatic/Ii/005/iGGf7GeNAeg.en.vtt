00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.070
 Hello dear friends, this is 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.290
 principle not 36 to 36 but pvp is between 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:23.519
 kicked 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:27.359
 Here are the builds 2 NAC Here are the specifications for 3 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:38.910
 sixth level theft 147 me at the enemy 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:41.280
 180 at will better so well now we 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 let 's arrange pvp he didn't just say what 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.789
 my leg crammed with all sorts of garbage not much 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.260
 began 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:53.059
 Well, he certainly craft more we are on 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.059
 detail on earth we fight 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.350
 sort of damage I have more but because 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:09.720
 that he has a little more agility 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:09.720
 punching will the more 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.510
 109,108 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.510
 and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.530
 so you see he will actually kill me 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.560
 incomprehensible but for now of course I have 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.130
 I squander her almost nothing at all 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.130
 no attention 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.880
 I even have some reason she can not power 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.450
 steal though I have energy theft 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 but he somehow 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.390
 unclear 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.390
 already 2 creep lot experience 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.750
 once again talents 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.850
 So 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.930
 yes he has and I gorelochka Joc 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.540
 where can one buy 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.890
 yes it is 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.890
 pich on also here really throwers beat 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.380
 yes the burner is here deciding the case 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.720
 Here is the question of whether we need 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.720
 to put 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 burner 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.480
 and I took my hand up to 100 from here took my hand 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.239
 put the will 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.750
 I had a sexual hand here, too, I threw myself 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.750
 fine 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.800
 and talent smeared before you 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.940
 really unagi no energy at all 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.940
 take away completely 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.070
 yes all the same without no bloody hunger 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.700
 without the burner a little bit different 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.700
 already built, you see reeks 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:05.390
 such things guys such things and now i'm 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.390
 I'll take a fight and try to kill the fights 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.410
 and 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:28.039
 that is, in principle, in principle our builds 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:28.039
 pretty similar as you can see 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.569
 see and under the stream of fights 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:46.830
 it went under the rib under the dragon I 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.940
 well and device that is all the same 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.940
 wiring decides 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:59.520
 wiring and stealing she will be a little 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.520
 revise oak 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:19.499
 I picked up numbers from poisons but rival 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.499
 with check
