00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 do not 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.200
 today we return to our ring of 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.330
 the technical section here on the night of 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.820
 marcatv boxing and for this we have 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.799
 come to collaborated city of the area 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.530
 peripheral of madrid where has the 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.109
 gym my friend and brother Luis Courage 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.300
 very well with him and with romerito we are going to 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.949
 see another type of hook last week 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.990
 We work the or with Periam with William 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.560
 Gutierrez and this week we will work 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.029
 the juice to the body before we go to 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.439
 make a few comments that we 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.360
 we leave a little in the air in the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.399
 previous season and that you at 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.469
 spectators are very kindly going to go 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.940
 communicating one of them and doubt that it 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.250
 has created is the trajectory of that 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.079
 own stroke you can look for liver 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.360
 properly speaking you can look for another 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.850
 trajectory looking for what the liver is 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.309
 and the stomach area the stomach a 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.890
 little bit more straight and if we can even 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.750
 look out looking for relative 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 liver that this shares will cost me 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.510
 even kidney area 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.030
 the romerito council we are going to work the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.350
 game to the liver that is the big lunch 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.350
 with left hand 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.270
 as romÃ¡n milestone makes a preview of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.380
 I accommodate your left side a little bit to 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.630
 snap the hit and from there look 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.630
 hit the liver area 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.560
 here differentiate well two ways of 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.710
 hit him one drop his hand and 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.340
 stab from there 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.930
 at the same time that it is accommodated the hand is lowered 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.670
 this is a technique that has higher 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.560
 risk 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.119
 but at the same time you get more 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.119
 speed in the hit 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.070
 the typical normal hook that is crouching 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.440
 we air from there logically in this 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.090
 way we have less watering to run 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.670
 but relativized the movement a bit 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.420
 there is a very clear difference in the blow 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.240
 to the body 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.160
 the blow is deep the blow has to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.550
 enter inside the body 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.170
 the liver sticks dry suddenly stays 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.830
 a little on the skin stays a little on 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.120
 the skin 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.030
 the blow down must enter baby 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.489
 one of the things that really is 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.470
 important in this blow is that the hit 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.870
 isolated 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.819
 the liver is very risky for that reason 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.430
 we should always try to entertain 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.530
 the opponent with blows to the head with 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.140
 blows above we solve here romerito 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.269
 how to put a passive combination like 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.849
 is the crochet node up so that the 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.879
 rival raise your hands and from there give you 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.879
 time to accommodate hit and paste the hand 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.440
 and here's the technical section of today 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.020
 I hope you liked it and that you have 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.680
 seen the differences between the 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.710
 mercat and the hud always linked always 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.300
 I like to remember the uppercut is a 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.000
 blow dry is a blow that goes the face 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.850
 and the juice the court is a hit that 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.340
 will produce as you have been explaining to us 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.010
 visually our great friend and piece 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.750
 Romerito boxer with this and without more 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.850
 next week we see each other again 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.030
 here in the technical section of the night 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.030
 boxing
