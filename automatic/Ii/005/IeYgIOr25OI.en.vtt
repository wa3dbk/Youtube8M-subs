 paris dakar are we reinforcing 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.810
 the safety of this whole event in 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.700
 function of the magnitude it has in 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.100
 tell how it was from the arrival of the day 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.989
 of the arrival how is the disembarkation 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.700
 what is the particular custody that 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.180
 they have this large number of vehicles 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.370
 that give life to the dakar the port of 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.800
 delta dock that is where we were is 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.839
 certified by the international code 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.759
 of protection of ships and installations 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.350
 port, this code is a code of 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.009
 quality of safety or of 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.439
 standardization of security levels 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.060
 this security those countries that are 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.960
 adhered 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.250
 they give us certainty that they have come from 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.909
 the same way that we who 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.189
 we are with the same 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.079
 certification at the national level 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.299
 naval prefecture argentina is the was the 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.179
 authority of application of this agreement 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.189
 international that is subscribed in the 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.810
 headquarters of the maritime organization as 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.610
 as is the day to day and let's do the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.549
 care that consists of getting up to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 that leave while the units are 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.700
 here based on what I was saying 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.179
 The port, although it is certified, has 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.209
 generated an effort a reinforcement a 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.069
 operational safety reinforcement 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:04.020
 with about 100 people with a 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:04.020
 bivouac a one people camping on the side 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.860
 from this parking lot this 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.780
 land and giving certainty of security 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.330
 in all this sector he was saying something 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.950
 as to finish what it has to do with 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.900
 Safety is very important because 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.580
 for the view of the world security is 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.930
 important for everything we must reinforce it and 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.110
 we have to have a lot of subtlety 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.610
 just to be able to observe the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.400
 security parameters that we execute 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.770
 here because we are seeing the world 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.350
 thank you very much perfect there then it is 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.210

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.670
 directly hurry pablo with the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.110
 security of what we are already living 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.570
 and how are we showing him by the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.180
 live public television from zarate 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.160
