00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
that's my PC that's kind of what I've

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.240 
that's my PC that's kind of what I've
got<00:04:27.450> in<00:04:27.660> there<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.170> what<00:04:28.680> I'm<00:04:28.770> playing<00:04:29.070> on

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
got in there and what I'm playing on

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.879 
got in there and what I'm playing on
currently<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:30.630> let's<00:04:30.990> have<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.230> closer<00:04:31.500> look<00:04:31.590> at

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
currently so let's have a closer look at

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.170 
currently so let's have a closer look at
the<00:04:32.190> game<00:04:32.370> itself

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
the game itself

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.430 
the game itself
let<00:04:33.360> me<00:04:33.480> just<00:04:33.690> real<00:04:33.930> click<00:04:34.139> start<00:04:34.410> recording

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
let me just real click start recording

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.010 
let me just real click start recording
here<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.700> we<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:35.970> actually<00:04:36.090> have<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.419> nicer

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
here so we can actually have a nicer

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.190 
here so we can actually have a nicer
screen<00:04:38.240> there<00:04:39.240> we<00:04:39.389> go<00:04:39.510> we're<00:04:39.720> in<00:04:39.750> game<00:04:39.990> right

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
screen there we go we're in game right

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.870 
screen there we go we're in game right
now<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:40.380> as<00:04:40.889> you<00:04:40.980> can<00:04:41.100> see<00:04:41.310> I've<00:04:41.550> got<00:04:41.669> like

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
now and as you can see I've got like

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.720 
now and as you can see I've got like
rival<00:04:42.150> X<00:04:42.270> Factor's<00:04:42.950> config<00:04:43.950> file<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.639> I'm

rival X Factor's config file that I'm

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.550 
rival X Factor's config file that I'm
using<00:04:44.880> right<00:04:45.120> here<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.600> I'm<00:04:45.750> I'm<00:04:46.290> kind<00:04:46.470> of

want<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:53.010> as<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.370> can<00:04:53.490> see<00:04:53.610> in<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.730> test

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
want and as you can see in the test

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.210 
want and as you can see in the test
range<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.390> never<00:04:54.750> basically<00:04:55.020> goes<00:04:55.350> below<00:04:55.620> 120

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220

course<00:04:58.620> it's<00:04:58.860> going<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.040> go<00:04:59.160> below<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.460> but

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
course it's going to go below that but

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.930 
course it's going to go below that but
it<00:05:00.210> usually<00:05:00.540> stays<00:05:00.720> around<00:05:01.160> 120<00:05:02.160> frames<00:05:02.700> per

it usually stays around 120 frames per
second<00:05:03.390> sometimes<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:04.080> goes<00:05:04.169> like<00:05:04.410> 90<00:05:05.010> hundred

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
see here these are my kind of setting
settings<00:05:25.200> here<00:05:26.780> that's<00:05:27.780> basically<00:05:28.290> nothing

settings here that's basically nothing

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.380 
settings here that's basically nothing

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
very interesting here mouth sensitive is

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.409 
very interesting here mouth sensitive is
pretty<00:05:30.630> low<00:05:30.840> because<00:05:30.960> I've<00:05:31.200> I'm<00:05:31.620> running<00:05:32.010> at

pretty low because I've I'm running at

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.900 
pretty low because I've I'm running at
6400<00:05:33.419> dpi<00:05:33.450> s--<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:35.280> high<00:05:35.460> visibility<00:05:35.760> I

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
should usually have that at 100% because

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.890 
should usually have that at 100% because
it's<00:05:38.640> not<00:05:38.910> really<00:05:39.120> hundred-percent<00:05:39.539> but<00:05:39.780> it's

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
it's not really hundred-percent but it's

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.870 
it's not really hundred-percent but it's
just<00:05:39.960> it's<00:05:40.200> just<00:05:40.350> shows<00:05:40.500> on<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.680> percent<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.220> my

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
just it's just shows on a percent and my

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.120 
just it's just shows on a percent and my
audio<00:05:42.120> tab<00:05:42.390> nothing<00:05:42.960> really<00:05:43.289> interesting<00:05:43.590> in

how I am playing so basically I've got

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.550 
how I am playing so basically I've got
like<00:06:14.880> my<00:06:14.910> mouse<00:06:15.300> of<00:06:16.080> course<00:06:16.289> in<00:06:16.350> the<00:06:16.440> right

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
like my mouse of course in the right

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.040 
like my mouse of course in the right
hand<00:06:16.800> but<00:06:17.070> I'm<00:06:17.280> kind<00:06:18.210> of<00:06:18.270> like<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.539> have<00:06:18.780> the

sprinting jumping and doing everything

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.020 
sprinting jumping and doing everything
because<00:07:31.590> I<00:07:31.620> don't<00:07:31.860> have<00:07:32.009> to<00:07:32.159> get<00:07:32.370> rid<00:07:32.550> of<00:07:32.610> or

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.030 
because I don't have to get rid of or

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.830 
because I don't have to get rid of or
hold<00:07:33.449> away<00:07:33.629> get<00:07:33.990> away<00:07:34.139> from<00:07:34.199> the<00:07:34.590> aswe<00:07:35.580> WD<00:07:36.539> keys

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 
hold away get away from the aswe WD keys

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.870 
hold away get away from the aswe WD keys
but<00:07:37.710> I<00:07:37.770> can<00:07:37.919> rather<00:07:38.099> just<00:07:38.400> do<00:07:38.550> it<00:07:38.639> with<00:07:38.759> my

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 
but I can rather just do it with my

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.159 
but I can rather just do it with my
mouse<00:07:39.030> of<00:07:39.150> course<00:07:39.330> control<00:07:39.599> here<00:07:39.870> because<00:07:40.080> I'm

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.169 
mouse of course control here because I'm

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.390 
mouse of course control here because I'm
holding<00:07:40.289> the<00:07:40.500> camera<00:07:40.740> with<00:07:40.979> the<00:07:41.069> other<00:07:41.190> hand

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 
holding the camera with the other hand

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.070 
holding the camera with the other hand
but<00:07:42.000> that's<00:07:42.180> basically<00:07:42.389> our<00:07:42.599> playing<00:07:42.900> I<00:07:43.020> think

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
but that's basically our playing I think

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.110 
but that's basically our playing I think
that's<00:07:43.380> the<00:07:43.620> best<00:07:43.889> way<00:07:44.190> to<00:07:44.250> actually<00:07:44.490> play<00:07:44.849> and

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
that's the best way to actually play and

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.480 
that's the best way to actually play and
to<00:07:45.419> be<00:07:45.569> effective<00:07:46.080> in<00:07:46.199> this<00:07:46.289> game<00:07:46.500> but<00:07:47.460> that

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.490 
to be effective in this game but that

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.269
