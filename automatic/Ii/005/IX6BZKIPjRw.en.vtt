Lowe's Nicola has these little clock
insolent<00:00:21.189> walk-ins<00:00:21.880> which<00:00:22.869> I<00:00:23.050> like<00:00:23.519> makes<00:00:24.519> it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
insolent walk-ins which I like makes it

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.050 
insolent walk-ins which I like makes it
easier<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:28.090> step<00:00:28.359> one<00:00:28.599> is<00:00:28.900> your<00:00:29.170> pet<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.939> need

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
basically mines craft a little bit which

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.610 
basically mines craft a little bit which

like a swamp hole you need to cut a

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.960 
like a swamp hole you need to cut a
little<00:01:13.540> square<00:01:13.780> so<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:15.190> way<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.460> can<00:01:15.580> shown

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
little square so this way you can shown

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.530 
little square so this way you can shown
the<00:01:16.150> area<00:01:17.100> yeah<00:01:18.100> we<00:01:18.580> kind<00:01:18.910> of<00:01:19.030> tug<00:01:19.210> on<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.390> a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
the area yeah we kind of tug on it a

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.990 
the area yeah we kind of tug on it a
little<00:01:19.870> bit<00:01:20.050> on<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.320> side<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:21.610> what<00:01:21.880> it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
little bit on this side that's what it

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.590 
little bit on this side that's what it
should<00:01:22.030> look<00:01:22.300> like<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:24.850> need<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.210> filter

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
should look like so you need the filter

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.530 
should look like so you need the filter
material<00:01:26.280> which<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.460> chose<00:01:27.760> swamp<00:01:28.240> cooler

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
material which I chose swamp cooler

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.680 
material which I chose swamp cooler
filter<00:01:29.080> now<00:01:29.260> you<00:01:29.320> can<00:01:29.590> choose<00:01:29.860> whatever

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
filter now you can choose whatever

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.390 
filter now you can choose whatever
material<00:01:31.690> want<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.200> or<00:01:32.410> what<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.710> prefer<00:01:32.920> I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
material want to or what you prefer I

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.440 
material want to or what you prefer I
prefer<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:35.080> way<00:01:35.140> because<00:01:35.680> it's<00:01:35.830> cheaper

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
prefer it this way because it's cheaper

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.570 
prefer it this way because it's cheaper
so<00:01:37.450> these<00:01:37.990> plastic<00:01:38.500> grates<00:01:38.740> don't<00:01:39.280> really

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
so these plastic grates don't really

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.510 
so these plastic grates don't really
know<00:01:39.790> where<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.030> get<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.450> from<00:01:40.480> I<00:01:40.930> actually

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
know where I get it from I actually

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.860 
know where I get it from I actually
found<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.850> from<00:01:43.540> another<00:01:44.140> project<00:01:45.870> so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
found it from another project so

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.360 
found it from another project so
basically<00:01:47.410> if<00:01:47.620> you<00:01:47.650> have<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.100> piece<00:01:50.370> that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
basically if you have this piece that

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.740 
basically if you have this piece that
levels<00:01:53.250> that's<00:01:54.250> pretty<00:01:54.580> much<00:01:54.730> flush<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.480> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
levels that's pretty much flush to the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.380 
levels that's pretty much flush to the
pipe<00:01:56.290> height<00:01:56.820> when<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.210> put<00:01:58.420> in<00:01:58.570> place<00:01:59.070> so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
pipe height when this is put in place so

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.820 
pipe height when this is put in place so
what<00:02:01.390> I'm<00:02:01.540> gonna<00:02:01.690> do<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.230> I'm<00:02:02.380> gonna<00:02:02.440> get<00:02:02.680> the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.930 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get the
grate<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.420> I'm<00:02:04.660> gonna<00:02:04.900> count<00:02:05.290> maybe<00:02:05.940> four

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
grate and I'm gonna count maybe four

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.850 
grate and I'm gonna count maybe four
spaces

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
spaces

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.830 
spaces
maybe<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:09.180> have<00:02:09.300> four<00:02:09.710> spaces<00:02:10.710> down<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.660> I'll

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
maybe we have four spaces down so I'll

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.930 
maybe we have four spaces down so I'll
get<00:02:13.080> more<00:02:13.290> because<00:02:13.440> I'm<00:02:13.740> one-handed<00:02:14.730> right

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
get more because I'm one-handed right

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.740 
get more because I'm one-handed right
now<00:02:15.150> I'm<00:02:15.720> basically<00:02:16.200> gonna<00:02:16.470> wing<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:17.750> so

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
now I'm basically gonna wing it so

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.450 
now I'm basically gonna wing it so
there's<00:02:19.110> gonna<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.350> these<00:02:19.560> pieces<00:02:19.830> popped<00:02:20.250> up

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
there's gonna be these pieces popped up

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.620 
there's gonna be these pieces popped up
there<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.820> it's<00:02:20.940> gonna<00:02:21.060> make<00:02:21.240> my<00:02:21.390> life<00:02:21.420> a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630

in place you want to make sure this is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.640 
in place you want to make sure this is

cut<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.190> perfection<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.810> these<00:02:42.960> is

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
cut it to perfection one of these is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.190 
cut it to perfection one of these is
actually<00:02:43.350> smaller<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.660> need<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> figure<00:02:46.080> out

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
actually smaller so I need to figure out

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.890 
actually smaller so I need to figure out
which<00:02:46.530> one<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.800> was

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
which one that was

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
this is the little snug this one so the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.320 
this is the little snug this one so the
most<00:02:50.730> Negus<00:02:51.240> one<00:02:51.510> needs<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.709> be<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.820> bottom

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
most Negus one needs to be on the bottom

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.190 
most Negus one needs to be on the bottom
on<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.080> bottom<00:02:55.110> here<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:57.750> ground<00:02:58.050> like

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
on the bottom here so I ground like

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.550 
on the bottom here so I ground like
right<00:02:58.470> here<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.540> I<00:03:00.540> put<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.900> top<00:03:02.150> Yorty

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
right here and I put on top Yorty

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.640 
right here and I put on top Yorty
