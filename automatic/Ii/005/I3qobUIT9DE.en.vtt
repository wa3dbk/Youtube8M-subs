rip it all the way through with the left
over<00:02:09.300> piece<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.290> to<00:02:10.500> once<00:02:10.710> again<00:02:10.830> slice

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
over piece I'm going to once again slice

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.720 
over piece I'm going to once again slice
that<00:02:11.490> in<00:02:11.610> half<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.800> fold<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.460> I'm<00:02:14.610> gonna

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
that in half so I fold it and I'm gonna

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.080 
that in half so I fold it and I'm gonna
do<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:14.970> cut<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.240> in<00:02:15.360> half<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.400> what<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
do is cut it in half so this is what it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.460 
do is cut it in half so this is what it
ought<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.270> look<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.960> two<00:02:19.110> extra

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
ought to look like or the two extra

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.210 
ought to look like or the two extra
pieces<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.600> what<00:02:21.750> we're<00:02:21.840> gonna<00:02:21.900> do<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.380> now

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
pieces so what we're gonna do now is now

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.530 
pieces so what we're gonna do now is now
that<00:02:23.430> we've<00:02:23.550> measured<00:02:23.790> up<00:02:24.000> we<00:02:24.120> know<00:02:24.240> exactly

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
that we've measured up we know exactly

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.060 
that we've measured up we know exactly
where<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.050> belongs<00:02:25.760> your<00:02:26.760> necks<00:02:27.560> going<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
where it belongs your necks going to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.030 
where it belongs your necks going to
flip<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.670> over<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.350> line<00:02:31.890> right<00:02:32.580> here

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
flip it over and so the line right here

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.650 
flip it over and so the line right here
this<00:02:35.040> keeps<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.670> from<00:02:35.790> fraying<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.480> that's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
this keeps it from fraying so that's

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.480 
this keeps it from fraying so that's
what<00:02:36.750> I'm<00:02:36.810> gonna<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.320> when<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.310> flip<00:02:38.430> it

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
what I'm gonna do and when you flip it

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.270 
what I'm gonna do and when you flip it
over<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.880> should<00:02:39.000> look<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:41.040> would

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
over it should look like this it would

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.370 
over it should look like this it would
now<00:02:41.370> look<00:02:41.580> like<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.989> fold<00:02:43.260> it

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
now look like this and you fold it

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.949 
now look like this and you fold it
you'll<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.130> your<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.430> side<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.420> here

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
you'll see your right side here and here

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.110 
you'll see your right side here and here
so<00:02:46.140> next<00:02:46.950> I'm<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.340> do<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.790> we're<00:02:48.090> going

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
apply something on top so that it

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.590 
apply something on top so that it
doesn't<00:03:58.620> burn<00:03:58.770> it<00:03:59.010> because<00:03:59.370> if<00:03:59.610> if<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.510> have

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
doesn't burn it because if if you have

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.080 
doesn't burn it because if if you have
the<00:04:00.690> heat<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.020> too<00:04:01.200> high<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.650> could<00:04:01.830> burn<00:04:02.090> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the heat is too high it could burn the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.770 
the heat is too high it could burn the
fabric<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.430> that's<00:04:05.610> why<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.760> do<00:04:05.910> I'm<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.570> a

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
fabric so that's why I do I'm just a

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.940 
fabric so that's why I do I'm just a
fire<00:04:07.020> like<00:04:07.260> cloth<00:04:07.560> over

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
fire like cloth over

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.040 
fire like cloth over
well<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.120> took<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.600> cloth<00:04:10.500> in<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.600> I<00:04:12.600> make<00:04:12.810> sure

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
well I took the cloth in and I make sure

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.470 
well I took the cloth in and I make sure

that you know is the same satin side for
all<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:15.720> them<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.079> it's<00:04:16.560> kind<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.859> its<00:04:17.040> really

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
all of them and it's kind of its really

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.330 
all of them and it's kind of its really
actually<00:04:17.459> simple<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:19.019> sorta<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:20.100> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
actually simple you sorta just that the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.120 
actually simple you sorta just that the
edges<00:04:20.790> pop<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.169> make<00:04:22.710> sure<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.010> it

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
edges pop it in to make sure that it

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.090 
edges pop it in to make sure that it
comes<00:04:23.370> out<00:04:23.640> equal<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:25.320> pin<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.560> down<00:04:25.680> and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
comes out equal and you pin it down and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.950 
comes out equal and you pin it down and
you<00:04:26.160> still<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> straight<00:04:26.760> line<00:04:26.970> down<00:04:27.180> on<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.900> and

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
you still a straight line down on it and

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.500 
you still a straight line down on it and
when<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.350> stars<00:04:28.590> who<00:04:28.950> pin<00:04:29.700> it<00:04:29.790> down<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.300> iron

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
when it stars who pin it down and iron

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.930 
when it stars who pin it down and iron
it<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.960> are<00:04:31.410> increased<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.070> then<00:04:32.580> I'll<00:04:32.700> go<00:04:32.850> do

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
it I are increased it then I'll go do

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.760 
it I are increased it then I'll go do
now<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.300> just<00:04:33.510> follow<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:33.900> line<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.380> so<00:04:34.530> one

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
now is just follow this line and so one

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.350 
now is just follow this line and so one
line<00:04:35.010> up<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.400> I'm<00:04:35.580> gonna<00:04:35.729> do<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.030> same<00:04:36.300> to

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
line up and I'm gonna do the same to

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.380 
line up and I'm gonna do the same to
both<00:04:36.690> sides<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.500> then<00:04:37.729> slice<00:04:38.729> this<00:04:39.090> long

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
both sides and then slice this long

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.030 
both sides and then slice this long
piece<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.870> middle<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.290> it's<00:04:40.590> done<00:04:40.800> so

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
piece in the middle and it's done so

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.610 
piece in the middle and it's done so
