00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.330 
was I was gonna say you looked up at the
moon<00:02:09.509> right<00:02:09.840> before<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.349> came<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.009> felt

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
moon right before you came and then felt

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.479 
moon right before you came and then felt
awkward<00:02:14.239> good<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.160> other<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.400> would

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
awkward good I think the other one would

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.680 
awkward good I think the other one would
work<00:02:17.610> better<00:02:19.700> for<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.760> comedic<00:02:21.120> standpoint

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
work better for a comedic standpoint

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.680 
work better for a comedic standpoint
it's<00:02:21.810> much<00:02:22.049> better<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:23.310> you'd<00:02:23.519> have<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.970> you'd

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
it's much better and you'd have to you'd

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.850 
it's much better and you'd have to you'd
have<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.230> who's<00:02:25.530> Lyle<00:02:26.780> you'd<00:02:27.780> have<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.170> explain

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
have to who's Lyle you'd have to explain

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.160 
have to who's Lyle you'd have to explain
that<00:02:30.560> post-coitus<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:32.150> post-coitus<00:02:33.170> pretty

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that post-coitus to post-coitus pretty

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.660 
that post-coitus to post-coitus pretty
much<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.470> think<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.830> would<00:02:34.980> warrant<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.489> an

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
much I think it would warrant like an

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.670 
much I think it would warrant like an
immediate<00:02:36.239> explanation<00:02:36.510> too<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.560> you'd

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
immediate explanation too so you'd

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.620 
immediate explanation too so you'd
probably<00:02:37.890> be<00:02:38.459> like<00:02:38.670> inside<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.390> her<00:02:39.480> at<00:02:39.599> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
probably be like inside of her at the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.970 
probably be like inside of her at the
time<00:02:39.870> yeah<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> would<00:02:40.319> probably<00:02:40.380> still<00:02:40.799> be<00:02:40.829> in

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
time yeah I would probably still be in

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.370 
time yeah I would probably still be in
there<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:42.060> probably<00:02:42.299> be<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.810> before<00:02:43.019> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
there it's probably be like before the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.800 
there it's probably be like before the
pullout<00:02:43.769> you'd<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.549> like<00:02:44.700> no<00:02:45.090> okay<00:02:45.420> look<00:02:45.630> this

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
pullout you'd be like no okay look this

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.690 
pullout you'd be like no okay look this
one<00:02:46.049> time<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.380> was<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.709> Skype<00:02:47.099> call<00:02:47.370> with<00:02:47.400> my

friend Lyle and I didn't know him too
well<00:02:49.290> at<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> time<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:50.610> what<00:02:50.760> just

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
well at the time and that's what just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.729 
well at the time and that's what just
she<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.599> at<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.780> point<00:02:52.019> she'd<00:02:52.530> probably

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
she just at that point she'd probably

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.770 
she just at that point she'd probably
cut<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.400> off<00:02:53.579> or<00:02:53.849> start<00:02:54.090> crying<00:02:54.390> or<00:02:54.629> something
