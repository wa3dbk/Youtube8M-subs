00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.299
 find restorers attentive to each 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.950
 detail is not easy 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.260
 and it was here in Brazil that the Venezuelan 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.469
 alessandro realized that he could win 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.360
 space working in this area a life 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.029
 guided by music 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.580
 his passion for clarinets led him to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.250
 venezuela symphony orchestra 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.730
 but after 15 years alessandro had 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.070
 facing a forced retirement 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.920
 had some medical problems with a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.149
 loss of blood of two children 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.680
 then all a retirement until 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.260
 Time, right? 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.829
 at this moment we decided my family I 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.989
 moms to brasÃ­lia 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.450
 the political turmoil in the homeland 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.120
 hastened the move to mines 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.789
 here he has rediscovered the harmony with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.399
 music restoring wind instruments 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.059
 not by chance alessandro lives at a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.489
 ufmg's conservatory block has 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.210
 not a right relationship with the musicians 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.780
 colleagues on such until sometime arrive 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.860
 university students with doubts 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.759
 there to play some hint of 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.189
 so many years of experience not touching 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.610
 before choosing the new profession hit 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:28.020
 safe and did not know anyone here 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.659
 but in a short time and the musicians neither 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.000
 they started to mention the studio is 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.390
 musician of the Philharmonic Orchestra 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.509
 federal university and dark circles 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.250
 instrument of sao paulo de rio grande 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.280
 of the deaf paraiba and good of minas gerais 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.010
 not everything 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.560
 once restorer it happened to be 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.080
 also a guardian of relics a 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.560
 customer left here this package is 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.110
 manufactured in france for 120 years 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.229
 in the case of this instrument I receive 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.340
 instrument with one is very bad the whole 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.300
 wood repaired all this to the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.180
 exchange the lacquer and concentrate for 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.120
 Such a delicate work a mini key 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.340
 is used to turn the screw and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.950
 it is removed later with a small 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.680
 pliers almost a forceps 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.750
 this other device identifies whether there is 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:34.390
 some air gap 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.319
 I'll close it, we can see that it has reached 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.239
 0 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.900
 This means that the instrument is 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.300
 really well well is the adaptation 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.160
 of the family in belo horizonte always 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.160
 clear around music 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.629
 I think since we've been together 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.319
 always this way you have always been 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.750
 moved by music is very 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.510
 present in our house even if he 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.000
 to retire the music continues smoking part 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.730
 the culture of children's education 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.670
 Let's continue growing here and every 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.659
 related but with a people so 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.659
 It's beautiful, I have.
