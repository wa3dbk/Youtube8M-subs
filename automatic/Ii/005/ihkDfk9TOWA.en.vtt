ways to investigate another world is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.700 
ways to investigate another world is
just<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> figure<00:00:54.629> out<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.199> looks<00:00:55.469> like

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
just to figure out what it looks like

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
just to figure out what it looks like
and<00:00:56.039> why<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> Europa<00:00:57.239> imaging<00:00:57.660> system

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and why so the Europa imaging system

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.240 
and why so the Europa imaging system
will<00:00:58.109> take<00:00:58.260> photos<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> moon's<00:00:59.039> surface

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
will take photos of the moon's surface

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
will take photos of the moon's surface
getting<00:00:59.609> resolution<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.480> high<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.079> some
