00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hey guys welcome to the second

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.999 
hey guys welcome to the second
PowerPoint<00:00:02.850> or<00:00:03.270> tutorial<00:00:04.049> we'll<00:00:04.529> have<00:00:04.710> we'll

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
PowerPoint or tutorial we'll have we'll

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.380 
PowerPoint or tutorial we'll have we'll
be<00:00:05.130> having<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.430> look<00:00:05.549> at<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.879> social

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
be having a look at the social

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.080 
be having a look at the social
ecological<00:00:06.660> model<00:00:07.109> today<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.970> how<00:00:08.970> it

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
ecological model today and how it

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.770 
ecological model today and how it
influences<00:00:09.780> physical<00:00:10.410> activity<00:00:10.800> levels<00:00:11.780> so

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
influences physical activity levels so

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.259 
influences physical activity levels so
first<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.170> all<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.469> model<00:00:13.769> itself<00:00:14.269> there's

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
first of all the model itself there's

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.220 
first of all the model itself there's
four<00:00:15.660> areas<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.369> basically<00:00:17.609> describes<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
four areas so it basically describes the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320 
four areas so it basically describes the
four<00:00:19.470> levels<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.100> influence<00:00:20.609> activities<00:00:21.119> so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
four levels that influence activities so

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.720 
four levels that influence activities so
there's<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.689> individual<00:00:22.260> level<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.859> social

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
there's an individual level the social

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.759 
there's an individual level the social
environment<00:00:24.420> influences<00:00:25.050> people<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
environment influences people the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.890 
environment influences people the
physical<00:00:26.220> environment<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:27.660> there's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
physical environment and then there's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.030 
physical environment and then there's
policy<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.109> individual<00:00:31.710> level

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
policy so for the individual level

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.250 
policy so for the individual level
things<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.090> diet<00:00:33.800> sentry<00:00:34.800> behavior<00:00:35.340> age

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
things like diet sentry behavior age

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.920 
things like diet sentry behavior age
gender<00:00:37.550> whether<00:00:38.550> you're<00:00:38.879> male<00:00:39.360> or<00:00:39.570> female

gender whether you're male or female

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.080 
gender whether you're male or female
obviously<00:00:40.110> will<00:00:40.649> depend<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.219> whether<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.910> do

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090

activity or not your socioeconomic

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.209 
activity or not your socioeconomic
status<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.059> much<00:00:45.180> money<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.600> have

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
status so how much money you have

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.549 
status so how much money you have
whether<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:48.210> wealthy<00:00:48.780> lifestyle<00:00:49.289> or

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
not your education level the more

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
not your education level the more
education<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> more<00:00:53.219> activity

education you have the more activity

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.080 
education you have the more activity
you're<00:00:54.059> likely<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.840> your<00:00:55.559> beliefs<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.910> for

you're likely to do your beliefs so for

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.180

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
example some religions limit the amount

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.180 
example some religions limit the amount
of<00:00:59.280> activity<00:00:59.579> particular<00:01:00.059> people<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.780> do

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
of activity particular people can do

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
of activity particular people can do
your<00:01:02.190> self-efficacy<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.270> belief<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.840> yourself

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
your self-efficacy so belief in yourself

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.679 
your self-efficacy so belief in yourself
and<00:01:04.610> whether<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.760> think<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.450> things

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and whether you think you can do things

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.620 
and whether you think you can do things
the<00:01:07.590> barriers<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.670> individual<00:01:09.240> barriers

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the barriers so your individual barriers

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.260 
the barriers so your individual barriers
are<00:01:09.900> things<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.500> mental<00:01:11.100> blocks<00:01:11.460> motivation

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
are things like mental blocks motivation

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.960 
are things like mental blocks motivation
that<00:01:13.110> sort<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.439> thing<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.830> whether<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> get

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that sort of thing and whether you get

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
that sort of thing and whether you get
enjoyment<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.630> exercise<00:01:16.170> some<00:01:16.470> people

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
enjoyment out of exercise some people

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.120 
enjoyment out of exercise some people
just<00:01:16.950> simply<00:01:17.280> don't<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.740> social

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
just simply don't like it the social

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.890 
just simply don't like it the social
environment<00:01:20.790> looks<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.330> things<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
environment looks at things that

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.550 
environment looks at things that
surround<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:23.040> social<00:01:23.460> way<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.560> things

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
surround you in a social way so things

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
surround you in a social way so things
like<00:01:25.680> support<00:01:26.100> from<00:01:26.280> family<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.759> friends<00:01:26.939> if

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
like support from family and friends if

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.060 
like support from family and friends if
your<00:01:27.869> family<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.409> friends<00:01:28.590> actually<00:01:28.829> do

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
your family and friends actually do

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.390 
your family and friends actually do
exercise<00:01:29.520> you're<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:29.970> likely<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.540> your

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
exercise you're more likely to your

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.590 
exercise you're more likely to your
siblings<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:32.729> brothers<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.180> sisters

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
siblings so your brothers and sisters

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
siblings so your brothers and sisters
again<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:35.490> likely<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
again if they do you're more likely to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.120 
again if they do you're more likely to
because<00:01:36.509> usually<00:01:36.900> you'll<00:01:37.290> hang<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.009> with

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
because usually you'll hang out with

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.440 
because usually you'll hang out with
them<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> exercise<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.299> they're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
them and do the exercise that they're

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.530 
them and do the exercise that they're
doing<00:01:39.710> your<00:01:40.710> parental<00:01:41.220> physical<00:01:41.790> activity<00:01:42.210> so

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
doing your parental physical activity so

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
doing your parental physical activity so
if<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.780> parents<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.350> active<00:01:43.740> you're<00:01:44.100> more

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
if your parents are active you're more

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
if your parents are active you're more
likely<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:45.000> active<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.259> someone

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
likely to be active if you have someone

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.940 
likely to be active if you have someone
to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.799> active<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:48.110> social<00:01:49.110> isolation<00:01:49.259> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to be active with social isolation so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
to be active with social isolation so
that<00:01:50.100> means<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.729> lock<00:01:51.450> yourself<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that means if you lock yourself up and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.690 
that means if you lock yourself up and
keep<00:01:52.409> yourself<00:01:52.770> away<00:01:52.979> from<00:01:53.040> others<00:01:53.520> you're

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
keep yourself away from others you're

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.480 
keep yourself away from others you're
less<00:01:53.880> likely<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.689> activity<00:01:55.250> if<00:01:56.250> there's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
less likely to do activity if there's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
less likely to do activity if there's
kids<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> same<00:01:57.270> area<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.020> more<00:01:58.469> likely

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
kids in the same area as you more likely

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.109 
kids in the same area as you more likely
to<00:01:58.829> hang<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.369> them<00:01:59.640> your<00:02:00.540> ethnicity<00:02:00.869> so

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
to hang out with them your ethnicity so

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.889 
to hang out with them your ethnicity so
cultural<00:02:03.119> things<00:02:03.439> whether<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:06.210> way<00:02:06.869> of

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
cultural things whether it's a way of

well the physical environment is really
important<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.640> need<00:02:48.330> things<00:02:48.569> like<00:02:48.750> walking

that<00:02:52.530> help<00:02:52.829> you<00:02:53.040> actually<00:02:53.579> do<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.030> exercise

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
that help you actually do the exercise

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.150 
that help you actually do the exercise

if you live in a flat in the middle of

if you live in a flat in the middle of
the<00:02:56.310> city<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:56.819> probably<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.599> little<00:02:57.720> bit<00:02:57.840> more

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
the city it's probably a little bit more

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.630 
the city it's probably a little bit more
tricky<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.410> do<00:02:58.620> exercise<00:02:59.069> than<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.459> would<00:02:59.610> be

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
tricky to do exercise than it would be

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.920 
tricky to do exercise than it would be
if<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.060> were<00:03:00.380> say<00:03:01.380> out<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:02.000> parklands<00:03:03.000> the

if you were say out in parklands the

weather obviously if it's freezing or if

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.789 
weather obviously if it's freezing or if
it's<00:03:06.329> boiling<00:03:06.540> hot<00:03:06.930> you're<00:03:07.140> not<00:03:07.380> going<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.650> do

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
it's boiling hot you're not going to do

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.920 
it's boiling hot you're not going to do
as<00:03:08.130> much<00:03:08.370> exercise<00:03:08.819> then<00:03:09.390> if<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.630> was<00:03:09.780> just

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
as much exercise then if it was just

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.160 
as much exercise then if it was just
Pleasant<00:03:10.440> mid-tempo<00:03:11.400> Jers<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.450> geography

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
Pleasant mid-tempo Jers the geography

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.400 
Pleasant mid-tempo Jers the geography
are<00:03:13.470> things<00:03:13.739> like<00:03:14.000> hills<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:16.110> know<00:03:16.260> with

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
are things like hills and you know with

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.650 
are things like hills and you know with
this<00:03:16.680> Beach<00:03:16.950> around<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.880> sort<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.180> thing

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
this Beach around and that sort of thing

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.640 
this Beach around and that sort of thing
so<00:03:19.489> people<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.670> are<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.030> hilly<00:03:21.870> areas<00:03:22.350> are

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so people that are in hilly areas are

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.920 
so people that are in hilly areas are
less<00:03:22.799> likely<00:03:23.100> less<00:03:23.819> likely<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.480> activity

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
less likely less likely to do activity

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.569 
less likely less likely to do activity
cuz<00:03:25.139> it<00:03:25.319> takes<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.620> lot<00:03:25.769> more<00:03:25.799> effort<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.310> go<00:03:26.459> up

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
cuz it takes a lot more effort to go up

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.309 
cuz it takes a lot more effort to go up
and<00:03:26.790> down<00:03:26.940> hills<00:03:27.209> than<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.600> does<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:28.079> what

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
and down hills than it does just what

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.229 
and down hills than it does just what
lands<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.310> that's<00:03:29.489> why<00:03:29.639> you<00:03:29.700> see<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.030> many

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
lands and that's why you see so many

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.599 
lands and that's why you see so many
cyclists<00:03:31.139> in<00:03:31.290> areas<00:03:32.010> where<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:32.370> completely

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
cyclists in areas where it's completely

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.259 
cyclists in areas where it's completely
flat<00:03:33.920> access<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.069> recreational<00:03:35.730> facilities

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
flat access to recreational facilities

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.720 
flat access to recreational facilities
so<00:03:36.540> if<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:37.170> more<00:03:37.410> access<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:38.430> gyms

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
so if you have more access to like gyms

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.910 
so if you have more access to like gyms
and<00:03:39.630> swimming<00:03:39.959> pools<00:03:40.200> then<00:03:40.470> you're<00:03:40.799> more

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
and swimming pools then you're more

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.039 
and swimming pools then you're more
likely<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.310> do<00:03:41.579> activity<00:03:42.180> as<00:03:42.269> well<00:03:42.480> same<00:03:43.019> as

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
likely to do activity as well same as

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.640 
likely to do activity as well same as
play<00:03:43.440> downs<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.130> parks<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.930> aesthetics<00:03:46.440> of

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
play downs and parks the aesthetics of

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.890 
play downs and parks the aesthetics of
an<00:03:46.799> environment<00:03:47.340> means<00:03:47.519> how<00:03:47.760> nice<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.540> looks

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
an environment means how nice it looks

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.819 
an environment means how nice it looks
so<00:03:49.260> if<00:03:49.650> you've<00:03:49.889> got<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.400> some<00:03:51.019> ugly<00:03:52.019> dumpy

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
so if you've got just some ugly dumpy

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.069 
so if you've got just some ugly dumpy
town<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.579> sort<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.090> exercise<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.720> that's<00:03:54.989> not

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
town to sort of exercise in that's not

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.449 
town to sort of exercise in that's not
so<00:03:55.380> amazing

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
so amazing

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.050

the beautiful coastal part of Sydney
where<00:04:02.400> everyone<00:04:03.389> exercises<00:04:04.109> then<00:04:04.349> you're

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
where everyone exercises then you're

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.069 
where everyone exercises then you're
more<00:04:04.920> likely<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.370> do<00:04:05.700> exercise<00:04:06.329> because<00:04:06.989> it

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
more likely to do exercise because it

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.039 
more likely to do exercise because it
looks<00:04:07.230> nice<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:08.790> socioeconomic<00:04:09.359> status<00:04:09.930> of

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
looks nice the socioeconomic status of

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.140 
looks nice the socioeconomic status of
the<00:04:10.169> neighbourhood<00:04:10.590> if<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.919> sort<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:11.970> live<00:04:12.120> in

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
the neighbourhood if you sort of live in

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.710 
the neighbourhood if you sort of live in
a<00:04:12.329> dingy<00:04:13.040> area<00:04:14.040> or<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> part<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.579> town

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
a dingy area or a part of town

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.870 
a dingy area or a part of town
that<00:04:16.019> doesn't<00:04:16.590> really<00:04:16.919> feel<00:04:17.250> safe<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.729> you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
that doesn't really feel safe to you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.909 
that doesn't really feel safe to you
then<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.660> know<00:04:18.690> less<00:04:19.019> likely<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.709> do<00:04:19.889> the

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
then you know less likely to do the

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.820 
then you know less likely to do the
exercise<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:22.320> goes<00:04:22.530> along<00:04:22.680> with

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
exercise and that goes along with

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.820 
exercise and that goes along with
perceptions<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.700> safety<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.360> stranger

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
perceptions of safety and stranger

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.149 
perceptions of safety and stranger
if<00:04:25.889> there's<00:04:26.129> a<00:04:26.189> lot<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.909> traffic<00:04:27.919> parents<00:04:28.919> are

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
if there's a lot of traffic parents are

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.920 
if there's a lot of traffic parents are
probably<00:04:29.370> reluctant<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.270> let<00:04:30.449> their<00:04:30.659> little

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
probably reluctant to let their little

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.300 
probably reluctant to let their little
kids<00:04:31.189> do<00:04:32.189> exercise<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:33.439> the<00:04:34.439> crime<00:04:34.830> rates<00:04:35.099> as

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
kids do exercise and the crime rates as

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.279 
kids do exercise and the crime rates as
well<00:04:35.490> will<00:04:35.909> also<00:04:36.300> influence<00:04:36.629> that<00:04:37.020> so

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
well will also influence that so

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.070 
well will also influence that so
basically<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:38.460> want<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.729> have<00:04:38.789> a<00:04:38.939> safe<00:04:39.330> nice

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
basically you want to have a safe nice

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.559 
basically you want to have a safe nice
area<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.650> do<00:04:40.919> exercise<00:04:41.490> in<00:04:41.699> otherwise<00:04:42.120> it's

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 
area to do exercise in otherwise it's

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.080 
area to do exercise in otherwise it's
it's<00:04:43.080> not<00:04:43.319> really<00:04:43.680> pleasant<00:04:44.129> to<00:04:44.310> be<00:04:44.490> doing

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
it's not really pleasant to be doing

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.110 
it's not really pleasant to be doing
activity<00:04:46.039> living<00:04:47.039> in<00:04:47.159> a<00:04:47.219> court<00:04:47.490> sometimes

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
activity living in a court sometimes

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.709 
activity living in a court sometimes
that<00:04:48.389> creates<00:04:48.659> like<00:04:49.169> a<00:04:49.199> social<00:04:50.270> niche<00:04:51.270> where

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
that creates like a social niche where

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.860 
that creates like a social niche where
people<00:04:52.409> know<00:04:52.620> each<00:04:52.650> other<00:04:53.039> I<00:04:53.400> suppose<00:04:54.180> bit

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
people know each other I suppose bit

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.559 
people know each other I suppose bit
like<00:04:55.080> Ramsey<00:04:55.979> Street<00:04:56.039> on<00:04:56.460> neighbors<00:04:56.879> so

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
like Ramsey Street on neighbors so

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.510 
like Ramsey Street on neighbors so
everyone<00:04:58.199> knows<00:04:58.379> everyone<00:04:58.919> you<00:04:59.159> might<00:04:59.310> get

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
everyone knows everyone you might get

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.869 
everyone knows everyone you might get
out<00:04:59.669> and<00:05:00.000> have<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:00.360> good<00:05:00.569> time<00:05:00.780> together<00:05:01.550> but<00:05:02.550> on

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
out and have a good time together but on

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.390 
out and have a good time together but on
the<00:05:03.210> flip<00:05:03.690> side<00:05:03.719> of<00:05:03.930> that<00:05:04.139> it<00:05:04.590> may<00:05:04.800> be<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.280> it

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
the flip side of that it may be that it

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.159 
the flip side of that it may be that it
restricts<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:05.940> amount<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.360> exercise<00:05:06.690> you<00:05:07.020> do

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
restricts the amount of exercise you do

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.570 
restricts the amount of exercise you do
because<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.620> actually<00:05:07.889> have<00:05:08.009> to<00:05:08.129> leave<00:05:08.310> that

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
because you actually have to leave that

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.969 
because you actually have to leave that
court<00:05:08.849> and<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.659> know<00:05:09.780> it's<00:05:09.960> not<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.169> straight

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
court and you know it's not a straight

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.089 
court and you know it's not a straight
free<00:05:11.190> street<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:13.229> might<00:05:13.740> end<00:05:13.919> up<00:05:14.039> getting

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
free street so you might end up getting

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.290 
free street so you might end up getting
less<00:05:14.550> exercise<00:05:16.099> and<00:05:17.099> the<00:05:17.610> connectivity<00:05:18.270> of

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
less exercise and the connectivity of

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.019 
less exercise and the connectivity of
streets<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:19.620> sort<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:19.919> connects<00:05:20.669> to<00:05:20.879> the

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
streets that sort of connects to the

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.379 
streets that sort of connects to the
living<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:22.050> court<00:05:22.759> the<00:05:23.759> easier<00:05:24.210> the

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
living in a court the easier the

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.540 
living in a court the easier the
run-through<00:05:24.659> of<00:05:24.990> streets<00:05:25.409> so<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:26.099> less<00:05:26.310> dead

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
run-through of streets so the less dead

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.159 
run-through of streets so the less dead
ends<00:05:26.849> you<00:05:26.939> have<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.360> more<00:05:27.539> likely<00:05:27.689> you<00:05:28.020> are<00:05:28.080> to

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
ends you have the more likely you are to

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.170 
ends you have the more likely you are to
do<00:05:28.469> exercise<00:05:29.039> because<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.819> know<00:05:29.909> you<00:05:29.969> can

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
do exercise because you know you can

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.409 
do exercise because you know you can
ride<00:05:30.330> your<00:05:30.509> bike<00:05:30.779> around<00:05:31.139> for<00:05:31.289> a<00:05:31.319> nice<00:05:32.419> you

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
ride your bike around for a nice you

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.119 
ride your bike around for a nice you
know<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.569> couple<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.990> hours<00:05:34.379> rather<00:05:34.710> than<00:05:35.099> a

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:35.129 
know a couple of hours rather than a

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.510 
know a couple of hours rather than a
couple<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.490> minutes<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:36.919> policy<00:05:37.919> so<00:05:38.190> policy

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
couple of minutes and policy so policy

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.510 
couple of minutes and policy so policy
are<00:05:38.789> basically<00:05:39.270> rules<00:05:39.690> or<00:05:40.050> regulations<00:05:40.860> that

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
are basically rules or regulations that

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.279 
are basically rules or regulations that
people<00:05:41.879> put<00:05:42.060> in<00:05:42.180> place<00:05:42.479> to<00:05:42.719> try<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.139> help

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
people put in place to try and help

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.040 
people put in place to try and help
improve<00:05:43.770> people's<00:05:44.009> levels<00:05:44.580> of<00:05:44.759> exercise<00:05:45.210> so

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
improve people's levels of exercise so

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.589 
improve people's levels of exercise so
urban<00:05:46.589> planning<00:05:47.099> is<00:05:47.789> usually<00:05:48.330> done<00:05:48.569> by

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
urban planning is usually done by

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.629 
urban planning is usually done by
councils<00:05:49.379> and<00:05:50.750> they<00:05:51.750> will<00:05:51.930> put<00:05:52.139> out

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
councils and they will put out

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.519 
councils and they will put out
guidelines<00:05:53.639> for<00:05:54.000> people<00:05:54.389> making<00:05:54.960> new<00:05:55.139> estates

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
guidelines for people making new estates

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.070 
guidelines for people making new estates
so<00:05:56.250> that's<00:05:56.460> why<00:05:56.610> you<00:05:56.669> see<00:05:56.940> a<00:05:56.969> lot<00:05:57.240> of<00:05:57.270> new

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
so that's why you see a lot of new

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.050 
so that's why you see a lot of new
housing<00:05:58.529> estates<00:05:58.860> today<00:05:59.159> they<00:05:59.370> include<00:05:59.789> a<00:05:59.879> lot

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
housing estates today they include a lot

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.879 
housing estates today they include a lot
of<00:06:00.089> park<00:06:00.419> lands<00:06:00.659> and<00:06:01.020> lakes<00:06:01.229> and<00:06:01.529> that<00:06:01.620> sort<00:06:01.860> of

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
of park lands and lakes and that sort of

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.869 
of park lands and lakes and that sort of
thing<00:06:02.150> because<00:06:03.150> they're<00:06:03.629> trying<00:06:03.900> to<00:06:04.139> attract

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
thing because they're trying to attract

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.510 
thing because they're trying to attract
more<00:06:05.879> residents<00:06:06.479> and<00:06:06.719> you<00:06:07.259> know<00:06:07.379> it's<00:06:07.889> nicer

there's many levels of influence that

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.679 
there's many levels of influence that
can<00:07:27.879> cause<00:07:28.389> a<00:07:28.419> person<00:07:28.719> to<00:07:29.050> do<00:07:29.199> activity<00:07:29.800> or<00:07:29.979> not

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:33.219 
so they'll be individual social
