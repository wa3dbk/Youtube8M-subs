about<00:00:44.340> my<00:00:44.720> 2011<00:00:45.720> board<00:00:46.310> Greg<00:00:47.310> Nelson<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.000> I

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
about my 2011 board Greg Nelson and I

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.060 
about my 2011 board Greg Nelson and I
have<00:00:48.180> been<00:00:48.510> shaping<00:00:48.780> boards<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.650> a<00:00:49.680> long<00:00:49.860> time

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
have been shaping boards for a long time

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.520 
have been shaping boards for a long time
i<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.400> i'm<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.730> board<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.420> number<00:00:51.720> 15<00:00:52.200> with

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
i think i'm at board like number 15 with

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.920 
i think i'm at board like number 15 with
hyper<00:00:52.740> life<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.480> over<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> years<00:00:54.600> I've

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
hyper life and over the years I've

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.630 
hyper life and over the years I've
really<00:00:55.260> got<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.470> spend<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.130> figuring<00:00:56.520> out

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
really got to spend time figuring out

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.450 
really got to spend time figuring out
what<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> don't<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.650> hyper

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
what I like what I don't like and hyper

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.950 
what I like what I don't like and hyper
light<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.090> good<00:01:00.210> about<00:01:00.300> translating

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
light is really good about translating

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.530 
light is really good about translating
that<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.440> these<00:01:01.830> shapes<00:01:02.300> Greg<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.450> have

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
that to these shapes Greg and I have

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.420 
that to these shapes Greg and I have
been<00:01:03.630> hands-on<00:01:04.020> together<00:01:04.589> working<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.220> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
been hands-on together working on this

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.110 
been hands-on together working on this
thing<00:01:05.730> and<00:01:06.950> got<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.160> really<00:01:08.400> great<00:01:08.610> features

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
thing and got some really great features

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.920 
thing and got some really great features
out<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.660> this<00:01:11.300> something<00:01:12.300> that<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.600> about

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
out of this something that I think about

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.480 
out of this something that I think about
like<00:01:13.050> when<00:01:13.410> I'm<00:01:13.560> designing<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.160> board<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
like when I'm designing a board is I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.760 
like when I'm designing a board is I
want<00:01:14.700> something<00:01:14.940> that's<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.390> work<00:01:15.540> for

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
want something that's going to work for

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.660 
want something that's going to work for
somebody<00:01:16.770> who<00:01:16.950> gets<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> board<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
somebody who gets on the board for the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
somebody who gets on the board for the
first<00:01:17.880> time<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.510> I<00:01:18.810> want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.050> able<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> grab

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
first time and I want to be able to grab
that<00:01:19.650> board<00:01:19.860> off<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.070> shelf<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.910> go<00:01:21.090> right<00:01:21.300> at

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
did new at this board we've got
three-stage<00:01:37.619> rocker<00:01:37.920> which<00:01:38.160> I've<00:01:38.340> kind<00:01:38.610> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
three-stage rocker which I've kind of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.670 
three-stage rocker which I've kind of
stayed<00:01:38.910> away<00:01:38.940> from<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:39.750> years<00:01:39.810> but

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
stayed away from for all these years but

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.560 
stayed away from for all these years but
we<00:01:41.160> didn't<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> flat<00:01:42.000> spot<00:01:42.330> we

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
we didn't go with a flat spot we

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
we didn't go with a flat spot we
actually<00:01:42.840> kept<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.140> board<00:01:43.350> continuous<00:01:43.950> in

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
actually kept the board continuous in

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.980 
actually kept the board continuous in
between<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> feet<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.900> really

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
between the feet so you don't really

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.620 
between the feet so you don't really
have<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> sacrifice<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.700> landing<00:01:48.060> still<00:01:48.300> soft

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
have to sacrifice the landing still soft

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.100 
have to sacrifice the landing still soft
landings<00:01:49.110> big<00:01:49.410> air<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:51.510> thing<00:01:51.690> that<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.870> really

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
landings big air the thing that I really

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.630 
landings big air the thing that I really
like<00:01:52.380> about<00:01:52.410> this<00:01:52.710> board<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.010> sometimes<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
like about this board is sometimes I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.250 
like about this board is sometimes I
want<00:01:53.910> a<00:01:53.970> bus<00:01:54.180> big<00:01:54.450> into<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.750> flats<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
want a bus big into the flats and

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.690

other times I want to stay on the
surface<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.710> water<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> butter<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> way

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
surface of the water and butter the way

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.630 
surface of the water and butter the way
and<00:01:59.940> do<00:02:00.120> some<00:02:00.300> slides<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.830> thing<00:02:02.040> really

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and do some slides so this thing really

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760 
and do some slides so this thing really
hits<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:03.060> lot<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.480> areas<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.200> super<00:02:04.650> happy

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
hits a lot of areas and I'm super happy

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.900 
hits a lot of areas and I'm super happy
with<00:02:04.920> how<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.250> board

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
with how this board

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.460 
with how this board
so<00:02:06.910> by<00:02:07.120> board<00:02:07.330> comes<00:02:07.510> in<00:02:07.690> two<00:02:07.870> sizes<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:08.410> can

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
so by board comes in two sizes you can
