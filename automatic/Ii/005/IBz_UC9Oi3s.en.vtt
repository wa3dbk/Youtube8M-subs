to stream things wirelessly as opposed

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
to stream things wirelessly as opposed
to<00:01:23.700> most<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> devices<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
to most of the devices like this on the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.899 
to most of the devices like this on the
market<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.920> includes<00:01:26.340> storage<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> are

market that includes storage and are

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.460 
market that includes storage and are
therefore<00:01:27.090> much<00:01:27.420> more<00:01:27.630> expensive<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.320> can

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
therefore much more expensive so you can

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
therefore much more expensive so you can
just<00:01:28.619> use<00:01:28.770> existing<00:01:29.130> USB<00:01:29.700> drives<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.270> SD

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
just use existing USB drives and SD

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.090 
just use existing USB drives and SD
cards<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.320> lying<00:01:31.560> around<00:01:31.740> which

is<00:01:32.280> definitely<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:33.329> plus<00:01:33.990> also<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:34.979> experience

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
is definitely a plus also my experience

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.850 
is definitely a plus also my experience
continued<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.150> positive<00:01:36.659> once<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.259> fired<00:01:37.650> up

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
continued to be positive once I fired up

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
particularly on the Android side but the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.430 
particularly on the Android side but the
functionality<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.150> rock-solid<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.140> didn't

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
functionality is rock-solid and I didn't

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
to get it to work so I think this is

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.250 
to get it to work so I think this is
actually<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> first<00:02:48.480> time<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:49.110> I've<00:02:49.230> seen

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
actually the first time that I've seen

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.369 
actually the first time that I've seen
an<00:02:49.709> app<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.190> really<00:02:50.489> feels<00:02:50.790> more<00:02:51.450> mature<00:02:52.109> and

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
an app that really feels more mature and

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.800 
an app that really feels more mature and
more<00:02:52.440> solid<00:02:53.129> on<00:02:53.250> Android<00:02:53.819> than<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.359> does<00:02:54.510> on

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
more solid on Android than it does on

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.170 
more solid on Android than it does on
iOS<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> kudos<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.250> Kingston<00:02:56.670> for<00:02:56.879> spending

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
iOS and a kudos to Kingston for spending

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.119 
iOS and a kudos to Kingston for spending
the<00:02:57.269> time<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.230> dominant<00:02:58.410> plat<00:02:58.859> what<00:02:59.040> is

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
the time on the dominant plat what is

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.160 
the time on the dominant plat what is
now<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.340> dominant<00:02:59.640> platform<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.900> make<00:03:01.049> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
now the dominant platform to make it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.229 
now the dominant platform to make it
actually<00:03:01.290> work<00:03:01.500> correctly<00:03:02.129> so<00:03:02.250> often<00:03:02.849> I<00:03:02.940> see

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239

the<00:03:03.660> iOS<00:03:04.079> app<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.440> awesome<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.069> Android

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
the iOS app is awesome and the Android

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.860 
the iOS app is awesome and the Android
one<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:05.760> kind<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.180> Frankenstein's

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
one is kind of like Frankenstein's

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
one is kind of like Frankenstein's
together<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.620> even<00:03:07.890> seeing<00:03:08.129> both<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.400> them<00:03:08.640> at

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
together and even seeing both of them at

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.390 
together and even seeing both of them at
parity<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.420> not<00:03:10.410> as<00:03:10.590> common<00:03:10.829> as<00:03:10.980> I'd<00:03:11.160> like<00:03:11.370> but

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
parity is not as common as I'd like but

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.130 
parity is not as common as I'd like but
in<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.849> case<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.329> really<00:03:12.569> felt<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> Android

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
in this case I really felt the Android

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.599 
in this case I really felt the Android
one<00:03:13.260> was<00:03:13.440> quite<00:03:13.620> strong<00:03:13.859> even<00:03:14.040> though<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.220> iOS

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
one was quite strong even though the iOS

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.640 
one was quite strong even though the iOS
one<00:03:14.849> did<00:03:15.420> look<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.810> little<00:03:15.930> bit<00:03:16.140> better<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.500> mean

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
one did look a little bit better I mean

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.220 
one did look a little bit better I mean
to<00:03:16.769> be<00:03:16.890> clear<00:03:17.040> guys<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.849> iOS<00:03:18.269> app<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.720> fine

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
to be clear guys the iOS app is fine

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.830 
to be clear guys the iOS app is fine
it's<00:03:19.530> functional<00:03:20.069> but<00:03:20.639> it<00:03:20.970> doesn't<00:03:21.389> have<00:03:21.599> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
it's functional but it doesn't have the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.650 
it's functional but it doesn't have the
same<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:23.010> same<00:03:23.190> number<00:03:23.609> of<00:03:23.639> features<00:03:24.389> and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
same the same number of features and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.080 
same the same number of features and
part<00:03:25.349> of<00:03:25.410> this<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:25.980> iOS<00:03:26.669> has<00:03:26.790> Fault<00:03:27.030> in

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
part of this is is just iOS has Fault in

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.550 
part of this is is just iOS has Fault in
the<00:03:27.150> first<00:03:27.359> place<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:27.959> example<00:03:28.349> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the first place so for example the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.520 
the first place so for example the
ability<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.730> directly<00:03:30.540> copy<00:03:30.780> files<00:03:31.169> back<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
ability to directly copy files back and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.170 
ability to directly copy files back and
forth<00:03:31.799> wherever<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.549> need<00:03:32.730> within<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
forth wherever you need within the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.879 
forth wherever you need within the
directory<00:03:33.630> structure<00:03:33.900> on<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.260> device<00:03:34.590> is

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
directory structure on the device is

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.710 
directory structure on the device is
something<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.760> Android<00:03:36.239> app<00:03:36.389> can<00:03:36.599> do

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
something that the Android app can do

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.900 
something that the Android app can do
but<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.959> iOS<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.470> can't<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.069> something<00:03:38.790> that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
but the iOS one can't and something that

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.580 
but the iOS one can't and something that
I<00:03:38.970> wouldn't<00:03:39.389> mind<00:03:39.540> seeing<00:03:39.780> added<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> iOS

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
I wouldn't mind seeing added to the iOS

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.020 
I wouldn't mind seeing added to the iOS
one<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.980> ability<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.340> use<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.639> third-party

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
one is the ability to use a third-party

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.930 
one is the ability to use a third-party
player<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.859> Android<00:03:44.160> one<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.340> can<00:03:44.669> use

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
player so on the Android one I can use

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.729 
player so on the Android one I can use
just<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.389> included<00:03:45.870> player<00:03:46.079> I<00:03:46.109> can<00:03:46.380> use<00:03:46.470> BS

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
just the included player I can use BS

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.740 
just the included player I can use BS
player<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.220> use<00:03:47.310> whatever<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.669> want<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.329> that

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
player I can use whatever I want so that

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.449 
player I can use whatever I want so that
I<00:03:48.780> get<00:03:49.019> great<00:03:49.260> file<00:03:49.530> compatibility<00:03:49.859> whereas

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
I get great file compatibility whereas

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.729 
I get great file compatibility whereas
on<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.669> iOS<00:03:50.819> one<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.810> basically<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.319> isn't

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
on the iOS one it basically just isn't

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.309 
on the iOS one it basically just isn't
even<00:03:52.799> detecting<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:54.060> media<00:03:54.480> file<00:03:54.810> types<00:03:55.169> that

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
even detecting the media file types that

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.199 
even detecting the media file types that
it's<00:03:55.739> done<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.310> doesn't<00:03:56.579> support<00:03:56.730> so

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
it's done that it doesn't support so

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.430 
it's done that it doesn't support so
that<00:03:57.450> was<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:57.810> was<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.959> bit<00:03:58.079> of<00:03:58.139> an<00:03:58.230> issue<00:03:58.290> for

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
that was that was a bit of an issue for

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.309 
that was that was a bit of an issue for
me<00:03:58.650> with<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.829> iOS<00:03:59.160> one<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.549> did<00:04:00.480> test<00:04:00.810> with<00:04:01.109> up

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
me with the iOS one I did test with up

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.710 
me with the iOS one I did test with up
to<00:04:01.349> three<00:04:02.129> devices<00:04:02.310> streaming<00:04:02.970> 1080p<00:04:03.510> but

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
to three devices streaming 1080p but

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.349 
to three devices streaming 1080p but
these<00:04:03.870> are<00:04:04.579> reasonably<00:04:05.579> low<00:04:05.730> bitrate<00:04:05.970> files

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
these are reasonably low bitrate files

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.449 
these are reasonably low bitrate files
like<00:04:06.629> they're<00:04:06.780> not<00:04:06.930> like<00:04:07.230> crazy<00:04:07.620> uncompressed

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
like they're not like crazy uncompressed

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.220 
like they're not like crazy uncompressed
or<00:04:08.639> anything<00:04:08.910> like<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.510> there<00:04:09.660> were<00:04:09.810> no

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
or anything like that and there were no

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.409 
or anything like that and there were no
issues<00:04:10.410> at<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:11.099> range<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.669> I'd<00:04:11.760> consider<00:04:12.239> to

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
issues at a range that I'd consider to

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.330 
issues at a range that I'd consider to
be<00:04:12.449> reasonable<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.500> anywhere<00:04:13.739> within<00:04:14.010> sort<00:04:14.250> of

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
be reasonable so anywhere within sort of

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.430 
be reasonable so anywhere within sort of
10<00:04:14.549> or<00:04:14.669> 15<00:04:15.030> feet<00:04:15.389> typically<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.289> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
10 or 15 feet typically this is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.900 
10 or 15 feet typically this is
something<00:04:16.709> I'd<00:04:16.799> use<00:04:16.949> for<00:04:16.979> traveling<00:04:17.669> in<00:04:17.789> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
something I'd use for traveling in the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.250 
something I'd use for traveling in the
car<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.329> plane<00:04:18.599> or<00:04:18.720> something<00:04:18.750> like<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.169> so

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
car on a plane or something like that so

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.020 
car on a plane or something like that so
you<00:04:19.349> wouldn't<00:04:19.500> be<00:04:19.650> tremendously<00:04:20.519> far<00:04:20.820> away

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
you wouldn't be tremendously far away

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.120 
you wouldn't be tremendously far away
from<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.359> one<00:04:22.229> cool<00:04:22.409> thing<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:22.979> does

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
from it one cool thing is that it does

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.200 
from it one cool thing is that it does
allow<00:04:23.159> both<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.150> USB<00:04:24.919> port<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.669> SD<00:04:26.940> card

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
allow both the USB port and the SD card

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.890 
allow both the USB port and the SD card
slot<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.570> be<00:04:27.659> used

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
slot to be used

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.050 
slot to be used
at<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.260> same<00:04:28.530> time<00:04:28.889> so<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.580> can<00:04:29.760> pack<00:04:30.030> some

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
at the same time so you can pack some

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.360 
at the same time so you can pack some
serious<00:04:30.720> storage<00:04:31.380> punch<00:04:31.650> if<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:31.889> want<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.250> all

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
serious storage punch if you want to all

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.250 
serious storage punch if you want to all
you<00:04:32.400> do<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.760> use<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.090> app<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.479> select<00:04:33.990> which

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
you do is use the app to select which

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.870 
you do is use the app to select which
one<00:04:34.530> you're<00:04:34.770> interested<00:04:35.190> in<00:04:35.370> browsing<00:04:35.760> and

from<00:05:34.830> me<00:05:35.070> at<00:05:35.250> under<00:05:35.490> 50<00:05:35.880> bucks<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:36.360> think<00:05:36.570> it

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
from me at under 50 bucks and I think it

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.010 
from me at under 50 bucks and I think it
is<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.840> very<00:05:37.260> very<00:05:37.740> smart<00:05:38.520> buy<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.479> guess<00:05:39.900> I

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
is a very very smart buy I guess I

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.330 
is a very very smart buy I guess I
didn't<00:05:40.200> really<00:05:40.349> talk<00:05:40.500> about<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.889> physically

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
didn't really talk about it physically

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.570 
didn't really talk about it physically
much<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:41.880> it's<00:05:42.289> got<00:05:43.289> a<00:05:43.320> USB<00:05:43.740> charging<00:05:44.010> port<00:05:44.370> to

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
much so it's got a USB charging port to

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.339 
much so it's got a USB charging port to
charge<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.940> internal<00:05:45.270> battery<00:05:45.389> a<00:05:45.630> USB<00:05:45.720> port

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
charge the internal battery a USB port

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.909 
charge the internal battery a USB port
for<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:47.060> USB<00:05:48.060> you<00:05:48.419> know<00:05:49.200> drive<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:49.740> then<00:05:49.830> it

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
for the USB you know drive and then it

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.560 
for the USB you know drive and then it
has<00:05:50.039> an<00:05:50.130> SD<00:05:50.280> card<00:05:50.430> slot<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:51.120> guess<00:05:51.270> there's<00:05:51.450> not

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
has an SD card slot I guess there's not

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.730 
has an SD card slot I guess there's not
really<00:05:51.750> a<00:05:51.840> whole<00:05:51.930> lot<00:05:51.960> to<00:05:52.080> say<00:05:52.229> power<00:05:52.440> button

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
really a whole lot to say power button

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.830 
really a whole lot to say power button
so<00:05:52.979> you<00:05:53.070> hold<00:05:53.160> that<00:05:53.340> to<00:05:53.430> turn<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:53.639> on<00:05:53.780> thank<00:05:54.780> you
