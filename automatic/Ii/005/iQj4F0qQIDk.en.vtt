00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you know because they do increase the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
you know because they do increase the
range<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> motion<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.430> controller

that's what they do they just they're

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.249 
that's what they do they just they're
like<00:01:37.770> extensions<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.479> gives<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.110> more

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
like extensions and that gives you more

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.499 
like extensions and that gives you more
accuracy<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.610> example<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:42.150> try

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
accuracy so if you for example just try

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
accuracy so if you for example just try
you<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.259> moving<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.680> controller<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
you know moving your controller on the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.649 
you know moving your controller on the
bottom<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:44.850> thumb<00:01:45.119> stick<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> know

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
bottom of your thumb stick you know

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
bottom of your thumb stick you know
you're<00:01:46.290> not<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.770> able<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.070> play<00:01:47.310> like

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you're not going to be able to play like

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.569 
you're not going to be able to play like
that<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.240> horribly<00:01:48.960> inaccurate<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that it's it's horribly inaccurate so it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.480 
that it's it's horribly inaccurate so it
only<00:01:50.670> makes<00:01:50.790> sense<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:52.079> increase<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.310> range

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
only makes sense to increase the range

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060 
only makes sense to increase the range
of<00:01:53.670> motion<00:01:53.850> which<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.450> by<00:01:54.780> extending<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of motion which is by extending this the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.709 
of motion which is by extending this the
length<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> thumb<00:01:56.790> stick<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.270> whatever

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
length of the thumb stick or whatever

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.749 
length of the thumb stick or whatever
and<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.579> whole

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and you know it's just like a whole

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.440 
and you know it's just like a whole
science<00:02:00.210> behind<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:01.579> yeah<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:02.909> adding<00:02:03.240> more

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
science behind it yeah but adding more

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
science behind it yeah but adding more
of<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> distance<00:02:04.079> from<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> bottom<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of the distance from the bottom of the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.219 
of the distance from the bottom of the
thumbstick<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.880> create<00:02:06.329> more<00:02:06.509> control<00:02:06.990> for

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
thumbstick will create more control for

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.440 
thumbstick will create more control for
you<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.250> uh<00:02:08.280> yeah<00:02:08.879> I've<00:02:08.970> had<00:02:09.119> them<00:02:09.239> for<00:02:09.330> about

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you so uh yeah I've had them for about

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.410 
you so uh yeah I've had them for about
two<00:02:10.020> weeks<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:11.009> first<00:02:11.280> when<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> put<00:02:12.239> them

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
two weeks and at first when I put them

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.460 
two weeks and at first when I put them
on

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
on

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.030 
on
I<00:02:13.560> put<00:02:13.920> them<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.070> both<00:02:14.310> joysticks<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:16.040> you

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
I put them on both joysticks and you

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.590 
I put them on both joysticks and you
know<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.220> figured<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.910> might<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.240> well<00:02:18.360> have

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
know I just figured I might as well have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.300 
know I just figured I might as well have
you<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:19.080> better<00:02:19.290> control<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.770> both<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:19.980> them

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
you know better control on both of them

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.940 
you know better control on both of them
but<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.630> decided<00:02:22.080> after<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.470> little<00:02:22.590> while<00:02:22.710> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
but I decided after a little while to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.880 
but I decided after a little while to
keep<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.820> aiming<00:02:24.150> stick<00:02:24.390> because

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
keep it on just the aiming stick because

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.230 
keep it on just the aiming stick because
i'm<00:02:25.890> using<00:02:25.950> these<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.490> ps3<00:02:26.730> controller

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
i'm using these on the ps3 controller

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.180 
i'm using these on the ps3 controller
and<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> little<00:02:27.990> uncomfortable<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.950> move

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
and it's a little uncomfortable to move

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.280 
and it's a little uncomfortable to move
with<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.600> press<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.990> sprint

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
with and you know press the sprint

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.900 
with and you know press the sprint
button<00:02:31.500> went<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.460> i<00:02:32.790> press<00:02:33.510> down<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.910> left

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
button went on i press down on the left

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.100 
button went on i press down on the left
thumbstick<00:02:36.480> thingy<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.340> i<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:39.600> decided<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
thumbstick thingy so i just decided to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.660 
thumbstick thingy so i just decided to
take<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.410> off<00:02:41.690> now<00:02:42.690> at<00:02:42.930> first<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.590> felt

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
take that off now at first it felt

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.940 
take that off now at first it felt
extremely<00:02:44.670> awkward<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.590> remember

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
extremely awkward I you know I remember

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.920 
extremely awkward I you know I remember
I<00:02:47.190> picked<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.550> up<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.420> wow<00:02:48.720> this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
I picked it up it was like wow this

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.660 
I picked it up it was like wow this
feels<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.290> know<00:02:49.320> nice<00:02:49.680> but<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.310> don't<00:02:50.370> know<00:02:50.550> how

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
feels you know nice but I don't know how

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.150 
feels you know nice but I don't know how
I'm<00:02:50.730> gonna<00:02:50.820> play<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.410> decided<00:02:53.010> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
I'm gonna play like this so I decided I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160 
I'm gonna play like this so I decided I
lived<00:02:53.520> through<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.970> try<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.240> see<00:02:54.959> what<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
lived through and try and see what it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.050 
lived through and try and see what it
would<00:02:55.230> feel<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.530> over<00:02:56.010> time<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.940> know

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
would feel like over time and you know

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.410 
would feel like over time and you know
now<00:02:57.240> i<00:02:57.270> am<00:02:57.570> here<00:02:58.260> still<00:02:59.250> using<00:02:59.610> them<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.000> at

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
now i am here still using them but at

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.990 
now i am here still using them but at
first<00:03:00.630> i<00:03:00.900> really<00:03:01.170> started<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.680> hate<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.310> i

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
first i really started to hate it I i

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.360 
first i really started to hate it I i
was<00:03:03.300> doing<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.930> shitty<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.530> my<00:03:04.620> matches<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.190> just

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
was doing so shitty in my matches I just

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370 
was doing so shitty in my matches I just
hated<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:05.880> much<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.810> was<00:03:06.959> really<00:03:07.080> like

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
hated it so much and I was really like

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.420 
hated it so much and I was really like
thinking<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.740> know<00:03:07.920> maybe<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.190> should<00:03:08.340> take

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
thinking you know maybe I should take

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.890 
thinking you know maybe I should take
him<00:03:08.580> off<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.000> at<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.300> point<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.600> was<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:09.840> used

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
him off but at this point I was so used

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.390 
him off but at this point I was so used
to<00:03:10.200> them<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.470> couldn't<00:03:10.770> because<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.190> even

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
to them I couldn't because it's even

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.900 
to them I couldn't because it's even
worse<00:03:11.690> but<00:03:12.690> um<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.310> know<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:14.520> began<00:03:14.760> to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
worse but um then I you know I began to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.250 
worse but um then I you know I began to
get<00:03:15.000> used<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.630> now<00:03:15.780> I'm<00:03:15.930> playing

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
get used to it and now I'm playing

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.630 
get used to it and now I'm playing
normally<00:03:16.740> again<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.130> know<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> could<00:03:17.459> say<00:03:17.610> that

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
normally again you know I could say that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.250 
normally again you know I could say that
I'm<00:03:17.880> pretty<00:03:18.180> much<00:03:18.209> back<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.510> where<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.780> was<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
I'm pretty much back to where it was and

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.440 
I'm pretty much back to where it was and
since<00:03:19.860> then<00:03:19.950> I've<00:03:20.160> gotten<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.550> MOAB<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.150> don't

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
since then I've gotten a MOAB I don't

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.970 
since then I've gotten a MOAB I don't
know<00:03:21.510> if<00:03:21.630> that's<00:03:21.810> really<00:03:21.930> linked<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:22.800> I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
know if that's really linked to it but I

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.670
