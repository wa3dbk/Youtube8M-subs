never<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:55.130> slow<00:01:56.130> motion<00:01:56.430> because

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
never do it in one slow motion because

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.170 
never do it in one slow motion because
the<00:01:57.690> braids<00:01:57.960> kind<00:01:58.289> of<00:01:58.410> stick<00:01:58.710> together<00:01:59.180> so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the braids kind of stick together so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.510 
the braids kind of stick together so
normally<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:01.619> takes<00:02:01.649> me<00:02:01.979> about<00:02:02.100> two<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.490> three

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
normally it takes me about two to three

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
normally it takes me about two to three
times<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.410> is<00:02:04.470> for<00:02:04.830> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.260 

after<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.210> brace<00:02:15.450> are<00:02:15.630> out<00:02:16.280> again<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:18.030> the
