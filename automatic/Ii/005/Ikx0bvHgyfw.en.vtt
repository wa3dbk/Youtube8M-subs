most locals are they Kevin yes and no
and<00:00:30.810> I'll<00:00:30.929> explain<00:00:31.230> why<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.710> first<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.250> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and I'll explain why but first just to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.410 
and I'll explain why but first just to
give<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> sense<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.969> where<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.300> right

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
give you a sense of where we are right

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.350 
give you a sense of where we are right
now<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.230> region<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.100> time<00:00:35.430> zones<00:00:35.730> away<00:00:35.910> from

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
now the region is a time zones away from

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660 
now the region is a time zones away from
Moscow<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> flight<00:00:37.829> from<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> capital

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
Moscow and the flight from the capital

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
Moscow and the flight from the capital
through<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> city<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.360> Magadan<00:00:39.690> takes<00:00:39.960> nine

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
through the city of Magadan takes nine

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410 
through the city of Magadan takes nine
hours<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.309> remote<00:00:41.850> region<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
hours so this is a very remote region in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.750 
hours so this is a very remote region in
Russia's<00:00:42.780> afar<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.190> surrounded<00:00:44.460> by

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
Russia's afar is they so surrounded by

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.490 
Russia's afar is they so surrounded by
mountains<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.780> only<00:00:45.960> by<00:00:46.230> sea

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
mountains you can get here only by sea

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.490 
mountains you can get here only by sea
or<00:00:46.710> by<00:00:46.950> plane<00:00:47.610> no<00:00:48.000> railroads<00:00:48.629> basically<00:00:49.350> no

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
or by plane no railroads basically no

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.650 
or by plane no railroads basically no
motorways<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> region's<00:00:51.090> economy<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
motorways so the region's economy is

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.600 
motorways so the region's economy is
very<00:00:51.719> much<00:00:52.020> affected<00:00:52.530> by<00:00:52.590> abide<00:00:53.280> by<00:00:53.460> this
