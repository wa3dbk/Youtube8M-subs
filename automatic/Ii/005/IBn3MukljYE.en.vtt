00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.920 

at<00:04:44.480> least<00:04:44.720> I'm<00:04:44.900> not<00:04:45.050> expecting<00:04:45.710> much

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.989 

you

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:52.999 
you

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.509 

so<00:04:53.959> I<00:04:53.989> hope<00:04:54.289> you<00:04:54.529> enjoyed<00:04:54.889> that<00:04:54.919> now<00:04:55.459> the

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:55.519 
so I hope you enjoyed that now the

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.729 
so I hope you enjoyed that now the
second<00:04:56.119> lot<00:04:56.299> didn't<00:04:56.659> actually<00:04:56.839> work<00:04:57.319> I<00:04:57.679> don't

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:57.739 
second lot didn't actually work I don't

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.129 
second lot didn't actually work I don't
think<00:04:58.099> it<00:04:58.549> may<00:04:58.789> have<00:04:58.819> made<00:04:59.179> it<00:04:59.719> a<00:04:59.749> bit<00:05:00.110> more

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
think it may have made it a bit more

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.949 
think it may have made it a bit more
blonder<00:05:00.949> but<00:05:03.099> overall<00:05:04.099> it<00:05:04.369> was<00:05:04.489> a<00:05:04.519> bit<00:05:04.699> enough

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:04.959 
blonder but overall it was a bit enough

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.399 
blonder but overall it was a bit enough
but<00:05:05.959> I<00:05:05.989> tried<00:05:06.379> it<00:05:06.409> so<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:08.539> next<00:05:08.719> step<00:05:08.959> is<00:05:09.169> to

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
but I tried it so the next step is to

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.369 
but I tried it so the next step is to
actually<00:05:09.559> use<00:05:09.769> bleach<00:05:10.189> on<00:05:10.549> the<00:05:10.879> brown<00:05:11.059> and<00:05:11.509> see

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
actually use bleach on the brown and see

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.119 
actually use bleach on the brown and see
what<00:05:12.529> color<00:05:12.739> that<00:05:12.919> comes<00:05:13.189> out<00:05:13.429> I<00:05:14.619> just<00:05:15.619> at<00:05:16.039> the
