00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:38.710 
hopefully will work out fine now so let
me<00:01:27.000> load<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:29.659> these<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:32.630> empty<00:01:34.250> shells<00:01:37.579> and

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
me load it these are empty shells and

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:54.610 
me load it these are empty shells and
one<00:01:39.770> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> chamber<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.720> yeah<00:01:44.570> like<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.630> said

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.060 

yeah<00:01:55.620> some<00:01:56.430> shells<00:01:56.820> are<00:02:00.680> some<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> shells

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
yeah some shells are some of the shells

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
yeah some shells are some of the shells
have<00:02:02.250> issues<00:02:02.670> some<00:02:02.940> don't<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.600> yeah<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> just

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
have issues some don't so yeah it just

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.100 
have issues some don't so yeah it just
depends<00:02:04.470> on<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.620> shells<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:05.010> guess<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:06.120> it's

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
depends on the shells I guess but it's

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.499 
depends on the shells I guess but it's
pretty<00:02:07.320> nice<00:02:07.700> works<00:02:08.700> smoother<00:02:09.270> than<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
pretty nice works smoother than I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.870 
pretty nice works smoother than I
thought

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
thought

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.650 
thought
triggers<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:13.160> disconnect<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> work

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
triggers in there disconnect the work

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.430 
triggers in there disconnect the work
and<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:17.600> safety<00:02:18.600> also<00:02:18.870> works<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.260> very

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and then safety also works is very

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.900 
and then safety also works is very
strong<00:02:19.710> safety<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:22.910> probably

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
strong safety I like it and probably

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.210 
strong safety I like it and probably
make<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> video<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.170> assembly<00:02:25.709> soon<00:02:25.950> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
make a video on this assembly soon so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.000 
make a video on this assembly soon so
stay<00:02:26.700> tuned
