00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.870 
however I decided that would be stupid
pointless<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.019> maybe<00:03:12.620> more<00:03:13.130> expensive<00:03:13.760> than

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
pointless and maybe more expensive than

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.699 
pointless and maybe more expensive than
what<00:03:14.090> would<00:03:14.269> normally<00:03:14.510> be<00:03:14.810> when<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.560> was

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
what would normally be when it was

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.590 
what would normally be when it was
officially<00:03:16.160> released<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.640> europe<00:03:16.940> however
