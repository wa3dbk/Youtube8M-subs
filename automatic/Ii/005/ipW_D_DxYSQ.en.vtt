00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.140
 yes this is apparently I give el to speed in the containers higher so the 65 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.459
 270 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.950
 arch engbers the seven kilo variant 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.160
 and on January 8 this is the 65 percent 80 by the sea 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.080
 give the specifications of this experience 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.570
 but what to do he has the energy to deliver the so much for it 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 write out the seven pounds as 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.260
 8 kilo variant 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.329
 furthermore the song has shine protects on ten victories m stand you have been since last 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.159
 year the this dry is the doornenaars right were also mounted nine there 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.589
 it goes nice and wide open so that you can handle it well, but if you could 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.320
 washing machine on that side then you can just put the door on 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.559
 these can confirm and go the other way open kitchen it was and also dry 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 has left 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.340
 during this machine also the delay is up to the euro 20 hours what 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.070
 implies that you can just say hey I want him to be free in 2 hours 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.050
 small tasty 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.600
 run at night 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.700
 in off-peak hours 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.409
 everyone who is nice and cheap is in the farthest corner wise 9 you 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 wallet 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.460
 furthermore, this now also see child lock that these are the beating five seconds 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.840
 hold down simultaneously 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.549
 but you see that there is a kind of land to come 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.719
 if they turn the knobs then the program will not be too 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.739
 comparing says and doesn't just finish such a point of view nicely 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.700
 the mission has a temporary a coach the ministry in addition to the ordinary of it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.690
 program are made of cotton and synthetic 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.730
 he wanted horse special programs for example the service is very good the 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.450
 pillows 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.680
 For example, if time was the sportswear, then everyone would go for a bit 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.110
 more cautiously than before, those clothes were a bit slower in the beginning 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.820
 is actually just better for the fabric, he also has the 2 program 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.290
 stand as transport are used namely 30 minutes out of 60 minutes 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.090
 a blazing fire the time is up 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.930
 also think there is a bit of tuner for something special 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.250
 programs in this case have the canvases of which I also have more expensive ones 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.110
 jeans 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.840
 I also want to be more careful with this, he now does it for 30 hours 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.510
 minutes over time the cautious tutu 2 hours and 10 minutes in the upper hand 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.939
 air 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.069
 Faster Faster Going Very Step by Step Making is always kitsch 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.540
 yes and that is even better for your clothes third it takes a little longer 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.270
 After having the buzzer sound when the animals are dry then it indicates 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.030
 a decent the hem then you know at least that it is ready 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.029
 we have the anti 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.290
 vinci after normally stays half an hour after he 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.139
 the anti-crawl remains three names and the clothes the answer 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.810
 this is also possible if you take it out and the antique rutte does it a year and a half 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.129
 hour yes pushing my ass almost completely neat out 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.159
 everyone has it but there are also a few warnings and lights 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.040
 for instance 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.550
 he has a water reservoir when it is full yes you do not have to legend 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:30.229
 for the wilders it was a lot to figure out a lot of time had to be spent 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.950
 you just tidy 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.690
 this makes it a kind of vacuum cleaner it has something to experience because that remains 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.010
 do not dry and bowl better 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.930
 youth care where many people come to land. this is the office open to press 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:47.100
 the button there is underneath the condenser lemmens to the outside 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.419
 when I also told him the alps 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.790
 you simply have to take a special shower once a month 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:53.930
 put all the way 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.439
 rinse because it stays 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.519
 dry at least in a good copper top condition 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.139
 if you were the one who would like to load seepage water that three times 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.710
 the empty then we also have a solution for this 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.510
 to include 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.429
 as long as I can you 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:16.239
 the supplier 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.919
 7 several sitting on the back of a seat after and completely ready how do you like 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.919
 never look at customers again 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.370
 as with the mission, also on 10 percent would fall two sensors 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.590
 the machine 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.400
 and what do you do if the program 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.050
 for example the cas dry 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.410
 choose yes already for the one was larger in 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.540
 or for example a shirt he makes sure he has an exact 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.939
 cast anyway 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:49.599
 And so that way you always think correct dosage for its use 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.349
 energy or little boy no problem with that wallet 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.800
 especially text the systems and what it entails makes the structures one of them 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.780
 the drum 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.950
 the son of a student to close your clothes as little as possible and the beauty of one 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.980
 pair against is because that one on both sides 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.980
 later turning to dry we will like that 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.150
 dried wax and not when a bonk comes out 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.639
 The beauty of this device is getting 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.150
 are 6 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.240
 I stand skate the device has been restored 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.509
 8 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.679
 yes you know but you never have a standard seven year guarantee on your own 

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:43.550
 but if you want to sit seven longer, ageeth has the solution there 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.979
 in front of 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.569
 namely an additional three-year warranty 49 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:48.990
 euro 50 or 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.130
 for five years extra guarantee 100 a 25 purely though you never have frieze again 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.580
 succeed costs for driving costs repair costs you name it 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.659
 bumper completely 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.909
 And then of course not forget the accessories advanced about the dream 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.949
 To hit the bowl balls and sabotages the air outlet store for the air dryer 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.939
 the condensation drain hoses allow you to impose the extent to which 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.900
 he then of course says this on the washing machine 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.210
 very handy so I have noticed a piece or without drawers
