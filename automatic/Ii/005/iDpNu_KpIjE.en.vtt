00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.500
 Hello, taking advantage of the fact that today May 10 is 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.840
 mother's day to surprise her 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.790
 we will make an exterior arrangement that we have 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.129
 thought to color the entrance to 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.770
 this house using this flower pot 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.770
 wood of 55 centimeters in diameter 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.369
 the substrate that we will use will have gravel 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.650
 at the base so that it never clogs the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.720
 drainage and a mixture of two parts of 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.020
 ground for flowerpots by a sand of 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.020
 lampa 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.820
 like all the plants are going to be in the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.200
 same place it is important to choose 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.220
 species that have the same 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.930
 Water requirements light and nutrients 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.760
 we start with a perennial shrub with a 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.710
 Very attractive foliage that will form 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.160
 small red fruits that will bring 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.160
 birds 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 then we add a kind of median 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.199
 height a compact veronica that produces 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.539
 spikes of light flowers to combine 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.350
 textures and simple lines add gray 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.350
 burgundy 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.910
 we continue with growth species 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.560
 creeping winter flowering and or 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.560
 white and that we jump bordeaux 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.450
 hello narvaez wrote us our site 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.400
 because it has hortencias with the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.490
 yellow leaves and you want to know that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.440
 can do paula your hortencias have 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.270
 clear if rich faith that is product of the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.400
 lack of iron for it to be 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.470
 available for the plant is important 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.300
 that means on the ground this what 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.410
 you can do by applying asia land or 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.410
 iron sulfate 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.510
 If you are going to do this work with your 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490
 own selection of species consider 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.320
 coordinate the flowering so 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.480
 have flowers throughout the year in the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.220
 pot this program was 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.290
 especially dedicated to all moms 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.150
