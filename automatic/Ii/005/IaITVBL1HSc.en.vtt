this video to tell you about it
Oh<00:00:39.660> too<00:00:40.559> cool<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.510> basically<00:00:42.510> bottled<00:00:42.989> water

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
Oh too cool is basically bottled water

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.430 
Oh too cool is basically bottled water
but<00:00:44.250> through<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> very<00:00:45.030> special<00:00:45.899> process

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
but through a very special process

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
but through a very special process
through<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> series<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> expensive<00:00:48.090> machines

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
through a series of expensive machines

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.430 
through a series of expensive machines
they've<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.700> at<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> at<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.660> molecular

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
they've actually at the at the molecular

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.490 
they've actually at the at the molecular
level<00:00:52.820> put<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.940> eight<00:00:54.180> times<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.989> much<00:00:55.199> oxygen

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
level put in eight times as much oxygen

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.160 
level put in eight times as much oxygen
as<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.489> would<00:00:56.640> normally<00:00:57.090> find<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.780> glass<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
as you would normally find in a glass of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.590 
as you would normally find in a glass of
water<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.940> say<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.449> had<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
water so that's to say if you had a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450 
water so that's to say if you had a
normal<00:01:00.780> glass<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.289> water<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.859> has<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
normal glass of water and it has the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
normal glass of water and it has the
normal<00:01:02.760> amount<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.090> oxygen<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.199> let's<00:01:04.379> call

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
normal amount of oxygen so let's call

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.460 
normal amount of oxygen so let's call
that<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.430> sake<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.670> discussion<00:01:06.229> 100%<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that the sake of discussion 100% of the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.910 
that the sake of discussion 100% of the
oxygen<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> normal<00:01:08.549> water<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.630> has<00:01:10.470> 800

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
oxygen and the normal water this has 800

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.719 
oxygen and the normal water this has 800
times<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.840> amount<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.400> what's<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
times in that amount so like what's the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.039 
times in that amount so like what's the
benefit<00:01:15.090> who<00:01:15.210> cares<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.689> they<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.960> like

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
benefit who cares that they just like

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
benefit who cares that they just like
put<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> bubble<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.060> blow

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
put a bubble and on to then and blow

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
put a bubble and on to then and blow
bubbles<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.930> I'm<00:01:19.140> Airi<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> water

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
bubbles with what I'm Airi to the water

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.910 
bubbles with what I'm Airi to the water
no<00:01:20.430> that's<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> case

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
no that's not the case

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.090 
no that's not the case
just<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.070> carbonation<00:01:24.060> physically<00:01:25.100> bonds

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
just like carbonation physically bonds

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.640 
just like carbonation physically bonds
itself<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.119> beverage<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> wears<00:01:28.439> off

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
itself with a beverage and wears off

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.890 
itself with a beverage and wears off
over<00:01:28.920> time<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.790> has<00:01:29.939> been<00:01:30.119> bonded<00:01:30.720> with

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
over time this has been bonded with

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.039 
over time this has been bonded with
oxygen<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> box<00:01:33.840> here

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.330 
the glass bottle retains the oxygen it's
it's<00:02:00.840> made<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.440> spring<00:02:01.740> water<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.220> that's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it's made with spring water so that's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.850 
it's made with spring water so that's
the<00:02:02.580> source<00:02:02.850> water<00:02:03.150> before<00:02:03.630> they

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the source water before they

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.070 
the source water before they
scientifically<00:02:04.860> engineered<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.930> it's<00:02:06.930> good

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
scientifically engineered here it's good

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.250 
scientifically engineered here it's good
source<00:02:07.320> magnesium<00:02:08.010> has<00:02:08.130> eight<00:02:08.490> point<00:02:08.790> four<00:02:09.260> pH

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
source magnesium has eight point four pH

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.580 
source magnesium has eight point four pH
level<00:02:10.680> so<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.010> a<00:02:11.070> little<00:02:11.190> bit<00:02:11.370> alkaline<00:02:12.590> they

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
level so it's a little bit alkaline they

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.370 
level so it's a little bit alkaline they
say<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.010> makes<00:02:14.430> your<00:02:14.580> breath<00:02:14.970> fresh<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.870> really

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
say it makes your breath fresh I really

say it makes your breath fresh I really
know<00:02:16.500> how<00:02:16.620> that's<00:02:16.800> possible<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:18.330> there's<00:02:18.510> no

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
know how that's possible and there's no

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.690 
know how that's possible and there's no
sodium<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.350> then<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.770> says<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.400> unique

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
sodium and then it says it's so unique

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.040 
sodium and then it says it's so unique
that<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.000> patented<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.630> actually<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.020> a
