00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.660 
alternative way of bringing up that
screen<00:02:03.970> would<00:02:04.570> have<00:02:04.810> been<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.620> come<00:02:05.860> down<00:02:06.100> and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
screen would have been to come down and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.850 
screen would have been to come down and
we<00:02:06.760> could<00:02:06.940> have<00:02:07.060> hit<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.300> FN<00:02:07.690> button<00:02:07.930> here<00:02:08.350> and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
we could have hit the FN button here and

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.200 
we could have hit the FN button here and
then<00:02:09.009> we<00:02:09.160> could<00:02:09.310> pick<00:02:09.460> that<00:02:09.640> one<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.030> book

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
then we could pick that one in a book

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.900 
then we could pick that one in a book
more<00:02:10.390> symbol<00:02:10.840> symbols<00:02:11.260> similar<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:12.070> roughly

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
more symbol symbols similar to roughly

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.870 
more symbol symbols similar to roughly
like<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.270> symbol<00:02:13.630> here<00:02:13.750> okay<00:02:14.140> now<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.160> in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
like this symbol here okay now and in

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.550 
like this symbol here okay now and in
this<00:02:16.030> case<00:02:16.240> here<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.570> on<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.810> f1<00:02:17.140> button<00:02:17.350> but

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
this case here it's on the f1 button but

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.260 
this case here it's on the f1 button but
could<00:02:17.770> be<00:02:17.890> on<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> different<00:02:18.340> book<00:02:19.120> and

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
could be on a different book and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.960 
could be on a different book and
depending<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.750> your<00:02:19.959> laptop<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.790> if<00:02:21.880> they

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
depending on your laptop now if they

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.730 
depending on your laptop now if they
overcome<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.570> problem<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.320> don't<00:02:23.470> have

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
overcome the problem that you don't have

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.830 
overcome the problem that you don't have
sound<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:24.760> try<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.940> overcome<00:02:25.270> this<00:02:25.600> by

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
sound you can try to overcome this by

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.760 
sound you can try to overcome this by
using<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.620> 3.5<00:02:27.310> millimeter<00:02:28.030> audio<00:02:28.570> jack<00:02:29.050> what

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
using a 3.5 millimeter audio jack what

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.699 
using a 3.5 millimeter audio jack what
we<00:02:29.890> have<00:02:30.070> here<00:02:30.310> an<00:02:30.640> RCA<00:02:31.060> cable<00:02:31.570> what<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
we have here an RCA cable what we do is

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.590 
we have here an RCA cable what we do is
with<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.400> one<00:02:33.580> here<00:02:33.820> we'll<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.120> connecting

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
with this one here we'll be connecting

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.960 
with this one here we'll be connecting
it<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.870> on<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> side<00:02:35.380> thing<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.370> we'd<00:02:36.700> assembled

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
it in on a side thing and we'd assembled

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.750 
it in on a side thing and we'd assembled
it's<00:02:37.270> marked<00:02:37.630> as<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.900> headphones<00:02:38.680> here<00:02:39.010> I've

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
it's marked as a headphones here I've

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.640 
it's marked as a headphones here I've
run<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.060> cable<00:02:40.480> around<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.080> connected<00:02:41.500> in

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
run this cable around and connected in

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.510 
run this cable around and connected in
and<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:43.209> border<00:02:43.690> em<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.340> would

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
and that border em and that would

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.940 
and that border em and that would
overcome<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.150> problem<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.830> know

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
overcome that problem and you know

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.500 
overcome that problem and you know
certainly<00:02:48.340> set<00:02:48.610> upon<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> plan<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.330> how<00:02:49.450> this

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
certainly set upon a plan of how this

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.810 
certainly set upon a plan of how this
work<00:02:49.810> motor<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.160> problem<00:02:51.520> there<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.700> that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
work motor and the problem there is that

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.300 
work motor and the problem there is that
your<00:02:52.090> cable<00:02:52.690> thing<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:53.260> other<00:02:53.739> videos<00:02:54.130> and

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
your cable thing have other videos and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.370 
your cable thing have other videos and
recombinant<00:02:54.790> things<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:55.930> noticing

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
recombinant things and we just noticing

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.350 
recombinant things and we just noticing
this<00:02:56.470> could<00:02:56.709> ruin<00:02:56.830> our<00:02:56.980> top<00:02:57.220> choose<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.760> HDMI

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
this could ruin our top choose the HDMI

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.420 
this could ruin our top choose the HDMI
output<00:02:58.780> on<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.140> laptop<00:02:59.380> if<00:02:59.920> there<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.250> an

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
output on this laptop if there is an

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.850 
output on this laptop if there is an
HDMI<00:03:00.610> output<00:03:01.330> it's<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.350> great<00:03:02.560> solution

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
HDMI output it's a great solution

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.220 
HDMI output it's a great solution
because<00:03:03.160> when<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.519> single<00:03:03.760> HDMI<00:03:04.299> cable<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.200> can

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
because when a single HDMI cable you can

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470 
because when a single HDMI cable you can
just<00:03:05.530> run<00:03:05.799> correctly<00:03:06.549> over<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:07.030> carry<00:03:07.269> both

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
just run correctly over to carry both

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.360 
just run correctly over to carry both
the<00:03:07.630> audio<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> video<00:03:08.380> in<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:09.040> single

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
the audio and the video in a single

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.740 
the audio and the video in a single
cable<00:03:09.580> enough<00:03:09.940> tops<00:03:10.150> would<00:03:10.299> be<00:03:10.390> an<00:03:10.480> ideal

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
cable enough tops would be an ideal

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.360 
cable enough tops would be an ideal
solution<00:03:10.959> but<00:03:11.650> they<00:03:11.739> were<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.950> main<00:03:12.100> props

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
solution but they were the main props

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.060 
solution but they were the main props
this<00:03:12.549> video<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.910> just<00:03:13.120> give<00:03:13.330> an<00:03:13.660> overview<00:03:14.320> I've

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
this video is just give an overview I've

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.630 
this video is just give an overview I've
used<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.489> VGA<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.690> VGA<00:03:17.680> cable<00:03:18.130> as<00:03:18.310> such<00:03:18.519> as

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
used a VGA and VGA cable as such as

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.900 
used a VGA and VGA cable as such as
we've<00:03:18.790> used<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.330> demonstration
