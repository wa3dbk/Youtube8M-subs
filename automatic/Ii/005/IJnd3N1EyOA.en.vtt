00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello guys we are staying and I 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.089
 to show you a video that looks like 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 is getting fashionable and of course they are left 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.730
 very bad feeling called charly charly 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 that there has been talk about him is 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.080
 in having a role not saying the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.690
 answers but repeated twice and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.990
 over two crossed pencils 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.230
 which you by this is like a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.570
 kind of door with which you're going to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.800
 talk to charly and you ask him 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.650
 things and the 3 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.780
 the truth is that it gives very bad roll as 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.270
 you can see and I'm talking loud 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
 bernal that I love but when 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.130
 questions saying charly charly to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.320
 beginning 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.270
 respond they have to be physical not 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.410
 obviously and the truth is that what 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.910
 we want to try and we are a little 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.300
 scared because we tried it before 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.520
 and record and we give more roll and more in this 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 home that things have really happened 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.750
 Fucked and weird as you could 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.150
 see in paranormal encounters or in 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.160
 blogs I have done themselves 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.040

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.040

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:38.399
 charly charly we have to ask your forgiveness 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.729

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.880
 pencils and burn the paper to not 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.860

 these were new 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.620
