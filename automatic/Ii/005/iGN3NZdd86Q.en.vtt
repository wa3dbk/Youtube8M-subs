we<00:03:59.239> also<00:03:59.480> suggest<00:03:59.810> using<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.500> rope<00:04:00.709> like<00:04:01.160> the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
we also suggest using a rope like the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.589 
we also suggest using a rope like the
beaded<00:04:01.670> rope<00:04:01.849> something<00:04:02.269> that's<00:04:02.450> gonna

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
beaded rope something that's gonna

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.500 
beaded rope something that's gonna
provide<00:04:02.989> some<00:04:03.260> output<00:04:03.829> some<00:04:04.760> feedback<00:04:05.209> it's

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
provide some output some feedback it's

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.110 
provide some output some feedback it's
also<00:04:05.660> gonna<00:04:05.900> move<00:04:06.170> with<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.829> air

gonna move with you so I don't suggest
using<00:04:15.410> your<00:04:15.680> speed<00:04:15.919> rope<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:16.789> type<00:04:17.180> of

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
using your speed rope for this type of

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.399 
using your speed rope for this type of
footwork<00:04:18.380> drill<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.539> suggestion<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.260> two

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
footwork drill so the suggestion is two

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:22.750 
footwork drill so the suggestion is two
to<00:04:21.530> three<00:04:21.680> times<00:04:21.829> a<00:04:22.039> week<00:04:22.070> for<00:04:22.400> three<00:04:22.610> minutes

to three times a week for three minutes
what<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.659> the<00:04:23.900> interval<00:04:24.200> set<00:04:24.380> will<00:04:24.560> look<00:04:24.590> like

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
what the the interval set will look like

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.439 
what the the interval set will look like
it's<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.159> 4<00:04:25.370> by<00:04:25.490> 20

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
it's a 4 by 20

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.240 
it's a 4 by 20
you're<00:04:26.930> gonna<00:04:27.050> do<00:04:27.259> four<00:04:27.650> different<00:04:27.770> movements

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
you're gonna do four different movements

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.439 
you're gonna do four different movements
you're<00:04:28.340> gonna<00:04:28.430> start<00:04:28.729> with<00:04:28.819> a<00:04:28.849> side<00:04:29.090> straddle

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
you're gonna start with a side straddle
