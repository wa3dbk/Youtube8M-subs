00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.430 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:03.210> we're<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.659> talk<00:00:03.810> about<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.380> to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
segment we're going to talk about how to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.330 
segment we're going to talk about how to
control<00:00:05.089> Japanese<00:00:06.089> beetle<00:00:06.690> grubs<00:00:07.280> now<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
control Japanese beetle grubs now the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.250 
control Japanese beetle grubs now the
Japanese<00:00:08.610> beetle<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.540> originally<00:00:09.960> from<00:00:09.990> Japan

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
Japanese beetle is originally from Japan

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.959 
Japanese beetle is originally from Japan
but<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:10.769> found<00:00:10.889> all<00:00:11.190> over<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.490> world<00:00:11.670> now

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
but it's found all over the world now

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.690 
but it's found all over the world now
and<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.840> does<00:00:13.110> lots<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.679> damage<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.190> plants<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and it does lots of damage to plants it

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.269 
and it does lots of damage to plants it
just<00:00:14.849> eats<00:00:15.120> away<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.630> leaves<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.500> there's

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
just eats away the leaves and there's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.160 
just eats away the leaves and there's
only<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.090> few<00:00:18.359> ways<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.840> can<00:00:19.020> actually

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
only a few ways that you can actually

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.740 
only a few ways that you can actually
control<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.859> population<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:21.090> much<00:00:21.300> easier

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
control the population it's much easier

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.470 
control the population it's much easier
to<00:00:21.810> control<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.500> particular<00:00:23.250> plants<00:00:23.939> then

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
to control the particular plants then

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.769 
to control the particular plants then
try<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.830> control<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.130> whole<00:00:26.369> area<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
try to control a whole area but if you

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.480 
try to control a whole area but if you
fight<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.529> bit<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.890> time<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.460> can

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
fight it a little bit at a time you can

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.269 
fight it a little bit at a time you can
make<00:00:29.880> headway<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.539> control<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.500> grub<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
make headway and control the grub and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639 
make headway and control the grub and
the<00:00:32.969> beetle<00:00:33.300> because<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.840> grub<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.230> actually

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the beetle because the grub is actually

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.750 
the beetle because the grub is actually
a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.399> C<00:00:36.149> shaped<00:00:36.450> worm<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:37.500> looks<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
a little C shaped worm that looks and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.700 
a little C shaped worm that looks and
grows<00:00:39.059> under<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.629> ground<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.320> it'll<00:00:40.500> eat

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
grows under the ground and it'll eat

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.209 
grows under the ground and it'll eat
away<00:00:40.739> lawns<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> crane<00:00:42.750> fly

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
away lawns just like the crane fly

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
away lawns just like the crane fly
larvae<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.270> sometimes<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.050> confuse

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
larvae will so sometimes you can confuse

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
larvae will so sometimes you can confuse
the<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> other<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.539> lots

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the one for the other but they do lots

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.319 
the one for the other but they do lots
of<00:00:49.110> damage<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.210> when

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of damage and so if you get them when

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.180 
of damage and so if you get them when
they<00:00:51.420> first<00:00:51.629> start<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> times<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.010> can

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they first start a lot of times you can

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.330 
they first start a lot of times you can
do<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:54.210> rid<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.600> naturally<00:00:55.350> but

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
do a get rid of them naturally but

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.599 
do a get rid of them naturally but
sometimes<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.059> control<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> whole<00:00:57.780> area

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
sometimes if they control a whole area

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.220 
sometimes if they control a whole area
sometimes<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.899> some

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
sometimes you have to go and get some

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.229 
sometimes you have to go and get some
kinds<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> pyrethrins<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> chemical

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
kinds of pyrethrins which are a chemical

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
kinds of pyrethrins which are a chemical
that<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.570> kill<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.320> bugs<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> area

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that will kill all the bugs in the area

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.969 
that will kill all the bugs in the area
which<00:01:05.549> would<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.360> last<00:01:06.630> resort<00:01:07.140> but

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
which would be a very last resort but

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.800 
which would be a very last resort but
we're<00:01:08.460> having<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.330> some<00:01:09.510> areas

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
we're having to do that in some areas

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
we're having to do that in some areas
where<00:01:09.930> they're<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.260> taking<00:01:10.500> over<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.430> it's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
where they're just taking over and it's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.330 
where they're just taking over and it's
unfortunate<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.590> pyrethrum<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.770> really

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
unfortunate because pyrethrum is really

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.760 
unfortunate because pyrethrum is really
a<00:01:14.549> toxic<00:01:15.390> chemical<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.380> found<00:01:16.619> in

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
a toxic chemical it's just found in

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
a toxic chemical it's just found in
chrysanthemums<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:18.119> they're<00:01:18.270> finding<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
chrysanthemums but they're finding that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.160 
chrysanthemums but they're finding that
women<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.220> wash<00:01:20.460> their<00:01:20.759> animals<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.810> flea

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
women that wash their animals in a flea

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
women that wash their animals in a flea
bath<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.799> has<00:01:23.009> pyrethrum<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.729> them<00:01:23.850> when

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
bath that has pyrethrum in them when

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120 
bath that has pyrethrum in them when
they're<00:01:24.390> pregnant<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.740> twice<00:01:26.100> as

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
they're pregnant there is twice as

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850 
they're pregnant there is twice as
likely<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.909> chance<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.840> children<00:01:28.740> with

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
likely of a chance to have children with

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.700 
likely of a chance to have children with
autism<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.299> chemical<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.500> don't

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
autism so it's a chemical I really don't

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.100 
autism so it's a chemical I really don't
like<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.930> have

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
like to use it all but if you do have

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.020 
like to use it all but if you do have
Japanese<00:01:34.530> beetle<00:01:34.890> grubs<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> protect

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
Japanese beetle grubs you can protect

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.969 
Japanese beetle grubs you can protect
your<00:01:36.180> plants<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> lot<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.960> ways<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.409> by

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
your plants in a lot of ways just by

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.370 
your plants in a lot of ways just by
hosing<00:01:38.490> them<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.820> off<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> hose<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.290> if

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
hosing them up off with a hose so if

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.600 
hosing them up off with a hose so if
there's<00:01:40.560> any<00:01:40.710> grub<00:01:40.950> sin<00:01:41.159> time<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> times

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
there's any grub sin time a lot of times

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.550 
there's any grub sin time a lot of times
you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.880> wash<00:01:42.150> them<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.259> from<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you can wash them out so from the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
you can wash them out so from the
underside<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> leaves<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.210> wash

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
underside of the leaves to just wash

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
finding that is not so dangerous it's

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.310 
finding that is not so dangerous it's
still<00:02:00.030> annoying<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.540> don't<00:02:00.659> want<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> use<00:02:00.990> for

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
still annoying you don't want to use for

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.289 
still annoying you don't want to use for
children<00:02:01.680> under<00:02:02.009> two<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:02.640> makes<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:03.119> wonder

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
children under two which makes me wonder

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.240 
children under two which makes me wonder
it<00:02:03.990> can't<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:06.079> naturally<00:02:07.079> okay<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> use

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it can't be that naturally okay to use

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.589 
it can't be that naturally okay to use
if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.759> still<00:02:09.030> don't<00:02:09.090> want<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.539> on

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
if you still don't want to use it on

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.720 
if you still don't want to use it on
young<00:02:09.869> young<00:02:10.080> children<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:11.009> still<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
young young children but still it's a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.640 
young young children but still it's a
little<00:02:11.819> bit<00:02:12.060> safer<00:02:12.360> than<00:02:12.480> pyrethrum

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
little bit safer than pyrethrum

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.800 
little bit safer than pyrethrum
by<00:02:13.920> spraying<00:02:14.280> neem<00:02:14.580> oil<00:02:14.819> on<00:02:15.269> any<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.629> bugs

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
by spraying neem oil on any of the bugs

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.110 
by spraying neem oil on any of the bugs
that<00:02:16.080> works<00:02:16.290> really<00:02:16.530> well<00:02:16.650> -<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.700> my<00:02:17.849> theory

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
that works really well - but my theory

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.449 
that works really well - but my theory
is<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.540> neem<00:02:18.750> oil<00:02:18.959> works<00:02:19.379> so<00:02:19.680> does<00:02:19.830> eucalyptus

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
is if neem oil works so does eucalyptus

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.220 
is if neem oil works so does eucalyptus

any<00:02:25.590> type<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.860> oils<00:02:26.400> work<00:02:26.730> really<00:02:27.060> well<00:02:27.360> with

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
any type of oils work really well with

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.440 
any type of oils work really well with
most<00:02:27.930> bugs<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.580> tried<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.819> spray<00:02:30.209> down

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
most bugs so I just tried to spray down

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.080 
most bugs so I just tried to spray down
the<00:02:30.750> trees<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:32.400> any<00:02:32.579> Japanese

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the trees and if you see any Japanese

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.490 
the trees and if you see any Japanese
beetles<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.599> spray<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:33.989> some<00:02:34.290> oil

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
beetles just spray them with some oil

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.380 
beetles just spray them with some oil
and<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.920> lot<00:02:35.099> of<00:02:35.220> times<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:36.150> doesn't

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
and that a lot of times it doesn't

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.910 
and that a lot of times it doesn't
always<00:02:36.690> kill<00:02:37.079> them<00:02:37.290> though<00:02:37.530> because<00:02:37.739> some<00:02:37.890> of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
always kill them though because some of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.789 
always kill them though because some of
them<00:02:38.069> can<00:02:38.250> be<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.640> big<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:40.110> there's

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
them can be really big and so there's

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.220 
them can be really big and so there's
really<00:02:41.069> none<00:02:41.340> lot<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.849> can<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.299> but<00:02:42.959> make

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
really none lot that you can do but make

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.050 
really none lot that you can do but make
sure<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:44.099> you<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.579> problems<00:02:44.790> with
