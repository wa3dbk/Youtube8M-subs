00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.220
MAN: Snuffy, I want you to meet
my brother, Minneapolis.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.130
He's an archaeologist.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.790
BIG BIRD: Snuffy is
my best friend.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.190
ARCHEOLOGIST: You're
Snuffleupagus.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.240
SNUFFY: Yes, I know.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.250
ARCHEOLOGIST: I can't believe
I'm actually meeting a real,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.380
live Snuffleupagus.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.510
SNUFFY: Well I can't believe
that I'm actually meeting a

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.820
real, live archaeologist.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.506
ARCHEOLOGIST: This makes my
quest even more important.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:29.970
MAN: What quest?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.650
SNUFFY: What's a quest?

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.154
ARCHEOLOGIST: My quest for the
golden cabbage of Snuffertiti.

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:39.850
BOTH: The golden cabbage
of Snuffertiti?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.060
BIG BIRD: What's that?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.010
ARCHEOLOGIST: I'll tell
you about it.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.490
I'll tell you about it.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.568
Many, many, many years ago,
long before any of us were

00:00:52.568 --> 00:00:57.010
born, there was a great queen
named Snuffertiti who was

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.260
queen or all the
Snuffleupagus's.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.120
The Snuffleupagus's had asked
their queen to choose an

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.380
official favorite food
for them all.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.720
And because she was a good
queen, she wanted

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.926
them all to be happy.

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:14.620
SNUFFERTITI: Oh dear.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.810
How will I ever find the
perfect favorite food?

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.190
It must be round, and
green, and leafy.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.859
But what kind of food is that?

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.480
My food persons are
searching the

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.480
countryside for such a food.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.010
Here comes one of them now.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.450
Keep on fanning, fan person.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.080
MAN: Your majesty,
your majesty.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.470
I have found the perfect
favorite food.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.180
It is called at apple.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.130
In is round and it is green.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.970
SNUFFERTITI: Yes.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.720
It is round, it is green.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720
But it's not leafy.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.020
There's not a single
leaf on it.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.380
I'm sorry, it just won't do.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.840
Ah, me.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.370
MAN: Excuse me, your majesty.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.130
SNUFFERTITI: I thought
I told you to keep on

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.060
fanning, fan person.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.240
MAN: Yes, yes your majesty.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.187
But I think I may have found the
food you're looking for.

00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:42.141
SNUFFERTITI: You?

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.810
What could you possibly
know about food?

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.520
You are a fan person.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.070
I have food persons to
tell me about food.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.300
And here comes another
one of them now.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.020
Keep on fanning, fan person.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.400
MAN: Your majesty.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.860
I have found the new
Snuffleupagus's favorite food.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.650
It is called a tree.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.670
And it is both green
and leafy.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.930
SNUFFERTITI: Yes, I can see that
it is green and leafy.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.690
But it isn't round.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.210
Besides, we can't eat trees.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.636
The branches get stuck
it our teeth.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.860
Oh dear.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.820
I will never find the perfect
favorite food.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.250
What's this?

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.780
MAN: It's a cabbage,
your majesty.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.020
It tastes good.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.270
Try it.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.730
SNUFFERTITI: Bring it closer.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.250
Well, it is round, and
green, and leafy.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.860
Bring it closer still.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.959
I will taste it.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.940
It's round, and green,
and leafy.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.240
And tasty as well.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.410
That's it.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.231
That is the perfect
favorite food.

00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:48.213
Oh, thank you, fan person.

00:04:48.213 --> 00:04:50.698
MAN: You're welcome,
your majesty.

00:04:50.698 --> 00:04:53.038
SNUFFERTITI: I have
been such a fool.

00:04:53.038 --> 00:05:00.200
From now on, I shall listen to
whatever anyone has to say, no

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.748
matter what kind of
person they are.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.530
ARCHEOLOGIST: And from that time
on, Snuggleupagus's ate

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.630
all the cabbages they could
get their snuffles on.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.820
In fact, cabbages became so
popular that the queen had a

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.300
golden cabbage made in honor
of the Snuffleupagus's

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.360
favorite food.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.320
And according to legend, that
golden cabbage is hidden in a

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.740
cave somewhere around here.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.910
BIG BIRD: Gee, Snuffy, I thought
your home was the only

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.471
save around here.

00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:41.721
SNUFFY: It is.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.716
MAN: That means.

00:05:45.716 --> 00:05:49.745
the lost cabbage might be
hidden in Snuffy's cave.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.840
ARCHEOLOGIST: What are
we waiting for?

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.690
Follow me.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.630
The golden cabbage awaits.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.290
SNUFFY: What's wrong
with him, Bird?

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.740
BIG BIRD: Oh, nothing Snuffy.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.580
He was an active child,
that's all.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.830
SNUFFY: Oh.
