00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.100
 ah 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.650
 very good girls good guys and what 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.100
 such are you I hope you are all very 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.610
 all right 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.110
 today I tell you the spectacular news 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.360
 was related to a birth not 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.590
 with a baby no animal but durÃ¡n 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.839
 star jaycee of a birth 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 spectacular and violent at the same time 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.789
 the image that you see on the screen has 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.220
 been captured by the space telescope 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.320
 hubble and good has been disclosed by 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.390
 sides to this week and shows how it's born 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.910
 a new star that shines within 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:43.170
 a cloud of golden gas and dust you will go 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.899
 14,568 6304 which is located about 22 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.109
 thousand 500 light years from the distance of the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.480
 land can be seen in the complex 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.760
 Molecular molecular clouds of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.340
 circinus which is one of the most 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.309
 important star formation is 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.800
 where is like the factory the juve of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.989
 stars is a view then 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.930
 particularly spectacular because 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.740
 has a soon stellar jet that is 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.900
 this 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.260
 good sure what they say is a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.380
 shape 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.690
 of tail under the star that is composed 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 leftover gas and dust cloud 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.820
 mother who did and who gave rise to the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.090
 star as if it were a cord 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.220
 umbilical more or less the star the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.930
 Stars are born when a gas cloud 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.170
 because it collapses under his property 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.830
 gravitational pull to form a 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.810
 hot core but sometimes not all the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.400
 material ends inside the star 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.100
 but as seen in the image that 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.100
 you have on screen in the remains can 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.800
 become someday a planet or 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.470
 an asteroid in the worst case the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:55.110
 image of free 14,568 6304 is similar 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.290
 to that of an image captured last year 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.090
 by the soul telescope in chile in the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.160
 that show illuminated jets that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.560
 they throw out the newly star 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.780
 born so good guys I hope that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.640
 I have interested you this news 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.010
 it is impressive and spectacular what 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.620
 we can get to see currently outside 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.360
 of our planet in the galaxy the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.459
 Birth of a star is fascinating 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 and be able to do something that we can understand 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.600
 little bit more about what it is about what it is and what 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.950
 wonderful that can be this way 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.910
 how good after all this 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.610
 super positivism see you in another 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.750
 this channel video more than you know 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.090
 comment on me in the comments 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.959
 worth the redundancy and nothing a month of 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.959
 all chao
