00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 determines the number of solutions for 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.710
 each of these equations and here 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.269
 we have three equations but before 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.519
 that we analyze each one of these 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.400
 equations remember when you can 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.039
 have an infinite solution solutions 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.470
 or there is no solution an equation is going to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.990
 have a solution if you can solve 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 for the variable let's say x and get something 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.300
 well as x is equal to something I do not know I'm going to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.439
 put it in abstract x equal to a or could 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.440
 be x equal to 5 x equal to minus 25 x 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.230
 equal to 10 x equal to pi any value 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.120
 when you get that x is a value 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.829
 specific then the system has a 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.989
 solution if you manipulate these 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.450
 equations by procedures that are 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.910
 valid of course and in the end you get 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.660
 some crazy weird thing like 3 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.170
 equal to 5 then the system does not have 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.120
 solution without solution solving a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.070
 equation is to find an x that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.439
 satisfies the equation and if someone 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.390
 simplifying the equation you get to a 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.580
 result as 3 equal to yes 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.860
 you wonder what is the value of x that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.409
 magically makes 3 equals 5 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.170
 because there is no value of x that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.119
 make 3 magically equal 5 not 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.369
 there is a way for this to be true without 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.020
 import the value of x that you choose if 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.720
 you get a strange result like this 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.770
 means that there is no solution for another 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 side if you get a result like 5 equal 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.720
 to 5 here it is coincidence that we are 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.159
 using the 5 x equal to 5 3 equal to 5 5 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.780
 equal to 5 but it does not have to be 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.340
 forcibly the 5 leaves for another 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.619
 number so you do not think you have to 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.970
 be 5 put 13 equal to 13 when 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.800
 you come to a result where something is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.390
 exactly equal to itself without 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.160
 import the value of x that you get is 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.800
 say replacing the equation any 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.080
 value of x you will get this result 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.270
 then in this case you are going to get 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.070
 endless solutions after this 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.729
 brief summary let's analyze these 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.090
 equations let's see the first equation 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.670
 subtracting 2 on both sides of the equation 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.009
 to eliminate this 2 let's do that 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.110
 we are 2 on the left side and we subtract 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.230
 2 on the right side and that we find 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.519
 minus 7 x + 2 - 12 canceled 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.819
 2 - 7x on the right side we have 2 x 2 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.430
 and minus 2 are canceled minus 9 x now 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.569
 doing this subtraction of the right side we 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.730
 it is that minus 7 x equals minus 7x 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.280
 and you are already realizing where we are going to 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.959
 get there regardless of the value of x 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.489
 minus 7 x equals minus 7x so it's 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.319
 we are in this case although you well 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.690
 could you say hey salt I do not see anything 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.909
 like 13 equal to 13 for that we could 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.910
 do something like divide between less 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.860
 7 on both sides of the equation we divide 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.810
 minus 7 left side minus 7 what 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.670
 done although this is unnecessary because 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.470
 you know that minus 7 for a number is 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.030
 exactly equal to minus 7 for that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.549
 same number but good when doing the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.859
 division is left x equal to x and y 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.940
 now we can subtract x both sides to 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.459
 then get 0 equal to 0 and that's 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.440
 true for any value of x that you 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.510
 choose always will be equal to 0 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.519
 and all these steps are valid for 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.079
 any value of x that we choose like this is 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.450
 that this particular equation has 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.569
 an infinity of solutions a number 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.749
 infinite 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.629
 of solutions let's look at this equation now 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:28.030
 I'm going to make it different from the middle 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.599
 I'm going to add the x from the right side I'm going to 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.579
 add 2 x with less 9 x than we have left 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.060
 on the left we have not done anything 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:43.060
 we have less 7 x + 3 that is equal to 2 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:48.639
 x minus 9 x equals minus 7 x minus 7 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.270
 x plus 2 now let's add let me do it 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:54.300
 better in the green color 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.010
 and we have it plus two in green we add 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.920
 now 7x on both sides of the equation 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.870
 on the left minus 7 x 7 x 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.270
 cancels we are only 3 and the side 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.120
 right also minus 7 x with 7 x se 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.120
 cancel and we are simply 2 is 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.000
 added 7 x from the left side and it's 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.060
 added 7 x on the right side but that 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.150
 we got 3 equal but 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.549
 this result is impossible no matter 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.800
 the value of x that we choose is that 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.850
 we are in the case of the equation that does not 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.740
 has a solution so this is a 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.780
 equation without solution there is no x in 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.420
 the universe that meets this equation 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.960
 now let's see the third equation 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.390
 let's start by subtracting 3 from both sides 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.700
 I want to eliminate this 3 so the 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.430
 left side cancel 3 and minus 3 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.760
 we have less 7 x and this is equal to 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.560
 plus 2 and minus 3 or less 1 we have 2x 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.180
 minus 1 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:01.260
 now we can subtract 2 x both sides 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.389
 we subtract 2x on both sides to get 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.400
 then on the left side we have left 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.930
 minus 9 x the right side are canceled 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.900
 these terms we have less 1 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.130
 dividing minus 9 both sides 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.760
 we already arrived at the solution of the equation 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.680
 x equal to 1 b we are not in this case of 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.200
 here we explicitly find a 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.150
 solution x equal to a ninth that meets 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.810
 with this equation so is this 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.810
 equation here has exactly one 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.810
 solution
