want this to be more efficient

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.900 
want this to be more efficient
you<00:00:59.530> could<00:00:59.710> also<00:00:59.829> insider'<00:01:00.309> bringing<00:01:00.699> energy

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
you could also insider' bringing energy

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.810 
you could also insider' bringing energy
potions<00:01:01.570> if<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:01.780> are<00:01:01.899> a<00:01:01.929> member<00:01:02.579> they're<00:01:03.579> very

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
potions if you are a member they're very

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.410 
potions if you are a member they're very
cheap<00:01:04.120> they're<00:01:04.780> only<00:01:04.989> 31<00:01:05.439> coins<00:01:05.740> each<00:01:06.040> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
cheap they're only 31 coins each and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.240 
cheap they're only 31 coins each and
they<00:01:07.420> will<00:01:07.570> restore<00:01:07.960> 20<00:01:08.500> energy<00:01:08.890> for<00:01:09.070> every

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
they will restore 20 energy for every

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.080 
they will restore 20 energy for every
time<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.549> drink<00:01:09.700> it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
time you drink it

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.910 
time you drink it
so<00:01:10.210> that's<00:01:10.479> 80<00:01:10.659> energy<00:01:11.110> per<00:01:11.290> potion<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:11.830> you

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
so that's 80 energy per potion so you

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.590 
so that's 80 energy per potion so you
don't<00:01:12.070> if<00:01:12.220> there's<00:01:12.549> a<00:01:12.610> lot<00:01:12.759> of<00:01:12.790> ashes<00:01:13.299> in<00:01:13.450> one

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
don't if there's a lot of ashes in one

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.560 
don't if there's a lot of ashes in one
area<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.130> will<00:01:15.369> be<00:01:15.490> much<00:01:15.759> faster<00:01:16.090> if<00:01:16.390> you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
area then it will be much faster if you

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.719 
area then it will be much faster if you
drink<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:16.900> potion<00:01:17.110> but<00:01:17.890> only<00:01:18.040> bring<00:01:18.340> one<00:01:18.549> per

basic thing is just anyone can do this

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.210 
basic thing is just anyone can do this
just<00:01:37.479> pick<00:01:37.720> up<00:01:37.840> ashes<00:01:38.409> off<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.770> ground<00:01:39.009> once

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
they appear and the trick to doing this

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.260 
they appear and the trick to doing this
more<00:01:41.770> efficiently<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:42.490> don't<00:01:42.880> go<00:01:43.030> for<00:01:43.210> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
more efficiently is don't go for the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.440 
more efficiently is don't go for the
ashes<00:01:43.689> when<00:01:43.869> they<00:01:43.960> just<00:01:44.170> appear<00:01:44.909> try<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.969> wait

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
ashes when they just appear try to wait

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.450 
ashes when they just appear try to wait
for<00:01:46.719> more<00:01:46.869> ashes<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.290> appear<00:01:47.649> in<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:48.040> row<00:01:48.219> before

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
for more ashes to appear in a row before

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.880 
for more ashes to appear in a row before
