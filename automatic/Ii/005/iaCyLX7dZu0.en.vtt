00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 more than a week before the tests 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.540
 of the bac philo for 680 thousand high school students 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.799
 this year and last straight 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.019
 so for revisions 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.940
 to each his recipe but you will see 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.809
 that some methods are more 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 effective than others 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.740
 it's the mystery of the brain 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 how to optimize your response memory 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.680
 with jeanne benzina and guillaume 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.590
 beaufils for this lesson in economics 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.449
 three ways to review different 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.980
 alicia salome and lea have tested all 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.730
 the methods before finding the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.890
 better but each one to his 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.989
 alicia needs to write her lesson is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.719
 summarized on cards with a code of 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.360
 precise colors it allows in 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 my head to memorize to see the course of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.280
 see how it is built and suddenly 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.379
 to be able to get out more easily if 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.700
 I only make nice people to 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.789
 know the technique of oea 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:59.879
 you just have to listen once 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.629
 that these writings finally it would bring a 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.439
 other so and reread fact that's what 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.689
 allows me his ramp 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.900
 salomé she reviews in music we 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.790
 highlights keywords years while he is there 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.580
 a recipe for better learning 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.000
 yes according to the scientists for the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.909
 know 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.549
 in his laboratory the professor oudea 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.150
 study the mechanisms of the brain for 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.070
 to revise well 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.009
 the student must associate the learning 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.689
 by heart with reflection you 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.420
 you will have to learn by heart 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.299
 a list of seven words as soon as the state 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.780
 take you tell me and step one 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:47.369
 memorizing the parker hammer 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.670
 computer bathers 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.020
 Web browser 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.630
 this is what happens in our brain 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.179
 the prefrontal cortex here at the front in 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.549
 yellow is mobilized when the list is 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.119
 learned she is recorded at the back 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.380
 of the brain 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.360
 here in glass selects two shapes 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.729
 Geometric for replacing following 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.869
 mechanisms of reflection with a 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.930
 logic exercise 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.910
 although a red left where I 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.099
 take a blue square on the left whose 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.780
 brain this time the areas satif in 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.040
 the other direction from the back to the front 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.200
 to properly revise it must be done 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.349
 to make the gym to his neurons and to combine 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.000
 both practices should not be dedicated 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.319
 learning that at the repetition the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.940
 repetition is useful for 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.579
 automation but we must also do 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.620
 reflection exercises that is to say 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.840
 to move his brain in both 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.840
 sense but his latest discovery 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.299
 here it is eleven yellow a brain at a 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.849
 exercise of reasoning then the same at 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.130
 rest until surprise treatment the 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.380
 active areas are the same for good 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.880
 learn so be aware to rest 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.100
 just after the rest pickups during 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.920
 learning during the day or in 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.290
 class are equally essential for 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.970
 stabilize learning in progress 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.680
 these scientific discoveries 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.660
 some have turned them into a method 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.430
 of work to optimize revisions 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.319
 of the ferry near Montpellier 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.750
 this teacher intervenes in the 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.769
 objective terminal classes their 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.940
 give tips 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.200
 somehow compatible brain 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.609
 the idea is to make cards of 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.099
 reviews exactly as you know 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.040
 do with as few words as possible 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:33.340
 it's a key word a key drawing that you 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.470
 will make think by association of ideas to 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.519
 all the knowledge you want 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.470
 more the keyword is personal and more 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.150
 you will remember May 15 he has 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.630
 just tried with his lesson from 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.710
 geography 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.320
 it's written some names for me 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.150
 remember the places you actually chose 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.550
 his keywords because for you he is 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.200
 evoked the most things but not because 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.600
 that it was present in a book or 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.420
 no in one that others on the board 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.990
 finished the little girl bristol the brain 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.820
 learns better on xxl format 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.180
 thanks to éric gaspard his students have 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.580
 realized their revisions successfully I 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.340
 risk me quickly and easily 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.290
 there is I notice that in my 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.270
 academic results 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.700
 we think we can change we can 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.410
 it is to improve and to see it works 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.510
 Best to reassure ourselves for 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.850
 the latest bac future tips 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.230
 graduates on the day of the exam started 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.850
 by answering obvious questions 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.850
 those whose answers or come 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.640
 easily so de-stressing your 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.640
 brain to better succeed the bac
