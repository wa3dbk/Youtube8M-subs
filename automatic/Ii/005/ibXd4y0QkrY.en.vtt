let's<00:01:12.700> turn<00:01:12.940> this<00:01:13.090> thing<00:01:13.150> on<00:01:13.620> take<00:01:14.620> a<00:01:14.650> look<00:01:14.860> at

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
let's turn this thing on take a look at

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:35.930 
let's turn this thing on take a look at
it

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:47.240 

has<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:36.690> pretty<00:01:36.900> fast<00:01:37.260> processor<00:01:38.190> 1<00:01:39.000> gigahertz

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.440 

the<00:01:47.880> phone<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.300> fairly<00:01:49.200> thin<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:51.270> weight

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the phone is fairly thin and the weight

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.110 
the phone is fairly thin and the weight
comes<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.990> at<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.310> four<00:01:53.310> point<00:01:53.520> four<00:01:53.670> ounces

so<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.050> has<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.200> nice<00:01:55.380> light<00:01:55.680> feel<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so it has a nice light feel to it the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
so it has a nice light feel to it the
screen<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.800> big<00:01:59.040> enough<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.430> 4.3<00:02:00.030> inches<00:02:00.270> but

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
screen is big enough at 4.3 inches but

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.160 
screen is big enough at 4.3 inches but
it's<00:02:00.570> not<00:02:00.720> too<00:02:01.370> too<00:02:02.370> obtrusive<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:06.110> one<00:02:07.110> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it's not too too obtrusive and one of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
it's not too too obtrusive and one of
the<00:02:07.229> best<00:02:07.380> things<00:02:07.440> about<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.970> top

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the best things about this the the top

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.999 
the best things about this the the top
time<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.660> rated<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.990> eight<00:02:10.140> point<00:02:10.440> eight<00:02:10.560> hours

time is rated to eight point eight hours

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.850 
time is rated to eight point eight hours
which<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.880> probably<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> leading

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
thing that's missing for boost is the 4g

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.570 
thing that's missing for boost is the 4g
capability<00:02:58.890> but<00:02:59.890> compared<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.310> some<00:03:00.460> of<00:03:00.490> the

boost other phones you have for the
money<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:05.050> thing's<00:03:05.260> listed<00:03:05.650> two<00:03:05.800> hundred

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
money this thing's listed two hundred

twenty<00:03:06.190> dollars<00:03:06.670> on<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.120> boost<00:03:07.300> website<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
twenty dollars on the boost website and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.560 
twenty dollars on the boost website and
I'm<00:03:12.400> sure<00:03:12.430> probably<00:03:12.850> in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.090> future<00:03:13.390> that

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
I'm sure probably in the future that

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.530 
I'm sure probably in the future that
price<00:03:13.780> will<00:03:13.930> go<00:03:13.960> down<00:03:14.050> slightly<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:15.540> maybe

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
price will go down slightly and maybe

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.150 
price will go down slightly and maybe
