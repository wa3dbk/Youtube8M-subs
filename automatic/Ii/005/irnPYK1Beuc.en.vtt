00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.760
 ahoy hello everyone my name is uton and 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:20.550
 Today I will show you a mod called 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.890
 Smoke mod and I already feel like yours 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.170
 your eyes lit up and you already understand 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.769
 probably that it is just awesome mod 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.470
 yes he adds that same smaug from 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.890
 movie hobbit or lord of the rings i'm not 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.960
 I do not like that at all 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.160
 This series and watched a few 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.350
 films lord of the rings and the hobbit 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.270
 that's the last film waste of smauga i 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.210
 also did not look 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.140
 we i think many of you were watching 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.510
 him and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.670
 or even if they didn’t watch it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.060
 even this mod is very like and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.960
 so we have one lonely chest 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.150
 in the middle of the beach let's open it here we are 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 see just a few things and this 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.490
 almost everything that adds this mod 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.670
 say little denmark let's just now 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.609
 look at these things staff of smaug 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.439
 it is something like a sword and it can be 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:20.729
 use for other purposes later 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.509
 I'll look at all of course here 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.149
 so here we have a bow dragonforce bow 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.130
 which is pretty strong, well sort of 8 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.799
 roughly a unit he knocks out and shoots 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.299
 ordinary arrows and set of course 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.710
 set of smaug itself 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.100
 let's dress him up 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.679
 any stick i press f5 let's not 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.899
 eager to see for yourself that's how I 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:50.490
 I look pretty epic now I think 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.560
 The author of this mod tried very hard and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.200
 made pretty pretty textures 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.749
 maybe in the movie something was but i 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.829
 as already said did not look therefore not 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:05.340
 I know nothing about this here such textures 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.069
 such armor is very strong by the way 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.469
 there are regular beats 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.439
 mobs you generally do not credited them and you 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:15.389
 you will not feel that is zombies 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.810
 you can't be crippled at all 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:22.290
 for example, well, let's take now 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.969
 it is a lonely egg that remains and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.090
 to spawn himself smok and that's how he 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.959
 guys looks like a huge smook with 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.389
 modelku 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.329
 most ordinary ender dragon but 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:39.799
 look he has a beautiful texture 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.239
 pretty texture also from the movie and 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.530
 let's fly up to it you can 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:50.609
 notice that it fires me this one 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.209
 what's the tempo look a bit temp found in 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.849
 general now is not up to him so this 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.829
 Smoke he just throws you fireball and 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.109
 sets you on fire and tries to kill 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.590
 in all sorts of ways things 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:08.280
 imposes such an awesome could notice 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.010
 that he has no 20 wanted to say 25,000 on 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.530
 in fact two and a half thousand hepe 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.609
 let's imagine we killed it 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.949
 smaug 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.069
 now I will not kill him of course 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:22.019
 it's very long and what are you sex with it 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.590
 you ask what is this drop 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.489
 huge boss UN dropnul am all here this 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.620
 and this one there is connection your sets weapons 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.560
 yes quite a lot and it's pretty good 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.859
 payment for such work for the murder 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.579
 Smauga So now I think it is worth 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:43.290
 tell you what 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.870
 Smook you create now perhaps 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.879
 tell you what 's doing here 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.519
 this thing is staff of smaug 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.790
 she not only can beat she also 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.040
 spawn a pet right mouse button and 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.909
 next to you appears pet let's 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.040
 let's sit on him look by the way him 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.319
 The name Newton managed to Smoke that is 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.269
 he is my pet he will go for 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.129
 me let's check here he goes for 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.329
 I teleport if I run away to 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.669
 away such a pet sit down on him yes 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.849
 as we see you can ride and see 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.760
 he runs very fast much faster 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.090
 than not 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.840
 three horses and even more so than dogs 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:29.050
 which I don’t really like that 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.660
 mowgli not smook pet we can also 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.940
 jump pretty high 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.170
 That's how he jumps and neatly 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.970
 plans later and it is possible not only 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.610
 ride the same way he can attack 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.660
 let's go back to the dogs that I 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:50.110
 already lost here they are dogs neatly 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.540
 go down and press the book of taste as we 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.910
 see we were able to attack the dog 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.030
 having such a pet on hand is very 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.070
 easy to kill various mobs and in general 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.820
 you will live easier to survive in 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.890
 minecraft 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.890
 see how easily even straighten 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.960
 With these dogs, I got creative 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.140
 could see how much hp this 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.810
 our pet has three full lanes 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.550
 That is, 30 pieces are very difficult 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.640
 will kill such a dragon and this 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.850
 undoubtedly plus is all that adds 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.850
 mod more here tell nothing but 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.400
 this will agree very much 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:31.380
 worked well the developer author of this 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.520
 fashion beautiful texture models and stuff
