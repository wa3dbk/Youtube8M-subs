00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.430
 hi everyone knows this kairos 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.080
 how is it going today for 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.820
 a new gameplay this time at 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.460
 snipers on the hydro map and you see 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.020
 the game mode arms realizes then this is 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.580
 a quotation marks a new way of 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.970
 game that came out today on black 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.380
 ops 2 on ps3 and xbox so that makes 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.539
 actually pleasure to see that on 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.769
 ps3 so at the same time as on xbox I 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.820
 believe it's a first time 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.700
 has something at the same time a little 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.290
 close but good who says face and a new 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.239
 game mode really in quotation marks 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.590
 because actually did not 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.120
 actually that but it's in the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.040
 bonus category which you go into the 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.630
 bonus category and you find this mode 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.610
 there then I do not know exactly how 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.980
 it's called in French but in English 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.720
 c arms trade and so it's just a 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.980
 death match in which instead 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.440
 to get 100 points for a 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.270
 enlightenment you are going to get 150 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.610
 so it's true that it's still 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.050
 a 50% growth that is not nothing 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 since they will allow you to 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.990
 unlock your strict scores a lot 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.909
 more quickly it's true that up 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.680
 now play in death match for 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.240
 unlock the strict score it was not 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.950
 always the top it was lights a 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.020
 little bit long so we'll always have 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.549
 privileged domination that allows you 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.590
 to hold a few more points or 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.479
 also the confirmed elimination that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.579
 she too from our more points and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.740
 so finally conditions to pick up the 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.119
 flags of course but so with 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.829
 this game mode there for me it's pretty much 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.600
 close as if you were playing in 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.100
 eliminations confirmed without having 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.710
 need to pick up medals you 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.090
 have 150 points directly and so there 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.609
 frankly to unlock your scores 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.479
 Strictly it's really going a lot more 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.009
 easily I can guarantee it 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.679
 so I said to myself I'm still 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.329
 to test it with the sniper I helped myself 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.189
 determination to have that a little bit 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.350
 faster and we can see that already beginning 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.729
 of party there we are at 10 10 finally 12 10 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.249
 so that's pretty much the beginning I already have 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.679
 unlocked warthog orbital station and 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.039
 helicopters so it's still great 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.060
 quick 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.229
 so good I had it anyway 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.549
 the opportunity to have it done 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.709
 some kills that helped me there 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.359
 above and finally down once you 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.979
 have all that good here is the part is done 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.969
 a little close to herself and it's happening 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.679
 rather not bad so 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.350
 I was pretty happy especially 700 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.639
 sniper games where I managed to make 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.080
 some that he has moments where I 

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.640
 tell 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.200
 no I will not be able to do it and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.120
 they are gone so here it is 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.490
 always a question also of bad 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.020
 a little bit of luck knowing 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.490
 is never really very sure of them 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.720
 when is this going to happen or not and 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.430
 we're going to see exactly where 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.470
 I wanted to do a little bit my clever 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.000
 huh I think a little bit of excess 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.830
 trust I said I see 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.120
 go right I go left and 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.220
 finally I got myself what 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.480
 is a bit of a shame I should have 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.560
 really go on to try to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.060
 kill rather than they try to make a 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.230
 little harm huh but here he won 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.630
 good for him 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.010
 that will teach me for next time in 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.420
 Anyway here I unlocked but my 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.280
 three sets when strict and it's a small 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.020
 little it is the goal of this mode there is 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.420
 to say to unlock these strict scores a 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.250
 a little faster without needing 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.630
 to go into domination since it's true 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.310
 that until now it was more or 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.720
 minus the game mode there are also points 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.240
 strategic where we can unlock the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.650
 strict score fairly quickly and from 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.780
 done thanks to that we can do it then 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.000
 it is true that it is a small point of 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.470
 view where we can discuss because on 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.140
 black ops 2 the problem of scores 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.580
 strict and opponents ie 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.320
 that often when we will throw sports 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.420
 strict a little too powerful or a small 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.180
 not too frequently opponents have 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.010
 frequencies so tend to leave 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.600
 the game and we'll meet again 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.910
 a little bit alone with our scores 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.260
 This pretty powerful stuff which is what 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.900
 not used to much it must be said 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.670
 there by good luck the enemies are over 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.920
 or less to stay happily because 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.540
 otherwise bah rÃ©tais stops and boring 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.370
 but actually it's a little bit 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.890
 the problem that has in call of duty 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.120
 so make a game mode where we can 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.610
 unlock the strict score more 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.739
 quickly is that yes or no it's 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.540
 wise knowing that the enemies have 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.100
 tendency to go out very easily 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.160
 cases of strict scores very powerful 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.540
 So to have to see after if you are on 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.920
 good enemies is good if you are 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.420
 on enemies who have a little bit of 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.269
 game rage easy quit 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.620
 there is a little bit boring 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.959
 for me what would have been good was 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.180
 make this game mode the most a match to 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.769
 death without a strict score and the sister 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.590
 is still interesting to see 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.480
 people playing 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.090
 not for the strict score but who 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.340
 plays low for just the elimination 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.840
 the goal of the game is not to get these 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.300
 strict blinds because I think it 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.870
 there are a lot of people who go 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.430
 to camp and that they will play differently 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.109
 to play the narrow score I say no 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.760
 because I too do it we saw 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.380
 times when I'm at a renting 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.210
 two to have I do not know my station 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.410
 orbital so automatically I'm going 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.419
 not run in the middle of the map 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.160
 I will be a little more careful and so 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.020
 so if there was a game mode 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.550
 its strict score there were already 1 I 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.280
 remember on mw2 you did a 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.470
 game mode without whom the streak is good 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.020
 it was still pretty much not even 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.130
 so good if I did not really play but 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.479
 at that moment I think that's it 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.190
 could be interesting to see a 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.350
 little difference between those who 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.400
 only those who want to forgive play the 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.440
 strict score or those who want 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.210
 simply play the part simply 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.250
 like that I'm going to play and not 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.470
 play to try to get scores 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.389
 strict and also because of this the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.950
 people add then that's it's a mode 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.330
 of play in quotation marks again but he 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.400
 Finally, I'm a little disappointed 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.240
 on it because david van der vaart 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.169
 so I'm not sure of the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.030
 pronunciation if it's correct or 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.620
 not but hey had announced that he 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.880
 was going to go out the similar game mode 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.080
 to the war game mode that were 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.760
 present in world at war 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.430
 this game mode I do not know if you 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.229
 remember who corresponded with three or 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.080
 five flags depending on the size of the 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.849
 map and with unlike the 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.860
 domination where we had to take 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.120
 possession of a flag a parent this is 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.550
 to say that you have middle flag 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.990
 each team must recover must 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.669
 take possession of the flag of 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.979
 middle one who takes possession one 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.620
 go on to the next flag until you have 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.940
 repelled the enemy in his camp and this 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.460
 game mode there was a game mode 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.260
 exceptional really on which it was 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.760
 a really very very big kiff to play 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.050
 so especially that it's treyarch 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.370
 they talked about that they had milk 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.349
 that they were going to bring back a game mode 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.150
 similar and unfortunately it did not 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.260
 still not the case and that it me 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.120
 disappoints a little bit because I think 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.190
 that this is a game mode on which we 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.419
 would really be exploded so this is 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.300
 always a little hope that they come out 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.740
 a little later and if ever the spell I 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.120
 think it's going to be really good for 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.500
 a little game mode a little more I 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.090
 finds it exciting that domination 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.590
 because the problem for me of the 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.910
 domination 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.250
 and you go to the enemy camp 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.900
 the point of reappearance will change 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.220
 they will reappear in your camp 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.660
 is automatically due to learn the 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.950
 flag and boom you will make yourself 200 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.080
 dots provided you to do one or two 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.370
 Kill and so on and there are people who 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.620
 have fun every time to go around 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.700
 maps like this and with this game mode 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.730
 there it would be nice since 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.780
 finally it would be a progression 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.940
 forced into the enemy camp 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.410
 and what would force a little m after the 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.820
 pressure in a linear way and not 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.980
 not having fun circling the map 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.540
 so this is the next 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.800
 end of the gameplay in any case I hope that 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.540
 the gameplay you liked I was pretty 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.070
 glad for me my part of the one who 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.470
 camp the sniper I did it anyway 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.640
 some small shots file at the end but 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.160
 in the end I'm not bad 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.500
 released with a rather positive score and 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.570
 with ba the prime objective that was 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.950
 thanks to this game mode to unlock but 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.970
 this strict body more easily and more 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.980
 quickly what was mission 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.050
 accomplished and make me happy too 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.250
 also to play sniper and bah it's 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.720
 Sure, it's always nice it feels 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.970
 always happy when we unlock 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.130
 scores quite powerful enough with the 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.470
 sniper so here bac for me it was 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.730
 accomplished mission here is 39 if I get 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.470
 remembered more the score with a ratio of 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.850
 6 50 that's fine it's done 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.020
