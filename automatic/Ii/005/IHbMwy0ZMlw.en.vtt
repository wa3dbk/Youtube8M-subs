interesting anatomy or other reasons
typically<00:00:38.360> this<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.840> way<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.020> prosthesis

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
typically this is the way a prosthesis

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.620 
typically this is the way a prosthesis
is<00:00:40.010> going<00:00:40.219> to<00:00:40.340> be<00:00:40.430> set<00:00:40.730> up<00:00:40.760> now<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:41.420> might<00:00:41.600> be

is going to be set up now you might be

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.200 
is going to be set up now you might be
wondering<00:00:41.780> how<00:00:42.649> does<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.010> prosthetist<00:00:43.579> get<00:00:44.000> a

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
wondering how does the prosthetist get a

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.509 
wondering how does the prosthetist get a
prosthetic<00:00:44.899> leg<00:00:45.199> set<00:00:45.589> up<00:00:45.710> properly<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:46.489> that

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
prosthetic leg set up properly so that

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.939 
prosthetic leg set up properly so that
it's<00:00:46.940> straight<00:00:47.300> up<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.600> down<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:48.649> way<00:00:48.769> they

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
it's straight up and down the way they

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.799 
it's straight up and down the way they
do<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:49.339> is<00:00:49.550> by<00:00:49.730> adjusting<00:00:49.879> these<00:00:50.480> four

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
do that is by adjusting these four

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.009 
do that is by adjusting these four
screws<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.289> are<00:00:51.620> on<00:00:51.859> the<00:00:52.010> bottom<00:00:52.219> of<00:00:52.519> the

and if I screw this one the socket moved

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.249 
and if I screw this one the socket moved
this<00:02:07.750> way

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
this way

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.559 
this way
so<00:02:08.500> that's<00:02:08.679> inversion<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.459> e-version<00:02:09.729> it's

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
so that's inversion and e-version it's

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.479 
so that's inversion and e-version it's
very<00:02:10.810> useful<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.260> know<00:02:11.530> how<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.739> adjust<00:02:11.890> your

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
very useful to know how to adjust your

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.699 
very useful to know how to adjust your
prosthetic<00:02:12.940> foot<00:02:13.090> because<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.709> sometimes

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
prosthetic foot because a sometimes

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.650 
prosthetic foot because a sometimes
these<00:02:15.220> set<00:02:15.520> screws<00:02:15.790> come<00:02:16.030> loose<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.540> it's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
these set screws come loose and it's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.840 
these set screws come loose and it's
good<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.930> know<00:02:17.020> how<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.170> tighten<00:02:17.530> them<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.920> be

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
good to know how to tighten them and be

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.820 
good to know how to tighten them and be
it's<00:02:19.390> nice<00:02:19.630> because<00:02:19.989> if<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.290> want<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.530> change

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
it's nice because if you want to change

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.479 
it's nice because if you want to change
shoes<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.840> your<00:02:22.840> shoes<00:02:23.319> are<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.160> slightly

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
shoes and your shoes are of a slightly

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.370 
shoes and your shoes are of a slightly
different<00:02:24.790> heel<00:02:25.180> height<00:02:25.450> then<00:02:26.019> you<00:02:26.200> can

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
different heel height then you can

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.860 
different heel height then you can
adjust<00:02:26.500> your<00:02:26.950> prosthesis<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.790> make<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.209> work

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
adjust your prosthesis to make it work

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.820 
adjust your prosthesis to make it work
for<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.739> instead<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.790> having<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.480> be

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
for you instead of having it be

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.020 
for you instead of having it be
misaligned<00:02:32.830> which<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.340> what<00:02:33.489> would<00:02:33.549> happen<00:02:33.760> if

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
misaligned which is what would happen if

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.390 
misaligned which is what would happen if
I<00:02:34.150> change<00:02:34.180> shoes<00:02:34.840> there<00:02:35.410> were<00:02:35.530> different<00:02:35.890> heel

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
I change shoes there were different heel

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.220 
I change shoes there were different heel
height<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.209> example<00:02:37.569> if<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.750> want<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.989> have

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
height so for example if I want to have

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.860 
height so for example if I want to have
shoes<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.680> have<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.830> heel<00:02:39.040> like<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.760> then<00:02:40.600> I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
shoes that have a heel like this then I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.039 
shoes that have a heel like this then I
would<00:02:40.959> adjust<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:42.269> backwards<00:02:43.269> using<00:02:43.930> this

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
would adjust this backwards using this

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.330 
would adjust this backwards using this
screw<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:45.030> plantar<00:02:46.030> flex<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.540> more<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.440> make

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
screw to plantar flex and more to make

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.789 
screw to plantar flex and more to make
this<00:02:48.819> come<00:02:49.360> back<00:02:49.540> into<00:02:49.900> alignment<00:02:50.319> with

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
this come back into alignment with

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.850 
this come back into alignment with
respect<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.540> line<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:53.080> drawn<00:02:53.380> right<00:02:53.620> here

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
respect to the line is drawn right here

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.009 
respect to the line is drawn right here
one<00:02:54.430> thing<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.790> definitely<00:02:55.030> want<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.690> do

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
one thing that you definitely want to do

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.680 
one thing that you definitely want to do
is<00:02:56.290> always<00:02:56.590> put<00:02:56.769> Loctite<00:02:57.579> on<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.060> set<00:02:58.329> screws

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
is always put Loctite on the set screws

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.690 
is always put Loctite on the set screws
and<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.079> mean<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.500> non<00:02:59.680> permanent<00:03:00.040> Loctite

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
and I mean the non permanent Loctite

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.780 
and I mean the non permanent Loctite
what<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.750> will<00:03:01.930> do<00:03:02.109> is<00:03:02.440> keep<00:03:03.010> your<00:03:03.489> set

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
what that will do is keep your set

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.819 
what that will do is keep your set
screws<00:03:04.150> from<00:03:04.420> coming<00:03:04.780> loose<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:05.440> allow<00:03:05.769> you

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
screws from coming loose but allow you

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.039 
screws from coming loose but allow you
to<00:03:06.130> loosen<00:03:06.340> them<00:03:06.579> if<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:06.970> need<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.269> that's

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
to loosen them if you need to that's

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.590 
to loosen them if you need to that's
really<00:03:08.590> important<00:03:09.070> it's<00:03:09.910> also<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.239> really<00:03:10.420> good

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
really important it's also a really good

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.210 
really important it's also a really good
idea<00:03:10.660> if<00:03:10.989> you've<00:03:11.140> never<00:03:11.380> adjusted<00:03:12.040> your

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
idea if you've never adjusted your

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.430 
idea if you've never adjusted your
prosthetic<00:03:12.730> before<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.450> either<00:03:14.019> take<00:03:14.410> a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
prosthetic before to either take a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.130 
prosthetic before to either take a
picture<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.400> arrangement<00:03:15.970> set<00:03:16.390> screws<00:03:16.780> or

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
picture of the arrangement set screws or

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.360 
picture of the arrangement set screws or
write<00:03:17.590> them<00:03:17.769> down<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.670> know<00:03:18.910> if<00:03:19.329> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
write them down so that you know if you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.770 
write them down so that you know if you
mess<00:03:21.370> everything<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.209> can't<00:03:22.480> get<00:03:22.660> your

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
mess everything up and can't get your

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.120 
mess everything up and can't get your
socket<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.320> way<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.500> want<00:03:23.799> it<00:03:23.980> after

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
socket the way you want it after

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.920 
socket the way you want it after
adjusting<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.060> can<00:03:25.180> always<00:03:25.390> go<00:03:25.660> back<00:03:25.690> to

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
adjusting it you can always go back to

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.560 
adjusting it you can always go back to
it<00:03:26.230> exactly<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.160> way<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.370> was<00:03:27.400> before<00:03:27.700> if<00:03:28.209> you

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
it exactly the way it was before if you

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.300 
it exactly the way it was before if you
take<00:03:28.750> pictures<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:29.620> replicate<00:03:30.160> exactly

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
take pictures and just replicate exactly

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.520 
take pictures and just replicate exactly
what<00:03:30.730> your<00:03:31.329> socket<00:03:31.810> was<00:03:31.930> already<00:03:32.170> set<00:03:32.320> up<00:03:32.410> to

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
what your socket was already set up to

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.289 
what your socket was already set up to
be<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.370> say<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.579> want<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:33.880> set<00:03:34.060> up<00:03:34.090> this

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
be so say you want to set up this

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.630 
be so say you want to set up this
prosthetic<00:03:34.870> leg<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.560> be<00:03:35.709> specific<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.519> an

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
prosthetic leg to be specific to an

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.059 
prosthetic leg to be specific to an
activity<00:03:37.120> for<00:03:37.390> me<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.569> can<00:03:37.959> use<00:03:37.989> aerial<00:03:38.650> silks

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
activity for me I can use aerial silks

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.699 
activity for me I can use aerial silks
or<00:03:39.280> tumbling<00:03:39.790> which<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> class<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.410> take

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
in which we don't wear shoes so I'll

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.500 
in which we don't wear shoes so I'll
take<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.170> shoe<00:03:44.350> off<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:46.030> doesn't<00:03:46.359> quite

and<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.870> reason<00:03:53.200> for<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.799> heel

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
and the reason for that is the heel

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.850 
and the reason for that is the heel
height<00:03:54.190> difference

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
height difference

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.700 
height difference
this<00:03:55.280> shoe<00:03:55.850> has<00:03:56.090> about<00:03:56.510> 3/8<00:03:57.110> of<00:03:57.200> an<00:03:57.320> inch<00:03:57.380> heel

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
this shoe has about 3/8 of an inch heel

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.310 
this shoe has about 3/8 of an inch heel
and<00:03:57.950> if<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.820> use<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.330> without<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.600> shoe<00:03:59.930> then

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
and if I use it without a shoe then

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.590 
and if I use it without a shoe then
there's<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.620> 3/8<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.250> news<00:04:01.370> difference<00:04:01.760> so

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
there's a 3/8 of a news difference so

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.270 
there's a 3/8 of a news difference so
now<00:04:02.780> instead<00:04:03.320> of<00:04:03.500> being<00:04:03.560> straight<00:04:04.010> up<00:04:04.130> and

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
now instead of being straight up and

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.850 
now instead of being straight up and
down<00:04:04.340> my<00:04:05.090> socket<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:05.930> tilted<00:04:06.380> a<00:04:06.470> little<00:04:06.500> bit

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
down my socket is tilted a little bit

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.460 
down my socket is tilted a little bit
backward<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.270> so<00:04:08.540> what<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.720> want<00:04:08.990> to<00:04:09.050> do<00:04:09.260> to

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
backward and so what I want to do to

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.960 
backward and so what I want to do to
adjust<00:04:09.800> it<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.160> bring<00:04:10.460> it<00:04:10.550> a<00:04:10.610> little<00:04:10.820> bit

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
adjust it is bring it a little bit

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.120 
adjust it is bring it a little bit
forward<00:04:11.240> to<00:04:11.570> bring<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:11.840> back<00:04:12.080> in<00:04:12.290> alignment<00:04:12.860> so

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
forward to bring it back in alignment so

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.860 
forward to bring it back in alignment so
I'll<00:04:13.220> do<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:19.600> all<00:04:20.600> right

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
I'll do that all right

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.830 
I'll do that all right
get<00:04:21.680> straight<00:04:22.450> leg<00:04:26.380> there<00:04:27.380> we<00:04:27.710> go

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
get straight leg there we go

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.800 
get straight leg there we go
there<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:30.020> go<00:04:30.500> don't<00:04:30.830> forget<00:04:31.070> your<00:04:31.220> lock<00:04:31.370> tight

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
there we go don't forget your lock tight

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.320 
there we go don't forget your lock tight
which<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:33.080> forgot<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.400> now<00:04:34.520> my<00:04:34.700> prosthetic<00:04:35.150> leg

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
which I forgot so now my prosthetic leg

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.750 
which I forgot so now my prosthetic leg
is<00:04:35.540> aligned<00:04:35.900> properly<00:04:36.260> for<00:04:36.860> walking<00:04:37.220> barefoot

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
is aligned properly for walking barefoot

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.120 
is aligned properly for walking barefoot
if<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.450> want<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.690> go<00:04:38.750> back<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.380> wearing<00:04:39.650> my<00:04:39.800> shoe

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
if I want to go back to wearing my shoe

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:47.290 
if I want to go back to wearing my shoe
I'll<00:04:40.580> just<00:04:40.910> put<00:04:41.780> my<00:04:41.810> shoe<00:04:42.140> back<00:04:42.260> on<00:04:46.300> your

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
I'll just put my shoe back on your

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.090 
I'll just put my shoe back on your
prosthesis<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:48.020> probably<00:04:48.440> almost<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.980> most

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
prosthesis is probably almost the most

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.190 
prosthesis is probably almost the most
important<00:04:49.700> thing<00:04:49.970> that<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.300> own<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:50.870> it

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
important thing that you own and it

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.130 
important thing that you own and it
would<00:04:51.290> be<00:04:51.440> really<00:04:52.010> really<00:04:52.390> uncool<00:04:53.390> if<00:04:53.810> you

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
would be really really uncool if you

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.800 
would be really really uncool if you
couldn't<00:04:54.710> wear<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.100> because<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.750> adjusted<00:04:56.750> it

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
couldn't wear it because you adjusted it

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.250 
couldn't wear it because you adjusted it
wrong<00:04:57.020> because<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.770> watched<00:04:57.950> my<00:04:58.160> video<00:04:58.280> so

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
wrong because you watched my video so

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.500 
wrong because you watched my video so
definitely<00:05:00.260> make<00:05:00.860> sure<00:05:01.060> you're<00:05:02.060> pretty

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
definitely make sure you're pretty

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.850 
definitely make sure you're pretty
confident<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.290> know<00:05:03.470> what<00:05:03.680> you're

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
confident that you know what you're

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.430 
confident that you know what you're
doing<00:05:04.160> before<00:05:04.729> you<00:05:04.940> do<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.270> or<00:05:05.540> at<00:05:05.900> least<00:05:06.169> make

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
doing before you do it or at least make

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.100 
doing before you do it or at least make
sure<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:07.190> take<00:05:07.370> pictures<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.600> way<00:05:08.780> that

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
sure to take pictures of the way that

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.440 
sure to take pictures of the way that
your<00:05:09.290> prosthesis<00:05:09.680> is<00:05:10.070> already<00:05:10.400> set<00:05:10.669> up<00:05:10.700> so

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
your prosthesis is already set up so

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.480 
your prosthesis is already set up so
that<00:05:11.660> if<00:05:11.840> you<00:05:12.020> do<00:05:12.320> get<00:05:12.530> it<00:05:12.680> adjusted<00:05:12.800> and<00:05:13.400> it

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
that if you do get it adjusted and it

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.280 
that if you do get it adjusted and it
doesn't<00:05:13.760> quite<00:05:13.940> work<00:05:14.210> right<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.780> can<00:05:14.960> set<00:05:15.200> it

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
doesn't quite work right you can set it

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.440 
doesn't quite work right you can set it
back<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.160> way<00:05:16.310> it<00:05:16.490> was<00:05:16.729> but<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.300> honestly

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
back to the way it was but I honestly

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.719 
back to the way it was but I honestly
feel<00:05:17.900> like<00:05:17.930> most<00:05:18.440> people<00:05:18.680> could<00:05:19.340> probably

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
feel like most people could probably

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.670 
feel like most people could probably
adjust<00:05:20.360> their<00:05:20.570> own<00:05:20.690> prosthesis<00:05:21.169> if<00:05:21.530> they

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
adjust their own prosthesis if they

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.830 
adjust their own prosthesis if they
really<00:05:21.919> need<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.460> and<00:05:22.729> having<00:05:23.720> that

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
really need it to and having that

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.659 
really need it to and having that
knowledge<00:05:24.200> is<00:05:24.350> especially<00:05:24.740> helpful<00:05:25.070> if<00:05:25.430> for

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
knowledge is especially helpful if for

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.580 
knowledge is especially helpful if for
example<00:05:25.700> your<00:05:26.300> prosthetist<00:05:27.020> lives<00:05:27.290> two<00:05:27.530> hours

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
example your prosthetist lives two hours

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.710 
example your prosthetist lives two hours
away<00:05:27.830> or<00:05:28.130> can<00:05:28.580> only<00:05:28.729> see<00:05:29.090> you<00:05:29.270> a<00:05:29.450> week<00:05:29.690> from

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
away or can only see you a week from

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.080 
away or can only see you a week from
Saturday<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.770> you<00:05:30.919> need<00:05:31.130> your<00:05:31.340> leg<00:05:31.580> adjusted

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
Saturday and you need your leg adjusted

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.480 
Saturday and you need your leg adjusted
now<00:05:32.390> it's<00:05:33.200> only<00:05:33.320> four<00:05:33.650> set<00:05:33.890> screws<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.430> so

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
now it's only four set screws and so

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.210 
now it's only four set screws and so
it's<00:05:34.640> not<00:05:34.790> super<00:05:35.360> complicated<00:05:35.540> but<00:05:36.320> if<00:05:36.620> you

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
it's not super complicated but if you

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.480 
it's not super complicated but if you
have<00:05:37.490> trouble<00:05:38.000> for<00:05:38.360> example<00:05:39.370> figuring<00:05:40.370> out

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
have trouble for example figuring out

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.670 
have trouble for example figuring out
which<00:05:40.669> direction<00:05:40.910> to<00:05:41.479> turn<00:05:41.720> your<00:05:42.020> screwdriver

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
which direction to turn your screwdriver

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.040 
which direction to turn your screwdriver
on<00:05:43.070> are<00:05:43.190> pretty<00:05:43.220> regular<00:05:43.880> basis<00:05:44.300> or<00:05:44.540> you<00:05:44.810> maybe

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
on are pretty regular basis or you maybe

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.320 
on are pretty regular basis or you maybe
aren't<00:05:45.530> even<00:05:45.740> aware<00:05:45.860> until<00:05:46.700> right<00:05:46.820> now<00:05:46.850> that

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
aren't even aware until right now that

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.290 
aren't even aware until right now that
screws<00:05:48.020> have<00:05:48.650> directions<00:05:49.160> then<00:05:49.820> you<00:05:50.000> might

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
screws have directions then you might

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.650 
screws have directions then you might
want<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:50.780> save<00:05:51.290> it<00:05:51.500> for<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.919> professionals<00:05:52.660> ok

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
want to save it for the professionals ok

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.270 
want to save it for the professionals ok
