00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.870
 at this year's Hanover Fair 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.910
 In many places robots could be seen 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 which interact directly with people 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.200
 the automation specialist fig 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 put his new one in Hanover 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.040
 two-armed robot june in front of it too 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.030
 for this year's hermes award 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.430
 was nominated 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.260
 you'll see the first robot with june 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.270
 which is suitable in mixed 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.800
 really close collaborations 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.630
 fellow human with human 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.940
 Workforce in the assembly 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.190
 for example, from small products to 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.850
 work that is essentially about it 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.470
 the production of today in the assembly 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
 even more flexible than it is 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.489
 previously possible with the flexible 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
 Robotics has already given the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 flexibility increase results in 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.890
 you me that you no 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.480
 conventional protective devices 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.370
 you need the robot in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.140
 mixed environment side by side with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.690
 putting people up 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.820
 Of course the application we took 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.620
 have as a crystallization point for the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.120
 Development is the assembly of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.219
 small parts whether now in this example 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.500
 components of emergency off switch or ob 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.560
 in other examples components of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 may also be mobile 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.190
 end-user device-just where the where the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.979
 Assembly consists of clear 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.780
 loads that robot now too 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.970
 master complex work processes 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.840
 demonstrated kuka at the example of a 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.090
 rinse off the sink 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.030
 the bottles open all the way to the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 typical wheat beer 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.000
 the robot completed all 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.280
 working steps autonomously and mostly 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.229
 error-free the Augsburger company 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.420
 but showed many others 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.040
 Robotics applications at Hanover 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 The fair is also in three 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.159
 main areas that's an area 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.069
 human robot collaboration then 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.079
 the whole range of smart platforms 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.689
 Control virtuality and the area 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.429
 Mobility was presented at the kuka 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.670
 was also the finalist of the 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.829
 innovation award 2015 four teams 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.079
 sweden italy and switzerland showed 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.780
 as robot arms for archaeological 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.899
 research as a motion translator of 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.729
 exo skeletons as ball catcher and for 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.970
 Picking tasks in the warehouse 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.989
 let use 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.480
 was also nice to look at 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.190
 Servicing robots out of hand 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.599
 system specialists chance even if it 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.030
 probably still take decades 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.890
 will be up to such service robots too 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.879
 autonomous tasks in your own household 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.610
 can do 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.110
 to present roses to fair guests 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.110
 it is enough today
