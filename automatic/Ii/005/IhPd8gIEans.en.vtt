town'll<00:00:48.390> however<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.050> adapted<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
town'll however it can be adapted to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.410 
town'll however it can be adapted to
whatever<00:00:50.040> Town<00:00:50.370> Hall<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.790> suits<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
whatever Town Hall really suits you I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.210 
whatever Town Hall really suits you I
would<00:00:52.110> use<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.380> between<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.680> Town<00:00:52.860> Hall<00:00:53.070> level

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
would use it between the Town Hall level

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.680 
would use it between the Town Hall level
9<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.090> Town<00:00:54.330> Hall<00:00:54.600> level<00:00:55.320> 15<00:00:56.130> around<00:00:56.670> 1617<00:00:57.570> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
9 and a Town Hall level 15 around 1617 I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.850 
9 and a Town Hall level 15 around 1617 I
think<00:00:57.900> you're<00:00:57.990> gonna<00:00:58.110> want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> try<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.620> adopt

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
think you're gonna want to try and adopt

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.100 
think you're gonna want to try and adopt
it<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.340> adapt<00:01:00.060> your<00:01:00.240> base<00:01:00.390> design<00:01:00.720> and<00:01:00.960> maybe

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
it or adapt your base design and maybe

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.770 
it or adapt your base design and maybe
go<00:01:01.320> something<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.650> the<00:01:01.980> death<00:01:02.190> box<00:01:02.780> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
go something like the death box you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.690 
go something like the death box you
don't<00:01:04.019> try<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.470> around<00:01:04.739> maybe<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> diamond

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
don't try it around maybe the diamond

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.820 
don't try it around maybe the diamond
both<00:01:06.240> those<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.600> good<00:01:06.720> options<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:07.320> but

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
both those are good options as well but

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.660 
both those are good options as well but
between<00:01:08.040> Town<00:01:08.490> Hall<00:01:08.790> 9<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.930> 15<00:01:10.290> clover<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.369> a

keeper heroes guys like that and the

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.530 
keeper heroes guys like that and the
other<00:03:02.219> thing<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.549> guys<00:03:02.669> need<00:03:02.909> to<00:03:02.939> do<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.299> have

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
other thing you guys need to do is have

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.929 
other thing you guys need to do is have
one<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.840> those<00:03:03.959> towers<00:03:04.199> that<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.519> cannon

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
one of those towers that is a cannon

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:06.949 
one of those towers that is a cannon
tower<00:03:06.030> because<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.359> will<00:03:06.449> just<00:03:06.569> blow<00:03:06.750> them

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
tower because it will just blow them

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.509 
tower because it will just blow them
away<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.230> all<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.680> hits<00:03:07.919> those<00:03:08.069> little<00:03:08.280> groups

anyways Town Hall level 12 this is a
setup<00:04:01.379> you<00:04:01.560> can<00:04:01.590> use<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:03.269> can<00:04:03.419> tell<00:04:03.569> now<00:04:03.719> that

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
setup you can use you can tell now that

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.839 
setup you can use you can tell now that
we<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.199> four<00:04:04.439> clover<00:04:04.859> before<00:04:05.519> clovers

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
we have the four clover before clovers

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.360 
we have the four clover before clovers
and<00:04:06.030> again<00:04:06.810> we're<00:04:07.049> short<00:04:07.259> on<00:04:07.379> legs<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.159> there's

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
and again we're short on legs so there's

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.909 
and again we're short on legs so there's
practically<00:04:08.879> no<00:04:09.030> legs<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.590> most<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.709> them<00:04:10.829> are

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
practically no legs and most of them are

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.050 
practically no legs and most of them are
only<00:04:11.009> in<00:04:11.280> one<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.669> length

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
only in one and length

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.849 
only in one and length
you<00:04:12.359> also<00:04:12.569> notice<00:04:12.900> how<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.019> have<00:04:13.079> it<00:04:13.229> a<00:04:13.469> lot<00:04:13.500> more

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
you also notice how I have it a lot more

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.949 
you also notice how I have it a lot more
bunched<00:04:14.310> together<00:04:14.759> so<00:04:15.329> instead<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.810> having

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
bunched together so instead of having

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.930 
bunched together so instead of having
two<00:04:16.289> lanes<00:04:16.620> on<00:04:16.889> each

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
two lanes on each

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.740 
two lanes on each
in<00:04:18.240> between<00:04:18.510> each<00:04:18.800> clove<00:04:19.800> clove<00:04:20.510> which<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.630> head

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
in between each clove clove which a head

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.330 
in between each clove clove which a head
on<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.930> other<00:04:22.020> one<00:04:22.200> in<00:04:22.320> which<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.530> have<00:04:22.710> on<00:04:22.920> my

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
on the other one in which I have on my

on the other one in which I have on my
main<00:04:23.550> one<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.030> only<00:04:24.810> have<00:04:24.990> one<00:04:25.230> this<00:04:25.890> really<00:04:26.310> is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
main one I only have one this really is

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.280 
main one I only have one this really is
just<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:26.790> don't<00:04:26.970> know<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.060> was<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.420> was<00:04:27.840> testing<00:04:28.200> it

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
just I don't know I was I was testing it

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.290 
just I don't know I was I was testing it
out<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.470> kind<00:04:28.830> of<00:04:28.890> liked<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.220> better<00:04:29.370> because<00:04:30.270> I

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
out I kind of liked it better because I

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.720 
out I kind of liked it better because I
only<00:04:30.540> have<00:04:30.750> one<00:04:30.780> cannon<00:04:31.320> tower<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:32.550> just

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
only have one cannon tower and this just

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.040 
only have one cannon tower and this just
makes<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.360> range<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.810> cannon

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
makes it so that the range that cannon

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.600 
makes it so that the range that cannon
tower<00:04:34.140> can<00:04:34.350> kind<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.590> reach<00:04:34.800> over<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.190> really

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
tower can kind of reach over and really

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.770 
tower can kind of reach over and really
hit<00:04:35.790> everything<00:04:36.180> because<00:04:36.360> with<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.630> other

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
hit everything because with the other

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.870 
hit everything because with the other
towers<00:04:37.230> they're<00:04:37.800> not<00:04:37.980> reaching<00:04:38.430> especially

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
towers they're not reaching especially

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.790 
towers they're not reaching especially
with<00:04:39.030> me<00:04:39.420> only<00:04:39.570> have<00:04:39.720> them<00:04:39.840> three<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.260> that

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
with me only have them three and that

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.500 
with me only have them three and that
goal<00:04:40.980> volts<00:04:41.310> taken<00:04:41.550> up<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.700> spot<00:04:41.940> down<00:04:42.150> by<00:04:42.330> that

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
goal volts taken up a spot down by that

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.950 
goal volts taken up a spot down by that
far<00:04:42.690> end<00:04:42.900> I<00:04:43.050> can<00:04:43.500> now<00:04:43.650> hit<00:04:43.950> that<00:04:44.220> with<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.150> one

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
far end I can now hit that with that one

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.780 
far end I can now hit that with that one
cannon<00:04:46.410> but<00:04:46.770> if<00:04:46.920> I<00:04:46.980> had<00:04:47.130> two<00:04:47.310> lanes<00:04:47.520> it

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
cannon but if I had two lanes it

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.860 
cannon but if I had two lanes it
wouldn't<00:04:47.970> hit<00:04:48.090> so<00:04:48.330> that's<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.600> reason<00:04:48.840> for

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
wouldn't hit so that's the reason for

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.020 
wouldn't hit so that's the reason for
that<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.740> guys<00:04:49.920> depend<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.400> your<00:04:50.520> tower<00:04:50.670> set

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
that you guys depend on your tower set

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.790 
that you guys depend on your tower set
it<00:04:51.150> up<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.450> is<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.900> most<00:04:52.080> appropriate<00:04:52.320> for

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
it up that is the most appropriate for

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.220 
it up that is the most appropriate for
your<00:04:52.950> base<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.660> yeah<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.900> can<00:04:55.020> see<00:04:55.110> this

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
your base and yeah so you can see this

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.860 
your base and yeah so you can see this
is<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.380> townhall<00:04:55.620> setup<00:04:56.040> for<00:04:56.190> level<00:04:56.370> 12<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.870> 13

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
is a townhall setup for level 12 and 13

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.820 
is a townhall setup for level 12 and 13
is<00:04:57.930> better<00:04:58.110> because<00:04:58.410> then<00:04:58.530> you'll<00:04:58.620> get<00:04:58.710> all

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
is better because then you'll get all

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.050 
is better because then you'll get all
those<00:04:58.950> legs<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.400> have<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.580> proper<00:04:59.850> setup

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
those legs and you have the proper setup

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.060 
those legs and you have the proper setup
but<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:00.540> know<00:05:00.660> work<00:05:00.960> with<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.200> dot<00:05:01.470> jump<00:05:01.920> into

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
but you know work with a dot jump into

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.470 
but you know work with a dot jump into
