I<00:00:14.050> accommodate<00:00:15.010> it<00:00:15.100> to<00:00:15.190> my<00:00:15.310> new<00:00:15.460> body<00:00:15.640> very

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
I accommodate it to my new body very

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.700 
I accommodate it to my new body very
quickly<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.810> view<00:00:17.050> in<00:00:17.140> the<00:00:17.230> mirrors<00:00:17.500> and

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
quickly the view in the mirrors and

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.150 
quickly the view in the mirrors and
became<00:00:18.070> utterly<00:00:18.520> familiar<00:00:22.770> let's<00:00:23.770> go<00:00:23.980> see

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
what's going on

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.290 
what's going on
and<00:00:50.260> I<00:00:50.350> think

yeah<00:01:00.830> maybe<00:01:01.070> I<00:01:01.190> should<00:01:01.400> have<00:01:01.490> told<00:01:01.610> you<00:01:01.760> this

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
yeah maybe I should have told you this

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.450 
yeah maybe I should have told you this

during<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> days<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.830> were<00:02:17.130> disembodied<00:02:17.900> we

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
during the days you were disembodied we

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.410 
during the days you were disembodied we
kept<00:02:19.170> Hubert's<00:02:19.560> activity<00:02:20.280> parallel<00:02:21.270> with

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
kept Hubert's activity parallel with

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.930 
kept Hubert's activity parallel with
yours<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:23.010> now<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> first<00:02:25.230> time<00:02:25.700> we<00:02:26.700> have

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
yours and now for the first time we have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.900 
yours and now for the first time we have
thrown<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.510> master<00:02:27.960> switch<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.770> put<00:02:29.490> Hubert

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
thrown the master switch and put Hubert

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.160 
thrown the master switch and put Hubert
in<00:02:30.090> complete<00:02:30.630> online<00:02:31.320> control<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:32.250> your<00:02:32.670> body

in complete online control of your body

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.550 
in complete online control of your body
your<00:02:34.170> new<00:02:34.200> body

your new body

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.370 
your new body
come<00:02:37.560> again<00:02:37.970> talking<00:02:38.970> about<00:02:39.030> I've<00:02:39.540> decided<00:02:40.230> to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
come again talking about I've decided to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.010 
come again talking about I've decided to
call<00:02:40.590> my<00:02:40.770> new<00:02:41.070> body<00:02:41.400> portals

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
call my new body portals

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.110 
call my new body portals
by<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.590> way<00:02:43.800> what<00:02:44.220> happened<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.550> Hamlet<00:02:44.940> yeah

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
by the way what happened to Hamlet yeah

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.990 
by the way what happened to Hamlet yeah
he's<00:02:47.720> still<00:02:48.050> down<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.349> stud<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.650> guess

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.839 

show<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.660> something

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.289 

B<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.480> brain<00:03:00.980> inches<00:03:01.980> for<00:03:02.159> you<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:03.090> can

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
B is for brain inches for you you can

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.319 
B is for brain inches for you you can
switch<00:03:03.599> whenever<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.349> want<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.730> can<00:03:06.120> switch

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
switch whenever you want so I can switch

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:18.050 
switch whenever you want so I can switch
in<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.629> middle<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.989> sentence<00:03:07.439> right<00:03:07.680> right

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.870 

you<00:03:18.600> got<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> spare<00:03:19.410> free<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:20.569> prosthetic<00:03:21.569> device

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
you got a spare free a prosthetic device

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.190 
you got a spare free a prosthetic device
to<00:03:23.880> come<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.180> handy<00:03:24.330> if<00:03:24.569> anything<00:03:24.870> happens<00:03:25.170> to

to come in handy if anything happens to

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.270 
to come in handy if anything happens to
your<00:03:25.410> it

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.220

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
oh you could use your e-business fair

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.880 
oh you could use your e-business fair
and<00:03:32.070> function<00:03:32.790> on<00:03:32.970> uber<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:34.140> doesn't<00:03:34.500> make<00:03:34.620> any

just a little bit out of sync well I
don't<00:05:40.130> know<00:05:40.220> whether<00:05:40.370> my<00:05:40.729> brain<00:05:41.090> is<00:05:41.300> Hubert<00:05:41.690> or

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
don't know whether my brain is Hubert or

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.100 
don't know whether my brain is Hubert or
York<00:05:42.050> anymore<00:05:42.380> than<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.650> do<00:05:43.840> well<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:44.990> two
