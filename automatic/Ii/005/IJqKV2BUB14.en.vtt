00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
 made 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.810
 Paulo 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.820
 to test it 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.820
 today we are going to talk about protein synthesis 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:17.400
 katerine in the most important recipes that we have there in our being ours 

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:18.259
 body 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.929
 because the protein responsible public all the reactions that occur 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.609
 in the life of living beings 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:25.640
 for example 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.649
 It's the color of an eye. 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.879
 depends on whether it is clear with the dark amount of pequim - produced by 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.490
 river samba 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.790
 this procedure depends on air 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.950
 protein that is an enzyme that will reactivate the production of 70 m 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.360
 and the initial question of this class 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.360
 how to determine the characteristics of a month did 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.989
 all our features tristan 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.990
 our chromosomes 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.149
 we still have 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.949
 ribbons of dna substance that forms 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.180
 ours that one voice 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.270
 can go up to one molecule 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140
 formed by double lc 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.920
 double 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.010
 nucleotide chain 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.590
 a piece of dna we'll find the GM 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.850
 responsible for genetic information 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 this gene 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.920
 will produce a protein and that protein will determine the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 character was the characteristic of the species 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.859
 I dealt with it can be a teach 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.810
 attend the sessions 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.810
 respiratory and management 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.960
 of a cell can be a hormone like insulin 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.680
 participating in the process 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.520
 to maintain the rate of glucose in the saints 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.810
 intended may also be an impediment as the girl 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.600
 in itapemirim 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.970
 then as we have just presented the dna is formed by a double chain of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.940
 nucleotides 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.650
 but I believe that said are represented by the vacancies enter zeradas 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.050
 As we just saw, I've insisted on this a lot for you. 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.390
 to understand the next game in the room 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.009
 that is how this protein science machine occurs because to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.999
 where is mine 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:10.259
 translate 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.110
 genetic information 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.489
 it is necessary to establish a contact 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.600
 dna may have information 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.559
 and so it goes to have is that we are being saved 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:24.169
 this contact is made through what we call the genetic code 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.389
 the genetic code is universally valid for all living things 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.919
 and he is then represented percent of what are words 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 that will determine the protein to be produced where this code is 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.170
 genetic code we will find in dna 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.019
 so now there is important information for you 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.679
 may even have a sequence of barrels in paths 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.919
 but every three intended bars we'll find 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:55.909
 a cord 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.319
 this responsible cord then 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.999
 by the genetic information that will qualify with the same city 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:08.789
 is a protein it is formed by a chain of amino acids now every thousand 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:12.649
 subscribers only match the dna cord 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.139
 then I 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.920
 aliar that form words and these words that are the cords 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.330
 is that we will be translated into the ribosomes and at the time we go 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.089
 find the synthesis of our preseason 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:31.109
 now this is very complex and I have prepared a well-summarized 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.810
 you better understand how this machine works 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.629
 of protein production 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.659
 or would I be taking the steps of protein synthesis 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:40.480
 first part 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.269
 is our cell nucleus dna 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.669
 where it has the genetic information that information is contained in the sequence 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.459
 of the most inflated 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.159
 also the physical form through a process known as transcription 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.549
 entering well and air we are going to form the messenger 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.650
 details still messenger because it is loading dna information 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:11.159
 eugenics messenger he came out of a profit through the membrane pores in the believe 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.449
 who is going to attack attack 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.109
 goes to another sector with asthma 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.889
 in the cytoplasm the messenger connects loud and clear 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.620
 if amino acids are rising on earth 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.080
 these amino acids entered the cell after years of action 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.240
 their role seated and if someone padlocks the ribosomes 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.169
 to form the protein 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.210
 now how do we get the animals that come to us that we like 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.249
 they are loaded by the rna 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:42.729
 conveyor 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.500
 how does the rna amino acid carriers through 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.199
 messenger information
