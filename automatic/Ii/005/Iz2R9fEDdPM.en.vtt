00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.240
 reference to follow uno and good software 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.250
 if they played years of work in a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.290
 obviously you can recognize this scene 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.599
 which is if I remember well the end of 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.779

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.779

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.100
 melody in that kind of vehicle to the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.350
 which bothered him a little and I marcus 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.480
 asked to see that it turned off the good 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.280
 well here in the campaign of repercussions 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.010
 of years of women you can also hear 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.469
 that is a melody and with a reference 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.629
 also towards frames to hear it we should 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.969
 play section number 6 of the campaign 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.680

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.339
 we have to kill them all for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.140
 move forward to be able to move forward if 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 they put a fast camera so that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.060
 we have so much and once we kill 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.810
 enemies 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.890
 they will ask us to go to the kitchen 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.619
 here is the kitchen once we enter 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.039

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.869
