00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
UK plug on

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.970 
UK plug on
this<00:02:21.670> particular<00:02:22.000> one<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.020> then<00:02:23.680> we've<00:02:23.800> got

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
this particular one and then we've got

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.700 
this particular one and then we've got
some<00:02:24.340> other<00:02:24.580> connections<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.690> controls<00:02:26.320> well

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
some other connections and controls well

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.410 
some other connections and controls well
the<00:02:27.040> lining<00:02:27.490> connections<00:02:28.030> are<00:02:28.210> pretty

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the lining connections are pretty

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.120 
the lining connections are pretty
straightforward<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.770> where<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.010> going

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
straightforward this is where you going

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.460 
straightforward this is where you going
to<00:02:30.220> plug<00:02:30.400> those<00:02:30.580> cables<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.240> go<00:02:31.390> out<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.230> your

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
to plug those cables to go out to your

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.860 
to plug those cables to go out to your
computer<00:02:33.100> then<00:02:33.970> we've<00:02:34.150> got<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.270> volume<00:02:34.690> control

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
computer then we've got a volume control

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.460 
computer then we've got a volume control
and<00:02:35.380> also<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.190> base<00:02:36.700> controller<00:02:37.270> as<00:02:37.450> well<00:02:37.630> we've

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
and also a base controller as well we've

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.320 
and also a base controller as well we've
got<00:02:38.590> some<00:02:38.740> little<00:02:38.950> fins<00:02:39.280> here<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.940> help<00:02:40.150> with

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
got some little fins here to help with

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.510 
got some little fins here to help with
heat<00:02:40.630> dissipation<00:02:41.170> from<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.800> amplifier<00:02:42.280> and

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
heat dissipation from the amplifier and

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.730 
heat dissipation from the amplifier and
then<00:02:43.090> we've<00:02:43.270> got<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.510> power<00:02:43.930> on/off<00:02:44.290> switch

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
then we've got a power on/off switch

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.770 
then we've got a power on/off switch
down<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.100> bottom<00:02:45.630> now<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.160> audio<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.430> y'all
