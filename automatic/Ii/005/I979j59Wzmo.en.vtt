 summary of all the configs you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.670

 click on the bottom right to access 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.880
 the platinum config that she will be 1150 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.100
 euros I'm trying to do some 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 states can say from 150 to 200 euros to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.250
 each time doing steps 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 intermediaries it's a little bit 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.000
 complicated so the config of ahold that is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.980
 what will change compared to the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.899
 previous to the silver we will spend with 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.480
 a ssd have finally tasted the joys of the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.829
 speed of ssd we will also change the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.520
 graphics card we will spend on a 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.230
 model 777 gtx and bah of the coup we go 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.090
 align a little bit the power 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.370
 necessary in charge of food passing 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.860
 on a 650 watts I redo you a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.750
 quick short description 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.070
 we are always I repeat once of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.350
 more about micro-atx 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.760
 once again click on the case 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 if you want to see the full review 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.100
 of this case the cooler master m2 without 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.560
 I told you that we were changing 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.780
 of food 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.860
 we always stay shy'm brand cooler 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.500
 master always a diet 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.000
 modular we take 100 watts do not have on 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.590
 age and 650 m 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.840
 the benefits modular power supplies 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.130
 semi modular low and cable 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.240
 management of simply you have 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.979
 fewer cables lying around in your 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.659
 casing the air circulates better the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.119
 components heats less heat is 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.790
 better dispel so that allows for 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.820
 lower the temperature on the one hand and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.490
 indirectly say the noise since the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.130
 fans will turn less quickly 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.850
 we keep the same motherboard asus h 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.110
 97th still not out clicking on sight 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.079
 we keep the same processor the i5 4590 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.000
 haswell refresh 3.3 giguÃ¨re that makes 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.740
 turn almost every game even 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.100
 not all games not necessarily thoroughly but 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.450
 it turns all the games of the moment 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.280
 map level modification 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 graph we go to the next step 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.290
 with a 770 gtx there are a lot a lot 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.630
 on the series 17 xx born sept 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.920
 hundred and a few right now since 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.690
 new series including 900 to some 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.550
 have come out I really invite you to 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.800
 monitor all the offers 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.080
 who can go back to the internet on 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.410
 can find from 770 to less than 200 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.260
 euros 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.819
 so there I have I prepared fashion 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.430
 of course not the price that appears 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.530
 but here's watching all the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.070
 sites that reference the promos that this 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.019
 art etc 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.670
 there are really big things to 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.910
 do right now on the cards 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.910
 serial graphics 700 and quality one has 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.700
 changed the ssd finally we changed vcsd on 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.709
 added a ssd in addition to the hard drive 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.200
 western digital black still in 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.400
 internal we add a small kingston 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.660
 hyperx 3 k and 240 giga 240 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.910
 gigas and let's say that's the norm that 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.250
 tries to impose a little bit for them 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.630
 ssd have 64 gigas and even more the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.269
 to think about it we put almost nothing 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.090
 above the 128 knows if you play this case 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.239
 one or two games the idea is still 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.590
 to spend on 240 giga the prices have not 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.080
 badly dropped we can afford 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.640
 now 2 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.000
 to double the ability to pass on 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.470
 240 this model is there in memory mlc 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.710
 it's something very important to 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.890
 look for for ssd you have not 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.930
 wrong with specifications that are you 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.670
 described on the ldlc page of which you 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.210
 see for example between hyperx three 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.580
 hyperx ssd holds at the appearance 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.280
 the comparison by endurance on 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.080
 three years so it is guaranteed 3 years 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.990
 besides I believe or five years I do not 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.150
 remember you have all the all 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.330
 the technical descriptions of these ssd 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.830
 sequential reading rates in 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.480
 sequential writing and so on and 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.040
 caetera and I'm looking for I'm looking for the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.890
 Warranty time 3 years manufacturer 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.050
 that's what it 's written here so concretely 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.480
 here you are quiet with these ssd 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.620
 122 euros for 240 giga it is one of 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.700
 best value prices 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.250
 this range of ssd 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.600
 we are not sure of the ultra high 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.310
 performances as one could be with 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.650
 of samsung but we are still on a 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.590
 reduced price and concretely I do not think 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.000
 that you will see the difference if you 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.330
 content to play if you do not 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.470
 big big apps 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.770
 you will not perceive the difference between 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.140
 this type of ssd a samsung serves more 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.370
 powerful but much more expensive so 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.930
 these were the three differences 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.240
 main between config duhalde to 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.040
 1000 euros and the config bronze 800 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.160
 euros I remind you of the change of 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.480
 graphics card we go on a gtx 570 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.669
 adopting a ssd for the system 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.040
 operating and main games and 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.050
 so to make up for the increase 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.760
 of the graphics card an increase 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.620
 of power we take 100 watts on 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.230
 going on for 650 watts always a 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.950
 gold certification plus so that's 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.780
 still not bad 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.910
 I invite you to click now

 1150 euros I kiss you 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.419
