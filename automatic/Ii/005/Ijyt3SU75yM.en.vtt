 the man 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.189
 Of course it is with the Xperia for new ways 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.089
 Of all test candidates, the system tug offers the most diverse 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.029
 possibilities 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.970
 before the flight he will pick up tractors with the same standards 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.449
 here, however, is much heavier 13 point 7 tons

 Dexia wants and forwards has a rotating cab 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.330
 build unique in tow 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.140
 the construction space behind the cab can be used for vessel devices and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.350
 Semi-trailers are used in many ways 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.440
 alternatively there is the track also with centrally fixed cabin 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.309
 in another version, the cab is mounted on the last Wankel engine 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.280
 the all-wheel steering 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.790
 It makes the Xerion very manoeuvrable and sets glass in terms of steering and steering 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.030
 Tackle new standards Dexia BIL and has seven different 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.110
 Transaction types 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.320
 with the Hyundai then, for example, no trace offset so that the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.850
 Floor is not rolled over twice, little things is the difference 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.950
 make clear 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.950
 OK 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.020
 the missing 9

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.620
 his total weight 14 point 6 tons 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.200
 of which about 800 6 tons on the front axle and 6 tons on the

 rear axle 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 when used on the field, the weight distribution changes 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.170
 Depending on the growing area, up to three tonnes are transferred to the rear axle 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 the dynamic weight distribution is 40 percent at the front and 60 percent 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.520
 behind 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.099
 Shattering four equal wheels 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.099
 your ratio of 50 to 50 is optimal 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.959
 oec 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.839

 his case a child upwards similar to in the automotive industry at VW and 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:04.779
 Audi are both brands independently and Casey hair falls thereby the role of VW 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:10.309
 To say Caius wants to technologically where the car makers are ready for 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:11.119

 Incidentally, fourth is the inventor of today common rail system 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.519
 in common-rail injection, a high-pressure pump applies the fuel 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.239
 a high top level 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.700
