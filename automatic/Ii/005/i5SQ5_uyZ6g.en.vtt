yellow sometimes are called doll which
DAL<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.009> thought<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.940> want<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.480> use

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
DAL and I thought for this I want to use

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
DAL and I thought for this I want to use
them<00:00:33.690> because<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.079> cook<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.530> little<00:00:34.829> bit

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
them because they do cook a little bit

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.650 
them because they do cook a little bit
quicker<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.090> you're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> want<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
quicker so what you're going to want to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
quicker so what you're going to want to
do<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.110> rinse<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.370> lentils<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:41.399> should

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
do is rinse the lentils and and should

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.040 
do is rinse the lentils and and should
just<00:00:41.790> kind<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.000> check<00:00:42.239> them<00:00:42.420> every<00:00:42.660> now<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
just kind of check them every now and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
just kind of check them every now and
then<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.290> might<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.590> stone<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.430> can

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
then there might be a stone but you can

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.670 
then there might be a stone but you can
see<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> there's<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.870> here's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.590> guy

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
see it there's like here's a little guy

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.720

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
they're just split in half so give them

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.020 
they're just split in half so give them
a<00:00:50.520> rinse<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.440> cooking<00:00:52.860> times<00:00:53.250> vary<00:00:53.760> on

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
all of these the brown actually takes a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.970 
all of these the brown actually takes a

what<00:05:51.490> you<00:05:51.610> can<00:05:51.760> do<00:05:51.970> is<00:05:52.030> to<00:05:52.270> reduce<00:05:52.420> a<00:05:52.810> little

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
what you can do is to reduce a little

bit<00:05:53.170> of<00:05:53.260> sodium<00:05:53.650> is<00:05:53.890> a<00:05:54.220> drain<00:05:54.880> them<00:05:55.110> capers

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
bit of sodium is a drain them capers

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.960 
bit of sodium is a drain them capers
capers<00:05:56.410> would<00:05:56.710> be<00:05:56.800> another<00:05:57.160> option<00:05:57.460> so<00:05:57.640> it's<00:05:57.880> a

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
capers would be another option so it's a

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.550 
capers would be another option so it's a
really<00:05:58.210> this<00:05:58.690> is<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:58.870> base<00:05:59.140> this<00:05:59.380> is<00:05:59.530> a

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
really this is a base this is a

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.250
