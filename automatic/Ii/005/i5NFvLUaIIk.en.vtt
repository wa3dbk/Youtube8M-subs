first-time mothers because by so doing
and<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.300> increase<00:01:03.570> their<00:01:03.930> likelihood<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and I increase their likelihood of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
and I increase their likelihood of
having<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.739> c-section<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.180> there's<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
having a c-section now if there's a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.270 
having a c-section now if there's a
medical<00:01:06.780> reason<00:01:06.960> indicated<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.770> induce<00:01:08.070> them

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and of course we all do that as

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
and of course we all do that as
necessary<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.820> try<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.450> bit

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
necessary but I try to be a little bit

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.859 
necessary but I try to be a little bit
more<00:01:12.780> conservative<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.409> approach<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.869> love

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
