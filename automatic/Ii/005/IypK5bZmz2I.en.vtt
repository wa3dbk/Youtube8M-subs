00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
never really built a treehouse built one

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.830 
never really built a treehouse built one
in<00:00:35.650> four<00:00:36.190> just<00:00:36.400> got<00:00:36.580> but<00:00:36.940> that's<00:00:37.390> not<00:00:37.570> break<00:00:37.780> no

in four just got but that's not break no
no<00:00:40.840> I<00:00:40.870> built<00:00:41.260> one<00:00:41.410> in<00:00:41.470> a<00:00:41.739> total<00:00:42.250> miner<00:00:42.430> as<00:00:42.670> well

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
no I built one in a total miner as well

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.700 
no I built one in a total miner as well
but<00:00:43.090> then<00:00:43.300> for<00:00:43.960> some<00:00:44.080> reason<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.500> didn't

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
but then for some reason it didn't

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.750 
but then for some reason it didn't
record<00:00:45.010> i<00:00:46.140> click<00:00:47.140> record<00:00:47.470> bidders<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:47.920> unable

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
record i click record bidders and unable

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.080 
record i click record bidders and unable
to<00:00:49.350> capture<00:00:50.350> something<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:51.460> I<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:54.489> build<00:00:54.969> it

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
to capture something so I can build it

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.930 
to capture something so I can build it
then<00:00:55.239> because<00:00:55.899> I<00:00:55.989> I<00:00:56.410> built<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:57.219> I<00:00:57.640> thought

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
then because I I built it and I thought

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.790 
then because I I built it and I thought
it<00:00:58.059> was<00:00:58.149> recording<00:00:58.750> but<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.620> weren't

actually improve after the video like
they<00:01:38.590> might<00:01:38.740> look<00:01:38.920> rubbish<00:01:39.550> in<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.789> video<00:01:40.060> but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
they might look rubbish in the video but

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.100 
they might look rubbish in the video but
like<00:01:40.630> after<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.709> video<00:01:42.209> they<00:01:43.209> look<00:01:43.390> little

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
like after the video they look little

00:01:44.110 --> 00:02:05.100 
like after the video they look little
bow<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:44.679> looked<00:01:44.830> very<00:01:44.890> good

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.999 

I<00:02:06.720> didn't<00:02:07.720> even<00:02:07.780> know<00:02:08.050> why<00:02:08.289> fill<00:02:08.710> in<00:02:08.860> that

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
I didn't even know why fill in that

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.690
