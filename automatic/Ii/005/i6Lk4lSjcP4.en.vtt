00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:11.300
 with people who did not record the video 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.490
 for my channel a lot but today I decided 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.490
 make a boxing of this 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.450
 with the portable speaker and go 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.350
 I still do not know how it is, I only know that 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.860
 I'll just open it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.810
 and we are going to do it with 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.040
 The first thing I found because I am 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.030
 excited to see her 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.030
 fourth unit 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:45.680
 no more did he have more for that but 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.780
 if this closure is opened 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.790
 but I do not know why they put plastics here 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.930
 and we produce 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.360
 to see how this father 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.930
 ah 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 ah 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.399
 or I break it or what is enough 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.399
 we remove 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.030
 a little bit because I have the flu 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.190
 it's something a little meditated heat 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.600
 and why does not this mother open 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.600
 because it has more plastic 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.260
 ah 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.690
 You can buy this tape in the store 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.320
 super commercial that everyone can 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.320
 find 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.820
 I'm excited for truth 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.259
 ah 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.850
 oh dad 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.979
 uy 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:58.810
 it's pretty something sinister is beautiful and 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.810
 ligerita nothing happens 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.200
 It seems 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:09.329
 but we look like yes 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.329
 know what this is for what it is 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.469
 through your rechargeable battery this is how 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.469
 it works and it brings connectors 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.440
 to this one so you see try to sd for 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.690
 usb 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.910
 another cable when it is auxiliary and for 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.170
 turn on the turn off by the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.830
 catch them let's leave it aside 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.800
 this little thing weighs nothing and here we bring 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.470
 to the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:51.130
 usb cable with the input I do not know what thing 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:55.060
 the collection a control and tony gwynn 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.600
 the battery that seems to cell there 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.300
 between him and this one is to connect him to one 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.150
 of these which is for usb 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.700
 and that's how the battery is charged and I understood 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.470
 as overheads here and a cablecito 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.570
 assistant 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.280
 everyone does not need these to listen 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.150
 music 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.620
 and that's all the box is empty 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.240
 there are only instructions and warranty 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.730
 what 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.610
 what interests us is easy to learn 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.070
 use this thing we have one box left 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.460
 empty that we can use to 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.460
 save it 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.420
