00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
there see if I can find the code to get

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
there see if I can find the code to get
the<00:00:56.010> smiley<00:00:56.610> yeah<00:00:57.030> another<00:00:57.480> great<00:00:57.780> way<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the smiley yeah another great way to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.229 
the smiley yeah another great way to
explore<00:00:58.530> city<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.579> might<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.820> added

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
explore city I think this might be added

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
explore city I think this might be added
to<00:01:00.359> any<00:01:00.510> maybe<00:01:00.930> geocaching<00:01:01.590> event<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.219> idea

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
to any maybe geocaching event the idea

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.889 
to any maybe geocaching event the idea
is<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.670> they're<00:01:02.940> temporary<00:01:03.480> they're<00:01:03.750> not

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
is that they're temporary they're not

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.740 
is that they're temporary they're not
permanent<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.129> around<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.210> event<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.570> there's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
permanent so around an event if there's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.380 
permanent so around an event if there's
a<00:01:06.840> school<00:01:07.770> locations<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.549> city<00:01:08.790> that's<00:01:09.090> one

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
a school locations in a city that's one

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
a school locations in a city that's one
way<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> find<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.020> let's<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:10.439> inside<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:11.280> if

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
way to find it so let's go inside see if

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
way to find it so let's go inside see if
we<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.549> find<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> code<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.450> hale's<00:01:12.689> ales

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.200 
and the very first thing that I saw was
the<00:01:25.380> code<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.040> location<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.000> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the code for this location this is this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.670

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
right here see and there it is right

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.920 
right here see and there it is right
there<00:01:31.220> drinking<00:01:32.220> local<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:33.540> obvious

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
there drinking local very obvious

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.859 
there drinking local very obvious
geocaching.com<00:01:34.550> so<00:01:35.550> not<00:01:35.880> only<00:01:36.149> is<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
geocaching.com so not only is there a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.080 
geocaching.com so not only is there a
code<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.369> container<00:01:38.850> right

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
code but this little container right

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.280 
code but this little container right
here<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:40.110> actually<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:42.450> logbook<00:01:42.869> insider

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
here is actually the logbook insider

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.460 
here is actually the logbook insider
check<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.690> actually<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
check it out so you actually do have to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.920 
check it out so you actually do have to
sign<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.830> log<00:01:46.950> book<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.299> smiley

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
sign the log book to to get the smiley

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.130 
sign the log book to to get the smiley
for<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.440> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.190> a<00:01:50.310> great<00:01:50.490> idea<00:01:54.140> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
for it I think this is a great idea so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.169 
for it I think this is a great idea so
that<00:01:55.289> was<00:01:55.380> easily<00:01:55.560> found<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.880> idea

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
that was easily found I think this idea

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.779 
that was easily found I think this idea
has<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.360> lot<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> potential<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:59.520> will<00:01:59.640> be

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
has a lot of potential and it will be

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.029 
has a lot of potential and it will be
