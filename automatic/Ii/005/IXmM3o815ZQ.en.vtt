I can undo this and I'm doing this one
hand<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.979> might<00:01:29.130> take<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.640> little<00:01:29.820> while

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
hand so it might take a little while

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:40.069 
hand so it might take a little while
this<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.439> all<00:01:32.009> leather<00:01:32.640> bag<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:38.900> actually<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
this is all leather bag and actually the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.590 
this is all leather bag and actually the
style<00:01:40.350> comes<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.100> several<00:01:41.640> different<00:01:41.790> colors

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
style comes in several different colors

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.800 
style comes in several different colors
but<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.770> thought<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.060> color<00:01:45.450> is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
but we thought this one this color is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.859 
but we thought this one this color is
the<00:01:46.020> best<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.799> his<00:01:46.979> wife<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.840> she's<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the best for his wife because she's a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.700 
the best for his wife because she's a
little<00:01:49.290> bit<00:01:49.439> older<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.689> but<00:01:51.689> she's<00:01:52.170> still<00:01:52.500> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
little bit older and but she's still in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.550 
little bit older and but she's still in
great<00:01:52.950> shape<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.490> everything<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.380> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
great shape and everything so this is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.310 
great shape and everything so this is
what<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> back<00:01:59.070> looks<00:01:59.100> like<00:02:00.049> might<00:02:01.049> not

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
what the back looks like might not

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.109 
what the back looks like might not
really<00:02:01.590> show<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.369> great<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.759> my<00:02:02.880> camera

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
really show up that great on my camera

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.929

cause<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> lighting<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.369> bag<00:02:05.670> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
cause of the lighting but this bag is

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.550

actually<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.110> dark<00:02:07.619> fuchsia<00:02:08.369> color<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
actually like a dark fuchsia color and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.970 
actually like a dark fuchsia color and
I<00:02:10.590> love<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.490> really<00:02:11.910> cute<00:02:12.330> tassel<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.830> they
