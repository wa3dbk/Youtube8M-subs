00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
there's a number of topical steroids we

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.250 
there's a number of topical steroids we
can<00:04:06.489> use<00:04:06.700> we<00:04:06.910> start<00:04:07.150> with<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.420> lowest<00:04:07.570> potency

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
can use we start with the lowest potency

can use we start with the lowest potency
and<00:04:08.380> gradually<00:04:08.890> slowly<00:04:09.220> increase<00:04:09.790> those

little<00:04:12.130> steroid<00:04:12.609> as<00:04:12.700> possible<00:04:13.150> because<00:04:13.269> there

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
little steroid as possible because there

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.080 
little steroid as possible because there
is<00:04:13.690> side<00:04:13.900> effect<00:04:14.290> from<00:04:14.380> this<00:04:14.940> remember<00:04:15.940> you
