00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.360
 it's the turn of singing and dancing and the 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.580
 video with a bit of a new decor 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.010
 since unfortunately I can not anymore 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.689
 to make videos during the day 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.580
 falls too fast 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.529
 during the night falls too fast it's 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.060
 rather that so I try to arrange myself 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.740
 otherwise with artificial lighting 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.449
 I hope it suits you when 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.699
 even I'm coming to make a video for you 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.949
 you talk about little dubbed christmas 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.129
 garland is not it since despite 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.720
 it all approaches and I know it's the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.129
 period when we will have to make 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.300
 gifts in any case me that's it this 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.100
 year I tried to make gifts 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.479
 my whole family so here it is 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.769
 little bit of a war to find 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.420
 ideas for everybody so I get 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.220
 am told why not give you my 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.470
 little gifts so I'm going to do 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.299
 several videos one for women in 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.670
 general so may be your mother 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:53.080
 amount of your cousin yourself or 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.510
 your girlfriend if you are a boy a 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.440
 other for men so that's it will be 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.909
 a little bit more limited because 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.920
 inevitably I have fewer gift ideas 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.170
 but in any case, here I am I will bring 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.159
 my personal opinion and the little one 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.960
 little discovery 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.640
 and then finally I'll finish with everything 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.469
 who is for kids and so 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.630
 pet all because I 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.189
 am younger the people who make 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.500
 also gifts to their 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.090
 pets i hope this 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.630
 small series you will like and I start 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.399
 right now 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.229
 first of all the first gift of which 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.750
 would like to talk to you this is a lot of the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.969
 reference brand that makes promos 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.929
 for Christmas just mind-blowing if you me 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.549
 followed for a little while you 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.719
 know that I love this brand the brand 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.990
 reference is really my mark 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.520
 favorite in care john tested not bad if 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 I die are we still green towards 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.240
 this brand is really textures 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.590
 super nice hyper effective for my 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.020
 share so yes it's the products that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.299
 are quite expensive since this is 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.520
 a bit of the same range as clarins skin 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.020
 iq so you have to put the price 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.479
 for the quality but here I wanted you 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.119
 to share for Christmas they make 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.490
 so gohelle offers where they make two 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.380
 three lots I even believe for the body 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.329
 with a gluttony of skin so it's 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.729
 a big jar of exfoliation that I love 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.200
 super efficient and I did everything 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.369
 way a review on all products 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.630
 references to which I will put you in 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.569
 info bar that I did with my 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.190
 mom and who is at 29 euros 90 which 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.900
 is just 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.220
 nothing at all compared to that 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.360
 cost individually since I believe 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.920
 that I made to calculate it comes back to 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.500
 around 60 euros if you had 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.030
 bought individually while the c29 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.380
 euros so that's it really 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.120
 the very opportunity for you to make yourself 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.800
 pleasure that without you put the link to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.180
 arm of a fake that I was really holding 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.070
 to share with you because I know 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.720
 that many of you are tempted 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.430
 but are a little stopped by the by the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.100
 price so there I think it's really 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.050
 the opportunity to test then I you 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.300
 presents a rather make-up product 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.160
 since you've already talked about the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.860
 palette it's donald ace cosmetics that 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.450
 is a palette with a lot of makeup 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.510
 eyelids and so I said to myself 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.150
 for young or ended for yourself 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.700
 your cousins or girls who like to 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.110
 make up in general and that they are 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.940
 beginners who would like to have the choice 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.490
 and that you do not cost an arm 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.570
 it's really a super alternative so 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.850
 it's a palette that looks like 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.350
 these there are more than 160 lighthouse of any 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.910
 way on the site you have all the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.160
 all pallets available with 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.620
 full of different colors price 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.270
 different containers and I find these 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.120
 headlights of super quality for a 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.620
 beginning and for the price that's for 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.030
 beginners it's just the ideal and 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.010
 I really like this palette so I 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.570
 wanted to know you knowing 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.010
 that it's not cool I believe in 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.850
 around 2 29 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.870
 same 30 euros and for the price finally I 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.820
 think there's some for the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.010
 quality so it can be a very pretty 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.080
 Christmas gift also afterwards some 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.820
 something you've heard a lot about 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.680
 are the sun steve candles you see 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.290
 still who burn behind me ben 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.720
 here I know that many of you 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.100
 have been tempted and that's true for me 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.760
 I think it's a gift 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.410
 just sublime he loses warmth and his 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.989
 candles are really great honestly 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.730
 I did not believe it more than it did 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.210
 ok, it's still candles 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.240
 that one I burn it 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.160
 and for quite some time now 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.810
 I have that hot cider and it smells 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.480
 just apple it seems fair that 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.950
 various and I love it so that's the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.980
 moment I think a very nice gift 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.540
 it's a beautiful object are really 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.130
 very high quality candles 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.110
 do not hesitate to for Christmas to make a 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.640
 tour on the site are really very 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.270
 beautiful candles with novel scents 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.160
 original 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.020
 I know that it smells hot cider 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.660
 Apple the can is really about 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.520
 greedy but without being in 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.500
 Time is very subtle perfumes and 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.000
 I think it's worth the detour 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.770
 Then I will tell you about the beats 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.210

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.390

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.130
 I tested three for now 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.290

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.600

 filled super packed super original but 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.630
 let's say that these products are not 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.580
 do not look like and I think level 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.290
 value for money for christmas offer 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.480
