00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.710
 and jump our eyes does not matter if 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.740
 you have blue or green eyes or 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.240
 brown or brown or black or degrees there 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.250
 a series of little tricks that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.410
 you can do in the eyes that can 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 make your eyes stand out more and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.609
 there are some that are so all 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.769
 we know and others that I think are 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.539
 my tricks and 70 interesting is knowing what 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.309
 what do I do to have one more look 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 striking and that highlight more our 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.170
 eyes keep watching the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.190
 to do is use my bronzer I'm 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.559
 using the same one that I have put 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.540
 for the face and what I do is put it on 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.460
 a brush to blur and I'll put it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 on the eyelid mobile not all the eyelid 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.600
 benz but on the outside and to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.530
 kill a little bit the eye socket this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.120
 what he's going to do is give him some 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.070
 shape the eye and give it depth 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.899
 and I'm going to put the same bronzer 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.800
 length of the tabs below but only 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.800
 on the outside 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.970
 and the next thing we're going to use is 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.890
 a brown pencil and let's put it very 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.540
 very very close to the lashes above 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.430
 it does not have to be perfect just 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.080
 concentrate on the color being very 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.950
 near the eyelashes and what we have left 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.630
 no piece of unpainted skin 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.369
 what I 'm going to do is look like 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.070
 that we have many more tabs because 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.509
 the roots are darker now with 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.840
 a clean brush I will blur the 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.840
 colour 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.260
 and now we are going to use the same pencil 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.730
 that we have used before and we are going to 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.890
 put along the lashes of 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.720
 down but only on the outside and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.990
 very very very close to the root of the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.990
 tabs 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.750
 and that was a clean brush we're going to 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.750
 blur 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.070
 The next thing I'm going to do is use 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.450
 a beige shade clarita mate and I'm going to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.450
 put just below the lashes 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.609
 next I will use a 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.530
 illuminator and I'll put it in the part 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:12.000
 of the eye in the lacrimal and that's what 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 what he is going to do is give light to the look 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.440
 and now we're going that the best part of the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.239
 eyelash mask I'm pretty 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.769
 Specific to wear my mask 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.599
 eyelashes and what we're going to do is put 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.390
 the applicator on the root of the eyelashes 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.599
 and start spinning it to put the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.950
 more mascara on the roots 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.420
 I'm doing this all along 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.849
 lashes and so I make sure that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.410
 have enough mascara all the roots and 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.480
 then I'm going to start combing my 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.480
 to spread the mascara to the tips 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.610
 and now the same in the other eye 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.680
 once I have mascara on all 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.090
 eyelashes I return to pass the applicator 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.220
 to make sure that all 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.420
 tabs are separated 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.129
 and then I will do the same in the 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.870
 tabs below I concentrate that the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.459
 more amount of mascara 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.420
 be at the root and then I'm thinking 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.420
 every little hair 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.070
 and we have finished having videos 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.990
 own little tricks that I have 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.760
 taught do not get in conversation and I 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.560
 send a photo for that area or twitter 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.570
 if you see them tie you do not have to 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.280
 put you every day for more expensive him 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.590
 is in all these things but what I 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.000
 I do many days is parallel to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.620
 Suntan lotion a little to give you a 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.420
 little way not to the eyes and that 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.210
 It also highlights a lot the eyes what I have 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.070
 done is a little put all the tricks 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.570
 that I have to be able to highlight the still 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.570
 more but you do not have to do them all 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.100
 every day obviously and that's it 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.780
