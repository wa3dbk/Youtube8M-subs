00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.770
 hello very good to all my name is 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.110
 fury tense from version 0.11 point 0 of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.570
 minecraft and guys and then nothing to say 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.390
 that we finally have to isolate a lot 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.869
 in block lancer, it's going to be beta 8 and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.340
 it has let us go up a lot but the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.500
 problem is that it will not let go 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.780
 a lot because some of them are worth it because 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 some will not be compatible because 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.280
 since the blog launcher is in phase 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.040
 beta and then they will not be compatible 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.170
 then it's going to leave some so 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 Try those you like and Marist 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 put them and try it if it leaves you and such 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.489
 but then, well, nothing here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.930
 we are with the chaitén guys what 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.840
 I will leave in the description so that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.359
 download but well and let's go 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.300
 see the review as you are seeing is 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.840
 pretty simple is worth the creator street 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.000
 nine mouse and then here is everything 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.800
 it's been all the blocks and all 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.350
 the little things are worth what we can put of his 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.660
 rival or creative as you are watching but 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.820
 so be careful because what comes 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.220
 being the bloc launcher can you create us 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.770
 it's worth it 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.600
 it's in beta phase and it's not going to 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.840
 leave 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.880
 so installing some modes has given me 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.770
 class what they are being the chaitén 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.040
 sometimes when I play better I think it's 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.580
 but it does not usually go bad or it is usually 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.710
 put you usually work worth more guys 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.810
 forward they will take out a sub y nate in what 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.479
 it's been better and also more 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.170
 forward to take it out what has been the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.060
 official paddock and it will leave 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.890
 install all the modes that we like 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.960
 so then nothing to leave the mod of 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.869
 china and have the description and you know 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.840
