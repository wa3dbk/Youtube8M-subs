 as if you were butters you would park that 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.190
 even though it is wrong to be just here 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.840

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.860

 here four becomes a crown and that is 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.910
 the often also a bit 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.710
 oh yes in case of fire when if there is 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.510
 fire breaks out 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.390
 should i do this there is a triangle 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:00.700

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:02.890
 oh shit in here 10 tenths my room 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.060
 nice and easy to remember so 10 is 10 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.430
 the fire should break out here 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.120
 straight on and then you have to go yourself 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.830
 investigate 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.050
 just jump on it probably well 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.979
 not very interesting in my window and 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.520
 I said you say take something 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.100

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.440
 not really many sprays very spectacular 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.660
 All views tnt look that way 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.450
 but there can be our hope that you 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.220
 getting out about just yourself can go away 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.479
 but attacked by the curtain and 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.330
