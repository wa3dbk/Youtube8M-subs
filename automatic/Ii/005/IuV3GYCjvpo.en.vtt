00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 looks at an expression of the soccer law is that 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.629
 almost everyone knows clear leg of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 dude that player like that with internet 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:15.809
 You were a bad ball land. 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'm lose, it's never played well but now 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 only beach very good that good that china 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.350
 presents thank you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.320
 Look, we're just going to talk about a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.910
 selection of canned legs are robots or 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.630
 gunners and then had to have come from 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.630
 japan side, right? 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.460
 the left is not potent uprooted is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.070
 but despise the adversary 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.590
 can be dangerous 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.270
 after all, it is the result of years of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.190
 university of aichi province 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.469
 south central japan 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.690
 if the Japanese selection of flesh and blood 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.360
 Does not make cute in glasses 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.940
 here between the canned legs we have a 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.129
 time winner took the title of champion 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.719
 last month in the national tournament of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.880
 football for robots 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.140
 besides the dispute the objective of the competition 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.299
 is to develop the technology in 2050 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.650
 machines may face humans 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.659
 in a nutshell 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.400
 the students say that such a challenge 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.590
 it's still far 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.020
 we have to improve the balance the sense 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.840
 position and it is still not safe to have a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.090
 robot in close contact with people 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.299
 explains tatsui to each of the students 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.280
 responsible for this team in the competition 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.070
 it is here on the reservation bench who understands 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.390
 how all this technology each 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.130
 robot has two cameras one on the forehead 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.880
 another at the time of the mouth and with 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.590
 cameras 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.979
 robots can see not only 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.159
 the lines of the field but also the ball that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.619
 not by chance is it orange with this color 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.840
 it stands out best in the field and 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.680
 facilitates the work of all those 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.409
 players 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.320
 the lab has training campground 8 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.890
 meters by 6 shook Japan and the match is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.479
 good 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.930
 the striker advances towards the goalkeeper 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.060
 who first defends the play continues 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.560
 reinforcement arrives for the attack 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.340
 all this strange in the small area 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:20.890
 the gunner falls but here it has no sign 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.319
 he gets up and kicks in beautiful goal 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.989
 the ball stops on the line there is only 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.880
 push to the goal 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.160
 the replay goal 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.750
 but when the players become more 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.640
 they look like strollers believe it's in this 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.690
 category that the Japanese are 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.110
 surpassing 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.680
 with you the Japanese carousel 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.800
 note the accuracy of the passes 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.230
 The force of kicking down the camera o 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.470
 medical attention to detail 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.290
 each robot has four compound wheels 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.600
 another 20 minors that allow a 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.360
 move anywhere 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.910
 who controls everything is the computer that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.390
 watch the match by four cameras in 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.390
 ceiling and determines the action of each garment 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.220
 told us what we have developed here 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.490
 be used to perfect cars that 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.560
 they will walk alone believes the student 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.930
 The secret of kicking is a mechanism that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.660
 It looks more like a drawer opening and the 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.480
 coverage play 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.710
 laboratory tricks seized with 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.670
 real plays 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.630
 the question is whether machines are ever 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.630
 who are going to teach us
