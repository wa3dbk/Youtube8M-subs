00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the queen you are seeing now consider 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.170
 official descendants of the wild Bengali 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.340
 cats in nature they belong to the genus 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.830
 Oriental cats 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.719
 but they became home recently 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.139
 thanks to the hard work on 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.340
 interspecific hybridization of animals 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.590
 selective work for many years 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.869
 Jane Mill was doing American 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 biologist geneticist and just amateur 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.439
 1981 baleen murloc she showed how 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.679
 says their family and friends made 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.960
 first pets bred eighty 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.570
 in the third year, she risked entering 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.230
 an exhibition where of course it was taken violently 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.059
 ambiguous someone for someone against 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.140
 feared much about those cats and already in 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.219
 ninety first year 1 only may have been 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.399
 documented as 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.500
 The breed is very domestic Bengal cats 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.600
 similar to their wild relatives and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.620
 even their walk is squat 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 prowling 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 the breed creator's idea was to 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.530
 show people 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.080
 how beautiful can be wild 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.299
 nature at home however 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.939
 similarity to predatory relatives not only 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.750
 external home pingala is also insane 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.710
 love water and green vegetation they 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.240
 love nature 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.960
 they love the space they have to walk 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.450
 on the street 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.729
 it is necessary to release periodically though 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.250
 would it be more if less 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.990
 degrees it was here they love 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.799
 territory is not small 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.710
 fettered 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.820
 for this reason it is difficult for such cats 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.520
 keep in the apartment 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.860
 they need the space of a private house more 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.689
 In addition, there is another nuance that is worth 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.630
 take into account those who decided to start yourself 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.240
 male bengal he is guaranteed to be 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.220
 tag everything around coming back because 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.270
 wild blood but in the wild it's the same 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.079
 very important territory all marked here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.990
 and they have a particularly intense smell at the label 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.460
 this one again about this 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.460
 wildness once again confirms that this 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.320
 nuance such there is such a pet 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.990
 not everyone will choose 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.570
 many people have a wild appearance even scared 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.970
 need to be a fan of predatory cats 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.510
 to feel the beauty of Bengali 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.150
 cats 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.030
 and meanwhile, about the intelligence and ingenuity of these 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.550
 animals can talk for hours they 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.850
 get along well with children and never 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.190
 show aggression to man for 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.930
 a few minutes is difficult to fully describe 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.670
 this breed 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.350
 Bengal cats conquer their grace 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.870
 movements and gaze 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.600
 as if given the opportunity to look in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.670
 keyhole kindergarten world in which 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.670
 seemingly no place for man
