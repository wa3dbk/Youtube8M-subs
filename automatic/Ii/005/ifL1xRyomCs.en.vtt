smooth so I thought ok no problem i do
the<00:01:37.229> same<00:01:37.439> i<00:01:37.619> put<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.369> gladder<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.759> same<00:01:38.970> spot

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the same i put my gladder on same spot

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
the same i put my gladder on same spot
he<00:01:39.630> went<00:01:39.840> away<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.619> flying<00:01:40.829> far

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
he went away but it was not flying far

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100 
he went away but it was not flying far
so<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> thought<00:01:41.520> ok<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.570> five<00:01:42.780> minutes<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
so I thought ok I have five minutes to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.319 
so I thought ok I have five minutes to
take<00:01:43.200> off<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.799> everything<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.759> ready<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
take off and go everything was ready I

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270 
take off and go everything was ready I
was<00:01:45.479> relaxed<00:01:45.990> happy<00:01:46.590> about<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.040> flying

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
was relaxed happy about the flying

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.569 
was relaxed happy about the flying
conditions<00:01:47.880> everything<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.360> great<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.579> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
conditions everything was great and I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.850 
conditions everything was great and I
try<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.479> invade<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> glider<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> glider

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
try to invade the glider and the glider

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.530 
try to invade the glider and the glider
came<00:01:53.130> above<00:01:53.340> me<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> wind<00:01:54.270> was<00:01:54.329> really

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
came above me but the wind was really

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
came above me but the wind was really
sketchy<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.920> old<00:01:56.070> glider<00:01:56.280> went<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.640> little

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
sketchy and the old glider went a little

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.310 
sketchy and the old glider went a little
bit<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.329> didn't<00:01:57.600> really<00:01:57.630> want<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.140> fly

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
bit like it didn't really want to fly

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.800 
bit like it didn't really want to fly
but<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> was<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> hole<00:01:59.700> already<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.780> I

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
but I was in the hole already so I

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740 
but I was in the hole already so I
turned<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.409> turn<00:02:01.740> around<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.219> kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.270> jump

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
turned I turn around and kind of jump

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.859 
turned I turn around and kind of jump
into<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.590> take<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.509> didn't<00:02:06.750> really

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
into it to take off and it didn't really

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.589 
into it to take off and it didn't really
go<00:02:06.990> am<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.680> glad<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.890> felt<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> back<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
go am I glad I felt in the back and I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.979 
go am I glad I felt in the back and I
felt<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> face<00:02:10.520> basically<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.180> hit

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
felt in the face basically so I I hit

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.949 
felt in the face basically so I I hit
the<00:02:13.110> ground<00:02:13.260> once<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.670> when<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> knew<00:02:15.930> I

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the ground once and then when I knew I

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.809 
the ground once and then when I knew I
was<00:02:16.260> going<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> go<00:02:16.680> down<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> pulled<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.610> brake

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
was going to go down I pulled the brake

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.960 
was going to go down I pulled the brake
really<00:02:18.120> far<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.720> food<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.709> pulled<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> brake

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
really far like food I pulled the brake

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.420 
really far like food I pulled the brake
fully<00:02:21.239> on<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.770> glider<00:02:22.980> went<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
fully on and so the glider went on the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.640 
fully on and so the glider went on the
ground<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.050> hopefully<00:02:25.050> basically<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
ground and hopefully basically the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.949 
ground and hopefully basically the
lighter<00:02:25.860> saved<00:02:26.160> me<00:02:26.310> because<00:02:26.459> he<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.390> was<00:02:27.540> went

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
lighter saved me because he it was went

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.729 
lighter saved me because he it was went
into<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> rocks<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:29.700> jumped<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.300> first

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
into the rocks and I jumped the first

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.949 
into the rocks and I jumped the first
steep<00:02:31.739> face<00:02:32.040> rocky<00:02:32.459> face<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.450> felt<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
steep face rocky face and I felt on the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.660 
steep face rocky face and I felt on the
ground<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> bottom<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.220> rocky<00:02:35.459> face

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
ground at the bottom of that rocky face

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.369 
ground at the bottom of that rocky face
maybe<00:02:36.769> 10<00:02:37.769> meter<00:02:37.980> or<00:02:38.190> something<00:02:38.519> not<00:02:38.700> not<00:02:39.379> not
