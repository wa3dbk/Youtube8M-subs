00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.309 

synthetic<00:00:05.730> diamonds<00:00:06.180> aren't<00:00:06.330> fake<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.960> as

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
synthetic diamonds aren't fake in as

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.140 
synthetic diamonds aren't fake in as
much<00:00:07.529> as<00:00:07.710> they're<00:00:07.859> made<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.189> pure<00:00:08.429> carbon<00:00:08.730> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
much as they're made of pure carbon the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.450 
much as they're made of pure carbon the
same<00:00:09.360> as<00:00:09.570> natural<00:00:09.929> diamonds<00:00:10.170> I'm<00:00:11.010> here<00:00:11.309> with

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
same as natural diamonds I'm here with

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.120 
same as natural diamonds I'm here with
dr.<00:00:11.490> mark<00:00:11.969> newton<00:00:12.269> mark<00:00:13.230> how<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.920> tell

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
dr. mark newton mark how can you tell

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.770 
dr. mark newton mark how can you tell
the<00:00:14.280> difference<00:00:14.309> between<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.150> synthetic

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
the difference between a synthetic

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.290 
the difference between a synthetic
diamond<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> natural<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:16.920> okay<00:00:17.850> these<00:00:18.060> are

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
diamond and a natural one okay these are

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.420 
diamond and a natural one okay these are
all<00:00:18.570> diamonds<00:00:19.109> yeah<00:00:19.590> four<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> them<00:00:20.250> are

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
all diamonds yeah four of them are

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.630 
all diamonds yeah four of them are
man-made<00:00:21.060> synthetic<00:00:21.900> diamonds<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.519> is

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
man-made synthetic diamonds and this is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.340 
man-made synthetic diamonds and this is
a<00:00:23.670> natural<00:00:24.090> diamond<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> first

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
a natural diamond so the first

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.670 
a natural diamond so the first
difference<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.269> year<00:00:28.199> old

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
difference is that these are a year old

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.060 
difference is that these are a year old
months<00:00:29.220> old<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.269> probably<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:31.109> 3

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
months old this is probably about 3

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.310 
months old this is probably about 3
billion<00:00:32.369> years<00:00:32.550> old<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.840> fairly<00:00:34.230> typical

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
billion years old this is fairly typical

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.760 
billion years old this is fairly typical
of<00:00:35.070> synthetic<00:00:35.850> diamond<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.200> time<00:00:37.559> it's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
of synthetic diamond in that time it's

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.459 
of synthetic diamond in that time it's
got<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> lot<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.250> nitrogen<00:00:38.760> impurity<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
got a lot of nitrogen impurity in and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
got a lot of nitrogen impurity in and
the<00:00:40.980> form<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.670> nation<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the form that the nation is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
the form that the nation is
incorporating<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> diamond<00:00:43.200> gives<00:00:43.379> rise<00:00:43.590> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
incorporating the diamond gives rise to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.010 
incorporating the diamond gives rise to
this<00:00:43.950> yellow<00:00:44.430> color<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.390> doesn't<00:00:45.719> really

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this yellow color so it doesn't really

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
this yellow color so it doesn't really
look<00:00:46.379> much<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> natural<00:00:47.430> diamond<00:00:47.760> because

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
look much like a natural diamond because

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
look much like a natural diamond because
you<00:00:48.090> expect<00:00:48.390> natural<00:00:48.899> diamonds<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.410> be

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you expect natural diamonds to be

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
you expect natural diamonds to be
colorless<00:00:49.850> now<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.030> possible<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> produce

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
colorless now it is possible to produce

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.810 
colorless now it is possible to produce
synthetic<00:00:52.350> colorless<00:00:53.070> diamonds<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.699> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
synthetic colorless diamonds and this is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
synthetic colorless diamonds and this is
a<00:00:53.850> good<00:00:54.300> example<00:00:54.329> unless<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.320> kill<00:00:55.590> us<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
a good example unless they kill us as in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.900 
a good example unless they kill us as in
not<00:00:57.000> much<00:00:57.239> color<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> M<00:00:58.910> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
not much color but the M the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.459 
not much color but the M the
distribution<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> Imperials<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> way

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
distribution the Imperials in the way

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.290 
distribution the Imperials in the way
the<00:01:01.680> Diamonds<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.340> grown<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.969> very

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
the Diamonds have grown is very

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
the Diamonds have grown is very
different<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> way<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> natural<00:01:04.799> diamond

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
different to the way a natural diamond

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.230 
different to the way a natural diamond
would<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.339> grown<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.090> gives

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
would have grown and that's what gives

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.359 
would have grown and that's what gives
them<00:01:06.450> away<00:01:06.510> other<00:01:07.110> than<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> impurities<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
them away other than the impurities to

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.740 
them away other than the impurities to
the<00:01:08.460> Diamonds<00:01:08.880> share<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.600> are<00:01:09.659> other

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the Diamonds share there are other

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
the Diamonds share there are other
qualities<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> natural<00:01:10.740> diamonds<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
qualities with a natural diamonds you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.730 
qualities with a natural diamonds you
know<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.659> legendary<00:01:13.110> hardness<00:01:13.710> that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
know like the legendary hardness that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.520 
know like the legendary hardness that
diamonds<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.030> man-made<00:01:15.869> diamonds<00:01:16.170> are

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
diamonds have so man-made diamonds are

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.700 
diamonds have so man-made diamonds are
as<00:01:16.590> hard<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.900> natural<00:01:18.900> diamonds<00:01:19.110> because

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
as hard as natural diamonds because

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
as hard as natural diamonds because
they're<00:01:19.860> chemically<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.520> same<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.420> natural

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
they're chemically the same as natural

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
they're chemically the same as natural
diamonds<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
diamonds but there are it's the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
diamonds but there are it's the
distribution<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> impurities<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.470> give

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
distribution of impurities that give

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.440 
distribution of impurities that give
them<00:01:25.920> away<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.369> being<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.820> synthetic<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
them away as being a synthetic and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690 
them away as being a synthetic and
that's<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:27.780> easy<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.350> show<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> commercial

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that's very easy to show and commercial

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
that's very easy to show and commercial
machines<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:30.420> available<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.409> can

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
machines are now available that you can

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
machines are now available that you can
just<00:01:31.710> put<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> diamond<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.759> seconds

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
just put the diamond in and in seconds

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
just put the diamond in and in seconds
you<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.680> synthetic<00:01:35.159> diamond

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you see that this is a synthetic diamond

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.219 
you see that this is a synthetic diamond
so<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> took<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.750> these<00:01:36.900> into<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
so if you took one of these into a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
so if you took one of these into a
jeweler's<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> recognize<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
jeweler's what do you recognize that it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640 
jeweler's what do you recognize that it
was<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> synthetic<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:39.540> any<00:01:40.049> jeweler<00:01:40.470> should

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
was a synthetic one any jeweler should

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.260 
was a synthetic one any jeweler should
know<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.220> their<00:01:41.400> dime<00:01:41.610> did<00:01:41.850> natural<00:01:42.180> or

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
know that their dime did natural or

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.819 
know that their dime did natural or
synthetic<00:01:42.409> because<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.560> will<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.799> been

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
synthetic because it will have been

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.310 
synthetic because it will have been
supplied<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.549> them<00:01:44.700> by<00:01:44.880> somebody<00:01:45.329> who<00:01:45.570> could

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
supplied to them by somebody who could

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
supplied to them by somebody who could
tell<00:01:46.560> them<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.829> they<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> any<00:01:47.700> gem

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and just bring it into focus is a bit

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.680 
and just bring it into focus is a bit
dirty<00:02:33.490> because<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.850> use<00:02:34.000> my<00:02:34.150> fingers<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.630> you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
dirty because I use my fingers so you

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.970 
dirty because I use my fingers so you
can<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:34.900> all<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.020> spots<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.500> dirt<00:02:35.680> on<00:02:35.890> the

surface but what you can clearly see are

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.560 
surface but what you can clearly see are
these<00:02:38.830> different<00:02:39.310> growth<00:02:39.700> sectors<00:02:40.209> coming

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
these different growth sectors coming

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.140 
these different growth sectors coming
out<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.590> called<00:02:41.890> cubo<00:02:42.430> octahedral

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
out and this is called cubo octahedral

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.479 
out and this is called cubo octahedral
growth<00:02:43.390> which<00:02:43.959> doesn't<00:02:44.350> occur<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.890> nature<00:02:44.920> so

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
growth which doesn't occur in nature so

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.190 
growth which doesn't occur in nature so
the<00:02:45.640> seed<00:02:45.970> will<00:02:46.209> have<00:02:46.330> been<00:02:46.480> down<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:47.050> and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
the seed will have been down here and

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.110 
the seed will have been down here and
the<00:02:47.680> diamond<00:02:47.980> actually<00:02:48.220> physically<00:02:48.610> grew<00:02:48.910> out

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the diamond actually physically grew out

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.150 
the diamond actually physically grew out
in<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.840> matter<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.230> couple<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.590> days<00:02:50.769> from

that seat that pattern straightaway

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.770 
that seat that pattern straightaway
tells<00:02:54.040> anybody<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.450> synthetic
