00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
so it's coming from household

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.840 
so it's coming from household
collections<00:01:23.829> you<00:01:24.009> throw<00:01:24.189> your<00:01:24.340> bottles<00:01:24.670> out

in the recycling once a week and that

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.620 
in the recycling once a week and that
plastic<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:27.670> eventually<00:01:27.939> making<00:01:28.299> its<00:01:28.569> way

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
plastic is eventually making its way

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.590 
plastic is eventually making its way
through<00:01:28.749> to<00:01:29.289> our<00:01:29.590> often<00:01:30.009> start<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.729> what's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
through to our often start and what's

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.109 
through to our often start and what's
the<00:01:31.719> best<00:01:31.899> way<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.170> dispose<00:01:32.619> of<00:01:32.679> them<00:01:33.069> because

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the best way to dispose of them because

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.209 
the best way to dispose of them because
obviously<00:01:34.119> they<00:01:34.509> can<00:01:34.689> be<00:01:34.869> used<00:01:35.350> again<00:01:35.709> once

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
obviously they can be used again once

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.389 
obviously they can be used again once

that<00:02:47.260> full<00:02:47.500> gamut<00:02:47.739> of<00:02:47.860> issues<00:02:48.220> if<00:02:48.640> for<00:02:48.910> one<00:02:49.060> of

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
that full gamut of issues if for one of

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.390 
that full gamut of issues if for one of
the<00:02:49.239> fruits<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:50.260> was<00:02:50.440> available<00:02:50.650> as<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.130> fair

alliance<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.430> we<00:02:54.489> could<00:02:54.640> do<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:54.820> we<00:02:55.030> would

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
alliance and we could do that we would

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.780 
alliance and we could do that we would
look<00:02:55.510> at<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.720> certification<00:02:56.290> Noah<00:02:57.070> if<00:02:57.459> there

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
look at that certification Noah if there

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.850 
look at that certification Noah if there
are<00:02:57.880> other<00:02:57.970> ones<00:02:58.239> which<00:02:58.620> was<00:02:59.620> sort<00:02:59.769> of

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
are other ones which was sort of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.050 
are other ones which was sort of
something<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.370> might<00:03:00.489> have<00:03:00.670> been<00:03:00.700> certified

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
something that might have been certified

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.960 
something that might have been certified
to<00:03:01.239> organic<00:03:02.230> or<00:03:02.560> maximal<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.459> then<00:03:03.760> we'll<00:03:03.880> look

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
to organic or maximal up then we'll look

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.699 
to organic or maximal up then we'll look
at<00:03:04.090> those<00:03:04.269> schemes<00:03:04.600> as<00:03:04.840> well<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.620> it's

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
at those schemes as well so it's

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.920 
at those schemes as well so it's
basically<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.310> about<00:03:06.820> improving<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.600> base
