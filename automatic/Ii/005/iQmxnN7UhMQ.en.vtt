hey<00:00:03.909> guys<00:00:06.090> so<00:00:07.090> today<00:00:07.120> we're<00:00:07.810> getting<00:00:08.320> ready<00:00:08.469> to

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
hey guys so today we're getting ready to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.320 
hey guys so today we're getting ready to
cut<00:00:10.570> the<00:00:10.600> neck<00:00:10.980> okay<00:00:12.010> this<00:00:12.460> is<00:00:12.639> probably<00:00:12.910> one

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
cut the neck okay this is probably one

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.940 
cut the neck okay this is probably one
of<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.480> most<00:00:13.540> complicated<00:00:14.080> parts<00:00:14.620> of<00:00:14.769> this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
of the most complicated parts of this

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.800 
of the most complicated parts of this
the<00:00:15.759> necks<00:00:16.000> are<00:00:16.209> rather<00:00:16.950> curvy<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.480> there's<00:00:19.720> a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
the necks are rather curvy so there's a

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.679 
the necks are rather curvy so there's a
lot<00:00:19.960> of<00:00:20.880> interesting<00:00:21.880> cuts<00:00:22.150> and<00:00:22.390> everything

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
lot of interesting cuts and everything

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.570 
lot of interesting cuts and everything
has<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:23.020> be<00:00:23.140> in<00:00:23.170> exactly<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.830> right<00:00:23.949> place<00:00:24.279> I

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
has to be in exactly the right place I

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.910 
has to be in exactly the right place I
just<00:00:24.970> remember<00:00:25.689> when<00:00:25.930> we<00:00:26.050> first<00:00:26.350> started<00:00:26.769> this

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
just remember when we first started this

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.560 
just remember when we first started this
that<00:00:27.189> we<00:00:27.490> had<00:00:27.609> to<00:00:27.670> account<00:00:27.939> for<00:00:28.119> a<00:00:28.300> lot<00:00:28.539> of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
that we had to account for a lot of

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.109 
that we had to account for a lot of
different<00:00:28.840> aspects<00:00:29.650> well<00:00:30.430> everything's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
different aspects well everything's

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.470 
different aspects well everything's
based<00:00:31.390> off<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.840> length<00:00:32.050> of<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.320> scale<00:00:32.879> so<00:00:33.879> in

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
based off the length of the scale so in

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.389 
based off the length of the scale so in
our<00:00:34.600> case<00:00:34.840> we're<00:00:35.080> working<00:00:35.110> with<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.620> 23<00:00:36.370> inch

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
our case we're working with a 23 inch

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.440 
our case we're working with a 23 inch
scale<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.270> that<00:00:37.300> refers<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:38.460> how<00:00:39.460> long<00:00:39.700> the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
scale and that refers to how long the

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.590 
scale and that refers to how long the
strings<00:00:40.840> are<00:00:41.050> allowed<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.530> be<00:00:41.820> from<00:00:42.820> where

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
strings are allowed to be from where

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.319 
strings are allowed to be from where
they<00:00:43.750> touch<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.469> nut<00:00:44.710> there<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:46.090> where<00:00:46.210> they

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
they touch the nut there to where they

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.670 
they touch the nut there to where they
touch<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.750> bridge<00:00:46.989> here<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:50.230> can<00:00:50.379> see<00:00:50.649> I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
touch the bridge here and you can see I

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.979 
touch the bridge here and you can see I
put<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.070> tape<00:00:51.280> measure<00:00:51.460> down<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:52.870> can

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
put the tape measure down and you can

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.119 
put the tape measure down and you can
see<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.289> indeed<00:00:53.649> this<00:00:55.170> guitar<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.350> at<00:00:56.500> 23

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
see that indeed this guitar is at 23

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.670 
see that indeed this guitar is at 23
inches<00:00:58.079> ago<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:01.239> right<00:01:01.300> so<00:01:01.629> how<00:01:02.230> do<00:01:02.289> we<00:01:02.410> get

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
inches ago all right so how do we get

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.920 
inches ago all right so how do we get
the<00:01:02.980> rest<00:01:03.190> of<00:01:03.399> it<00:01:03.520> off<00:01:03.699> of<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.149> well<00:01:04.509> we<00:01:04.780> know

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
the rest of it off of that well we know

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.210 
the rest of it off of that well we know
this<00:01:05.199> point<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:07.000> we<00:01:07.149> know<00:01:07.270> this<00:01:07.479> point<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:09.100> we

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
this point and we know this point but we

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.830 
this point and we know this point but we
need<00:01:09.369> to<00:01:09.460> figure<00:01:09.640> out<00:01:09.850> where<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.330> box<00:01:10.540> goes

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
need to figure out where the box goes

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.800 
need to figure out where the box goes
mm-hmm<00:01:11.820> everything<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.150> do<00:01:13.270> changes

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
mm-hmm everything that you do changes

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.830 
mm-hmm everything that you do changes
the<00:01:13.990> sound<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:16.150> height<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.720> bridge

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
the sound and the height of the bridge

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.560 
the sound and the height of the bridge
changes<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.619> sound<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.189> distance<00:01:18.580> from<00:01:19.390> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
changes the sound the distance from the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.410 
changes the sound the distance from the
bridge<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.310> tailpiece<00:01:21.790> changes<00:01:22.299> the

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
bridge to the tailpiece changes the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.590 
bridge to the tailpiece changes the
sound<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:23.560> position<00:01:24.009> of<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.220> bridge<00:01:24.460> on<00:01:25.270> the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
sound the position of the bridge on the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.590 
sound the position of the bridge on the
Box<00:01:25.950> changes<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.100> sound<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:28.030> position<00:01:28.479> of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
Box changes the sound the position of

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.240 
Box changes the sound the position of
the<00:01:28.659> bridge<00:01:28.900> relative<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.799> sound<00:01:30.040> hole

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
the bridge relative to the sound hole

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.080 
the bridge relative to the sound hole
changes<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.820> sound<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.520> getting<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:34.000> this

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
changes the sound so getting to this

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.429 
changes the sound so getting to this
point<00:01:34.390> took<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.049> little<00:01:35.229> bit<00:01:35.380> of

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
point took a little bit of

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.249 
point took a little bit of
experimentation<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:36.729> what<00:01:37.060> we<00:01:37.150> have<00:01:37.360> here<00:01:37.390> is

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
experimentation so what we have here is

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.499 
experimentation so what we have here is
one<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.590> our<00:01:38.680> tail<00:01:38.920> pieces<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.939> bottom<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.390> it

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
one of our tail pieces the bottom of it

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.730 
one of our tail pieces the bottom of it
is<00:01:41.579> one-inch<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.329> sets<00:01:43.600> right<00:01:44.170> up<00:01:44.320> against

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
is one-inch and it sets right up against

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.280 
is one-inch and it sets right up against
the<00:01:44.860> inside<00:01:45.009> of<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.460> box<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:46.420> when<00:01:46.869> we're<00:01:47.140> in

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
the inside of the box so when we're in

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.730 
the inside of the box so when we're in
here<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.189> neck<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:48.939> in<00:01:48.970> place<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.500> tail

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
here and the neck is in place the tail

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.730 
here and the neck is in place the tail
piece<00:01:51.009> sits<00:01:51.430> in<00:01:51.670> such<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.140> touches<00:01:53.409> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
piece sits in such that it touches the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.130 
piece sits in such that it touches the
back<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.159> box<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.790> we<00:01:55.479> know<00:01:55.689> that<00:01:56.020> that's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
back of the box and we know that that's

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.440 
back of the box and we know that that's
one<00:01:56.439> inch<00:01:56.649> one<00:01:57.250> inch<00:01:57.280> from<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.880> inside<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.390> the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
one inch one inch from the inside of the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.899 
one inch one inch from the inside of the
box<00:01:58.689> to<00:01:58.930> there<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.350> one<00:01:59.920> inch<00:02:00.100> from<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.460> side

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
box to there and one inch from that side

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.090 
box to there and one inch from that side
of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:02.380> tail<00:02:02.799> piece<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.320> peak<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
of the tail piece to the peak of the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.660 
of the tail piece to the peak of the
bridge<00:02:07.090> okay<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.440> two<00:02:08.739> inch<00:02:08.950> yep

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
bridge okay so this is a two inch yep

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.650 
bridge okay so this is a two inch yep
and<00:02:09.820> then<00:02:10.209> 23<00:02:11.170> inches<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:12.129> there<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and then 23 inches to there so that

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.790 
and then 23 inches to there so that
gives<00:02:13.900> us<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.680> reference<00:02:15.220> point<00:02:15.370> up

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
gives us this reference point up

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.400 
gives us this reference point up
ahead<00:02:16.070> of<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.250> neck<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> know<00:02:18.460> where<00:02:20.410> my

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
ahead of the neck so I know where my

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.050 
ahead of the neck so I know where my
base<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.980> my<00:02:22.310> neck<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.090> now<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.510> know<00:02:23.720> where

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
base of my neck is and now I know where

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.000 
base of my neck is and now I know where
using<00:02:26.060> my<00:02:26.180> handy<00:02:26.570> dandy<00:02:26.600> template<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:30.290> point

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
using my handy dandy template this point

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.410 
using my handy dandy template this point
right<00:02:31.160> here<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.550> where<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.760> bridge<00:02:32.000> will<00:02:32.240> end

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
right here is where the bridge will end

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.490 
right here is where the bridge will end
up<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.620> need<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.920> put<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:35.180> 25<00:02:36.020> inches

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
up so I need to put that and 25 inches

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.630 
up so I need to put that and 25 inches
out<00:02:37.510> not

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
out not

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.060 
out not
I'm<00:02:40.640> putting<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> nut<00:02:41.360> 25<00:02:42.170> inches<00:02:42.590> off<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:42.830> the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
I'm putting the nut 25 inches off of the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.450 
I'm putting the nut 25 inches off of the
base<00:02:43.700> at<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.720> bottom<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.230> neck<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.740> that

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
base at the bottom of the neck so that

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.150 
base at the bottom of the neck so that
allows<00:02:46.760> me<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.000> place<00:02:47.300> my<00:02:47.330> template<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.890> draw

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
allows me to place my template to draw

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.460 
allows me to place my template to draw
in<00:02:49.490> just<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.270> head<00:02:51.130> time<00:02:52.130> tours<00:02:52.900> then<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:53.930> find

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
in just the head time tours then I find

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.260 
in just the head time tours then I find
out<00:02:54.650> where<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.980> body<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.490> because<00:02:55.940> every

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
out where the body is because every

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.340 
out where the body is because every
single<00:02:56.600> box<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> different<00:02:57.590> length<00:02:57.770> here<00:02:59.350> in

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
single box is a different length here in

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.000 
single box is a different length here in
our<00:03:00.530> case<00:03:00.770> for<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.520> box<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:02.090> 14<00:03:02.600> inches<00:03:03.010> to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
our case for this box it's 14 inches to

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.010 
our case for this box it's 14 inches to
the<00:03:04.130> outer<00:03:04.310> edge<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> box<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.390> that

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
the outer edge of the box and that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.630 
the outer edge of the box and that
allows<00:03:06.350> me<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.680> place<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.450> curve<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.780> neck

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
allows me to place the curve of the neck

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.270 
allows me to place the curve of the neck
where<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.790> meets<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.060> body<00:03:11.770> so<00:03:12.770> I<00:03:12.800> want<00:03:13.100> this

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
where it meets the body so I want this

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.300 
where it meets the body so I want this
curve<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.610> come<00:03:14.060> in<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.830> match<00:03:15.830> up<00:03:16.070> with<00:03:16.190> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
curve to come in and match up with the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.960 
curve to come in and match up with the
body<00:03:17.590> flush<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.239> that<00:03:20.420> allows<00:03:20.660> me<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.959> find

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
body flush so so that allows me to find

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.920 
body flush so so that allows me to find
from<00:03:22.970> my<00:03:23.000> nut<00:03:23.560> down<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.890> where<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:26.540> curve

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
from my nut down to where this curve

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.050 
from my nut down to where this curve
needs<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.560> meet<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.010> box<00:03:28.250> so<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:28.910> is

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
needs to meet the box so this is

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.760 
needs to meet the box so this is
actually<00:03:29.420> two<00:03:29.600> templates<00:03:29.959> so<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:30.530> two

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
actually two templates so this is two

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.590 
actually two templates so this is two
templates<00:03:31.310> they're<00:03:31.640> attached<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.180> each<00:03:32.420> other

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
templates they're attached to each other

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.860 
templates they're attached to each other
so<00:03:33.080> this<00:03:33.370> basically<00:03:34.370> stretches<00:03:35.090> virtually<00:03:35.690> in

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
so this basically stretches virtually in

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.800 
so this basically stretches virtually in
between<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.590> two<00:03:36.770> markings<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.480> actual

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
between the two markings so the actual

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.780 
between the two markings so the actual
process<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.410> marking<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.890> supping<00:03:40.370> involves

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
process of marking the supping involves

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.600 
process of marking the supping involves
clamps<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.480> pencils<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.280> measuring<00:03:43.280> and

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
clamps and pencils and measuring and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.729 
clamps and pencils and measuring and
whatnot<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.450> we're<00:03:44.600> just<00:03:44.630> gonna<00:03:44.870> do<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.470> and

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
whatnot so we're just gonna do that and

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.620 
whatnot so we're just gonna do that and
then<00:03:46.340> we'll<00:03:46.430> come<00:03:46.670> back<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:46.880> we'll<00:03:47.180> cut<00:03:47.480> in

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
then we'll come back and we'll cut in

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.270 
then we'll come back and we'll cut in
measure<00:03:48.590> whisker<00:03:49.130> monkey<00:03:49.520> measure<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:51.470> after

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
measure whisker monkey measure and after

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.670 
measure whisker monkey measure and after
I<00:03:53.020> don't<00:03:54.020> know<00:03:54.080> how<00:03:54.260> long<00:03:54.350> did<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.560> take

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
I don't know how long did that take

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.890 
I don't know how long did that take
forever<00:03:55.720> forever<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:57.440> UH<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.880> lot<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.450> measuring

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
forever forever a UH a lot of measuring

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.650 
forever forever a UH a lot of measuring
and<00:04:00.050> templating<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:01.209> double-checking<00:04:02.209> and

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
and templating and double-checking and

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.270 
and templating and double-checking and
whatnot<00:04:03.230> we<00:04:03.530> have<00:04:04.030> marked<00:04:05.030> up<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.890> entirety

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
whatnot we have marked up the entirety

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.830 
whatnot we have marked up the entirety
here<00:04:08.620> we're<00:04:09.620> gonna<00:04:09.709> try<00:04:09.980> an<00:04:10.100> experiment<00:04:10.840> we

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
here we're gonna try an experiment we

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.650 
here we're gonna try an experiment we
ringling<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:14.030> bit<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.540> holds

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
ringling the bit that holds

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.629 
ringling the bit that holds
the<00:04:19.030> Hilton's<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.930> an<00:04:21.019> angle<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:22.430> our

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
the Hilton's and an angle so that our

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.550 
the Hilton's and an angle so that our
strings<00:04:23.000> can<00:04:23.270> leave<00:04:23.450> it<00:04:23.660> at<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.260> right<00:04:24.500> angle

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
strings can leave it at a right angle

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.740 
strings can leave it at a right angle
and<00:04:25.130> then<00:04:25.190> go<00:04:25.880> up<00:04:26.030> over<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.360> bridge<00:04:26.510> and

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
and then go up over the bridge and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.770 
and then go up over the bridge and
continue<00:04:27.200> on<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:28.460> we're<00:04:28.639> gonna<00:04:28.730> make<00:04:29.600> that

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
continue on so we're gonna make that

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.860 
continue on so we're gonna make that
slight<00:04:30.110> adjustment<00:04:30.680> from<00:04:30.830> our<00:04:30.950> usual<00:04:31.130> plant

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
slight adjustment from our usual plant

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.600 
slight adjustment from our usual plant
and<00:04:32.870> see<00:04:33.080> how<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.350> works<00:04:33.560> out<00:04:33.770> hopefully

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
and see how that works out hopefully

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.850 
and see how that works out hopefully
that'll<00:04:34.970> make<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.480> stronger<00:04:35.900> actually<00:04:36.620> and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
that'll make it stronger actually and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.890 
that'll make it stronger actually and
yours<00:04:37.550> trade<00:04:37.850> secret<00:04:38.270> stuff<00:04:38.510> we're<00:04:38.720> not<00:04:38.750> gonna

did and stock here nut finger spot there
trade<00:05:38.690> secret<00:05:39.229> stuff<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:40.610> curve<00:05:40.850> where<00:05:41.120> it

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
trade secret stuff the curve where it

trade secret stuff the curve where it
meets<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.479> body<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.289> this<00:05:42.470> goes<00:05:42.710> inside<00:05:43.130> the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
meets the body and this goes inside the

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.590 
meets the body and this goes inside the
box<00:05:43.900> and<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.020> is<00:05:45.260> where<00:05:45.729> the<00:05:46.729> tail<00:05:47.360> piece

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
box and this is where the tail piece

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.980 
box and this is where the tail piece
will<00:05:47.840> mount<00:05:49.870> account

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990

the trick fit enable you to get this box
closed<00:06:02.979> through<00:06:03.979> that<00:06:04.220> thing<00:06:05.050> then<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.860> file

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
closed through that thing then you file

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.409 
closed through that thing then you file
one<00:06:07.520> today<00:06:09.610> still<00:06:10.610> quite<00:06:10.880> a<00:06:10.910> bit<00:06:11.120> of<00:06:11.210> things

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
one today still quite a bit of things

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.409 
one today still quite a bit of things
left<00:06:11.690> to<00:06:11.780> do<00:06:11.990> obviously<00:06:12.490> we'll<00:06:13.490> continue<00:06:14.350> this

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
left to do obviously we'll continue this

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.050 
left to do obviously we'll continue this
in<00:06:17.419> the<00:06:17.630> future<00:06:18.080> I<00:06:18.440> have<00:06:19.220> no<00:06:19.460> idea<00:06:19.789> what<00:06:19.940> we're

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
in the future I have no idea what we're

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.760 
in the future I have no idea what we're
doing<00:06:20.330> next<00:06:20.479> time<00:06:20.810> what<00:06:21.289> are<00:06:21.350> we<00:06:21.440> doing

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
doing next time what are we doing

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.730 
doing next time what are we doing
sanding<00:06:22.669> sanding<00:06:23.539> will<00:06:23.930> probably<00:06:24.409> do<00:06:24.590> off

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
sanding sanding will probably do off

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.000 
sanding sanding will probably do off
camera<00:06:25.099> yeah<00:06:26.060> we<00:06:27.050> have<00:06:27.140> to<00:06:27.260> do<00:06:27.380> the<00:06:27.470> glue<00:06:27.680> up<00:06:27.830> on

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
camera yeah we have to do the glue up on

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.050 
camera yeah we have to do the glue up on
the<00:06:28.130> box

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
the box

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.490 
the box
yeah<00:06:30.060> and<00:06:31.580> that's<00:06:32.580> got<00:06:32.790> a<00:06:32.820> set<00:06:33.350> so<00:06:34.350> I<00:06:34.380> think

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
yeah and that's got a set so I think

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.170 
yeah and that's got a set so I think
what<00:06:34.860> we'll<00:06:34.980> do<00:06:35.190> in<00:06:35.340> between<00:06:35.640> this<00:06:35.790> video<00:06:36.000> and

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
what we'll do in between this video and

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
of days from there it will take us a

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.190 
of days from there it will take us a
couple<00:06:53.700> of<00:06:54.030> days<00:06:54.180> to<00:06:54.390> do<00:06:54.540> the<00:06:54.690> finishing

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
couple of days to do the finishing

to do it that way and how of course
explain<00:07:01.890> how<00:07:02.070> we<00:07:02.130> did<00:07:02.430> it<00:07:04.310> unless<00:07:05.310> they<00:07:05.490> want

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
explain how we did it unless they want

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.030 
explain how we did it unless they want
to<00:07:05.730> watch<00:07:05.910> me<00:07:06.180> use<00:07:06.570> sandpaper<00:07:07.110> for<00:07:07.440> the<00:07:07.560> next<00:07:07.830> I
