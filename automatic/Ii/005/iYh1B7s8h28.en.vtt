hello everybody today we're going to

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.220 
hello everybody today we're going to
talk<00:00:02.580> about<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.909> digestive<00:00:03.090> system<00:00:03.510> and

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
talk about the digestive system and

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.710 
talk about the digestive system and
we're<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.560> start<00:00:05.009> out<00:00:05.310> with<00:00:05.850> our<00:00:05.910> study

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
we're going to start out with our study

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.390 
we're going to start out with our study
of<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.080> gross<00:00:07.259> anatomy<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.919> digestive

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
of the gross anatomy of the digestive

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.879 
of the gross anatomy of the digestive
system<00:00:08.460> by<00:00:08.970> looking<00:00:09.000> at<00:00:09.719> some<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
system by looking at some of the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.549 
system by looking at some of the
functions<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.730> digestive<00:00:12.420> system<00:00:12.559> so

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
functions of the digestive system so

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.490 
functions of the digestive system so
let's<00:00:13.860> get<00:00:14.670> started<00:00:15.389> making<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.839> list<00:00:16.260> of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
let's get started making a list of

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.730 
let's get started making a list of
functions<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.279> six<00:00:17.960> primary<00:00:18.960> functions

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
functions I have six primary functions

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.840 
functions I have six primary functions
and<00:00:20.270> I'm<00:00:21.270> actually<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:22.050> can't<00:00:22.470> help<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.039> have

tube<00:01:18.689> we're<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> name<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.430> parts

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
tube we're going to name all the parts

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.640 
tube we're going to name all the parts
in<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.030> lecture<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> draw

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
in this lecture but I'm going to draw

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.940 
in this lecture but I'm going to draw
you<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.860> picture<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.650> functions<00:01:25.650> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
you a picture of all the functions of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
you a picture of all the functions of
the<00:01:26.520> digestive<00:01:27.030> system<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.659> we're<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the digestive system and we're going to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.160 
the digestive system and we're going to
start<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> first<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.119> which<00:01:30.990> is

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
start with the first one which is

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.469 
start with the first one which is
basically<00:01:32.090> ingestion<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.570> food<00:01:34.409> particles

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
basically ingestion of food particles

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.530 
basically ingestion of food particles
into<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> mouth<00:01:37.610> one<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> jobs<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
into the mouth one of the jobs of the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.039 
into the mouth one of the jobs of the
digestive<00:01:39.990> system<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.740> ingest<00:01:41.159> food<00:01:42.049> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
digestive system is to ingest food that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.090 
digestive system is to ingest food that
makes<00:01:43.259> sense<00:01:43.500> doesn't<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.570> imagine<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
makes sense doesn't it imagine that and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.670 
makes sense doesn't it imagine that and
look<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.250> even<00:01:47.280> drew<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:47.909> you

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
look I even drew it for you

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
look I even drew it for you
guess<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.950> another<00:01:50.610> function<00:01:51.600> okay<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> have

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
guess what another function okay I have

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.300 
guess what another function okay I have
to<00:01:52.140> draw<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.500> piece<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.680> food<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.820> came<00:01:54.090> in

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
to draw you a piece of food they came in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.109 
to draw you a piece of food they came in
another<00:01:56.310> function<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.600> digestive<00:01:58.469> system

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
another function of the digestive system

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:07.280 
another function of the digestive system
is<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.990> digest<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.579> food<00:02:04.520> really<00:02:05.869> true<00:02:06.869> story

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
is to digest the food really true story

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.580 
is to digest the food really true story
what<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> digestion

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
what is digestion

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.320 
what is digestion
well<00:02:10.099> basically<00:02:10.780> when<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.870> digest<00:02:12.440> something

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
well basically when you digest something

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.610 
well basically when you digest something
you<00:02:14.330> break<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.810> down<00:02:15.020> into<00:02:15.440> little<00:02:16.190> err<00:02:16.640> parts

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
you break it down into little err parts

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.920 
you break it down into little err parts
how<00:02:18.620> great<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.220> look<00:02:20.090> I'm<00:02:20.360> even<00:02:20.569> going<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
how great is this look I'm even going to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.190 
how great is this look I'm even going to
label<00:02:21.260> these<00:02:21.610> ingestion<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:23.660> was<00:02:23.900> number

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
label these ingestion this was number

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.120 
label these ingestion this was number
one<00:02:25.360> digestion<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:27.410> was<00:02:27.620> number<00:02:27.800> two<00:02:28.099> I

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
one digestion this was number two I

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.940 
one digestion this was number two I
broke<00:02:28.519> it<00:02:28.670> down<00:02:28.700> into<00:02:29.209> pieces<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.950> our

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
broke it down into pieces in our

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.860 
broke it down into pieces in our
digestive<00:02:31.519> system<00:02:31.910> there<00:02:32.090> are<00:02:32.120> two<00:02:32.239> ways<00:02:32.840> that

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
digestive system there are two ways that

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.009 
digestive system there are two ways that
we<00:02:33.260> break<00:02:33.590> things<00:02:33.860> down<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:35.360> can<00:02:35.540> break<00:02:35.750> things

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
we break things down we can break things

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.270 
we break things down we can break things
down<00:02:36.140> chemically<00:02:38.290> or<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.800> can<00:02:39.980> break<00:02:40.160> them

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
down chemically or we can break them

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.740 
down chemically or we can break them
down<00:02:40.340> mechanically<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:44.860> says<00:02:45.860> mechanically

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
down mechanically that says mechanically

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.990 
down mechanically that says mechanically
of<00:02:47.750> course<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.140> does

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
of course it does

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.280 
of course it does
when<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.090> break<00:02:50.269> something<00:02:50.510> down<00:02:50.750> chemically

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
when you break something down chemically

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.199 
when you break something down chemically
you<00:02:51.319> actually<00:02:51.920> add<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.130> chemical<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.030> and

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
you actually add a chemical to it and

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.500 
you actually add a chemical to it and
the<00:02:53.420> chemical<00:02:54.130> breaks<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.640> chemical<00:02:56.060> bonds

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
the chemical breaks the chemical bonds

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.259 
the chemical breaks the chemical bonds
in<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.870> original<00:02:57.380> substance<00:02:58.269> creating

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
in the original substance creating

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.850 
in the original substance creating
smaller<00:02:59.810> particles

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
smaller particles

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.759 
smaller particles
that's<00:03:01.549> what<00:03:01.790> digestion<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.660> when<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.560> break

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
that's what digestion is when you break

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.070 
that's what digestion is when you break
something<00:03:04.040> down<00:03:04.370> mechanically<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.630> actually

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
something down mechanically you actually

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.150 
something down mechanically you actually
apply<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.890> force<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:08.660> break<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.650> particles

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
apply a force to break the particles

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.759 
apply a force to break the particles
apart<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.849> end<00:03:11.090> result<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:11.840> exactly<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.530> same

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
apart the end result is exactly the same

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.590 
apart the end result is exactly the same
you<00:03:13.040> end<00:03:13.250> up<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.670> start<00:03:14.000> out<00:03:14.150> with<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.390> big

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
you end up you start out with a big

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.449 
you end up you start out with a big
particle<00:03:15.079> you<00:03:15.290> end<00:03:15.470> up<00:03:15.650> with<00:03:15.799> lots<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.160> little

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
particle you end up with lots of little

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.880 
particle you end up with lots of little
particles<00:03:16.760> which<00:03:17.600> again<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.170> definition

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
particles which again is the definition

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.940 
particles which again is the definition
of<00:03:19.370> digestion<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:21.730> third<00:03:22.989> thing<00:03:23.989> that<00:03:24.530> happens

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
of digestion a third thing that happens

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.080 
of digestion a third thing that happens
in<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:26.239> digestive<00:03:26.750> system<00:03:27.579> I'm<00:03:28.579> going<00:03:28.880> to

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
in the digestive system I'm going to

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.830 
in the digestive system I'm going to
draw<00:03:29.329> it<00:03:29.480> in<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.750> different<00:03:29.780> color<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
draw it in a different color the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.180 
draw it in a different color the
digestive<00:03:33.500> system<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:34.370> whole<00:03:34.579> system<00:03:35.030> moves

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
digestive system the whole system moves

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.039 
digestive system the whole system moves
substances<00:03:37.190> through<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.569> it's<00:03:38.750> called

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
substances through it so it's called

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.530 
substances through it so it's called
motility<00:03:42.280> but<00:03:43.280> basically<00:03:43.700> you're<00:03:43.940> moving<00:03:44.420> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
motility but basically you're moving the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.949 
motility but basically you're moving the
particles<00:03:45.139> through<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.819> GI<00:03:47.060> tract<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.720> look

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
particles through the GI tract so look

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.740 
particles through the GI tract so look
I'm<00:03:48.170> going<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.650> draw<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:48.950> like<00:03:49.010> this

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
I'm going to draw it like this

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.849 
I'm going to draw it like this
this<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.930> number<00:03:51.230> three<00:03:52.239> these<00:03:53.239> particles

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
this is number three these particles

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.099 
this is number three these particles
move<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.850> I'm<00:03:55.970> going<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.180> try<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:56.600> make<00:03:56.780> my

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
move and I'm going to try and make my

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.349 
move and I'm going to try and make my
little<00:03:57.290> purple<00:03:57.560> particles<00:03:58.160> they<00:03:58.850> just<00:03:59.060> move

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
little purple particles they just move

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.160 
little purple particles they just move
through<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.840> digestive<00:04:00.380> tract<00:04:00.590> as<00:04:00.850> we

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
through the digestive tract as we

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.150 
through the digestive tract as we
examine<00:04:03.170> our<00:04:04.209> entire<00:04:05.209> system<00:04:05.950> we're<00:04:06.950> going<00:04:07.040> to

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
examine our entire system we're going to

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.849 
examine our entire system we're going to
see<00:04:07.489> different<00:04:08.120> parts<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.410> tube<00:04:09.620> and

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
see different parts of the tube and

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.140 
see different parts of the tube and
we're<00:04:09.950> going<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.100> name<00:04:10.400> all<00:04:10.639> those<00:04:10.790> different

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
we're going to name all those different

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.250 
we're going to name all those different
parts<00:04:11.299> of<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.690> tube<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:13.900> we'll<00:04:14.900> notice<00:04:15.230> that

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
parts of the tube and we'll notice that

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.840 
parts of the tube and we'll notice that
different<00:04:15.829> parts<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.280> tube<00:04:16.519> have

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
different parts of the tube have

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.219 
different parts of the tube have
different<00:04:17.269> functions<00:04:17.630> like<00:04:17.720> different

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
different functions like different

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.449 
different functions like different
things<00:04:18.260> are<00:04:18.560> happening<00:04:19.039> in<00:04:19.099> each<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.370> the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
things are happening in each of the

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.210 
things are happening in each of the
parts<00:04:19.849> but<00:04:20.539> we<00:04:20.810> have<00:04:21.409> to<00:04:21.590> move<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:22.010> food

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
parts but we have to move the food

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.320 
parts but we have to move the food
through<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.550> tube<00:04:22.849> in<00:04:23.120> order

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
through the tube in order

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.249 
through the tube in order
to<00:04:23.479> get<00:04:23.599> from<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.840> start<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.229> finish

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
to get from the start to the finish

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.920 
to get from the start to the finish
which<00:04:24.770> makes<00:04:25.039> complete<00:04:25.819> sense<00:04:28.300> we<00:04:29.300> also<00:04:29.509> have

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
which makes complete sense we also have

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.399 
which makes complete sense we also have
I<00:04:30.259> love<00:04:31.250> this<00:04:31.430> one

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
I love this one

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:38.140 
I love this one
another<00:04:33.409> function<00:04:34.250> is<00:04:34.629> secretion<00:04:35.629> and<00:04:37.150> it's

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
another function is secretion and it's

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.089 
another function is secretion and it's
probably<00:04:38.689> a<00:04:38.750> good<00:04:38.960> idea<00:04:39.020> we're<00:04:39.680> going<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.889> see

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
probably a good idea we're going to see

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.050 
probably a good idea we're going to see
secretion<00:04:40.789> in<00:04:41.090> lots<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.539> different<00:04:41.599> scenarios

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
secretion in lots of different scenarios

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.709 
secretion in lots of different scenarios
secretion<00:04:44.060> is<00:04:44.300> when<00:04:44.930> like<00:04:45.530> body<00:04:46.099> cells<00:04:46.719> this

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:47.719 
secretion is when like body cells this

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.619 
secretion is when like body cells this
is<00:04:47.870> familiar<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.469> you<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.590> know<00:04:49.629> epithelial

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 
is familiar to you I know epithelial

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.540 
is familiar to you I know epithelial
cells<00:04:51.430> lining<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.960> lumen<00:04:54.469> of<00:04:54.500> my<00:04:54.949> digestive

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
cells lining the lumen of my digestive

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.939 
cells lining the lumen of my digestive
tube<00:04:55.960> actually<00:04:56.960> are<00:04:57.199> producing<00:04:58.210> substances

tube actually are producing substances
digestive<00:05:00.949> chemicals<00:05:01.509> mucus<00:05:02.509> other<00:05:02.870> enzymes

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
digestive chemicals mucus other enzymes

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.540 
digestive chemicals mucus other enzymes
even<00:05:05.300> sometimes

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
even sometimes

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.570 
even sometimes
some<00:05:07.550> waste<00:05:08.419> products<00:05:09.020> are<00:05:09.139> actually

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
some waste products are actually

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.760 
some waste products are actually
secreted<00:05:10.580> into<00:05:10.849> the<00:05:11.300> digestive<00:05:11.509> tubing<00:05:12.199> but

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
secreted into the digestive tubing but

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.879 
secreted into the digestive tubing but
when<00:05:13.009> a<00:05:13.039> substance<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:14.500> moved<00:05:15.500> from<00:05:15.800> the

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
when a substance is moved from the

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.189 
when a substance is moved from the
inside<00:05:16.310> of<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.460> body<00:05:16.639> into<00:05:17.449> the<00:05:17.479> outside<00:05:17.930> into

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
inside of the body into the outside into

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:18.760 
inside of the body into the outside into
the<00:05:18.229> tube

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
the tube

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.730 
the tube
that<00:05:19.099> process<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:19.550> secretion<00:05:20.300> are<00:05:20.719> some<00:05:21.620> of

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
that process is secretion are some of

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.670 
that process is secretion are some of
these<00:05:21.830> familiar<00:05:22.400> they're<00:05:23.360> totally<00:05:24.199> functions

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
these familiar they're totally functions

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.040 
these familiar they're totally functions
about<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:25.039> thelia<00:05:25.279> shoe<00:05:25.819> which<00:05:26.330> is<00:05:26.360> what<00:05:26.750> the

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
about the thelia shoe which is what the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.309 
about the thelia shoe which is what the
tubing<00:05:27.409> is<00:05:27.590> lined<00:05:27.830> with<00:05:28.000> all<00:05:29.000> right<00:05:29.449> number

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 
tubing is lined with all right number

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.649 
tubing is lined with all right number
five<00:05:32.110> why<00:05:33.110> are<00:05:33.440> we<00:05:33.620> doing<00:05:33.949> on<00:05:34.099> why<00:05:34.659> digestive

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
five why are we doing on why digestive

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.689 
five why are we doing on why digestive
system<00:05:36.080> why<00:05:37.479> because<00:05:38.479> you're<00:05:39.349> hungry<00:05:39.699> your

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
system why because you're hungry your

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.269 
system why because you're hungry your
cute<00:05:41.000> little<00:05:41.180> cells<00:05:41.539> are<00:05:41.870> starving<00:05:42.560> and<00:05:42.800> so

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
cute little cells are starving and so

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.339 
cute little cells are starving and so
another<00:05:43.729> function<00:05:44.389> of<00:05:44.569> the<00:05:44.779> digestive<00:05:45.319> system

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
another function of the digestive system

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.260 
another function of the digestive system
is<00:05:45.860> absorption<00:05:47.139> again<00:05:48.139> hopefully<00:05:49.270> familiar

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
is absorption again hopefully familiar

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.850 
is absorption again hopefully familiar
because<00:05:50.449> this<00:05:50.750> is<00:05:50.900> actually<00:05:51.289> a<00:05:51.319> function<00:05:51.589> of

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
because this is actually a function of

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.519 
because this is actually a function of
the<00:05:51.979> epithelial<00:05:52.610> tissues<00:05:52.969> themselves<00:05:53.629> so

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:54.529 
the epithelial tissues themselves so

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.119 
the epithelial tissues themselves so
once<00:05:54.949> you<00:05:55.250> break<00:05:55.639> down<00:05:56.210> your<00:05:56.690> chemicals<00:05:57.469> your

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
once you break down your chemicals your

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.369 
once you break down your chemicals your
food<00:05:58.400> it<00:05:58.819> gets<00:05:58.879> digested<00:05:59.240> into<00:05:59.960> smaller

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
food it gets digested into smaller

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.820 
food it gets digested into smaller
pieces<00:06:01.330> what<00:06:02.330> is<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.629> point<00:06:02.839> of<00:06:03.199> breaking<00:06:03.710> it

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
pieces what is the point of breaking it

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.119 
pieces what is the point of breaking it
into<00:06:04.009> smaller<00:06:04.159> pieces<00:06:04.669> in<00:06:05.089> the<00:06:05.240> first<00:06:05.419> place

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
into smaller pieces in the first place

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.670 
into smaller pieces in the first place
well<00:06:07.129> your<00:06:07.639> cells<00:06:07.969> actually<00:06:08.360> cannot<00:06:08.870> use<00:06:09.289> the

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
well your cells actually cannot use the

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.040 
well your cells actually cannot use the
hamburger<00:06:10.190> directly<00:06:10.940> your<00:06:11.419> cells<00:06:11.719> have<00:06:11.930> to

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
hamburger directly your cells have to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.689 
hamburger directly your cells have to
use<00:06:12.169> the<00:06:12.319> molecules<00:06:12.800> in<00:06:13.069> the<00:06:13.219> hamburger<00:06:13.550> they

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
use the molecules in the hamburger they

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.050 
use the molecules in the hamburger they
can't<00:06:13.969> make<00:06:14.960> energy<00:06:15.529> that<00:06:15.919> you<00:06:16.099> can<00:06:16.250> use<00:06:16.550> out

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
can't make energy that you can use out

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
can't make energy that you can use out
of<00:06:17.389> an<00:06:17.479> entire<00:06:17.839> hamburger<00:06:18.409> so<00:06:19.009> break<00:06:19.250> it<00:06:19.400> down

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
of an entire hamburger so break it down

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.990 
of an entire hamburger so break it down
don't<00:06:21.080> leave<00:06:21.440> it<00:06:21.589> in<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.800> tube<00:06:22.009> because<00:06:22.550> guess

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
don't leave it in the tube because guess

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.839 
don't leave it in the tube because guess
where<00:06:23.330> the<00:06:23.509> tube<00:06:23.719> is<00:06:23.900> going<00:06:24.460> yeah<00:06:25.490> that

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
where the tube is going yeah that

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.719 
where the tube is going yeah that
direction<00:06:26.770> anything<00:06:27.770> you<00:06:27.889> leave<00:06:28.069> in<00:06:28.279> there<00:06:28.520> is

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
direction anything you leave in there is

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.760 
direction anything you leave in there is
going<00:06:29.360> to<00:06:29.479> end<00:06:29.690> up<00:06:29.839> in<00:06:29.990> your<00:06:30.020> toilet

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
going to end up in your toilet

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.579 
going to end up in your toilet
hopefully<00:06:31.490> it's<00:06:32.209> your<00:06:32.419> toilet<00:06:32.750> I<00:06:32.930> don't

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:33.589 
hopefully it's your toilet I don't

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.670 
hopefully it's your toilet I don't
really<00:06:33.709> want<00:06:33.889> to<00:06:33.919> think<00:06:34.099> about<00:06:34.279> that<00:06:34.399> too<00:06:34.610> much

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.340 

but<00:06:37.680> anything<00:06:38.069> that<00:06:38.100> we<00:06:38.310> want<00:06:38.930> we<00:06:39.930> better<00:06:40.169> get

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
but anything that we want we better get

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.740 
but anything that we want we better get
it<00:06:40.500> out<00:06:40.620> of<00:06:40.740> there<00:06:40.979> through<00:06:41.940> the<00:06:42.090> process<00:06:42.600> of

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
it out of there through the process of

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.809 
it out of there through the process of
absorption<00:06:43.880> that's<00:06:44.880> handy<00:06:45.300> and<00:06:45.800> then

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
absorption that's handy and then

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.350 
absorption that's handy and then
anything<00:06:47.819> that's<00:06:48.030> left<00:06:48.660> over<00:06:49.280> yes<00:06:50.280> the<00:06:51.030> things

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
anything that's left over yes the things

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.120 
anything that's left over yes the things
that<00:06:51.539> are<00:06:51.630> left<00:06:51.750> over<00:06:52.169> so<00:06:52.740> we're<00:06:52.949> going<00:06:53.069> to

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
that are left over so we're going to

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.950 
that are left over so we're going to
take<00:06:53.729> the<00:06:54.599> little<00:06:55.139> purple<00:06:55.560> squares<00:06:55.889> and

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
take the little purple squares and

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.659 
take the little purple squares and
anything<00:06:57.960> that's<00:06:58.139> left<00:06:58.410> we're<00:06:59.310> going<00:06:59.550> to

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
anything that's left we're going to

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:05.809 
anything that's left we're going to
eliminate<00:07:01.669> elimination<00:07:03.740> interestingly<00:07:04.819> the

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 
eliminate elimination interestingly the

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.839 
eliminate elimination interestingly the
way<00:07:06.060> we<00:07:06.240> eliminate<00:07:06.870> stuff<00:07:07.770> in<00:07:08.160> the<00:07:08.340> digestive

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
way we eliminate stuff in the digestive

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.439 
way we eliminate stuff in the digestive
system<00:07:08.880> is<00:07:09.389> by<00:07:10.289> going<00:07:10.639> poopoo<00:07:11.639> through<00:07:12.240> the

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:12.449 
system is by going poopoo through the

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:16.490 
system is by going poopoo through the
anus<00:07:12.900> so<00:07:13.800> literally<00:07:14.190> diarrhea<00:07:15.060> diarrhea<00:07:15.930> is

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
anus so literally diarrhea diarrhea is

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.420 
anus so literally diarrhea diarrhea is
awful<00:07:17.099> because<00:07:17.699> and<00:07:18.090> you<00:07:18.360> can<00:07:18.830> it's<00:07:19.830> a<00:07:20.009> huge

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
awful because and you can it's a huge

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.960 
awful because and you can it's a huge
issue<00:07:20.849> if<00:07:21.419> you<00:07:21.660> have<00:07:21.840> diarrhea<00:07:22.080> and<00:07:22.620> you<00:07:23.610> can't

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
issue if you have diarrhea and you can't

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.700 
issue if you have diarrhea and you can't
get<00:07:24.180> it<00:07:24.330> under<00:07:24.570> control<00:07:24.750> because<00:07:25.680> you

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
get it under control because you

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.260 
get it under control because you
actually<00:07:25.979> are<00:07:26.280> going<00:07:26.430> to<00:07:26.490> poop<00:07:26.699> out<00:07:26.820> all<00:07:27.060> your

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
actually are going to poop out all your

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.680 
actually are going to poop out all your
nutrients<00:07:28.050> you're<00:07:28.409> going<00:07:28.620> to<00:07:28.770> eliminate<00:07:29.690> all

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:30.690 
nutrients you're going to eliminate all
