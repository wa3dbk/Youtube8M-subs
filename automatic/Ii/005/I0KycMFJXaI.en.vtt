00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.360
 the activity of the pikes depends on 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.780
 several factors one of them is the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.780
 food 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.430
 this time in the reservoir where 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.650
 fished there was lack of activity some that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.950
 another ship was seen moving around the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.950
 shore 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.090
 this was the reason why I decided 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.600
 use a lure with the form 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.540
 elongated similar to the body of a boat 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.240
 an 18-centimeter floating lure 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.659
 that reaches a maximum depth of 2 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.659
 meters 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.080
 I realized after the second 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.470
 catch that the pikes were singing 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.360
 very close to the shore located at a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.360
 Depth of 2 to 3 meters 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.890
 most of the sets I made were very 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.340
 near the shore and almost all 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.640
 chopped were produced at 5 x 6 meters 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.640
 the shore 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.940
 two or three bites were a meter 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.940
 scarce of the shore 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.470
 In the middle of winter you can activate 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.470
 Pike and find a day with enough 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.250
 activity 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.350
 this intuit fishing day was the ideal 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.340
 to get some captures 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.420
 the temperature was high a little windy and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.420
 all day cloudy 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.470
 in these days the odd fish is 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.440
 active as was the case with the barbot and 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.709
 also the day when the nuncio is cloudy 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.990
 moves more comfortable in looking for food 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.790
 goes unnoticed by the absence 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.790
 of the sun's rays 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.310
 Without a doubt the stations of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.420
 Spring and autumn are the best for 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.150
 the fishing of the pike 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.310
 but we never rule out the days of 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.800
 winter that nature us 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.800
 provides propitious for fishing
