00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.050
 yes it started in london 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.500
 not so long ago 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.750
 then so much has happened since then and it seems to have lasted a long time 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.659
 eternity 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.009
 at that time 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.169
 and winter with our faithful companions in a bachelor apartment close to 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.130
 rule 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.869
 I still have wonders 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.869
 maybe painful season for celebrities 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.550
 the social Christian party enraged campaign 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.619
 three active managers mostly of pyre 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.570
 in hospital the Swiss relay 4 x 4 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.100
 my name is congo 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.800
 and trust me 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.860
 the press that his relations with read that singles hotel and in 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.470
 hour they have no worries 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.250
 he passes the claims the opposite 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.250
 I was bored remembered m 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 ker 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 m 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.890
 he wishes instead that my companion needed campaign 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.570
 she relies on three generations to stay single all our lives 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.660
 but with a passion involved we things m love songs of course 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.660
 while he did not know absolutely anything alarming 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.860
 for them he's smart enough for a human being 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.140
 I would even say that Roger is a pretty animal in his 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.230
 together 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.380
 we did not see why he would not have deserved to have a campaign 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.510
 sugar 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 and I had drawn and repeated 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.410
 created to come on the chains are not you just have to continue 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 belga a result that flushes out find them 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.890
 strange specimens 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 the ump should still 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.960
 surely not 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 scientists 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.750
 our world 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.750
 short-legged 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.279
 but yesterday 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.359
 every turn 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.359
 policemen and dogs 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.279
 but maybe too much paid expensive 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.919
 too much 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.809
 too old 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:31.189
 the problem 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.189
 it's a problem a problem 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.409
 indeed the one that is weaker 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.109
 but I love creatures 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:46.879
 roxy single strand of poetry 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.829
 the other 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.299
 the licra who are charged 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.420
 of unemployment could find someone else so that also charente you know 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.419
 I was looking for politics 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:02.319
 really i'm on the sidelines the place dreamed for a meeting 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.319
 I have always succeeded 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.909
 we work in secret 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.909
 it's going to be too much your way 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.200
 percent even for the moment 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.430
 for every hour that passes
