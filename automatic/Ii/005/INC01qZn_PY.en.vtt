encounter is that right yes seems like a

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.949 
encounter is that right yes seems like a
vast<00:02:26.530> area<00:02:26.860> that's<00:02:27.400> huge<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.360> actually<00:02:28.810> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
vast area that's huge it's actually the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.340 
vast area that's huge it's actually the
largest<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.799> natural<00:02:30.280> park<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.940> world

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
largest the natural park in the world

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.430 
largest the natural park in the world
and<00:02:32.350> also<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.250> coastal<00:02:33.910> for<00:02:34.090> service<00:02:34.510> for

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
and also a coastal for service for

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.640 
and also a coastal for service for
marine<00:02:36.280> mammals<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.810> think<00:02:38.110> because<00:02:38.230> of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
marine mammals and I think because of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.039 
marine mammals and I think because of
our<00:02:38.799> furnace<00:02:39.430> was<00:02:39.610> taking<00:02:40.060> me<00:02:40.239> at<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.570> area

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
our furnace was taking me at that area

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.330 
our furnace was taking me at that area
then<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:43.180> was<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.720> lot<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.260> concern<00:02:44.799> about<00:02:44.829> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
then it was a lot of concern about the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.210 
then it was a lot of concern about the
disturbances<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:46.959> inhabited<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.920> and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
disturbances to this inhabited and and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.180 
disturbances to this inhabited and and
what<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> may<00:02:49.570> affect<00:02:50.079> to<00:02:50.350> their<00:02:50.530> animals

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
what that may affect to their animals

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.760 
what that may affect to their animals
