says has to keep at this level because

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.300 
says has to keep at this level because
you<00:05:33.360> could<00:05:33.660> be<00:05:33.870> a<00:05:34.050> winner

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.180 

as<00:05:40.240> much<00:05:40.480> as<00:05:40.630> I<00:05:40.720> absolutely<00:05:40.990> loved<00:05:41.410> it<00:05:41.920> it

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
as much as I absolutely loved it it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.810 
as much as I absolutely loved it it
really<00:05:42.610> did<00:05:43.210> lose<00:05:44.200> technique<00:05:44.860> because<00:05:45.490> of<00:05:45.670> the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
really did lose technique because of the

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.610 
really did lose technique because of the
speed<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.450> think<00:05:46.720> that<00:05:46.900> hampered<00:05:47.470> the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
speed and I think that hampered the

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.159 
speed and I think that hampered the
whole<00:05:47.770> thing

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
whole thing

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.230 
whole thing
dancing<00:05:50.169> is<00:05:50.380> fantastic<00:05:51.070> but<00:05:51.250> you<00:05:51.280> were<00:05:51.580> behind

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
dancing is fantastic but you were behind

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.240 
dancing is fantastic but you were behind
a<00:05:52.510> lot<00:05:52.810> of<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.020> time<00:05:53.230> and<00:05:53.500> choreographically

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
a lot of the time and choreographically

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.070 
a lot of the time and choreographically
I<00:05:54.400> don't<00:05:54.790> think<00:05:55.030> it's<00:05:55.180> up<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.540> standards

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
I don't think it's up to the standards

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.659 
I don't think it's up to the standards
that<00:05:56.139> you're<00:05:56.350> normally<00:05:56.800> setting<00:05:57.190> I<00:05:57.280> felt<00:05:57.520> like

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
that you're normally setting I felt like

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.600 
that you're normally setting I felt like
the<00:05:57.820> choreography<00:05:58.510> was<00:05:59.050> just<00:05:59.380> stopping<00:05:59.889> too

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
the choreography was just stopping too

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.280
