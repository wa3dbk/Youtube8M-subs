00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.780 
going bad you get slated massively and
you're<00:00:13.019> probably<00:00:13.380> never<00:00:13.650> as<00:00:14.219> good<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:14.670> your

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
you're probably never as good as your

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.900 

and<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.349> think<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.710> team<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.279> brought<00:00:23.670> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and I think what this team is brought to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.420 
and I think what this team is brought to
the<00:00:23.939> Six<00:00:24.300> Nations<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:25.050> year<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.859> they<00:00:26.279> had<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the Six Nations this year was they had a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.220 
the Six Nations this year was they had a
belief<00:00:26.699> no<00:00:27.090> matter<00:00:27.270> what<00:00:27.419> the<00:00:27.480> score<00:00:27.689> was<00:00:27.720> they

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
belief no matter what the score was they

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
belief no matter what the score was they
could<00:00:28.410> always<00:00:28.529> win<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:28.800> game<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.270> long<00:00:30.419> as

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
could always win the game and as long as

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.390 
could always win the game and as long as
they<00:00:30.630> were<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> game<00:00:31.079> with<00:00:31.320> ten<00:00:32.040> fifty

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
they were in the game with ten fifty

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.160 
they were in the game with ten fifty
minutes<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> go<00:00:32.820> they<00:00:33.660> had<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> chance<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
minutes to go they had the chance of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.710 
minutes to go they had the chance of
winning<00:00:34.379> it<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:36.120> happened<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.480> Scotland

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
winning it and that happened in Scotland

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.799 
winning it and that happened in Scotland
but<00:00:37.199> probably<00:00:37.980> earlier<00:00:38.250> than<00:00:38.480> that<00:00:39.480> late<00:00:39.660> in

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
but probably earlier than that late in

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.850 
but probably earlier than that late in
the<00:00:39.900> game<00:00:40.019> and<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.350> still<00:00:40.530> had<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> belief

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the game and they still had the belief

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.610 
the game and they still had the belief
