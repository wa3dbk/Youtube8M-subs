which<00:03:50.769> gives<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.160> an<00:03:51.280> interesting<00:03:51.910> look<00:03:52.150> I'm

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
which gives it an interesting look I'm

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.720 
which gives it an interesting look I'm
sure<00:03:52.840> JB<00:03:53.320> tried<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.859> with<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.100> slightly<00:03:54.489> blue

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
sure JB tried it with the slightly blue

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.490 
sure JB tried it with the slightly blue
tinted<00:03:55.090> outsole<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:55.810> thought<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.320> this

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
tinted outsole and thought that this

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.530 
tinted outsole and thought that this
went<00:03:56.950> better<00:03:57.250> with<00:03:57.519> this<00:03:57.670> look<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.420> know

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
went better with this look and you know

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.479 
went better with this look and you know
what<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.720> can't<00:03:59.079> complain<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.709> just<00:04:00.190> looks

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
what I can't complain it just looks

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.310
