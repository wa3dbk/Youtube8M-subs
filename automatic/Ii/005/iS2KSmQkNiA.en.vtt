00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
blending that we did so just so we have

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.150

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and set the white liner with it so you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.839 
and set the white liner with it so you
can<00:03:10.109> also<00:03:10.260> deepen<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:11.069> outer<00:03:11.220> half<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.640> want

in preparation for the lashes so I'm

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.880 
in preparation for the lashes so I'm

half I'm taking the inner portion of it

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.900 
half I'm taking the inner portion of it
