00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
perfect sear marks in just a second I'll

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.360 
perfect sear marks in just a second I'll
get<00:01:43.870> some<00:01:44.020> vegetable<00:01:44.650> planks<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.040> there<00:01:45.220> we'll

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
get some vegetable planks on there we'll

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.370 
get some vegetable planks on there we'll
see<00:01:45.400> how<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.640> performs<00:01:46.000> vegetables<00:01:46.480> instead

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
see how it performs vegetables instead

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.900
