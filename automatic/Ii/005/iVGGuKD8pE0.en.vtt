was 60 well way before I completed the
story<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.500> once<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.250> do<00:03:56.489> get<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.850> 60th<00:03:57.299> it's

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
story and once you do get to 60th it's

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.390 
story and once you do get to 60th it's
not<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.109> were<00:03:58.200> out<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.470> content<00:03:58.980> they

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
not like you were out of content they

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.250 
not like you were out of content they
were<00:03:59.579> really<00:03:59.850> nice<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.299> got<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.660> to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
were really nice you got to to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.910 
were really nice you got to to
operations<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.359> I<00:04:03.359> think<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.720> was<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.930> four<00:04:04.530> off

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
operations and I think it was a four off

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.860 
operations and I think it was a four off
the<00:04:05.190> top<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.489> my<00:04:05.579> head<00:04:05.700> hard<00:04:05.880> modes<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.420> might<00:04:06.750> be

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
the top of my head hard modes I might be

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.870 
the top of my head hard modes I might be
wrong<00:04:07.079> so<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:07.920> definitely<00:04:08.280> got<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.670> lot<00:04:08.850> of

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
wrong so you definitely got a lot of

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.030 
wrong so you definitely got a lot of
content<00:04:09.359> there<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.750> do<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.170> as<00:04:10.769> you're

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
content there you do and as you're

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.180 
content there you do and as you're
leveling<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:12.120> 60<00:04:12.750> you're<00:04:13.049> getting<00:04:13.380> gear<00:04:13.920> to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
leveling to 60 you're getting gear to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.569 
leveling to 60 you're getting gear to
help<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.579> progress<00:04:14.790> into<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.570> content<00:04:16.109> so

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
help you progress into that content so

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.610 
help you progress into that content so
they<00:04:17.579> definitely<00:04:18.030> they<00:04:18.600> plan<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.140> expansion

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
they definitely they plan this expansion

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.800 
they definitely they plan this expansion
very<00:04:20.130> well<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.700> mechanics<00:04:21.209> were<00:04:21.600> done

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
very well and the mechanics were done

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.770 
very well and the mechanics were done
very<00:04:22.079> well<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.460> must<00:04:24.030> say<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.510> you're
