00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:18.840
 save company guys is easy than 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:25.439
 today in a book is of the Portuguese show 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:29.189
 that today is this car and I have to say if 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.550
 is a very common engineering error 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.140
 df happen to reinvent itself and not speak of 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.770
 Neon this canopla here 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 finishing the wiring how this is 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.739
 the electric locking package produced 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:54.480
 electric is not very common this car is 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:57.420
 possible to be short here is a curve 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.120
 to avoid is what makes you stay 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.100
 opening and closing the spinning is with this is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.770
 What happens and is going to break, right? 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.979
 It is very common to happen wiring break 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.119
 often for the professional and glass 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.369
 electric side of the passenger even that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.930
 the driver's side stop the rain is not 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.240
 speaker and with the travelex it hurts in case 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.850
 here install an alarm here through the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.790
 Come on, the sonata. You come here in the house. 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:37.220
 included and found that the plant was 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.400
 electric and reveals that Marcelo will 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:46.259
 do the test that is the thread is the two 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.970
 the core 3131 that is positive and 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.000
 negative 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.040
 if you checked here you have chain on it 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.960
 negative very difficult this module 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.000
 problem and so very likely that it will 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.740
 to be in the wiring that white on average to the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.920
 center has 12 volts and the other 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.950
 I do not invest nor put here in the current 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.950
 places the black pointer here from the last 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.770
 31 a very negative mark of votes 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.940
 probable wiring broken here is in the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.980
 if such 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.500
 We make a lot of moves and this model is 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.000
 most of the time the broken wiring and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
 as I said this central 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.200
 it's hardly a problem and it's the central one 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.890
 then they were startled. 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.440
 It's you, you 're going to pull it. 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.860
 inside the door column she sees 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.680
 wrapped with a cloth insulation tape that 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.140
 you can see a piece because it's already been 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.630
 removed with a unique car that 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.610
 many children have already been 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.670
 many films mainly from 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.560
 work that's five more then here 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.570
 several and was already amended as I was going 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.040
 to pass here the wiring that the 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.950
 of the switch I am putting a 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.670
 lot of leh had broken wire here 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.870
 I 'm going to do the amendment here so this 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.750
 It's a suggestion that I give if it goes. 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.990
 uncoiling that pan and pull tape 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.960
 I tried to see a lot and I broke. 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.870
 inside that is insulation and plastic the 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.840
 wire wire spinning is already broken 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:43.610
 So this tip I'm leaving for you. 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:48.740
 today are broken inside the canopla of the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.320
 fiat steering column an answer 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.080
 confirm he sees a broken wire 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.290
 often breaks many once you 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.330
 the central strip and leaves the key latches 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.330
 ignition off to avoid short 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.520
 and in less than one by one because it has 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.720
 some that too that the repeated run 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.090
 bloch to blue and red i here you 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.030
 you may notice that you have two children 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.340
 so you do not make food mess 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.709
 if you have more if a broken wire 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.620
 you and one after another 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.750
 a graphite so have had the test 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.449
 All right, too, quote coming. 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:34.099
 negative here on the athlete's connections 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.280
 so I'll leave this tip to you 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.410
 today beyond the world that is very common and 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.150
 inventory both in the side column 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.940
 left side with right side plate 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.740
 also the tip that I left for you 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.620
 Thank you again today, posted 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.110
 was in our channel penny enjoying the 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.740
 if the video is legal for you if 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.199
 the usefulness enjoys there and help 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.880
 people to release the video we are without 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.979
 answer the questions 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.220
 This is it, then the company is 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.289
 away but in morals there for guys there 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.590
 It's okay and a big hug and until the next 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.590
 video
