sir<00:00:11.920> as<00:00:12.920> you<00:00:12.950> can<00:00:13.190> see<00:00:13.370> now<00:00:14.500> I've<00:00:15.500> taken<00:00:16.270> each

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
sir as you can see now I've taken each

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.490 
sir as you can see now I've taken each
nipple<00:00:18.340> just<00:00:19.340> to<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.580> end<00:00:19.930> of<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.200> spoke

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
nipple just to the end of the spoke

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.609 
nipple just to the end of the spoke
thread<00:00:22.930> but<00:00:24.130> that<00:00:25.750> isn't<00:00:26.750> initial<00:00:27.380> tension

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
thread but that isn't initial tension

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.799 
thread but that isn't initial tension
initial<00:00:28.579> tension<00:00:28.880> is<00:00:29.869> where<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.829> tension<00:00:31.809> in

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
initial tension is where the tension in

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.990 
initial tension is where the tension in
the<00:00:33.050> spoke<00:00:33.350> begins<00:00:34.130> to<00:00:34.460> have<00:00:34.730> an<00:00:34.880> effect<00:00:35.329> on

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
the spoke begins to have an effect on

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.639 
the spoke begins to have an effect on
truing<00:00:38.260> you<00:00:39.260> can<00:00:39.469> see<00:00:39.770> there<00:00:40.870> it's<00:00:41.870> slightly

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
truing you can see there it's slightly

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.180 
truing you can see there it's slightly
thicker<00:00:43.660> spoke<00:00:44.660> is<00:00:44.870> just<00:00:45.260> slightly<00:00:45.649> thicker

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
thicker spoke is just slightly thicker

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.970 
thicker spoke is just slightly thicker
and<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:47.510> means<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:48.019> because<00:00:48.710> it's<00:00:48.859> a

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
and that means it's because it's a

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.220 
and that means it's because it's a
double<00:00:49.160> butted<00:00:49.640> spoke<00:00:49.999> slightly<00:00:50.629> thicker<00:00:50.960> at

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
double butted spoke slightly thicker at

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.110 
double butted spoke slightly thicker at
the<00:00:51.260> end<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:53.620> we're<00:00:54.620> dependent<00:00:55.129> on<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.550> kind

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
the end and we're dependent on the kind

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.750 
the end and we're dependent on the kind
of<00:00:56.390> spoke<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:57.170> you're<00:00:57.350> using<00:00:57.800> whether<00:00:58.670> it's

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
of spoke that you're using whether it's

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.009 
of spoke that you're using whether it's
single<00:00:59.420> butted<00:00:59.929> double<00:01:00.379> butted<00:01:00.769> laying<00:01:01.249> gauge

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
single butted double butted laying gauge

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.100 
single butted double butted laying gauge
will<00:01:03.220> give<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.400> different<00:01:04.690> requirement<00:01:05.690> in

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
will give you a different requirement in

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.230 
will give you a different requirement in
the<00:01:06.560> tension<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:07.490> with<00:01:07.640> double<00:01:07.970> but<00:01:08.090> it's

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
the tension so with double but it's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.340 
the tension so with double but it's
folks<00:01:10.120> I'm<00:01:11.120> going<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.450> take<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> point

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
folks I'm going to take it to a point

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.580 
folks I'm going to take it to a point
where<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.909> tension<00:01:14.240> if<00:01:15.020> you're<00:01:15.260> doing<00:01:15.500> it

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
where the tension if you're doing it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.470 
where the tension if you're doing it
just<00:01:15.620> by<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.010> feel<00:01:16.400> if<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:16.700> don't<00:01:16.940> have<00:01:17.240> one

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
just by the feel if you don't have one

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.950 
just by the feel if you don't have one
of<00:01:17.600> these<00:01:17.690> things<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:20.050> spoke<00:01:21.050> tension<00:01:21.380> meter

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
of these things a spoke tension meter

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.340 
of these things a spoke tension meter
you<00:01:23.960> take<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.440> point<00:01:24.710> where<00:01:25.750> turning<00:01:26.750> the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you take it to a point where turning the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.400 
you take it to a point where turning the
nipple<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:28.310> just<00:01:28.640> starting<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:30.290> bite<00:01:32.410> can't

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
nipple is just starting to bite can't

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.760 
nipple is just starting to bite can't
make<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:33.890> any<00:01:34.100> clearer<00:01:34.910> than<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.210> really<00:01:35.810> so

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
make it any clearer than that really so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.340 
make it any clearer than that really so
first<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.220> all<00:01:37.480> you're<00:01:38.480> turning<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.260> I'm

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
first of all you're turning it and I'm

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.830 
first of all you're turning it and I'm
going<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.520> use<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:41.210> thing<00:01:41.510> here<00:01:43.720> let's<00:01:44.720> see

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
going to use this thing here let's see

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.640 
going to use this thing here let's see
if<00:01:44.960> I'm<00:01:45.110> turning<00:01:46.390> making<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.510> tighter<00:01:47.810> making

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
if I'm turning making it tighter making

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.150 
if I'm turning making it tighter making
tiger<00:01:48.950> in<00:01:49.160> it<00:01:49.310> just<00:01:50.650> getting<00:01:51.650> a<00:01:51.740> little<00:01:51.920> bit

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
tiger in it just getting a little bit

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.530 
tiger in it just getting a little bit
difficult<00:01:54.100> if<00:01:55.100> you're<00:01:55.580> using<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.300> spoke

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
difficult if you're using the spoke

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.400 
difficult if you're using the spoke
tension<00:01:56.780> meter<00:01:58.360> then<00:01:59.360> there<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.080> go

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
tension meter then there we go

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.520 
tension meter then there we go
I'm<00:02:00.590> gonna<00:02:01.240> mess<00:02:02.240> up<00:02:02.510> on

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.750 

takes<00:02:08.530> up<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:10.050> zero<00:02:11.050> tension<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:12.550> what<00:02:12.730> I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
takes up and zero tension and what I

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.660 
takes up and zero tension and what I
want<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:15.810> about<00:02:16.810> there<00:02:17.430> slightly<00:02:18.430> under

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
want is just about there slightly under

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.580 
want is just about there slightly under
ten<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.750> I'm<00:02:19.990> going<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> try<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.560> get<00:02:20.709> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
ten and I'm going to try and get that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.020 
ten and I'm going to try and get that
for<00:02:23.590> all<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.069> spokes<00:02:24.340> that's<00:02:24.640> going<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.910> be<00:02:25.000> a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
for all the spokes that's going to be a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.000 
for all the spokes that's going to be a
sort<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.330> baseline<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.920> that's<00:02:27.400> what<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.610> call

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
sort of baseline and that's what I call

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.820 
sort of baseline and that's what I call
initial<00:02:30.010> tension<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.330> can<00:02:31.450> do<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.690> using<00:02:32.590> a

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
initial tension so you can do it using a

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.030 
initial tension so you can do it using a
tool<00:02:33.250> or<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.600> do<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.900> by<00:02:35.080> feel<00:02:35.410> which<00:02:36.010> is

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
tool or you can do it by feel which is

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.970 
tool or you can do it by feel which is
what<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.340> used<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.850> do<00:02:37.000> before<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.870> got<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.260> but

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
what I used to do before I got this but

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.400 
what I used to do before I got this but
using<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.519> my<00:02:40.390> feel<00:02:40.840> has<00:02:41.940> my<00:02:42.940> guesswork<00:02:43.510> has

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
using this my feel has my guesswork has

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.380 
using this my feel has my guesswork has
improved<00:02:44.920> quite<00:02:45.370> considerably<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.330> I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
improved quite considerably so I

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.290 
improved quite considerably so I
recommend<00:02:46.900> if<00:02:47.170> you're<00:02:47.380> going<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.680> be<00:02:47.830> using

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
recommend if you're going to be using

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.460 
recommend if you're going to be using
building<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> lot<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.540> wheels<00:02:49.720> get<00:02:50.110> yourself

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
building a lot of wheels get yourself

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.420 
building a lot of wheels get yourself
one<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.620> these<00:02:50.830> things

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.489 

you
