00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.260
 this will also be a normal live team 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.449
 deathmatch on the map 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.410
 lead author is metz has just started 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.410
 give a brief guide 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.650
 I think the map is actually pretty 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.790
 cool is one alone 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.900
 then I run boring again and again 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:47.760
 The bangs sometimes there is definitely 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:49.840
 ever one of them ran in 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.540
 we can hear in cologne i hope there 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:02.860
 me now not to welcome a team 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:04.269
 made already taken care of cover there 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.329
 was revenue building but then came 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:14.909
 Again one of the side one dies like that 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:14.909
 quickly we all traffic lights 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.240
 So I would have asked someone what I have 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.789
 now hold call of duty after 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.060
 So I showed that to bats 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.219
 is in my view a solid shooter 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.700
 the well he has the potential yet 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.819
 really a good shooter and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.270
 that's what I mean, that's really important to me 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.289
 was one second 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.890
 for that it is real from my point of view 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.530
 important that either the weapon damage 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.289
 is reduced or the health 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.420
 is increased so and because the lobby 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.469
 Sex are extremely misunderstood and you can 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.060
 the players partly not 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.999
 take over because you stop so fast 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:03.639
 dies and the maps really linger 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:05.560
 enter as many camper positions and 

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:07.569
 the mark ruby ​​of intel sensitive 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.369
 word he has said since we have nothing 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.369
 changed that as well over mw3 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.750
 but he just wanted to do it again 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.020
 not exclude he said that she was there 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.930
 maybe what do the bible do? 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:32.160
 he says 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:42.300
 But there is one more here 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:45.740
 one ode there is one 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.740
 small sport was such a small corner 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.510
 shit now I have to go to the building 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.370
 shit in quickly 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.319
 why do my teams do that too much ? 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:11.489
 Honestly, why do you let yourself so 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:17.970
 and I do not think so 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:27.030
 I just had to shut up because 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:30.319
 i mean 33 34 matches kids and 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.319
 teen is curious 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.650
 so my e-mails now have to be the opponents 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.920
 maybe Germany back here 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.920
 come 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.569
 it could be that coming here soon 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.569
 there was already a new one 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.860
 okay it would be here in the mark here I have 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.860
 also a roof on the head 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.790
 here is also normal sports cool 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.940
 ok crass 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:26.460
 they had no opponent because delivery again 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.330
 has been there has my time 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.330
 taken care of by team age 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.850
 All right then they would be out of here 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.850
 Here is actually quite a lot going on 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.650
 small gift I left there 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:11.140
 and then there was one more 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:11.140
 that's so blatant we look where they are 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.440
 really partly really very defensive 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.580
 play again the leader of the must 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.580
 hate me now 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.600
 after all, we are back in the lead 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.560
 I was not exactly sure 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.560
 Let's hope back 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.540
 you have to be careful here 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.770
 he comes here 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.770
 Yes 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.920
 the pony here i patrol lie now 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:27.000
 just in a very small area because of me 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:29.110
 You have to do that sometimes 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.200
 just this big is very too 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.200
 recommend 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.190
 at least if you want to win games 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:49.380
 check if there is one more 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.380
 comes there 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:01.950
 I'm just wondering there it is 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.950
 continued here 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.490
 the rockets out immediately 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.750
 now he has to get out and we hope we 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:26.900
 do not go on it I already stop there 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:30.310
 again big next steps clean 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:34.699
 we still got the helicopters 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.560
 with the last grassamen then still 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:40.400
 hinbekommen 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.720
 16:29 would still have a very good round 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:47.300
 I could have more time 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:53.320
 but had a nice optics like 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.320
 me in and look
