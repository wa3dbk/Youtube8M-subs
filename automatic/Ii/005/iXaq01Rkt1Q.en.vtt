hey guys here today with a video on

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.140 
hey guys here today with a video on
polymeric<00:00:06.150> sand<00:00:07.370> kind<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.490> pros<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.730> cons

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
polymeric sand kind of the pros and cons

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
polymeric sand kind of the pros and cons
going<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.690> be<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> quick<00:00:09.960> video<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.950> pros<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
going to be a quick video the pros and

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.379 
going to be a quick video the pros and
cons<00:00:11.630> versus<00:00:12.630> just<00:00:12.840> regular<00:00:13.200> sand<00:00:14.360> so<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
cons versus just regular sand so the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.279 
cons versus just regular sand so the
pros<00:00:15.890> are<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.160> power<00:00:17.340> matrix<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.050> all<00:00:19.050> you

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
pros are the power matrix and all you

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.310 
pros are the power matrix and all you
have<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:20.390> use<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.960> joints

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
have to do is use that and the joints

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.250 
have to do is use that and the joints
make<00:00:22.529> sure<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.359> spread<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.990> all

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
make sure that you do not spread it all

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.900 
make sure that you do not spread it all
over<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.769> face<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.250> bricks<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.699> try<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
over the face of the bricks and try to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.400 
over the face of the bricks and try to
water<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:27.539> anything<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.990> here's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
water it or anything like that here's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.859 
water it or anything like that here's
the<00:00:28.590> typical<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> doing<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.869> you're

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the typical way of doing this you're

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.370 
the typical way of doing this you're
going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:33.090> joints<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> grout

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
going to do the the joints with a grout

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
going to do the the joints with a grout
bag<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.969> want<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.300> sweep<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.750> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
bag or if you want to sweep it on you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.650 
bag or if you want to sweep it on you
can<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.290> pour<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.800> sweep<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.629> take<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
can just pour it on sweep it on take a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.430 
can just pour it on sweep it on take a
leaf<00:00:40.020> blower<00:00:40.850> use<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.180> low<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.660> angle<00:00:43.379> it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
leaf blower use it on low and angle it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.900 
leaf blower use it on low and angle it
up<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.010> you're<00:00:44.160> trying<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.730> just

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
up and all you're trying to do is just

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.810 
up and all you're trying to do is just
blow<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> sand<00:00:46.170> off<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.860> faces<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
blow the sand off of the faces of the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.439 
blow the sand off of the faces of the
brick<00:00:48.500> if<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.710> leave<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.329> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
brick if you leave that on there and you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.090 
brick if you leave that on there and you
wet<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.079> actually<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.590> stain<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
wet that you actually can stain the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.729 
wet that you actually can stain the
brick<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> basically<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.110> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.559> make

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
brick so basically you want to just make

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.040 
brick so basically you want to just make
sure<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.210> excess<00:00:57.629> off<00:00:57.840> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
sure that you get the the excess off of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.360 
sure that you get the the excess off of
it<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:59.210> when<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.329> done<00:01:01.190> you're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
it and when you're done you're going to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.770 
it and when you're done you're going to
have<00:01:02.550> something<00:01:02.789> that's<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> seal<00:01:03.539> out

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
have something that's going to seal out

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.840 
have something that's going to seal out
insects<00:01:04.470> weeds<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.369> also<00:01:06.060> wash<00:01:06.330> out<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:08.070> good

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
insects weeds and also wash out the good

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.359 
insects weeds and also wash out the good
thing<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.439> regular<00:01:10.830> sand<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
thing is you can do the regular sand and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520 
thing is you can do the regular sand and
if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> don't<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> way<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
if you don't like the way it is down the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.340 
if you don't like the way it is down the
road<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.299> use<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> polymeric<00:01:15.869> sand<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
road you can use the polymeric sand you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.580 
road you can use the polymeric sand you
just<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> make<00:01:16.830> sure<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:19.470> know

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
just have to make sure that you you know

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
just have to make sure that you you know
clean<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> excess<00:01:21.030> sand<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
clean out the excess sand and then you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.100 
clean out the excess sand and then you
can<00:01:22.170> use<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:23.540> that's<00:01:24.540> roughly<00:01:24.960> about

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
can use that that's roughly about

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.569 
can use that that's roughly about
eighteen<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.009> twenty<00:01:26.340> dollars<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:27.049> bucket

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
eighteen to twenty dollars a bucket

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.249 
eighteen to twenty dollars a bucket
covers<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:29.700> 50<00:01:30.210> 50<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> 55<00:01:31.470> square<00:01:31.799> feet<00:01:33.259> so

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
covers about 50 50 to 55 square feet so

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.780 
covers about 50 50 to 55 square feet so
it's<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> those<00:01:34.950> things<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.460> guess<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
it's just one of those things I guess is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's just one of those things I guess is
the<00:01:35.909> choice<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.930> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> spend

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the choice you know if you want to spend

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
the choice you know if you want to spend
the<00:01:37.409> money<00:01:37.560> upfront<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.220> lot<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.180> home

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the money upfront a lot of home

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.590 
the money upfront a lot of home
