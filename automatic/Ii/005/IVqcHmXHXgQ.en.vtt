00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.140 
but also the end of the universe is
constantly<00:01:38.430> trying<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
constantly trying to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
constantly trying to
you<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:40.260> like<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.560> spikes<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.010> pits<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you just like the spikes and pits if the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.220 
you just like the spikes and pits if the
end<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.820> universe<00:01:42.090> gets<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.900> is<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
end of the universe gets you that is the

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.770 
end of the universe gets you that is the
end<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> game<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.970> next<00:01:45.180> mode<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.510> called

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
end of the game the next mode is called

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600 
end of the game the next mode is called
hell<00:01:46.260> zone<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:46.830> in<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.190> it's<00:01:47.370> pretty

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
hell zone and in that one it's pretty

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.010 
hell zone and in that one it's pretty
much<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.910> same<00:01:48.060> there's<00:01:48.330> no<00:01:48.510> end<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.900> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
much the same there's no end of the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
much the same there's no end of the
universe<00:01:49.260> in<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.130> Hal<00:01:50.460> zone<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
universe in this one but in Hal zone you

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.080 
universe in this one but in Hal zone you
have<00:01:51.420> way<00:01:52.350> more<00:01:52.380> spikes<00:01:52.950> way<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.520> pits<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
have way more spikes way more pits and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.000 
have way more spikes way more pits and
the<00:01:54.240> game<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.660> more<00:01:54.870> difficult<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.620> found

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
the game is just more difficult I found

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.470 
the game is just more difficult I found
that<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.190> mode<00:01:56.430> runs<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:56.940> bit<00:01:57.090> slower

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
that that mode runs a little bit slower

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.780 
that that mode runs a little bit slower
the<00:01:57.840> gameplay<00:01:58.380> doesn't<00:01:58.650> actually<00:01:58.980> feel<00:01:59.490> as

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the gameplay doesn't actually feel as

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.400 
the gameplay doesn't actually feel as
nice<00:02:00.180> because<00:02:00.600> you're<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.840> getting<00:02:01.140> as<00:02:01.230> much

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
nice because you're not getting as much

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.170 
nice because you're not getting as much
speed<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.490> you're<00:02:02.580> not<00:02:02.700> getting<00:02:02.970> as<00:02:03.060> many

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
speed and you're not getting as many

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.020 
speed and you're not getting as many
pills<00:02:03.510> hit<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.710> takes<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.160> lot<00:02:05.340> more<00:02:05.550> precision

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
pills hit it takes a lot more precision

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.060 
pills hit it takes a lot more precision
but<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:07.080> gameplay<00:02:07.470> mechanics<00:02:07.590> are

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
but the gameplay mechanics are

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.790 
but the gameplay mechanics are
relatively<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.850> same<00:02:09.259> final<00:02:10.259> mode<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.560> called

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
relatively the same final mode is called

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.480 
relatively the same final mode is called
the<00:02:11.160> kepler<00:02:11.700> run<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.600> one<00:02:12.840> there<00:02:13.080> are

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
the kepler run and in that one there are

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.610 
the kepler run and in that one there are
gravity<00:02:14.490> fields<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.090> are<00:02:15.410> centers<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
gravity fields that are centers with a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.320 
gravity fields that are centers with a
spike<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.400> when<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.610> hit<00:02:17.760> those<00:02:17.880> gravity

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
spike and when you hit those gravity

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.810 
spike and when you hit those gravity
fields<00:02:18.690> they<00:02:18.870> will<00:02:19.050> bend<00:02:19.410> your<00:02:19.770> surf<00:02:20.190> up<00:02:20.490> or

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
fields they will bend your surf up or

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.640 
fields they will bend your surf up or
down<00:02:21.180> depending<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.930> which<00:02:22.170> side<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
down depending on which side of the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.710 
down depending on which side of the
field<00:02:22.860> you're<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.430> now<00:02:24.030> they'll<00:02:24.180> try<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.420> suck

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
field you're on now they'll try to suck

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.690 
field you're on now they'll try to suck
you<00:02:24.840> towards<00:02:25.350> these<00:02:25.620> spikes<00:02:26.100> but<00:02:26.490> for<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
you towards these spikes but for the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.430 
you towards these spikes but for the
most<00:02:26.850> part<00:02:26.970> you're<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:27.840> gonna<00:02:27.930> bend<00:02:28.290> around

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
most part you're just gonna bend around

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.140 
most part you're just gonna bend around
the<00:02:28.709> gravity<00:02:29.220> field<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.760> actually

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the gravity field and this is actually

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.730 
the gravity field and this is actually
kind<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> fun<00:02:30.660> mode<00:02:30.930> because<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.500> end<00:02:31.650> up

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
kind of a fun mode because you end up

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.260 
kind of a fun mode because you end up
getting<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> lot<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.370> speed<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.090> lot

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
getting a lot more speed you get a lot

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.750 
getting a lot more speed you get a lot
more<00:02:33.300> ramps<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.310> pretty

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
more ramps going but it's pretty

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.150 
more ramps going but it's pretty
interesting<00:02:36.360> trying<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.380> deal<00:02:37.560> with<00:02:37.770> those

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
interesting trying to deal with those

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.550 
interesting trying to deal with those
extra<00:02:38.730> gravity<00:02:38.940> fields<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.870> while<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.260> mode

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
extra gravity fields and while this mode

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.020 
extra gravity fields and while this mode
does<00:02:40.830> feel<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> little<00:02:41.250> bit<00:02:41.580> different<00:02:41.820> than

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
does feel a little bit different than

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.330 
does feel a little bit different than
the<00:02:42.090> other<00:02:42.300> two<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:43.080> still<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.500> same<00:02:43.739> core

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
the other two it's still the same core

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.030 
the other two it's still the same core
gameplay<00:02:44.760> mechanics<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.720> therefore<00:02:46.230> not

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
gameplay mechanics and therefore not

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.190 
gameplay mechanics and therefore not
that<00:02:47.400> much<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.910> variance<00:02:48.390> there<00:02:48.810> are<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.050> number

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
that much in variance there are a number

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.420 
that much in variance there are a number
of<00:02:49.320> different<00:02:49.650> purchases<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> make

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
of different purchases you can make

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.280 
of different purchases you can make
within<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> game<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.209> those<00:02:51.330> aren't<00:02:51.690> in-app

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
within the game and those aren't in-app

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.290 
within the game and those aren't in-app
purchases<00:02:52.830> those<00:02:53.040> only<00:02:53.340> use<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.880> in-game

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
purchases those only use the in-game

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.110 
purchases those only use the in-game
currency<00:02:54.360> which<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.590> time<00:02:56.100> capsule<00:02:56.730> cake

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
currency which is the time capsule cake

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.759 
currency which is the time capsule cake
points<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.840> get<00:02:58.019> while<00:02:58.260> you're<00:02:58.410> surfing

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
points that you get while you're surfing

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.920 
points that you get while you're surfing
through<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.430> different<00:02:59.730> levels<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.720> get

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
through the different levels you can get

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.320 
through the different levels you can get
pets<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.530> costumes<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
pets and costumes and

pets and costumes and
different<00:03:04.110> vehicles<00:03:04.920> as<00:03:05.190> well<00:03:05.220> each<00:03:06.060> one<00:03:06.420> just

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
different vehicles as well each one just

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.500 
different vehicles as well each one just
really<00:03:07.380> upgrades<00:03:07.980> your<00:03:08.280> surfer<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.120> various

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
really upgrades your surfer in various

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.820 
really upgrades your surfer in various
different<00:03:09.660> ways<00:03:09.870> through<00:03:10.260> statistics

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
different ways through statistics

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.430 
different ways through statistics
they're<00:03:11.640> not<00:03:11.820> really<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.570> much<00:03:12.810> different

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
they're not really that much different

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.430 
they're not really that much different
overall<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.040> found<00:03:14.420> interesting<00:03:15.420> enough<00:03:16.230> and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
overall I found interesting enough and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.660 
overall I found interesting enough and
it's<00:03:16.530> kind<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.710> cool<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.980> collect<00:03:17.340> them<00:03:17.490> all

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
it's kind of cool to collect them all

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.160 
it's kind of cool to collect them all
but<00:03:17.880> at<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.030> same<00:03:18.180> time<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.600> didn't<00:03:18.900> find<00:03:19.080> that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
but at the same time I didn't find that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.650 
but at the same time I didn't find that
they<00:03:19.350> had<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> major<00:03:20.220> impact<00:03:20.580> on<00:03:21.120> how<00:03:21.390> far<00:03:21.600> I

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
they had a major impact on how far I

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.710 
they had a major impact on how far I
went<00:03:21.930> with<00:03:22.200> each<00:03:22.530> surfing<00:03:23.040> run<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.720> they

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
went with each surfing run and they

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.450 
went with each surfing run and they
ended<00:03:25.260> up<00:03:25.350> being<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.710> little<00:03:25.890> bit<00:03:26.160> more

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
ended up being a little bit more

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.000 
ended up being a little bit more
aesthetic<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.510> their<00:03:27.660> appeal<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.650> one<00:03:28.800> overall

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
aesthetic to their appeal so one overall

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.340
