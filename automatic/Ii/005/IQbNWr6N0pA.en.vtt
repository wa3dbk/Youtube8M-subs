00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 welcome to metal slug and good this 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.890
 game that many of us have played 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.170
 little machines in the little machines that were 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.700
 outside the stores, now it's 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.059
 I wanted to play it and we're going to play it 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.490
 little here with you every time 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.460
 I will upload only 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.320
 the machine gun before I thought it was a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.520
 soy rudeness 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.520
 this is only one I'm going to upload 11 per day 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.620
 one level per day is short 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.370
 unless of course you ask me more 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.310
 but for the moment he's just going to do this 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.490
 do not scream 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.980
 and do not stop foreseeing they do not stop appearing 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.250
 let them appear although I did not see so much 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.100
 on the roof 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.050
 on the roof they were separated by helicopter 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.470
 this is the only game where you can see 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.870
 a person fights against a helicopter 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.330
 where can you see this one person 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.730
 fighting face to face against a tank of 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.450
 war 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.140
 or not 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.140
 LOL 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.330
 wait for another write machine gun 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.330
 uy 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.480
 I did not get off of both 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.510
 do not stay 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.010
 I will not do this side 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.490
 so that I do not go using the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.490
 missiles 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.750
 that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.869
 Well, as you can see, we had a 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.210
 perfect game in fact the most killed 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.930
 remembering also that in this game if 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.430
 I do not believe you that if you hit one with 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.130
 once you get hit you die 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.000
 and we have three lives let's play with 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.100
 five continuous 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.070
 the whole game to see if we had the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.840
 I really doubt it if it is necessary because 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.950
 we add more no 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.500
 obviously but 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.360
 although I stayed in the pure place where 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 I can be hit by all the blows 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.370
 come on we come back 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.000
 okay 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.670
 that allowed you to finish the game with 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.670
 the tank 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.390
 there it was fine not silly 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.390
 no nothing happens 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.830
 we destroyed it I did not keep the tank 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.500
 but fortunately I take several 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.350
 neighborhoods rescued and I did not die any time 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.180
 see you in the next video that 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.190
 it's probably tomorrow if this video 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.230
 reaches a goal of likes that I'm going to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
 leave in the description of the video mission 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.080
 complete number one put them none 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.080
 we follow
