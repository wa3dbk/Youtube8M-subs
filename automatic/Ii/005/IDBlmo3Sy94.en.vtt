it's longer range it is however slightly
less<00:01:55.710> effective<00:01:56.310> due<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> lack<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
less effective due to the lack of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840 
less effective due to the lack of
stopping<00:01:57.930> power<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.799> than<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.250> first<00:01:59.610> on

stopping power as more than one first on
target<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.479> needed<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.079> long-range<00:02:01.619> kill

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
target is needed for long-range kill

target is needed for long-range kill
however<00:02:03.060> attaching<00:02:04.020> an<00:02:04.140> echo<00:02:04.500> group<00:02:04.890> will

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
however attaching an echo group will

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.100 
however attaching an echo group will
slightly<00:02:05.399> lower<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> weapons<00:02:06.270> week<00:02:06.840> would

and attaching and I asked quote when

really lower the weapons recoil this is

really lower the weapons recoil this is

the only weapon that gets lower recalled

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.380 
the only weapon that gets lower recalled

minimum amount of kills I've got with my
tag<00:03:22.470> dogs<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.890> was<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.250> six<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.820> think<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.270> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
tag dogs it was like six I think and the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.310 
tag dogs it was like six I think and the
most<00:03:25.140> i<00:03:25.350> think<00:03:25.560> i<00:03:25.620> got<00:03:25.770> like<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.100> p<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:27.320> yes

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
most i think i got like the p and yes

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.110 
most i think i got like the p and yes
it's<00:03:28.739> all<00:03:28.860> started<00:03:29.190> using<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.670> streak<00:03:29.970> i

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
it's all started using the streak i

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.910 
it's all started using the streak i
think<00:03:30.390> i've<00:03:30.480> been<00:03:30.510> using<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:31.410> most<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.770> my

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
think i've been using it in most of my

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.190 
think i've been using it in most of my
games<00:03:31.980> now<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.520> but<00:03:33.270> it<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.510> little<00:03:33.750> bit<00:03:33.930> hard

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
games now and but it is little bit hard

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.350 
games now and but it is little bit hard
to<00:03:34.320> get<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> street<00:03:35.010> get<00:03:35.430> 11<00:03:35.790> kills<00:03:36.060> there

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
to get the street get 11 kills there

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.210 
to get the street get 11 kills there
without<00:03:36.570> dying<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.170> especially<00:03:37.650> without<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
without dying and especially without the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.630 
without dying and especially without the
stopping<00:03:38.640> power<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.470> your<00:03:40.470> streets<00:03:40.890> doesn't

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
stopping power and your streets doesn't

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.270 
stopping power and your streets doesn't
really<00:03:41.970> build<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.320> have<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.890> kind<00:03:44.100> of

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
really build up so you have to kind of

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.760 
really build up so you have to kind of
work<00:03:44.489> hard<00:03:44.850> get<00:03:45.270> door<00:03:45.600> street<00:03:46.020> it's<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.590> good

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
work hard get door street it's a good

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.010 
work hard get door street it's a good
thing<00:03:46.830> us<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.640> because<00:03:48.090> many<00:03:48.450> people<00:03:48.540> they

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
thing us but it because many people they

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.870 
thing us but it because many people they
get<00:03:49.200> one<00:03:49.410> or<00:03:49.530> two<00:03:49.560> streets<00:03:50.010> try<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.370> hide<00:03:50.700> away

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
get one or two streets try to hide away

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.870 
get one or two streets try to hide away
and<00:03:51.420> they<00:03:51.950> streaks<00:03:52.950> do<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> top<00:03:53.520> of<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.730> way

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
and they streaks do the top of the way

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.180 
and they streaks do the top of the way
but<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.690> black<00:03:54.900> ops<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.350> have<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.709> find<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.980> work

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
but in black ops you have to find a work

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.890 
but in black ops you have to find a work
harder<00:03:56.670> get<00:03:56.850> more<00:03:57.030> importantly<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.750> game

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
harder get more importantly to the game

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.750 
harder get more importantly to the game
so<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.200> could<00:03:58.410> get<00:03:58.770> your<00:03:58.830> streaks<00:03:59.340> instead<00:03:59.730> of

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
so you could get your streaks instead of

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.430 
so you could get your streaks instead of
getting<00:04:00.060> one<00:04:00.480> streak<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.020> letting<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
getting one streak and letting the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.030 
getting one streak and letting the
street<00:04:01.709> do<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.100> job<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.550> in<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.760> way

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
street do the job for you in a way

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.170 
street do the job for you in a way
