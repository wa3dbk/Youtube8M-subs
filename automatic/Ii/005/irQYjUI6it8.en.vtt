opinions on them on and you know kind of

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.260 
opinions on them on and you know kind of
see<00:00:34.140> how<00:00:34.920> they<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.280> useful<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.210> we

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
see how they can be useful and what we

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.790 
see how they can be useful and what we
can<00:00:36.300> anticipate<00:00:36.660> when<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.320> game<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
can anticipate when we get this game so

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.280 
can anticipate when we get this game so
number<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> first<00:00:38.790> wish<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.930> make

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
number one the first wish you can make

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.470 
number one the first wish you can make
is<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:41.010> money<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.059> called<00:00:42.270> money

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is for money right so it's called money

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.900 
is for money right so it's called money
want<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> obviously<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:44.250> probably<00:00:44.640> just

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
want and obviously it's probably just

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.180 
want and obviously it's probably just
increased<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.690> zeni<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.010> think

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
increased a lot of zeni like I think

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.770 
increased a lot of zeni like I think
like<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.460> lot<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> Dragon<00:00:48.210> Ball<00:00:48.329> Z<00:00:48.360> games

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
like a lot of the Dragon Ball Z games

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.180 
like a lot of the Dragon Ball Z games
and<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> lot<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.230> dragon<00:00:49.530> ball<00:00:49.620> z<00:00:49.770> games<00:00:49.950> there's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and a lot of dragon ball z games there's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.619 
and a lot of dragon ball z games there's
always<00:00:50.430> an<00:00:50.550> alternative<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.329> money<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
always an alternative to get money and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.090 
always an alternative to get money and
always<00:00:51.989> seemed<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> alternative<00:00:53.010> was

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
always seemed like the alternative was

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.880 
always seemed like the alternative was
faster<00:00:53.579> than<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.570> wish<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.020> know<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.739> um

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
faster than the wish you know but um

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.670 
faster than the wish you know but um
let's<00:00:56.399> see<00:00:56.670> um<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> rest<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.379> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
let's see um what the rest are so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.200 
let's see um what the rest are so
obviously<00:00:58.980> that'll<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.340> useful<00:00:59.520> for<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
obviously that'll be useful for if you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.939 
obviously that'll be useful for if you
can't<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.539> bothered<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> alternative

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
can't be bothered to do the alternative

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280 
can't be bothered to do the alternative
and<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.910> such<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.329> maybe<00:01:03.539> tournaments<00:01:04.170> or

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and like such as maybe tournaments or

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
and like such as maybe tournaments or
something<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.610> we'll<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.000> how

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
something like that and we'll see how

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.969 
something like that and we'll see how
when<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> game<00:01:07.200> comes<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.530> num<00:01:07.770> number

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
when when the game comes out num number

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
when when the game comes out num number
two<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> getting<00:01:08.580> rare<00:01:08.790> item<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> guess<00:01:09.510> all

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
two is getting rare item so I guess all

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
two is getting rare item so I guess all
the<00:01:10.680> items<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:10.979> combine<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> shop<00:01:11.580> will<00:01:12.210> be

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the items you combine the shop will be

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
the items you combine the shop will be
there<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:12.840> there'll<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.290> items

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
there but then there'll be some items

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.350 
there but then there'll be some items
that<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> cash<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.430> can't<00:01:14.760> actually<00:01:15.060> get

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that you cash you can't actually get

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.450 
that you cash you can't actually get
from<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> shop<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> some<00:01:16.590> items<00:01:16.920> which

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
from the shop and some items which

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.399 
from the shop and some items which
probably<00:01:17.729> maybe<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.630> get<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.290> even

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
probably maybe you can get in even

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.649 
probably maybe you can get in even
quests<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.400> know<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:21.390> playing<00:01:21.570> the

got<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:30.150> late<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.020> was

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
got it like late but I think it was

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.899 
got it like late but I think it was
probably<00:01:31.290> supposed<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.250> rare<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.729> was

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
probably supposed to be rare and I was

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.700 
probably supposed to be rare and I was
just<00:01:33.090> unlucky<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.630> when<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.960> comes<00:01:34.140> luck

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
just unlucky because when it comes luck

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.710 
just unlucky because when it comes luck
I<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.189> none<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.090> maybe<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.509> could<00:01:36.659> be

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
I have none so maybe that could be

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.719 
I have none so maybe that could be
helpful<00:01:36.990> people<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.680> people<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.040> me<00:01:38.100> skills

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
helpful people for people like me skills

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.840 
helpful people for people like me skills
items<00:01:39.329> materials<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.070> particularly

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
items materials on but I do particularly

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.510 
items materials on but I do particularly
think<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.720> skills<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.520> techniques

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
think this is for skills and techniques

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.330 
think this is for skills and techniques
because<00:01:45.090> number<00:01:45.450> three<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.040> fashionable<00:01:47.040> cold

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
because number three is fashionable cold

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.030 
because number three is fashionable cold
clothes<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.450> um<00:01:48.750> I'm<00:01:49.409> guess<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.860> able

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
clothes so um I'm guess you can be able

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
clothes so um I'm guess you can be able
to<00:01:50.130> unlock<00:01:50.610> new<00:01:50.850> outfits<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.600> things<00:01:51.780> like

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
to unlock new outfits and things like

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.010 
to unlock new outfits and things like
that<00:01:52.220> maybe<00:01:53.220> saying<00:01:53.640> arm<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.119> maybe<00:01:54.360> some

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that maybe saying arm or maybe some

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
that maybe saying arm or maybe some
freezer<00:01:55.380> type<00:01:55.740> thing<00:01:56.040> maybe<00:01:56.219> something<00:01:56.579> for

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
freezer type thing maybe something for

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.060 
freezer type thing maybe something for
the<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.390> origin<00:01:57.750> /<00:01:58.020> freezer<00:01:58.290> race<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the all the origin / freezer race you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.889 
the all the origin / freezer race you
know<00:01:59.219> who<00:01:59.399> knows<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.000> obviously<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
know who knows but obviously that is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.959 
know who knows but obviously that is
what<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.229> now<00:02:01.530> number<00:02:01.590> 4<00:02:02.100> says<00:02:02.399> want<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> be

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
what it is now number 4 says want to be

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.819 
what it is now number 4 says want to be
strong<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.420> pretty<00:02:04.110> much<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.740> going

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
strong I pretty much think this is going

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.389 
strong I pretty much think this is going
to<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.009> an<00:02:05.070> increase<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.460> stats<00:02:05.969> um<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:07.380> hope<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
to be an increase in stats um I hope it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.740 
to be an increase in stats um I hope it
doesn't<00:02:08.640> increase<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.239> for<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
doesn't increase is that for you like it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.200 
doesn't increase is that for you like it
just<00:02:09.929> forces<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
just forces you to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.970 
just forces you to
attack<00:02:11.630> up<00:02:12.110> or<00:02:12.380> anything<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.710> hope<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.950> just

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
attack up or anything I hope it just

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.770 
attack up or anything I hope it just
gives<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.460> some<00:02:13.670> maybe<00:02:14.000> some<00:02:14.300> stat<00:02:14.540> points

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
gives you some maybe some stat points

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.530 
gives you some maybe some stat points
which<00:02:15.110> are<00:02:15.200> significant<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.860> any<00:02:16.070> other<00:02:16.250> mode

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
which are significant to any other mode

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.270 
which are significant to any other mode
that'll<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.600> awesome<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:18.110> number<00:02:18.680> five<00:02:18.710> want

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
that'll be awesome now number five want

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.430 
that'll be awesome now number five want
to<00:02:19.490> grow<00:02:19.760> key<00:02:20.690> ballsy<00:02:21.020> wasn't<00:02:21.260> even<00:02:21.410> sure

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
to grow key ballsy wasn't even sure

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.650 
to grow key ballsy wasn't even sure
about<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:21.920> actually<00:02:22.370> meant<00:02:22.700> because<00:02:23.060> if<00:02:23.450> it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
about this actually meant because if it

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.960 
about this actually meant because if it
was<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.110> do<00:02:24.410> your<00:02:24.710> body<00:02:24.890> type<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.730> wouldn't

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
was to do your body type it wouldn't

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.010 
was to do your body type it wouldn't
make<00:02:26.030> sense<00:02:26.090> because<00:02:26.480> if<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.780> are<00:02:26.930> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
make sense because if you are the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.420 
make sense because if you are the
tallest<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.560> could<00:02:27.680> possibly<00:02:28.040> be<00:02:28.250> I'm

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
tallest you could possibly be I'm

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.310 
tallest you could possibly be I'm
doubted<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.090> not<00:02:29.180> gonna<00:02:29.360> unlock<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:30.140> a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
doubted it's not gonna unlock like a

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.690 
doubted it's not gonna unlock like a
total<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.710> us<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.010> then<00:02:31.100> how<00:02:31.370> would<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.640> even

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
total of us and then how would that even

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.580 
total of us and then how would that even
be<00:02:31.910> useful<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.540> I'm<00:02:33.080> not<00:02:33.260> gonna<00:02:33.350> say<00:02:33.560> that

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
be useful and I'm not gonna say that

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.470 
be useful and I'm not gonna say that
they<00:02:33.830> haven't<00:02:33.980> been<00:02:34.160> ever<00:02:34.340> useless<00:02:35.030> wishes<00:02:35.360> in

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
they haven't been ever useless wishes in

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.000 
they haven't been ever useless wishes in
any<00:02:35.630> game<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.320> just<00:02:36.500> think<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.710> this<00:02:36.860> is

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
any game but I just think that this is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.430 
any game but I just think that this is
beyond<00:02:37.490> useless<00:02:37.700> once<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.390> girl<00:02:38.510> could<00:02:38.840> be<00:02:39.140> in

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
beyond useless once a girl could be in

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.290 
beyond useless once a girl could be in
terms<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:40.160> strength<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.640> then<00:02:40.850> again<00:02:41.060> while

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
terms of strength and then again while

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.790 
terms of strength and then again while
then<00:02:41.630> what's<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.990> point<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.290> which<00:02:42.500> number

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
then what's the point of which number

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.670 
then what's the point of which number
for<00:02:42.980> want<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.520> be<00:02:43.610> strong<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.540> on<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:45.200> don't<00:02:45.560> know

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
for want to be strong so on I don't know

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.350 
for want to be strong so on I don't know
want<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.070> grow<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:46.640> some<00:02:46.820> sort<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.180> like

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
want to grow as some sort of like

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.220 
want to grow as some sort of like
continuation<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.290> story<00:02:48.350> or<00:02:48.950> ah<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.900> don't

continuation of the story or ah I don't

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.470 
continuation of the story or ah I don't
know<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> don't<00:02:52.430> know<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.880> no<00:02:52.910> idea

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
know is it I don't know I have no idea

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.270 
know is it I don't know I have no idea
do<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.870> age<00:02:54.110> cuz<00:02:54.620> why<00:02:54.770> would<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.040> want<00:02:55.220> that

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
do you age cuz why would you want that

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.830 
do you age cuz why would you want that
but<00:02:55.880> our<00:02:56.000> guys<00:02:56.150> some<00:02:56.420> what<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.630> think<00:02:56.810> about

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
but our guys some what you think about

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.780 
but our guys some what you think about
that<00:02:57.080> number<00:02:57.230> number<00:02:57.470> 62<00:02:58.070> remember<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.610> new

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
that number number 62 remember the new

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.420 
that number number 62 remember the new
ultimate<00:02:59.570> technique<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.290> guess<00:03:00.530> maybe<00:03:01.160> if

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
ultimate technique so I guess maybe if

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.070 
ultimate technique so I guess maybe if
you<00:03:01.520> have<00:03:01.640> an<00:03:01.730> ultimate<00:03:02.030> ultimate<00:03:02.810> technique

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
you have an ultimate ultimate technique

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.690 
you have an ultimate ultimate technique
it's<00:03:03.290> not<00:03:03.470> as<00:03:03.590> easy<00:03:03.710> as<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.040> was<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.430> game

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
it's not as easy as it was in the game

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.520 
it's not as easy as it was in the game
and<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.270> beta<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.900> just<00:03:06.050> replace<00:03:06.290> ultimate

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
and in the beta to just replace ultimate

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.780 
and in the beta to just replace ultimate
techniques<00:03:07.040> even<00:03:07.250> though<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.370> doubt<00:03:07.430> it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
techniques even though I doubt it

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.430 
techniques even though I doubt it
because<00:03:07.880> why<00:03:08.390> would<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.600> want<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.050> make<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.350> a

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
because why would you want to make it a

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.080 
because why would you want to make it a
hard<00:03:09.620> thing<00:03:09.890> but<00:03:10.040> maybe<00:03:10.400> learning<00:03:10.610> ultimate

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
hard thing but maybe learning ultimate

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.450 
hard thing but maybe learning ultimate
tech<00:03:11.270> techniques<00:03:11.690> we're<00:03:12.320> only<00:03:12.500> done<00:03:12.920> by<00:03:13.130> maybe

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
tech techniques we're only done by maybe

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.850 
tech techniques we're only done by maybe
the<00:03:13.730> master<00:03:14.240> so<00:03:14.780> when<00:03:15.080> you're<00:03:15.230> going<00:03:15.530> being<00:03:15.740> an

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
the master so when you're going being an

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.620 
the master so when you're going being an
apprentice<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.490> somebody<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.180> can<00:03:17.300> only<00:03:17.420> get

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
apprentice of somebody you can only get

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.630 
apprentice of somebody you can only get
it<00:03:17.690> there<00:03:17.930> maybe<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.410> remember<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:19.220> up<00:03:19.430> to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
it there maybe to remember it you up to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.000 
it there maybe to remember it you up to
a<00:03:19.790> new<00:03:19.940> ultimate<00:03:20.330> technique<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:21.410> kind<00:03:21.740> of<00:03:21.830> had

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
a new ultimate technique you kind of had

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.280 
a new ultimate technique you kind of had
to<00:03:22.040> like<00:03:22.400> go<00:03:22.670> back<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.180> previous<00:03:23.360> master<00:03:23.960> i

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
to like go back to the previous master i

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.770 
to like go back to the previous master i
took<00:03:24.890> some<00:03:25.040> long<00:03:25.310> long<00:03:25.700> process<00:03:25.970> will<00:03:26.570> find

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
took some long long process will find

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.360 
took some long long process will find
out<00:03:26.870> we<00:03:27.020> get<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.260> game<00:03:27.440> but<00:03:27.920> i<00:03:27.980> had<00:03:28.190> for

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
out we get the game but i had for

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.460 
out we get the game but i had for
feeling<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.420> just<00:03:29.600> this<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:30.050> just<00:03:30.350> the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
feeling that of it just this is just the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.900 
feeling that of it just this is just the
fastest<00:03:30.860> way<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.010> learn<00:03:31.370> something<00:03:31.760> that

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
fastest way to learn something that

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.490 
fastest way to learn something that
you've<00:03:32.060> forgotten<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.690> maybe<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:32.990> can<00:03:33.050> buy

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
you've forgotten and maybe you can buy

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.930 
you've forgotten and maybe you can buy
that<00:03:33.740> forgotten<00:03:34.160> one<00:03:34.310> maybe<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.700> don't<00:03:34.760> want

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
that forgotten one maybe you don't want

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.610 
that forgotten one maybe you don't want
to<00:03:35.000> go<00:03:35.090> on<00:03:35.210> to<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.390> training<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:36.200> it's<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.440> long

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
to go on to the training but it's a long

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.740 
to go on to the training but it's a long
winded<00:03:36.980> process<00:03:37.430> but<00:03:37.940> uh<00:03:37.970> we'll<00:03:38.390> find<00:03:38.630> out

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
winded process but uh we'll find out

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.300 
winded process but uh we'll find out
when<00:03:38.840> we<00:03:38.900> gettin<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.260> now<00:03:39.290> number<00:03:39.650> seven<00:03:40.130> I

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
when we gettin it now number seven I

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.330 
when we gettin it now number seven I
want<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:41.180> remember<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:42.050> new<00:03:42.230> death<00:03:42.500> blow<00:03:42.860> now

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
want to remember the new death blow now

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.920 
want to remember the new death blow now
I<00:03:43.370> wonder<00:03:43.790> if<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.240> don't<00:03:44.450> see<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> difference

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
I wonder if I don't see a difference

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.450 
I wonder if I don't see a difference
between<00:03:45.350> death<00:03:45.530> blow<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:46.040> ultimate

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
between death blow and ultimate

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.360 
between death blow and ultimate
technique<00:03:47.330> arm<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:48.620> don't<00:03:48.980> think<00:03:49.040> there's<00:03:49.310> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
technique arm I don't think there's a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.370 
technique arm I don't think there's a
category<00:03:49.790> for<00:03:50.000> death<00:03:50.210> blow<00:03:50.540> attack<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.290> you

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
category for death blow attack so you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.320 
category for death blow attack so you
guys<00:03:51.530> gotta<00:03:51.770> help<00:03:52.100> me<00:03:52.280> out<00:03:52.430> with<00:03:52.610> this<00:03:52.640> one

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
guys gotta help me out with this one

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.090 
guys gotta help me out with this one
down<00:03:53.510> below<00:03:53.900> because<00:03:54.110> what<00:03:54.590> would<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.830> mean

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
down below because what would that mean

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.580 
down below because what would that mean
you<00:03:55.400> know<00:03:55.520> what<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.300> what<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.900> death<00:03:57.170> below

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
you know what is what is a death below

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.270 
you know what is what is a death below
is<00:03:57.800> it<00:03:57.950> some<00:03:58.190> sort<00:03:58.220> of<00:03:58.490> strike<00:03:59.030> attack<00:03:59.210> arm<00:04:00.280> it

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
is it some sort of strike attack arm it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.490 
is it some sort of strike attack arm it
could<00:04:01.610> be<00:04:01.850> super<00:04:02.120> attacked<00:04:02.600> but<00:04:03.200> who<00:04:03.350> knows

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
could be super attacked but who knows

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.660 
could be super attacked but who knows
you<00:04:03.770> know<00:04:03.860> this<00:04:04.040> is<00:04:04.160> coming<00:04:04.400> from<00:04:04.520> a

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
you know this is coming from a

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.120 
you know this is coming from a
translation<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.560> who<00:04:06.560> knows<00:04:06.710> who<00:04:06.920> knows<00:04:06.950> who

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
translation and who knows who knows who

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.310 
translation and who knows who knows who
just<00:04:07.490> get<00:04:07.610> to<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.270> find<00:04:08.450> out<00:04:08.690> maybe<00:04:09.110> in

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
just get to have to find out maybe in

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.930 
just get to have to find out maybe in
Japanese<00:04:09.710> says<00:04:09.950> def<00:04:10.130> blow<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.520> English<00:04:10.730> is<00:04:10.850> a

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
Japanese says def blow and English is a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.750 
Japanese says def blow and English is a
super<00:04:11.240> attack<00:04:11.510> who<00:04:11.750> knows<00:04:11.960> okay<00:04:12.890> so<00:04:13.160> next<00:04:13.490> one

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
super attack who knows okay so next one

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.760 
super attack who knows okay so next one
is<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.330> want<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.720> increase<00:04:15.020> usable<00:04:15.440> characters

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
is I want to increase usable characters

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.280 
is I want to increase usable characters
not<00:04:15.920> Q<00:04:16.190> this<00:04:17.000> is<00:04:17.120> no<00:04:17.239> right<00:04:17.420> now<00:04:17.750> cue<00:04:17.960> ball<00:04:18.109> z

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
not Q this is no right now cue ball z

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.440 
not Q this is no right now cue ball z
thought<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:18.950> meant<00:04:19.280> um<00:04:19.489> increase<00:04:20.299> the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
thought that this meant um increase the

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.240 
thought that this meant um increase the
number<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:20.810> create<00:04:21.560> character<00:04:21.919> creation

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
number of create character creation

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.310 
number of create character creation
slots<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.760> can<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:23.419> because<00:04:23.720> if<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.110> didn't

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
slots you can have because if you didn't

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.000 
slots you can have because if you didn't
know<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:24.650> beta

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
know in a beta

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.190 
know in a beta
10<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:25.790> maybe<00:04:25.910> don't<00:04:26.030> get<00:04:26.360> ten<00:04:26.600> maybe<00:04:26.750> get<00:04:26.960> two

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
10 so maybe don't get ten maybe get two

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.170 
10 so maybe don't get ten maybe get two
and<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.500> have<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.710> build<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:27.980> up<00:04:28.130> this<00:04:28.550> way<00:04:28.910> oh

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
and you have to build it up this way oh
