00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
what happened last year at Kentucky a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.340 
what happened last year at Kentucky a
couple<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> times<00:01:33.780> had<00:01:33.990> gotten<00:01:34.170> together

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
couple of times had gotten together

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.109 
couple of times had gotten together
that's<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.920> he<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.159> angry<00:01:35.520> about<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.970> all

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that's what he was angry about so all

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.179 
that's what he was angry about so all
that<00:01:36.360> bubbles<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.079> surface<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:38.070> know

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
that bubbles to the surface you know

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
that bubbles to the surface you know
later<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.509> came<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.930> sunday

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
later on and that's what came up sunday

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.410 
later on and that's what came up sunday
and<00:01:40.380> i<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> rivalry<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:41.850> continue

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and i think the rivalry will continue

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899 
and i think the rivalry will continue
but<00:01:42.869> i<00:01:42.930> think<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.290> will<00:01:43.439> continue<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.189> bubble

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
but i think it will continue to bubble

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.520 
but i think it will continue to bubble
under<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.299> surface<00:01:45.509> until<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
under the surface until they get to a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.350 
under the surface until they get to a
place<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.950> Bristol<00:01:47.670> late<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> year

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
place like Bristol late in the year

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
place like Bristol late in the year
Martinsville<00:01:49.290> Richmond<00:01:49.799> similar<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
Martinsville Richmond similar like that

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.760 
Martinsville Richmond similar like that
where<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.210> repay<00:01:51.720> someone

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
where you can really repay someone

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.990 
where you can really repay someone
that's<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:53.009> it'll<00:01:53.189> come<00:01:53.250> back<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that's when it'll come back up but I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
that's when it'll come back up but I
think<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.390> great<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.810> having<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
think it's great I think having a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.709 
think it's great I think having a
rivalry<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.909> sort<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.240> simmering

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
rivalry like this just sort of simmering

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.450 
rivalry like this just sort of simmering
underneath<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> surface<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.860> fun<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.369> of

was questioning what was going on with

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.940 
was questioning what was going on with
stewart-haas<00:02:48.780> racing<00:02:49.320> earlier<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.740> year<00:02:49.800> I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
stewart-haas racing earlier this year I

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.320 
stewart-haas racing earlier this year I
never<00:02:50.220> really<00:02:50.430> questioned<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.300> think

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
never really questioned that and I think

never really questioned that and I think

points<00:02:57.720> he's<00:02:58.140> only<00:02:58.320> eight<00:02:58.590> points<00:02:59.070> out<00:02:59.190> of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
points he's only eight points out of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.790 
points he's only eight points out of
that<00:02:59.370> top<00:02:59.610> 16<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.450> getting<00:03:01.020> himself<00:03:01.140> into<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
that top 16 and getting himself into the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.260 
that top 16 and getting himself into the
chase<00:03:02.010> think<00:03:02.250> eventually<00:03:02.430> Tony<00:03:02.820> Stewart<00:03:03.090> will

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
chase think eventually Tony Stewart will

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.330 
chase think eventually Tony Stewart will
get<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.570> win<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.140> get<00:03:04.650> himself<00:03:04.800> into<00:03:05.190> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
get the win and get himself into the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.710 
get the win and get himself into the
chase<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.700> think<00:03:05.910> they<00:03:06.000> will<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.360> three<00:03:06.660> of

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
chase I think they will have three of

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.290 
chase I think they will have three of
the<00:03:06.780> four<00:03:06.990> cars<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:08.040> chase<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.550> year<00:03:08.880> but

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
the four cars in the chase this year but

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.760 
the four cars in the chase this year but
I<00:03:09.330> think<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.690> all<00:03:09.720> these<00:03:09.990> different<00:03:10.260> winners

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
I think with all these different winners

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.130 
I think with all these different winners
and<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.580> look<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:11.910> guys<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.090> Jimmie<00:03:12.570> Johnson

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
and you look at guys like Jimmie Johnson

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.320 
and you look at guys like Jimmie Johnson
you<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.740> Denny<00:03:13.980> Hamlin<00:03:14.490> Matt<00:03:14.730> Kenseth<00:03:15.210> all

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
you know Denny Hamlin Matt Kenseth all

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.700 
you know Denny Hamlin Matt Kenseth all
those<00:03:15.450> guys<00:03:15.630> haven't<00:03:16.080> won<00:03:16.230> yet<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.650> year

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
those guys haven't won yet this year

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.110 
those guys haven't won yet this year
we're<00:03:16.950> gonna<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.280> lot<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.550> winners<00:03:17.910> this

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
we're gonna have a lot of winners this

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.270 
we're gonna have a lot of winners this
year<00:03:18.180> plus<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:18.960> guys<00:03:19.110> like<00:03:19.380> Kyle<00:03:19.650> Larson

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
year plus you have guys like Kyle Larson

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.250 
year plus you have guys like Kyle Larson
knocking<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> door<00:03:21.270> getting<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.810> whim<00:03:21.990> I

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
knocking on the door getting the whim I

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.220 
knocking on the door getting the whim I
think<00:03:22.830> getting<00:03:23.100> yourself<00:03:23.550> in<00:03:23.730> via<00:03:24.480> points<00:03:25.080> is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
think getting yourself in via points is

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.230 
think getting yourself in via points is
shrinking<00:03:26.130> by<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.340> week<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.850> think<00:03:27.060> honestly

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
shrinking by the week I think honestly

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.030 
shrinking by the week I think honestly
you're<00:03:27.600> going<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.960> be<00:03:28.080> top<00:03:28.350> six<00:03:28.740> top

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
you're going to have to be top six top

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.880 
you're going to have to be top six top
seven<00:03:29.490> points<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.570> don't<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.020> win<00:03:31.320> to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
seven points if you don't have a win to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130 
seven points if you don't have a win to
get<00:03:32.070> yourself<00:03:32.490> into<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.970> chase<00:03:33.270> without<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
get yourself into the chase without a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.230 
get yourself into the chase without a
win<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.650> year<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.130> think<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.370> window<00:03:36.000> of

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
win this year so I think that window of

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.910 
win this year so I think that window of
saying<00:03:36.780> hey<00:03:36.960> we're<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.320> make<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.770> on

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
saying hey we're going to make it in on

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.860 
saying hey we're going to make it in on
points<00:03:38.430> points<00:03:38.640> still<00:03:38.970> matter<00:03:39.240> folks<00:03:39.570> don't

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
points points still matter folks don't

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.690 
points points still matter folks don't
think<00:03:40.050> it's<00:03:40.170> just<00:03:40.260> about<00:03:40.500> wins<00:03:40.830> points

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
think it's just about wins points

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.520 
think it's just about wins points
certainly<00:03:42.060> still<00:03:42.300> matter<00:03:42.570> but<00:03:43.170> i<00:03:43.200> think<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
certainly still matter but i think the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.050 
certainly still matter but i think the
window<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.890> get<00:03:44.070> yourself<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.550> on<00:03:44.670> points<00:03:45.000> a

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
window to get yourself in on points a

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.850 
window to get yourself in on points a
shrinking<00:03:45.540> every<00:03:45.750> week<00:03:46.170> when<00:03:46.440> we<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.680> all

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
shrinking every week when we get all

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.620 
shrinking every week when we get all
these<00:03:46.980> new<00:03:47.220> winners<00:03:47.520> in<00:03:47.730> speaking<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.240> texas

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
these new winners in speaking of texas

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.370 
and winners who's winning in texas well

don't worry folks and we went through

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.800 
don't worry folks and we went through
the<00:04:11.640> stretch<00:04:11.880> last<00:04:12.150> year<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.510> you'll<00:04:12.630> remember

the stretch last year if you'll remember

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.990 
the stretch last year if you'll remember
Jimmy<00:04:13.200> Johnson<00:04:13.620> was<00:04:13.770> dominating<00:04:14.400> races<00:04:14.850> and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
Jimmy Johnson was dominating races and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.729 
Jimmy Johnson was dominating races and
not<00:04:15.630> winning<00:04:16.020> them<00:04:16.140> that's<00:04:16.320> what<00:04:16.410> we've<00:04:16.560> had

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
not winning them that's what we've had

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.530 
not winning them that's what we've had
really<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.100> last<00:04:17.310> three<00:04:18.030> weeks<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.420> could

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
really the last three weeks you could

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.090 
really the last three weeks you could
argue<00:04:18.690> even<00:04:19.020> going<00:04:19.320> back<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.620> Bristol<00:04:19.980> they've

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
argue even going back to Bristol they've

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.830 
argue even going back to Bristol they've
had<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> car<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.580> could<00:04:20.850> win<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.330> race<00:04:21.540> but

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
had a car that could win the race but

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.690 
had a car that could win the race but

right<00:04:25.970> on<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.150> car<00:04:26.330> I<00:04:26.540> think<00:04:26.870> eventually

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
right on the car I think eventually

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.810 
right on the car I think eventually
Jimmie<00:04:27.590> Johnson<00:04:27.980> will<00:04:28.100> be<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.400> position<00:04:28.550> to
