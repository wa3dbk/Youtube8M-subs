00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
temperatures and also pH levels so I

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.220 
temperatures and also pH levels so I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
different fish you can have in

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.560 
different fish you can have in
aquaponics<00:00:54.770> freshwater<00:00:55.770> fish<00:00:56.039> obviously<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
aquaponics freshwater fish obviously you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.049 
aquaponics freshwater fish obviously you
can<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:58.020> barramundi<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.940> have

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
can have barramundi now you can have

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.680 
can have barramundi now you can have
trout<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.379> silver<00:01:01.829> perch<00:01:02.690> in

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
trout we can have silver perch in

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.780 
trout we can have silver perch in
Canberra<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> good<00:01:04.470> idea<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.670> have

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
Canberra a good idea is to have

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.570 
Canberra a good idea is to have
barramundi<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.659> summer<00:01:07.400> because<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.520> are

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
barramundi in summer because they are

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.039 
barramundi in summer because they are
very<00:01:08.729> fast<00:01:09.030> grower<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.600> grow<00:01:09.720> them<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:09.930> in

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
very fast grower you can grow them up in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.870 
very fast grower you can grow them up in
about<00:01:10.110> six<00:01:10.530> months<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.460> winter<00:01:11.640> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
about six months and then in winter you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
about six months and then in winter you
grow<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.510> rainbow<00:01:12.900> trout<00:01:13.400> overwinter

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
grow that the rainbow trout overwinter

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.359 
grow that the rainbow trout overwinter
they<00:01:14.640> take<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.119> six<00:01:15.330> months<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.689> well<00:01:15.900> turn

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
they take it out six months as well turn

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.539 
they take it out six months as well turn
to<00:01:17.369> grow<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.270> they're<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> good<00:01:18.720> fish<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> have

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
to grow so they're a good fish to have

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.620 
to grow so they're a good fish to have
people<00:01:20.549> also<00:01:21.090> use<00:01:21.240> yabbies<00:01:21.720> red<00:01:22.650> claw<00:01:23.540> can<00:01:24.540> be

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
people also use yabbies red claw can be

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.230 
people also use yabbies red claw can be
used<00:01:25.159> I've<00:01:26.159> even<00:01:26.490> heard<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.790> people<00:01:26.850> having

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
used I've even heard of people having

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.440 
used I've even heard of people having
saltwater<00:01:28.020> systems<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.880> grow<00:01:30.420> all

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
saltwater systems in which they grow all

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.160 
saltwater systems in which they grow all
sorts<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.990> saltwater<00:01:31.320> fish<00:01:31.650> including<00:01:32.400> prawns

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
sorts of saltwater fish including prawns

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.960 
sorts of saltwater fish including prawns
and<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.530> plants<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.310> tend<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> grow

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and the plants that they tend to grow

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.100 
and the plants that they tend to grow
are<00:01:36.420> algae<00:01:37.100> which<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.520> used<00:01:38.820> which<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.780> used

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
are algae which can be used which I used

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.420 
are algae which can be used which I used
for<00:01:40.790> making<00:01:41.790> biofuels<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.229> that's<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
for making biofuels so that's that's a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.740 
for making biofuels so that's that's a
thing<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> future<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.479> think<00:01:45.659> we're

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
thing of the future which I think we're

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.039 
thing of the future which I think we're
gonna<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> lot<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.439> soon<00:01:48.049> anyway

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
gonna see a lot more of soon anyway
