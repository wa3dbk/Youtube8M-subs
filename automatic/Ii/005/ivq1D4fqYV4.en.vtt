00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 I am in this holy place 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 at the temple of our ancestors, the Maya 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 This wonderful structure, which is so unusual, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 it was built in honor of the Great Father - the Sun. 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.500
 Every 5,200 years, we gather in this place 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 when the darkness covers the planet for 60 to 70 hours. 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.000
 You can not see the sun then. 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 Why? 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Because learned Mayan astronomers have discovered 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 that the Earth always moves around the Sun, 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 but now we are approaching time, 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.500
 when we cut the central magnetic axis. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 There is a large axis above Earth, 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.300
 which sets all stars and planets in motion. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.100
 So when the Earth passes through this axis, 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.500
 we do not see the sun's rays. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 We are inside. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 When the Earth reappears from this axis, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 we will then be able to see 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 New Sun. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 But I can not tell you 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 is this the same sun, 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 is it a different sun? 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.500
 Many people are abusing the Mayan calendar, 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.000
 scaring our people and speaking out threats, 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 saying that the end of the world will come, 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 that in 2012 the world will end. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.000
 So that's why I say 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 to all my brothers - do not be afraid. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 The sun will become invisible, 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 The earth will not see the sun, 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.500
 but we should understand 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 that it is like the New Year. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.500
 The old year ended today, December 31 ... tomorrow is January 1. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Happy New Year! 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.500
 We should wish for it when this day comes. 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.000
 We do not know the exact date, we can not say if it will be December 12, 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.500
 it can be in 2015, 2020 or later. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.000
 We have lost the exact date. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.500
 Maya 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.000
 during the night of darkness 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 they never extinguish a fire, 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 which is like a torch illuminating a long night, 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 before the New Sun appears
