00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.219
 when it was announced 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.070
 that the book fair was going to 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.269
 lay off 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.059
 Because reasons 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.880
 that there was a stockpile of many 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.710
 we outraged there was no 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.240
 reason to suspend the book fair 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 I could move the collection Santo Domingo 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.990
 and of course what you do not have 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.349
 have the sun occupied by the police 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.880
 the socket is for citizens and a lot 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.810
 more of the citizens for the same 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.200
 whom the pri fear of books 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.230
 was going to be suspended indefinitely 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.090
 then Fabricio decided to convene this 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.420
 current that I joined 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.850
 I am added and this to give books 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.850
 today in the factory socket is to say that no 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.800
 the fair was suspended fortunately 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.960
 since then now 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.550
 to the fair has recovered we are going to 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.710
 have book fair born from the middle and 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.000
 colleagues and the next one was inaugurated 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.940
 Wednesday 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.940
 and the tragedies of euripides 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.140
 the interpretation of dreams is not 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.140
 let's give it to the people 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.080
 and the culture 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.790
 so we are restoring the dialogue 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.940
 do not forget who I am 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.160
 I'm not the same as you are me but 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.020
 That's not why you stopped keeping yourself 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.430
 I'm not an anarchist hired by 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.720
 governance 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.119
 I am a free writer 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.300
 I come to win an anthology of 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.290

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.790
