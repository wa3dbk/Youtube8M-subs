00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.980
 as well 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.560
 Y 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.300
 or the friendly friends taxis of this 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.550
 activity that we are going to see the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.460
 style of Juan Valdivia guitarist 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.890
 soloist to leave the silence a grupazo 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.620
 one of the biggest rock bands 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.199
 in Spanish he is a guitarist who uses 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.239
 much the resource of the species one of 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.970
 the most used resources in the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.490
 guitar so if you're tuning colleague 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.380
 playing 62 guitars one is playing 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.780
 the chords and the other does not know very well 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 what to do does not want to touch the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.040
 same notes in the same frets as 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.550
 you can pull arpeggios ie 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.000
 place chords all over the mast 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.860
 to do it in depth right now to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.550
 get a sound similar to Juan's 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.470
 valdivia we can use a little bear 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.590
 drive but little because we have to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.180
 get clean in the notes is worth 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 we understand that there is cleanliness and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.050
 clarity and then it also helps a lot 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.150
 having an effect like chorus 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.930
 to achieve a similar sound an effect 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.380
 that was used a lot in the 80s and juan 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.460
 valdivia because he used it a lot 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.040
 well now we start with the arpeggios 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.000
 there are two parts the first part we are 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.000
 with a minor if a lower sustained re f 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.490
 so maybe your colleague is 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.570
 doing this the ximÃ©nez 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.570
 for sharp 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.370
 and what are you going to do there in juan 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.830
 valdivia of art and storm because you go 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.110
 over here and we put a minor yes here 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.310
 this comes from here so we take advantage 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.650
 the fret 9 of the fourth the third and 7 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.880
 of the second so we have a yes 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:37.950
 minor and we're playing that note that note 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.140
 now part of the corde of the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.640
 king is the fifth is the is that is the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.640
 fifth of the king because now a king comes 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.390
 we are still in a network but also 7 7 and 9 7 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.550
 are part of the network, this is part 7 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.310
 of the king but and this 9 is not part of 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.220
 network but if the scale is worth it because 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.230
 we have to stick only to the chords 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.360
 to the notes of the chord we can also 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.370
 get out a bit of the chord and play a 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.790
 note that it falls within the scale 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.969
 because we are in the tonality of 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.620
 of the greater or sustained minor that is what 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:17.150
 same so 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.150
 we started first compass 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.930
 now comes the lowest sustained fa 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.700
 colleague is touching the sharp you 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.920
 You Placing a minor to F sharp 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.420
 sustained minor here but taking advantage 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 the finest strings the three 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.250
 first and let's play this well 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.660
 I'm treading on that 19 well let's go 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.660
 play as a third string 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.799
 and 9a 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.079
 it is not part of the queue but 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.989
 yes of the scale because now we are going to 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:58.689
 come to my older and older but also 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:00.460
 is this greater or this that we can 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.400
 to play 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:09.700
 all this is pretty much what you can you can 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:12.550
 employ a lot of chance and whatever 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.510
 come on, it's pretty free, so 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.860
 since the junior sharp fa we have 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.860
 you can also come to a slide 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:28.969
 and now I start from the youngest one again ' 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.969
 slowly if smaller 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.259
 I have sustained minor 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.259
 I repeat myself 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.880
 and now the second part would come in the 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.490
 that we use one side 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.270
 saw 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:00.030
 Minor sharp and a king 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.510
 because with the side you go here to the most 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.510
 classic 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.160
 the game is determined 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.819
 the nature is very clear now comes the 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.819
 my 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.629
 Maybe your colleague is touching the cni 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.629
 here 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.750
 it could be the here 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.290
 and my colleague is playing in me here you 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.750
 what are you doing then you touch on me here the most 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.839
 classic look at the fret 1 of the 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.839
 third string and then 0 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.839
 10 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.930
 and 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.310
 the lowest sustained fa 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.100
 let your colleague touch it here because you 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.940
 you will be playing for someone and for 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.979
 no repeat 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.660
 the same notes of the same frets 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.820
 so one that looks up here and the 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.789
 another down here you go here 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.789
 down arpeggiator men and let's make a 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.090
 and 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.979
 this note per octave is the same as 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.979
 still part of the chord 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:26.780
 and in the king and your partner does this 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.160
 place this major re and you go to 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.780
 place it there is worth and 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.350
 p 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.890
 all right 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.890
 t 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:44.259
 there that note is not part of the chord 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.259
 but it is part of the scale 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.370
 so everything slowly the second part 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.370
 it would be like 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.090
 and 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:04.779
 and 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.210
 Well, art is a very important resource 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.850
 used of the most used in the 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.310
 blackboard and it does not matter in blues rock style 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.200
 metal country whatever it is even 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.000
 electronic if you give yourself a bit the 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.000
 electronics you've seen in asturias 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.020
 well, I encourage you to give it a reed 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.730
 to take a look at our 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.800
 monographic courses because we have 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:39.750
 all oak blues courses 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.750
 beginner of 30 tonic
