00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
so these are real simple to make let's

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.580 
so these are real simple to make let's
go<00:00:28.730> over<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:28.970> materials<00:00:29.540> first<00:00:29.780> for<00:00:30.470> the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
go over the materials first for the

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.350 
go over the materials first for the
headband<00:00:31.070> material<00:00:31.580> itself<00:00:31.940> is<00:00:32.060> going<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.270> be

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
headband material itself is going to be

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.450 
headband material itself is going to be
this<00:00:32.510> f<00:00:32.750> OE<00:00:33.080> or<00:00:33.560> what<00:00:33.740> we<00:00:33.860> call<00:00:34.040> fold<00:00:34.310> over

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
this f OE or what we call fold over

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.090 
this f OE or what we call fold over
elastic<00:00:34.960> okay<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.590> comes<00:00:36.770> in<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.980> variety

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
elastic okay and it comes in a variety

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.640 
elastic okay and it comes in a variety
of<00:00:37.400> widths<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.030> sizes<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.630> if<00:00:39.080> you're<00:00:39.320> in<00:00:39.530> a

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
of widths and sizes and if you're in a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.860 
of widths and sizes and if you're in a
pinch<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:40.160> can't<00:00:40.460> find<00:00:40.700> fo<00:00:41.060> e<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:41.720> can

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
pinch and you can't find fo e you can

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.900 
pinch and you can't find fo e you can
always<00:00:42.050> use<00:00:42.350> just<00:00:42.590> plain<00:00:42.830> all<00:00:43.070> elastic<00:00:43.670> but<00:00:43.880> I

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
always use just plain all elastic but I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.150 
always use just plain all elastic but I
find<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.660> fold<00:00:44.960> over<00:00:45.170> elastic<00:00:45.320> is<00:00:45.860> a<00:00:45.890> lot

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
find that the fold over elastic is a lot

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.310 
find that the fold over elastic is a lot
more<00:00:46.370> smooth<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.420> it's<00:00:47.660> more<00:00:47.840> comfortable

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
more smooth and it's more comfortable

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.720 
more smooth and it's more comfortable
especially<00:00:48.500> if<00:00:48.890> you're<00:00:49.010> making<00:00:49.340> these<00:00:49.460> for

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
especially if you're making these for

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.240 
especially if you're making these for
babies<00:00:50.120> or<00:00:50.360> young<00:00:50.630> children<00:00:50.900> okay<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:52.040> have

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
them in two different sizes here this is

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.140

be stretching okay and it is permanent
and<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:20.480> non-toxic<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:21.680> is<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.920> one

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
go back a whole nother row if you wanted

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.460 
go back a whole nother row if you wanted
to<00:03:13.120> okay<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.630> Risa<00:03:15.170> cure<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.530> in<00:03:15.650> place

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
to okay just to Risa cure that in place

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.020 
to okay just to Risa cure that in place
and<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.590> can<00:03:18.740> see<00:03:18.770> I<00:03:18.980> have<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.280> headband<00:03:19.790> done

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
and you can see I have a headband done

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.150 
and you can see I have a headband done
you<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:20.690> go<00:03:20.840> on<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.050> inside<00:03:21.530> here<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:21.980> just

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
you can go on the inside here and just

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.050 
you can go on the inside here and just
cut<00:03:22.550> off<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:22.940> excess<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.800> there<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:28.490> okay

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
cut off that excess and there it is okay

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.640 
cut off that excess and there it is okay
so<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.510> what<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.780> outside<00:03:30.200> is<00:03:30.320> going<00:03:30.350> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
so this is what the outside is going to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.020 
so this is what the outside is going to
look<00:03:30.800> like<00:03:30.950> now<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.490> have<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.730> few<00:03:31.940> different

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
look like now you have a few different

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.330 
look like now you have a few different
options<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.840> leave<00:03:33.080> this<00:03:33.290> mark<00:03:33.680> as<00:03:33.890> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
options you can leave this mark as the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.220 
options you can leave this mark as the
back<00:03:34.580> side<00:03:34.880> or<00:03:35.150> if<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.570> wanted<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.900> just<00:03:36.050> look

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
back side or if you wanted to just look

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.290 
back side or if you wanted to just look
like<00:03:36.290> one<00:03:36.650> continuous<00:03:37.370> loop<00:03:37.820> for<00:03:38.270> your

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
like one continuous loop for your

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.970 
like one continuous loop for your
headband<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:38.990> you<00:03:39.080> don't<00:03:39.260> see<00:03:39.470> this<00:03:39.590> actual

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
headband so you don't see this actual

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.130 
headband so you don't see this actual
seen<00:03:40.220> what<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.880> can<00:03:40.910> do<00:03:41.240> is<00:03:41.480> glue<00:03:41.930> your

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
seen what you can do is glue your

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.750 
seen what you can do is glue your
embellishment<00:03:42.740> right<00:03:42.830> where<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.160> seam<00:03:43.550> meet

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
embellishment right where that seam meet

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.970 
embellishment right where that seam meet
so<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.030> get<00:03:44.270> a<00:03:44.300> cleaner<00:03:44.810> finish<00:03:45.110> since<00:03:45.800> it's

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
so you get a cleaner finish since it's

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.680 
so you get a cleaner finish since it's
gonna<00:03:46.070> be<00:03:46.250> hidden<00:03:46.459> under<00:03:46.820> there<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.540> that's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
gonna be hidden under there so that's

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.490 
gonna be hidden under there so that's
what<00:03:47.780> I'm<00:03:47.930> gonna<00:03:48.050> do
