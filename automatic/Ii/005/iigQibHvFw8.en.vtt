00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
coming in at number 2 is the sm 1

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.530 
coming in at number 2 is the sm 1
magnitude<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.439> thing<00:03:16.650> goes<00:03:16.829> up<00:03:17.099> to<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:18.209> range

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
magnitude this thing goes up to in range

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.380 
magnitude this thing goes up to in range
and<00:03:18.900> two<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.950> goes<00:03:20.189> down<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.459> immobility<00:03:21.090> I

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and two it goes down to immobility I

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.899 
and two it goes down to immobility I
believe<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.200> truly<00:03:22.799> awesome<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:23.370> suggest

believe this is truly awesome I suggest
you<00:03:23.969> put<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.239> red<00:03:24.480> dot<00:03:24.689> sight<00:03:24.989> for<00:03:25.829> grip<00:03:26.069> and

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
you put a red dot sight for grip and

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.380 
you put a red dot sight for grip and
then<00:03:28.099> doesn't<00:03:29.099> really<00:03:29.250> matter<00:03:29.640> between<00:03:29.970> these

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
then doesn't really matter between these

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.390 
then doesn't really matter between these
two<00:03:30.659> but<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.349> can<00:03:31.500> eat<00:03:31.620> put<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.799> quick<00:03:32.010> draw<00:03:32.189> or
