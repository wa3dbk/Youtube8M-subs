one<00:00:30.060> second<00:00:30.859> okay<00:00:31.859> let's<00:00:32.309> get<00:00:33.149> into<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
one second okay let's get into the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.770 
one second okay let's get into the
comparison<00:00:34.140> first<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.620> let's<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.040> how

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
comparison first of all let's see how

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.180 
comparison first of all let's see how
you<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> lot<00:00:37.440> easier<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you see here is a lot easier and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:55.000 
you see here is a lot easier and
smoother<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.030> one

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:03.369 

okay<00:00:55.940> let's<00:00:56.210> check<00:00:56.329> out<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.219> sayings<00:01:02.019> so<00:01:03.019> it's

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
okay let's check out the sayings so it's

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.170 
okay let's check out the sayings so it's
just<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.589> little<00:01:03.829> bit<00:01:03.920> faster<00:01:04.369> not<00:01:04.640> too<00:01:04.879> much

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
just a little bit faster not too much

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:16.100 
just a little bit faster not too much
but<00:01:05.540> still<00:01:05.840> significant

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.550 

the<00:01:16.770> dredge<00:01:17.070> running<00:01:17.100> two<00:01:17.730> point<00:01:18.270> zero<00:01:18.600> point

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the dredge running two point zero point

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.940 
the dredge running two point zero point
1<00:01:19.770> i'd<00:01:20.580> say<00:01:21.000> said<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.480> one's<00:01:21.690> running<00:01:21.870> 2.1<00:01:22.440> so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
1 i'd say said this one's running 2.1 so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
1 i'd say said this one's running 2.1 so
i'm<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.610> shout<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.120> but<00:01:24.450> i<00:01:24.690> guess

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
i'm going to shout out that but i guess

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.490 
i'm going to shout out that but i guess
maybe<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.800> is<00:01:25.920> i<00:01:26.190> don't<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:27.200> because<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
maybe it is i don't know because a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.900 
maybe it is i don't know because a
segway<00:01:29.010> supposed<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.370> two<00:01:29.610> point<00:01:29.850> zero

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
segway supposed to be two point zero

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.020 
segway supposed to be two point zero
point<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.890> just<00:01:31.890> 2.1<00:01:32.370> i<00:01:32.490> guess<00:01:32.760> as<00:01:32.940> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
point one but just 2.1 i guess as you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.480 
point one but just 2.1 i guess as you
can<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.300> here<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:34.979> two<00:01:35.220> point<00:01:35.430> zero

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
can see here and this is two point zero

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.770 
can see here and this is two point zero
point<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.820> system<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.660> to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
point one so just in your system just to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.000 
point one so just in your system just to
let<00:01:40.260> you<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:41.150> as<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.290> bottom<00:01:43.560> he<00:01:43.740> had<00:01:43.979> a

doesn't work on this device so let me
show<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.330> how<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:12.840> happens<00:02:19.250> when<00:02:20.250> I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
already on to a disk device on average

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.509 
already on to a disk device on average
to<00:02:24.510> start<00:02:24.780> Wi-Fi<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.370> little

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
to start Wi-Fi so that's the little

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.979 
to start Wi-Fi so that's the little
under<00:02:26.880> would<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> still<00:02:27.660> working<00:02:27.900> on

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
under would like to I still working on

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.630 
under would like to I still working on
that<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.500> should<00:02:28.739> be<00:02:28.769> available<00:02:29.190> soon

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
that and it should be available soon

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.940 
that and it should be available soon
enough<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.120> at<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.049> current<00:02:31.260> moment<00:02:31.530> it's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
enough but at the current moment it's

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.640 
enough but at the current moment it's
not<00:02:32.220> available<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.959> was<00:02:34.200> same<00:02:34.440> thing<00:02:34.590> a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
not available it was same thing a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:44.380 
not available it was same thing a
bluetooth<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.310> not<00:02:35.459> available<00:02:39.920> ok

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.850 

surprisingly<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> hd2<00:02:45.870> hd2<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.380> pretty<00:02:46.620> fast

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
surprisingly the hd2 hd2 is pretty fast

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.200 
surprisingly the hd2 hd2 is pretty fast
with<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.160> because<00:02:47.460> even<00:02:47.910> though<00:02:48.030> it's<00:02:48.180> not

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
with this because even though it's not

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.940 
with this because even though it's not
actually<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> original<00:02:49.020> system<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.740> pretty

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
actually the original system is pretty

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.050 
actually the original system is pretty
smooth<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:56.190> since<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.520> windows<00:02:56.760> mobile<00:02:56.880> is

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
smooth and since this windows mobile is

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
smooth and since this windows mobile is
the<00:02:57.150> understand<00:02:57.540> i<00:02:57.630> can<00:02:57.720> actually<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:58.050> this

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.410 

okay<00:05:13.410> so<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.700> on-screen<00:05:14.970> keyboard<00:05:15.090> is

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
okay so that the on-screen keyboard is

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.970 
okay so that the on-screen keyboard is
pretty<00:05:15.570> good<00:05:15.750> on<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.290> remember<00:05:16.860> this

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
pretty good on it and remember this

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.090 
pretty good on it and remember this
device<00:05:17.310> can<00:05:17.730> pretty<00:05:17.970> much<00:05:18.030> sox<00:05:18.860> since<00:05:19.860> it's

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
device can pretty much sox since it's

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:30.170 
device can pretty much sox since it's
against<00:05:20.820> a<00:05:21.000> state<00:05:21.240> test<00:05:21.480> build<00:05:28.610> on<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.940> of

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
against a state test build on this of

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.800 
against a state test build on this of
course<00:05:30.240> has<00:05:30.510> a<00:05:30.540> keyboard<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:32.430> this<00:05:32.810> the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
course has a keyboard and this the

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.700 
course has a keyboard and this the
rotate<00:05:34.290> I<00:05:35.750> think<00:05:36.750> I<00:05:38.960> guess<00:05:39.960> is<00:05:40.140> one<00:05:40.350> rotate

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
rotate I think I guess is one rotate

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.040 
rotate I think I guess is one rotate
right<00:05:40.860> now<00:05:43.460> rotate<00:05:44.460> know<00:05:44.640> okay<00:05:45.600> so<00:05:45.660> that's

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
right now rotate know okay so that's

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.920 
right now rotate know okay so that's
pretty<00:05:46.380> much<00:05:46.440> all<00:05:46.710> um<00:05:50.090> the<00:05:51.090> day<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.780> the

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
pretty much all um the day of the

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.040 
pretty much all um the day of the
performance<00:05:52.050> itself<00:05:52.470> is<00:05:52.740> pretty<00:05:52.950> similar

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
performance itself is pretty similar

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.640 
performance itself is pretty similar
same<00:05:55.050> lock<00:05:55.350> screen<00:05:56.660> this<00:05:57.660> is<00:05:57.810> newer<00:05:58.170> system<00:05:58.560> I

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
same lock screen this is newer system I

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.740 
same lock screen this is newer system I
guess<00:05:58.710> apparently<00:05:59.040> the<00:05:59.430> newer<00:05:59.670> system<00:06:00.090> is

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
guess apparently the newer system is

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:13.460 
guess apparently the newer system is
almost<00:06:01.050> as<00:06:01.260> smooth

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.690 

and<00:06:14.870> yeah<00:06:15.870> if<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:16.830> want<00:06:16.980> to<00:06:17.040> try<00:06:17.160> to<00:06:17.220> Sodom<00:06:17.610> you
