you're not even going to notice it and

you're not even going to notice it and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
due to the weight do you really don't

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.139 
due to the weight do you really don't
notice<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.640> your<00:01:56.729> pocket

now speaking of weight the weight with

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
now speaking of weight the weight with
the<00:01:59.610> combination<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> sticky<00:02:00.750> strip<00:02:01.229> on

the combination of the sticky strip on
the<00:02:01.469> bottom<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.460> does<00:02:02.610> make<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> nice

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the bottom really does make a nice

the bottom really does make a nice
combination<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.840> if<00:02:04.020> you're<00:02:04.259> using<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.710> in

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
combination that if you're using this in

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.580 
combination that if you're using this in
cradle<00:02:05.250> mode<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.270> definitely<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:07.020> still<00:02:07.380> use

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
cradle mode you definitely can still use

and it ruled it slides but fortunately
with<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.840> combination<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:21.160> really<00:02:21.459> does

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
with that combination it really does

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.580 
with that combination it really does
hold<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.270> nice<00:02:22.510> job<00:02:22.540> holding<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.380> in

this<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.200> only<00:02:26.350> thing<00:02:26.620> i<00:02:26.740> really<00:02:26.950> would

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
this the only thing i really would

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.650 
this the only thing i really would
change<00:02:27.550> because<00:02:27.819> i<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.209> do<00:02:28.300> believe<00:02:28.330> this

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
change because i really do believe this

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.840 
change because i really do believe this
is<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.870> really<00:02:29.140> nice<00:02:29.290> device<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.980> led

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
is a really nice device is led

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.699 
is a really nice device is led
brightness<00:02:31.360> they<00:02:31.840> are<00:02:32.080> definitely<00:02:32.290> bright

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
brightness they are definitely bright

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.440 
brightness they are definitely bright
enough<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.280> one<00:02:33.610> you're<00:02:33.820> out<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.090> about<00:02:34.150> you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
enough that one you're out and about you

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.540 
enough that one you're out and about you
can<00:02:34.630> always<00:02:35.050> tell<00:02:35.290> how<00:02:35.560> much<00:02:36.070> battery<00:02:36.370> power

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
can always tell how much battery power

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.930 
can always tell how much battery power
in<00:02:37.090> life<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.450> have<00:02:37.480> left<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.620> unfortunately

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
in life you have left but unfortunately

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.340 
in life you have left but unfortunately
whenever<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.390> fully<00:02:40.720> charged<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
whenever this is fully charged it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.500 
whenever this is fully charged it
actually<00:02:41.739> will<00:02:41.950> light<00:02:42.280> up<00:02:42.459> all<00:02:42.819> three<00:02:43.300> lights

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
actually will light up all three lights

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.570 
actually will light up all three lights
at<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> same<00:02:44.020> time<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.620> then<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.400> will<00:02:45.520> just

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
at the same time and then it will just

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.880 
at the same time and then it will just
continuously<00:02:46.270> flicker<00:02:46.570> on<00:02:46.690> off<00:02:47.140> all<00:02:47.470> three<00:02:47.770> at

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
continuously flicker on off all three at

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.560 
continuously flicker on off all three at
once<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.820> i<00:02:48.850> would<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.270> much<00:02:49.540> rather

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
once so i would have much rather

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.630 
once so i would have much rather
preferred<00:02:50.170> seeing<00:02:50.530> them<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.190> leave<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
preferred seeing them just leave the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.270 
preferred seeing them just leave the
third<00:02:51.850> LED<00:02:52.269> static<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.440> way<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.650> know<00:02:54.070> it's

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
third LED static that way you know it's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.220 
third LED static that way you know it's
charged<00:02:54.580> but<00:02:54.910> it's<00:02:55.150> not<00:02:55.330> all<00:02:55.510> three<00:02:55.870> LEDs

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
charged but it's not all three LEDs

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.410 
charged but it's not all three LEDs
because<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.910> quite<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.150> powerful

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
because with that it is quite a powerful

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.530 
because with that it is quite a powerful
combination<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.500> it<00:03:00.370> really<00:03:00.550> will<00:03:00.880> light<00:03:01.390> up

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
combination and it really will light up

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.560 
combination and it really will light up
a<00:03:01.810> good<00:03:02.170> section<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.800> room<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.940> overall

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
a good section of the room but overall

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.479 
a good section of the room but overall
