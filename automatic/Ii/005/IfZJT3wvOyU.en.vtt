using it is if you go fast it comes
flying<00:02:00.639> out<00:02:00.999> and<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.450> can<00:02:01.630> get<00:02:01.749> everywhere

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
flying out and it can get everywhere

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.830

Tarek's<00:02:04.359> that<00:02:04.569> fast

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
Tarek's that fast

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.139 
Tarek's that fast
it's<00:02:06.110> hard<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.380> control<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.950> fast<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.030> can

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it's hard to control it fast so you can

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.779 
it's hard to control it fast so you can
slow<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.450> down<00:02:08.570> so<00:02:09.530> we've<00:02:09.710> done<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.070> pretty<00:02:10.399> darn
