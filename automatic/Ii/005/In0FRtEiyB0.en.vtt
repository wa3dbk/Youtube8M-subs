00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 no no 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.139
 we go 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.610
 let's improve things in safe defense 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.930
 that does not mean we're not going to 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.480
 learn some game that we are not going to 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.640
 fit goals 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.210
 but improve without any doubt we continue 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.820
 working and also how it should be 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 work to improve our our 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.140
 individual and collective performance 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.879
 I still think there is room for improvement and 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.060
 I repeat that does not mean that the rival does not 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.200
 have no parties or not you 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.850
 or I can not give you goals in fact 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.250
 that these days we have done some 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.810
 things not in the most appropriate way what 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.070
 what happens is how it does not cost a goal or not 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.250
 They cost points because it seems that everything 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.370
 all right 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.050
 I already said this a few days ago it's a continuous 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.230
 improvement work going 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.880
 and perfected to go looking 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.150
 a global context that will make you more 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.150
 strong 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.420
 we go back to the usual 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.350
 what do you want to play that all all of you 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.080
 I would like to play 90 minutes if I understand 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.820
 but we go back to the 27 everyone wants a 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040
 list everyone wants to play and that's 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.040
 impossible nothing this was a situation 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.970
 normal that happens in football 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.350
 usually when a player feels 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.119
 much pain and thinks he can not continue 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.409
 and then suddenly you see that you are 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.570
 better but the mister and he has decided to do 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.280
 the change is over there is no 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.289
 controversial no mess between the player 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.570
 another one comes out and the main thing is always the 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.600
 team gets angry more or less is part 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.909
 of the person of each one I leave it in 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.020
 quarantine and I focus on what's important 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.290
 that is the moment that is the performance 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.270
 of the players working 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.970
 but that is not so but that all fail 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.700
 less us but that that has a 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.409
 added difficulty 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.079
 well you take it so it was seen that there was 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.820
 three clearly highlighted teams and that 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.100
 they practically lost nothing with 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.960
 which was a championship 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.239
 exciting this year may be the same 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.640
 version can not be another similar by 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.180
 soon we see a valencia or sevilla 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.170
 also very good looking and athletic 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.480
 from madrid-real madrid will be up 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.849
 sure in the dispute with us that is 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.200
 that we will see the evolution of 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.530
 days we only have 4 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.540
 we are 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.900
 no no I do not have it at all because it goes 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.069
 to pass insurance is more I would sign 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.810
 fit a goal in every game of all 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.819
 the championship and win every game that is 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.819
 the goal here is to fit 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.000
 not to not fit because it is very good as 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.660
 reinforcement but rivals also play 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.660
 have had their options 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.909
 and we will not have our goal to be 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.650
 better than the rival do many more 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.569
 things better than them and there will be matches 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.569
 that they have done that we will lose 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.579
 and so it is routed to be more what 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.739
 I understand as something until necessary 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.799
 because as much as I could get angry 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.939
 will not change, I do not intend to change 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.260
 part of my position as coach 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.260
 know how to accept all this and 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.879
 here is going to be criticism we always win 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.069
 we lose and we win because it does not convince if 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.260
 we lose because it is a disaster if the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.120
 position of the rival or cayetano 08 la 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.579
 possession we already have to have a series 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.500
 of football concepts that always 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.049
 they're going to surround the team it's about 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.450
 face them with the greatest naturalness and 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.459
 tranquility 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.690
 and improve improving in teams is my 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.160
 true work that is my only 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.410
 obsession to improve my team 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.660
 continuously without having it there is the 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.519
 be called and I still have to evacuate 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.819
 his last layer of memories for 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.819
 Thank you
