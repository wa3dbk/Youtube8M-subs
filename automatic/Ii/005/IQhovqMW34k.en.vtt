to animate pictures and make sounds on

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.759 
to animate pictures and make sounds on
them<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.330> stuff<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.170> that's<00:02:45.290> what<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.500> mean

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.280 
them and stuff so that's what I mean
it's<00:02:46.040> just<00:02:46.670> awesome<00:02:47.239> some<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.810> our<00:02:47.900> students

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
it's just awesome some of our students

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.380 
it's just awesome some of our students
are<00:02:48.500> starting<00:02:48.859> to<00:02:48.890> place<00:02:49.519> their<00:02:49.790> games<00:02:50.000> into

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
are starting to place their games into

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.930 
are starting to place their games into
virtual<00:02:50.959> reality<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.829> you<00:02:52.340> actually<00:02:52.519> put<00:02:52.820> on

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
virtual reality so you actually put on

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.729 
virtual reality so you actually put on
the<00:02:53.090> goggles<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.690> then<00:02:53.780> you're<00:02:53.930> immersed<00:02:54.410> in

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
the goggles and then you're immersed in

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.590 
the goggles and then you're immersed in
ancient<00:02:54.920> Hawaiian<00:02:55.489> you<00:02:55.609> look<00:02:55.820> around<00:02:56.180> so

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
ancient Hawaiian you look around so

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.900 
ancient Hawaiian you look around so
within<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.230> virtual<00:02:57.650> world<00:02:57.920> for<00:02:58.250> example<00:02:58.670> we

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
within that virtual world for example we

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.030 
within that virtual world for example we
have<00:02:59.150> students<00:02:59.569> working<00:02:59.780> on<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.530> version<00:03:00.950> of

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
have students working on a version of

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.150 
have students working on a version of
the<00:03:01.160> Hokulea<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.760> double<00:03:02.450> halt<00:03:02.920> sailing<00:03:03.920> canoe

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
the Hokulea a double halt sailing canoe

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.520 
the Hokulea a double halt sailing canoe
and<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:05.209> idea<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.510> they're<00:03:05.840> going<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.109> build<00:03:06.290> a

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
and the idea is they're going to build a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.710 
and the idea is they're going to build a
minigame<00:03:06.980> where<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.790> learn<00:03:08.030> how<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.299> sail

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
minigame where you learn how to sail

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.809 
minigame where you learn how to sail
such<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.260> canoe<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.920> then<00:03:10.489> they're<00:03:10.609> going<00:03:10.640> to

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
such a canoe and then they're going to

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.360 
such a canoe and then they're going to
take<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.120> across<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.380> students<00:03:13.250> who've

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
take it across to the students who've

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.740 
take it across to the students who've
been<00:03:13.489> collaborating<00:03:13.880> with<00:03:14.180> them<00:03:14.510> in

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
been collaborating with them in

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.050 
been collaborating with them in
countries<00:03:15.560> as<00:03:15.680> far<00:03:15.920> away<00:03:16.010> as<00:03:16.130> Singapore<00:03:16.850> and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
countries as far away as Singapore and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.690 
countries as far away as Singapore and
Japan<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.109> they<00:03:18.260> work<00:03:18.470> together<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:19.220> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
Japan so they work together in the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.940 
Japan so they work together in the
shared<00:03:20.000> space<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:20.810> virtual<00:03:21.350> world<00:03:21.380> so

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
shared space of this virtual world so

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.280 
shared space of this virtual world so
the<00:03:22.700> important<00:03:23.120> thing<00:03:23.239> about<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.840> Hokulea

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
the important thing about the Hokulea

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.020 
the important thing about the Hokulea
and<00:03:24.560> working<00:03:24.889> with<00:03:25.010> students<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.459> Japan<00:03:25.790> and

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
develop a fish and see how that fish

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.590 
develop a fish and see how that fish
actually<00:03:57.550> moves<00:03:57.790> through<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.000> water<00:03:58.330> so

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
actually moves through the water so

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.410 
actually moves through the water so
they're<00:03:58.750> actually<00:03:58.900> learning<00:03:59.290> about<00:03:59.590> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
they're actually learning about the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.580 
they're actually learning about the
content<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.510> we<00:04:01.600> need<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.900> know<00:04:02.050> in<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.290> formal

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590

content that we need to know in a formal
educational<00:04:03.040> setting<00:04:03.370> but<00:04:03.580> then<00:04:03.700> they're

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
educational setting but then they're

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.360 
educational setting but then they're
also<00:04:04.000> exploring<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.500> how<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.830> interacts

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
also exploring it to how that interacts

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.460 
also exploring it to how that interacts
with<00:04:06.490> another<00:04:06.880> fish<00:04:07.209> within<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.959> virtual

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470

right now with Bishop Museum and
creative<00:04:12.370> academies<00:04:12.820> is<00:04:13.000> looking<00:04:13.270> at<00:04:13.450> how<00:04:13.690> we

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
creative academies is looking at how we

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.319 
creative academies is looking at how we
can<00:04:14.140> create<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:15.250> ecosystem<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:15.760> Hawaii<00:04:16.060> and

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
can create the ecosystem of Hawaii and

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.090 
can create the ecosystem of Hawaii and
the<00:04:16.419> alp<00:04:16.720> wha<00:04:16.930> which<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.590> actually<00:04:17.769> the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
the alp wha which is actually the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.440 
the alp wha which is actually the
watershed<00:04:18.640> from<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:18.940> top<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.299> mountain

to<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.870> bottom<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.260> sea<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.739> how<00:04:21.130> ancient

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
to the bottom of the sea and how ancient

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.090 
to the bottom of the sea and how ancient
hawaiians<00:04:21.970> would<00:04:22.090> actually<00:04:22.620> rely<00:04:23.620> on<00:04:23.919> the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
hawaiians would actually rely on the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.730 
hawaiians would actually rely on the
Agua<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:25.270> actually<00:04:25.600> survive<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.590> we're

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740
