00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
tired of it running off of this 12 volt

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.560 
tired of it running off of this 12 volt
power<00:00:10.019> source<00:00:10.860> here<00:00:11.309> which<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:12.360> is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
power source here which that is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.860 
power source here which that is
connected<00:00:13.519> which<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:15.179> connected<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.690> the

carburetor<00:00:16.430> it's<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.580> kill<00:00:17.820> switch<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
carburetor it's a kill switch for the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.090 
carburetor it's a kill switch for the
carburetor<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.109> case<00:00:19.289> your<00:00:19.470> throttle<00:00:19.859> sticks

carburetor in case your throttle sticks

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.609 
carburetor in case your throttle sticks
wide<00:00:20.310> open<00:00:20.760> it's<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> 12-volt<00:00:22.410> power

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
wide open it's just a 12-volt power

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.679 
wide open it's just a 12-volt power
source<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> headlight<00:00:23.880> gets<00:00:24.119> dim<00:00:24.420> when

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
source and the headlight gets dim when

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.120 
source and the headlight gets dim when
you're<00:00:24.869> idling<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.560> bright<00:00:25.769> when<00:00:26.010> you're

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
you're idling and bright when you're

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.130 
you're idling and bright when you're
revving<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.330> went<00:00:27.480> ahead<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> took<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
revving so I went ahead and took one of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.130 
revving so I went ahead and took one of
my<00:00:28.320> RC<00:00:29.099> car<00:00:29.340> batteries<00:00:29.869> mounted<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> up

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
my RC car batteries mounted it up

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560 
my RC car batteries mounted it up
underneath<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.740> handlebar<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.390> it's

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
underneath the handlebar here and it's

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.560 
underneath the handlebar here and it's
an<00:00:33.719> 11-point<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.850> three<00:00:35.850> cell<00:00:36.090> light<00:00:36.360> bulb

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
an 11-point one three cell light bulb

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.360 
an 11-point one three cell light bulb
batteries<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.530> plug<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.100> right

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
batteries so I can just plug it in right

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.600 
batteries so I can just plug it in right
in<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.770> then<00:00:40.770> I'll<00:00:40.950> stand<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> can

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
in there and then I'll stand then I can

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
in there and then I'll stand then I can
have<00:00:41.790> power<00:00:42.120> on/off<00:00:42.860> without<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> bike<00:00:44.219> even

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
have power on/off without the bike even

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
have power on/off without the bike even
running<00:00:44.969> which<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.320> bit<00:00:46.440> easier<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
running which is a little bit easier to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
running which is a little bit easier to
do<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.809> trying<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> run<00:00:49.079> off<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.230> power

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
do then trying to run off the power

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.049 
do then trying to run off the power
source<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.430> didn't<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> brake

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
source because I didn't have a brake

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.410 
source because I didn't have a brake
light<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.780> bright<00:00:52.079> enough<00:00:53.090> to<00:00:54.090> make<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
light that was bright enough to make it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:04.840 
light that was bright enough to make it
safe<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.270> go<00:00:57.270> ahead<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.510> plug<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.140> quick

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.930 

just<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.570> plugs<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.140> right<00:01:07.170> there

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
just like that just plugs in right there

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.180 
just like that just plugs in right there
the<00:01:08.940> balance<00:01:09.360> tap<00:01:09.690> right<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.130> do

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
the balance tap right here all that I do

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.130 
the balance tap right here all that I do
is<00:01:11.370> plug<00:01:11.610> my<00:01:11.760> little<00:01:12.030> charger<00:01:12.780> into<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
is plug my little charger into that I

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.540 
is plug my little charger into that I
can<00:01:13.470> leave<00:01:13.620> it<00:01:13.770> mounted<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.250> underneath

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
can leave it mounted right underneath

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.820 
can leave it mounted right underneath
there<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> charge<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.260> right<00:01:16.290> from<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:16.740> all

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
