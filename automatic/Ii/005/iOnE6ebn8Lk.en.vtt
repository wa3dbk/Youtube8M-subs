00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.819
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.650
 after the game in kind regards the 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.349
 media representatives from freiburg and the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.300
 even before they ask him to go in 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.410
 I may be rich live yourself 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.980
 seen to play 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.700
 right at the beginning of the game the soli 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.360
 already as we also highest priority 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:35.260
 put on a good organization 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:38.890
 if the opponent had the ball and from 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.820
 what then so that the team 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.280
 the ball possession was little room found 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.780
 but it was still found by me 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.920
 got started playing football as well 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.519
 I found others in the game altogether 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.999
 left side the young boys have it 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.300
 well done but then also mike hanke 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:09.909
 the now just injury free 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.290
 then comes in better and better and was 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.049
 that's a good first half after the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.270
 half-time problems 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.200
 we have been able to change tactically as well 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.500
 442 in sebastian frey is and has it 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.939
 to control it relatively well 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.399
 but of course, after the half-time 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:35.200
 Tor or normally gets a goal 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:39.210
 and then of course it was clear that as 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.399
 21 it gets really hot but 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.049
 the guys then find the 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.329
 properly controlled except for these 15 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.609
 minutes to have eighth after halftime 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.619
 the neat and the cargo and 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:57.100
 lorenzo my whole power is too 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.609
 logical but it's great that now 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.090
 even European games could be the young 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.840
 buben 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.009
 of course that's great for us thanks 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:19.670
 clarify questions 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:24.260
 that too is the program 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:28.860
 I'm not unhappy about that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.500
 we in braunschweig phased football 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:37.190
 have played and phased today 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:41.940
 I have already said so 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:45.990
 just so we somehow the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.470
 have an idea and that's the way it is already 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.459
 many years that one would like football already 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:58.700
 play and here are a few things 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.700
 that make him courageous for the future 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.350
 throw 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:32.350
 the heater has mirrored 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.200
 Brunswick has to stop the training 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.010
 Tuesday 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.400
 and we tested this morning and 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.510
 we did not hope so now 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.040
 indebted that not the next 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:54.920
 fails because it is enough for us slowly 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:57.260
 We are now having the next weeks 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.910
 every three days plays against teams 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.900
 like gladbach leverkusen schalke 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.660
 wolfsburg and I mean somewhere me 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:15.320
 then the limit of the kite 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:17.710
 but if the gods do not want that 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.710
 drumstick 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.670
 So I did not think that European Cup 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.620
 does not play strenuous is completely on 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:13.350
 the limits but that's me too 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:16.070
 fuss where are we not then 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.480
 was subordinated but partially 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.650
 was proclaimed not European trophy 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.410
 important that is something where I have to say 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.790
 as one can only suspect something someone 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.580
 One look a little bit at me 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.620
 knows or the team with completely 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.330
 inexplicable only it would be natural 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.160
 bad if I, as a coach a 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.750
 European Cup match would be considered and 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.580
 that plays three days later in the 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.810
 Bundesliga 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.140
 that would be ignored 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.140
 irresponsible 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:03.000
 makes total recurrent 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.710
 Yes research says but you have to 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.830
 then he has to tell me car 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.460
 now also with a four-pack what you 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.740
 had injuries and and 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.960
 other things was the red card in one 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.789
 a little care is so that you 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.740
 now in your games in Nuremberg and in 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:28.259
 brunswick and today also the 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.039
 worked out in quotes happiness 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.110
 also had 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.789
 you have to say that very clearly and we have to 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:40.349
 Of course, we are not where we are 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:43.580
 Wish to come sometime but 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:47.099
 For the moment I think you should 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.250
 let church in the village and say so 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:53.940
 have to say that it really does 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:57.900
 is always nice what something then 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.740
 also played as already to the 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.880
 stay here 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.349
 it was exceptionally hospitable 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.020
 the people here 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:07.949
 It was a total experience I was still 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.069
 never in the Czech Republic 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:14.430
 we were all it was totally great in 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:15.779
 hotel and also with the with the with 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.370
 with slovan liberec with one 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:21.830
 responsible trainers 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.830
 and indeed two great games and 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:28.220
 It was a really great experience for me 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:32.030
 to be able to just be here and 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:35.780
 and this hospitality 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.780
 receive many thanks
