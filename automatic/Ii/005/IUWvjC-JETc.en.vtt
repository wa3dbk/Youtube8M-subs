00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.970 
and we've kind of taken this approach
the<00:03:22.080> philosophy<00:03:22.620> we've<00:03:22.770> had<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.780> it's

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
the philosophy we've had is that it's

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.360 
the philosophy we've had is that it's
helpful<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.430> valuable<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.090> have<00:03:27.270> fan<00:03:28.020> service

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
helpful and valuable to have fan service

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.640 
helpful and valuable to have fan service
but<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:30.209> experience<00:03:30.600> does<00:03:30.870> not<00:03:31.020> depend<00:03:31.380> upon

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
but the experience does not depend upon

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.160 
but the experience does not depend upon
it<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:33.420> compare<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.900> some<00:03:34.080> other

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
it and so to compare it to some other

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.350 
it and so to compare it to some other
thing<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:35.310> gives<00:03:35.370> us<00:03:35.550> kind<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.790> an<00:03:35.910> objective

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
thing that gives us kind of an objective

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.440 
thing that gives us kind of an objective
way<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.570> thinking<00:03:36.870> about<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:38.090> noticed<00:03:39.090> that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
way of thinking about it we noticed that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.290 
way of thinking about it we noticed that
JJ<00:03:39.959> Abrams<00:03:40.410> Star<00:03:40.620> Trek<00:03:40.950> film<00:03:41.220> did<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:41.970> really

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
JJ Abrams Star Trek film did a really

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.470 
JJ Abrams Star Trek film did a really
good<00:03:42.540> job<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.170> balance<00:03:43.830> my<00:03:44.340> son<00:03:44.670> has

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
good job of that balance my son has

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.570 
good job of that balance my son has
never<00:03:45.750> seen<00:03:45.989> any<00:03:46.170> Star<00:03:46.470> Trek<00:03:46.680> movie<00:03:46.950> he<00:03:47.250> loved

never seen any Star Trek movie he loved
that<00:03:47.700> film<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.300> he<00:03:48.390> had<00:03:48.480> no<00:03:48.690> prior<00:03:48.959> knowledge

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
that film and he had no prior knowledge

that film and he had no prior knowledge
he<00:03:49.380> knew<00:03:49.530> what<00:03:49.650> Star<00:03:49.830> Trek<00:03:49.860> was<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.580> he<00:03:50.880> knew

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
he knew what Star Trek was and he knew

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.490 
he knew what Star Trek was and he knew
it<00:03:51.030> was<00:03:51.390> important<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.780> science<00:03:52.050> fiction<00:03:52.320> but

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
it was important to science fiction but

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.380 
it was important to science fiction but
he<00:03:52.800> had<00:03:52.890> never<00:03:52.950> seen<00:03:53.280> any<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.670> TV<00:03:53.970> shows<00:03:54.180> or

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
he had never seen any of the TV shows or

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
any of the movies before and you know I

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.650 
any of the movies before and you know I
showed<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:56.610> section<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.120> aliens<00:03:57.480> colonial

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
showed a section of aliens colonial

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.120 
showed a section of aliens colonial
marines<00:03:58.020> earlier<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.620> kind<00:03:58.770> of<00:03:58.800> betrays

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
marines earlier and it kind of betrays

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.400 
marines earlier and it kind of betrays
that<00:03:59.370> same<00:03:59.610> philosophy<00:04:00.600> when<00:04:00.630> you're<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.320> the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
that same philosophy when you're in the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.260 
that same philosophy when you're in the
