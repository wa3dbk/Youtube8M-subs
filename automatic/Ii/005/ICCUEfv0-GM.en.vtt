Emme<00:00:12.330> storage<00:00:13.230> system<00:00:14.210> just<00:00:15.210> like<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.509> one

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
Emme storage system just like this one

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.510 
Emme storage system just like this one
or<00:00:16.529> maybe<00:00:16.590> not<00:00:16.890> like<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.160> one<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.400> doesn't

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
or maybe not like this one it doesn't

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.680 
or maybe not like this one it doesn't
really<00:00:17.609> matter<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:18.420> you're<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
really matter so what you're going to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.859 
really matter so what you're going to
need<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> ender<00:00:19.770> chest<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.750> you're<00:00:21.750> going

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
need is a ender chest and you're going

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.130 
need is a ender chest and you're going
to<00:00:21.900> make<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> basic<00:00:22.529> import<00:00:23.340> bus<00:00:23.609> which<00:00:24.480> they're

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
to make a basic import bus which they're

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.170 
to make a basic import bus which they're
not<00:00:25.320> too<00:00:25.680> expensive<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.609> you're<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
not too expensive if you're in the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.820 
not too expensive if you're in the
position<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> game<00:00:28.140> where<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.590> are

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
position of the game where you are

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.429 
position of the game where you are
building<00:00:29.099> an<00:00:29.369> Emmy<00:00:29.630> system<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.349> going

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
building an Emmy system that's not going

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.280 
building an Emmy system that's not going
to<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.590> hard<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> craft<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
to be hard at all for you to craft and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.510 
to be hard at all for you to craft and
so<00:00:34.290> you're<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> need<00:00:35.100> an<00:00:35.160> inner<00:00:35.280> chest

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
so you're going to need an inner chest

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
so you're going to need an inner chest
to<00:00:35.730> make<00:00:35.880> sure<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> all<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.840> color<00:00:37.050> codes<00:00:37.380> on

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to make sure that all the color codes on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.760 
to make sure that all the color codes on
the<00:00:37.649> top<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> same<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.210> they<00:00:39.770> transfer

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the top are the same so they transfer

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
the top are the same so they transfer
between<00:00:40.950> each<00:00:41.190> other<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.940> set<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.420> little

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
between each other so I set up a little

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.970 
between each other so I set up a little
bit<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.319 

set<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.850> how<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.210> going

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
set up so you can see how this is going

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.139 
set up so you can see how this is going
to<00:00:48.420> work<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.620> my<00:00:49.920> old<00:00:50.100> base<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.969> in

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
to work so in my old base which is in

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.350 
to work so in my old base which is in
the<00:00:51.239> process<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.690> being<00:00:51.899> torn<00:00:52.170> down<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:53.610> have

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the process of being torn down I have

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
the process of being torn down I have
set<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.350> other<00:00:55.379> end<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:56.340> chest<00:00:56.550> here

and just a basic empty chest so what
you're<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.329> down

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
you're going to need to do is put down

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.450 
you're going to need to do is put down
an<00:01:00.629> item<00:01:00.930> duct<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.500> you're<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
an item duct and you're going to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
an item duct and you're going to
position<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> red<00:01:03.960> arrow

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
position this to have the red arrow

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
position this to have the red arrow
facing<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.890> it'll<00:01:05.189> send<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> items

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
facing this way so it'll send the items

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
facing this way so it'll send the items
into<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.360> ender<00:01:06.540> chest<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.860> redstone

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
into the ender chest and a redstone

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
into the ender chest and a redstone
torch<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.240> you'll<00:01:09.360> play<00:01:09.540> place<00:01:10.020> down<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
torch that you'll play place down to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.609 
torch that you'll play place down to
power<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.939> cocl<00:01:11.939> will<00:01:12.390> light<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.500> has

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
power it cocl will light up when it has

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.240 
power it cocl will light up when it has
power<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.610> working<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:16.860> could<00:01:16.950> also<00:01:17.100> do

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
power and it's working you could also do

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.560 
power and it's working you could also do
a<00:01:17.280> switch<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> wanted<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.030> turn<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
a switch if you wanted to turn on and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.100 
a switch if you wanted to turn on and
off<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> you're<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
off and so you're just going to put in a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
off and so you're just going to put in a
basic<00:01:22.619> item<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.070> guess<00:01:23.220> I'll<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.610> apples<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
basic item I guess I'll put my apples in

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.010 
basic item I guess I'll put my apples in
here<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.509> doesn't<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:24.840> matter

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
here because it doesn't really matter

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
here because it doesn't really matter
and<00:01:25.470> you'll<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.710> them<00:01:25.830> leave<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> chest

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and you'll see them leave the chest

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.030 
and you'll see them leave the chest
there<00:01:27.390> now<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.960> chest<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> you'll<00:01:28.890> see

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
there now in this chest and you'll see

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
there now in this chest and you'll see
I'm<00:01:29.130> counting<00:01:29.460> down<00:01:29.720> what<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> means<00:01:31.110> is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
I'm counting down what that means is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.630 
I'm counting down what that means is
that<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.860> into<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.280> Emme

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that they are going into your Emme

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.170 
that they are going into your Emme
storage<00:01:33.329> system<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.369> if<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.759> hurry<00:01:35.970> up

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
storage system and if we can hurry up

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.480 
storage system and if we can hurry up
and<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.509> back<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.079> time<00:01:37.320> you'll<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:38.220> ah

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
and get back there in time you'll see ah

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.560 
and get back there in time you'll see ah
more<00:01:41.490> fast<00:01:41.759> enough<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.720> I'll<00:01:42.840> put<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.140> some

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
more fast enough so I'll put in some

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.740 
more fast enough so I'll put in some
cobblestone

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
cobblestone
