00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.390
 happens the same thing we're also added using rusty armor 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.290
 The modern concept of security armor etc 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.219
 kirchner and the racing car to pass the safety armor 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:21.470
 the frost body the structure standing up to almost happens to be an element 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.960
 secondary 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.999
 in some cases 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.439
 what 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.169
 nowadays 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.069
 theory 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.789
 tiven 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.350
 believes that the parties are with such an important level of originality in the case 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.520
 of tourism 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.980
 if you do both 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.980
 we are a security armor inside 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.650
 trying to get it fully completed and if it links to the network with the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.160
 initial body so that worked together and increase 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.300
 the stiffness value 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.050
 but on the other hand 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 We have to keep in mind 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.740
 that it is very important to have liquidity think that one of the enemies of the 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.860
 performance in the center of baghdad 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 of the highest things you have installed a high competitions of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.340
 narvaez 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.490
 it has to be above my head 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 going to take the whole top of the car 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.920
 nor generate 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 lula a benefit on the other hand prejudices 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.229
 that I'm putting a relatively high weight but raising the center 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.190
 severity does not harm 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.140
 that's why it's so important to design the route I have to achieve 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.630
 1 of river mahler 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.780
 and at the same time 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 comply with the regulatory parameters 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.350
 yépez and make it as fast as possible 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.490
 efe 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.510
 in denver 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.240
 A little bit of Toledo has died how to achieve it 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.179
 and is that as in the whole day for a match from concepts 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.520
 simple and basic to do a work that was not far from an ideal value 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.199
 up to tonalá possible to analyze with only four high-tech 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.329
 to be able to do finite element calculations as maybe they have used it 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.799
 then they have heard it many times 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.709
 reality 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.129
 p cobos or something that is done without achieving an optimization and maybe some aznar 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.390
 matured with the sets we are going to allow we were going to be at 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:32.200
 better between 80 and 90 percent of the dominial that can be achieved with that 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.199
 armor 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.079
 and the other part if passion is achieved a studious goalkeeper 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.099
 he also noticed a certain thing that one knows the fact of giving a look 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.640
 any 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.240
 still owe quickly we can tell if they have harmful effects 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.859
 it is not even necessary to go to a world 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.859
 to a deep study d 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:55.619
 read 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.469
 that's why I consider that it can not be 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.549
 it's easy to know
