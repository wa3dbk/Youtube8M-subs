00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.630
 Hello again today with a video 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:27.090
 to the rust bike bags in the last one 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 Video I have this sample provides 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.330
 that's the middle model and that is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.910
 actually a very practical bag 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.420
 that will be on 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.079
 on the upper city ​​in front of the steering column 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.699
 attached for this one has here 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.650
 straps with velcro 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.210
 that actually works completely 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.030
 well down here you can do something else 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.610
 stow 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 Here then the phone comes in 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.519
 you can also stop here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.580
 serve down here is one more 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.210
 Output lead cable with headphones and 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:06.689
 I have the HTC makes that makes sense 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.030
 and that fits in here but that is 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.460
 very very tight and he good at it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.070
 works but it's just sitting there 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.469
 the beach and actually I had planned 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.759
 my battery still here in the bag too 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.039
 stow adjust the pocket and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.630
 then with a suitable cable the 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.700
 mobile phone on the way to load 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.759
 but because everything is so tight that fits 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 Of course not now I have on ebay 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.630
 seen by accident 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.289
 this is this bag in different 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.979
 As you can see, this size is already there 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:49.289
 bigger I bought myself now 0 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:52.740
 and that has 19 5 cm and only 18 5 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.789
 In any case, I think this is one 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.539
 entire corner smaller and if I am now 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.119
 here 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:04.229
 that would have stuck the banks then can 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.880
 I immediately with the connection cable 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.360
 do 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.920
 the bag is big enough for here 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.240
 to offer the mobile phone with plug space 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.370
 It is also a bit tight 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.930
 but then at least it does not fly 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.500
 and forth 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.520
 so now I can quite normal here 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.520
 connect battery 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.750
 and stow it below the cell phone 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.160
 then the whole thing is done and that 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.280
 Mobile phone is well packed for my nature 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.660
 and will be loaded at the same time now 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.400
 Of course, the question is how do I switch 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.860
 The cell phone of a cell phone has been here 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.360
 This double tap work that goes 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.490
 Do not do this here because of that 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.670
 bags or this proximity sensor 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.990
 So the the proximity sensor of the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.240
 stop recognizes that the phone is in 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.020
 a bag is now in here 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.630
 is dark and therefore no backup 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.310
 However, the next work when 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.890
 you press something stronger up here 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.070
 then the phone goes on and then you can 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.120
 it serves 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:20.310
 the second function works only 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.950
 just do not stop it because of that 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.480
 sensor is occupied and therefore prevented 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.740
 but otherwise the larger version is 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.660
 not only from the volume 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.010
 bigger but you can do that too 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.600
 connect the charger and therefore 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.480
 I recommend you exactly before buying 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.670
 to pay attention to what size you buy 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.230
 I bought the bag when I bought it 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.230
 did not know that it was too 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.260
 bigger gives because at this time 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.370
 Although I only searched for this variety 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.670
 was offered 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.050
 now there are these big ones here and there 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.520
 that cost me there euro 99 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.170
 article location was even germany 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.060
 So the choice within two days 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.350
 Here I can only recommend you 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.920
 workmanship is very good 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.640
 Maybe you want to get out there 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.620
 Sometime a bag from the up here 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.230
 Continue to be transparent is so 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.370
 sensors is not occupied 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.060
 can you ever write there 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.540
 maybe the year in ear to take 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.669
 do list for next time also okay so 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.020
 a lot first now to this bag me 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.280
 I wish you a lot of fun while biking 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.280
 bye until next time
