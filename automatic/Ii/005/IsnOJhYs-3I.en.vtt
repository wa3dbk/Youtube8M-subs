one not bad at all week also flip

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.680 
one not bad at all week also flip
screens<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.790> swap<00:03:25.150> them<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.190> that

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
screens we swap them just like that

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
worth noting that the echo made great

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.820 
worth noting that the echo made great

battery<00:03:36.160> life<00:03:36.430> here<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.660> phone<00:03:37.989> lasted<00:03:38.560> for

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
battery life here this phone lasted for

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.400 
battery life here this phone lasted for
about<00:03:39.040> three<00:03:39.580> days<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:40.030> standby<00:03:40.569> after<00:03:41.080> we<00:03:41.200> did

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
about three days on standby after we did

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.860 
about three days on standby after we did
our<00:03:41.440> initial<00:03:41.890> tests<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:43.060> battery<00:03:43.450> life<00:03:43.660> on

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
our initial tests so the battery life on

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.930 
our initial tests so the battery life on
this<00:03:44.019> phone<00:03:44.080> is<00:03:44.530> very<00:03:44.830> good<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.489> here's<00:03:45.880> a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
this phone is very good and here's a

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.920 
this phone is very good and here's a
taste<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.360> tablet<00:03:46.870> mode<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:48.160> just<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.930> 4.7

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
taste of tablet mode it's just a 4.7

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.809 
taste of tablet mode it's just a 4.7
inch<00:03:50.310> capacitive<00:03:51.450> touchscreen<00:03:52.450> experience

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
inch capacitive touchscreen experience

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.440 
inch capacitive touchscreen experience
from<00:03:54.819> outer<00:03:55.060> space<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.560> most<00:03:56.830> useful

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
from outer space and this is most useful

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.110 
from outer space and this is most useful
using<00:03:58.450> maps<00:03:58.690> of<00:03:59.049> course<00:03:59.890> because<00:04:00.880> we<00:04:01.000> have

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
using maps of course because we have

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.630 
using maps of course because we have
twice<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.390> real<00:04:01.780> estate<00:04:02.140> here<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.459> one

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
twice the real estate here this is one

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.280 
twice the real estate here this is one
of<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.790> few<00:04:07.030> areas<00:04:07.299> on<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.810> phone<00:04:07.989> where<00:04:08.170> we

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
of the few areas on the phone where we

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.979 
of the few areas on the phone where we
have<00:04:08.410> pinch<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.830> zoom<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:10.180> course<00:04:10.450> tablet

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
have pinch to zoom and of course tablet

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.890 
have pinch to zoom and of course tablet
mode<00:04:11.200> came<00:04:11.650> in<00:04:11.799> handy<00:04:12.069> for<00:04:12.600> advanced<00:04:13.600> gaming

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
mode came in handy for advanced gaming

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.469 
mode came in handy for advanced gaming
and<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.769> can<00:04:14.950> see<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.190> as<00:04:15.310> an<00:04:15.519> accelerometer

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
and you can see it as an accelerometer

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.539 
and you can see it as an accelerometer
for<00:04:17.260> 3d<00:04:17.799> but<00:04:18.840> also<00:04:19.840> this<00:04:20.320> this<00:04:20.890> seemed<00:04:21.220> in<00:04:21.430> the

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
for 3d but also this this seemed in the

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.730 
for 3d but also this this seemed in the
middle<00:04:21.820> just<00:04:22.360> kind<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.720> breaks<00:04:23.020> everything<00:04:23.380> up

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
middle just kind of breaks everything up

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.969 
middle just kind of breaks everything up
and<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:25.810> think<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.350> screen<00:04:26.650> should<00:04:26.919> be

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
and we think that the screen should be

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.640 
and we think that the screen should be
merged<00:04:27.400> together<00:04:27.760> somehow<00:04:28.600> this<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.500> an

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
merged together somehow this is an

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.400 
merged together somehow this is an
example<00:04:29.979> of<00:04:30.250> optimized<00:04:30.970> mode<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:31.690> that's

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
example of optimized mode and that's

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.440 
example of optimized mode and that's
basically<00:04:32.710> when<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.190> select<00:04:33.580> an<00:04:34.030> application

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
basically when you select an application

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.880

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
in the middle of the screens we think

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.950 
in the middle of the screens we think
that<00:05:34.550> Kyle<00:05:34.850> Sarah<00:05:35.210> needs<00:05:35.420> to<00:05:35.570> figure<00:05:35.750> out<00:05:35.930> a

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
that Kyle Sarah needs to figure out a

that Kyle Sarah needs to figure out a
way<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.400> merge<00:05:37.400> get<00:05:38.090> rid<00:05:38.300> of<00:05:38.330> that<00:05:38.570> seem<00:05:38.960> so

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
way to merge get rid of that seem so

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.920 
way to merge get rid of that seem so
it's<00:05:39.680> just<00:05:39.950> edge<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.610> edge<00:05:40.790> also<00:05:41.480> we<00:05:41.660> need<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
it's just edge to edge also we need the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.960 
it's just edge to edge also we need the
ability<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:42.470> pinch<00:05:42.710> and<00:05:42.950> zoom<00:05:42.980> throughout<00:05:43.760> the

entire phone not just in maps and we

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.580 
entire phone not just in maps and we
think<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.670> 4G<00:05:47.180> model<00:05:47.570> would<00:05:47.690> really<00:05:48.110> do<00:05:48.410> the
