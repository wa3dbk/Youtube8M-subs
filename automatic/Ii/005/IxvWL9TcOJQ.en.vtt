learning how to blow air through a straw

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.470 
learning how to blow air through a straw
and<00:00:38.559> make<00:00:38.800> bubbles<00:00:39.160> so<00:00:39.610> once<00:00:39.969> you<00:00:40.090> understand

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
and make bubbles so once you understand

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.180 
and make bubbles so once you understand
the<00:00:40.570> concept<00:00:41.020> apply<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.620> an<00:00:41.740> instrument

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190

started messing around with circular
breathing<00:00:50.710> about<00:00:50.890> five<00:00:51.160> or<00:00:51.310> six<00:00:51.400> months<00:00:51.700> ago

talking about circular breathing I

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.889 
talking about circular breathing I
actually<00:01:03.700> thought<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.329> one<00:01:04.540> was<00:01:04.570> quite

actually thought that that one was quite
good<00:01:05.229> he's<00:01:05.500> circular<00:01:05.950> breathing<00:01:06.220> through

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
good he's circular breathing through

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.350 
good he's circular breathing through
soprano<00:01:07.450> sax<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:09.189> tube<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.579> small<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.149> tube

second on soprano sax it's not going to
be<00:01:23.889> the<00:01:23.979> case<00:01:24.159> with<00:01:24.310> baritone<00:01:24.850> I've<00:01:25.060> been

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179

trying it on baritone it's it's for me

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.010 
trying it on baritone it's it's for me
right<00:01:30.009> now<00:01:30.039> I<00:01:30.429> consider<00:01:30.789> it<00:01:30.850> impossible<00:01:31.179> but

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
right now I consider it impossible but

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.520 
right now I consider it impossible but
i'm<00:01:32.200> not<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:32.350> baritone<00:01:32.709> player<00:01:32.859> so<00:01:34.289> tenor<00:01:35.289> is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
i'm not a baritone player so tenor is

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.519 
i'm not a baritone player so tenor is
very<00:01:35.740> difficult<00:01:35.999> i'm<00:01:36.999> getting<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.079> down<00:01:38.229> well

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:38.529 
very difficult i'm getting it down well

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:43.859 
very difficult i'm getting it down well
on<00:01:38.709> alto<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.539> as<00:01:40.799> i<00:01:41.799> progress<00:01:42.069> i<00:01:42.490> will<00:01:42.819> move<00:01:43.689> to

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
on alto and as i progress i will move to

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.260 
on alto and as i progress i will move to
a<00:01:43.899> bigger<00:01:44.139> horn<00:01:44.499> it's<00:01:45.369> much<00:01:45.819> easier<00:01:45.850> to

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
a bigger horn it's much easier to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.999 
a bigger horn it's much easier to
disguise<00:01:46.749> the<00:01:47.109> fact<00:01:47.139> that<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.590> circular

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
disguise the fact that you circular

disguise the fact that you circular
breathing<00:01:48.249> when<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.509> notes<00:01:49.779> are<00:01:50.139> a<00:01:50.679> moving

so anyway I'll show you what I've gotten

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.460

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
to at this point if I'm playing a moving

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.610 
to at this point if I'm playing a moving
passage<00:02:12.900> let's<00:02:13.900> write<00:02:14.080> up<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.230> circular

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
passage let's write up a circular

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.660 
passage let's write up a circular
breathing

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:32.180 

Oh

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.700 

now<00:02:33.190> here's<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.850> thing<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:35.530> I've

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
now here's the thing that I've

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.010 
now here's the thing that I've
discovered<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.390> didn't<00:02:37.690> notice<00:02:37.930> this

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
discovered and I didn't notice this

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.570 
discovered and I didn't notice this
until<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.350> started<00:02:38.710> circular<00:02:39.130> breathing<00:02:39.370> if

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
until I started circular breathing if

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.900 
until I started circular breathing if
I'm<00:02:39.730> gonna<00:02:39.880> play<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.890> practice<00:02:42.400> exercise

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
I'm gonna play as a practice exercise

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.490 
I'm gonna play as a practice exercise
I'm<00:02:43.180> only<00:02:43.330> going<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.600> play<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.960> you<00:02:44.290> know<00:02:44.380> in

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
I'm only going to play it you know in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.830 
I'm only going to play it you know in
normal<00:02:44.800> circumstances<00:02:44.890> until<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:46.420> run<00:02:46.660> out<00:02:46.720> of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
normal circumstances until I run out of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.080 
normal circumstances until I run out of
air<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.320> take<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> breath<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.220> stop<00:02:48.460> for<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.730> second

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
air I take a breath I stop for a second

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.030 
air I take a breath I stop for a second
and<00:02:49.180> start<00:02:49.810> doing<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.170> again<00:02:50.440> whatever<00:02:50.680> key

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
and start doing that again whatever key

and start doing that again whatever key
would<00:02:51.280> be<00:02:51.310> in<00:02:51.930> I've<00:02:52.930> discovered<00:02:53.200> through

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.700 
would be in I've discovered through
circular<00:02:54.100> breathing<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:55.200> my<00:02:56.200> fingers<00:02:56.530> get

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
circular breathing that my fingers get

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.710 
circular breathing that my fingers get
tired<00:02:56.740> because<00:02:57.460> they<00:02:57.820> never<00:02:58.030> moved<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.630> a

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.890 
feel that fatigue coming in I'll you
know<00:03:18.370> look<00:03:18.670> at<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> wall<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.090> think<00:03:19.660> about<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
know look at the wall and think about a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.390 
know look at the wall and think about a
crack<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.380> wall<00:03:20.590> or<00:03:20.800> something<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.190> don't

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
crack in the wall or something I don't

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.560 
crack in the wall or something I don't
know<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.790> got<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.150> find<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.420> way<00:03:22.450> to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
know I just got to find a way to

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.290 
know I just got to find a way to
distract<00:03:22.990> my<00:03:23.260> mind<00:03:23.400> from<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.490> fatigue<00:03:24.970> that

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
distract my mind from the fatigue that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.140 
distract my mind from the fatigue that
is<00:03:25.570> starting<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.990> creep<00:03:26.260> into<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:27.580> top<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:28.030> my

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
is starting to creep into the top of my

is starting to creep into the top of my
hand<00:03:28.420> right<00:03:29.080> here<00:03:29.320> especially<00:03:29.580> now<00:03:30.580> that's

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
hand right here especially now that's

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.310 
hand right here especially now that's
not<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.330> have<00:03:31.540> any<00:03:31.690> physical<00:03:31.990> problem

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
not because I have any physical problem

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.780 
not because I have any physical problem
with<00:03:32.410> my<00:03:32.560> hand<00:03:32.770> we<00:03:32.950> know<00:03:33.100> about<00:03:33.340> my<00:03:33.430> carpal

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
with my hand we know about my carpal

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.280 
with my hand we know about my carpal
tunnel<00:03:34.000> syndrome<00:03:34.120> rather<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.690> spoke<00:03:35.260> about

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
tunnel syndrome rather I spoke about

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.750 
tunnel syndrome rather I spoke about
that<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:35.860> is<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.070> completely<00:03:36.430> different

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
that this is a completely different

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.920 
that this is a completely different
thing<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.209> perfectly<00:03:37.570> normal<00:03:37.630> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
thing this is perfectly normal and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.540 
thing this is perfectly normal and
everyone's<00:03:38.230> going<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.410> go<00:03:38.470> through<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.680> so

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
everyone's going to go through that so

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.690 
everyone's going to go through that so
on<00:03:40.360> a<00:03:40.420> moving<00:03:40.780> passage<00:03:41.190> if<00:03:42.190> I'm<00:03:42.370> going<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.550> play

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
on a moving passage if I'm going to play

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.660 
on a moving passage if I'm going to play
the<00:03:42.850> same<00:03:43.090> thing<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:44.230> two<00:03:44.920> minutes<00:03:45.160> let's<00:03:45.459> say

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
the same thing for two minutes let's say

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.430 
the same thing for two minutes let's say
I'm<00:03:46.120> going<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:46.390> have<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.630> take<00:03:46.780> my<00:03:46.990> time<00:03:47.170> I'm

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
I'm going to have to take my time I'm

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.540 
I'm going to have to take my time I'm
gonna<00:03:47.560> have<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.800> think<00:03:48.010> about<00:03:48.130> what<00:03:48.430> I'm<00:03:48.520> doing

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
gonna have to think about what I'm doing

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.990 
gonna have to think about what I'm doing
and<00:03:49.060> I'm<00:03:49.840> going<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.860> just<00:03:51.310> understand

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and I'm going to have to just understand

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.720 
and I'm going to have to just understand
that<00:03:52.570> over<00:03:53.050> time<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.890> will<00:03:53.950> get<00:03:54.190> better<00:03:54.370> and

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
that over time it will get better and

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:25.020 
that over time it will get better and
better<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.270> easier<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.810> easier

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.940 

so<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.690> felt<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.140> saw<00:04:27.170> the<00:04:27.380> slope<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.800> this

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
so you felt I saw the slope of this

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.800 
so you felt I saw the slope of this
where<00:04:28.130> I<00:04:28.160> stopped<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.850> other<00:04:29.060> thing<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.570> I'm

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
where I stopped the other thing that I'm

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.390 
where I stopped the other thing that I'm
working<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:30.290> you<00:04:30.440> can<00:04:30.560> hear<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.830> dynamics

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
working on that you can hear is dynamics

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.570 
working on that you can hear is dynamics
going<00:04:31.640> from<00:04:32.360> double<00:04:33.320> piano<00:04:33.560> two<00:04:33.830> men<00:04:33.980> so<00:04:34.160> Forte

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
going from double piano two men so Forte

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.540 
going from double piano two men so Forte
to<00:04:35.210> double<00:04:35.510> Forte<00:04:35.900> back<00:04:36.230> down<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.740> trying<00:04:37.250> to

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
to double Forte back down and trying to

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.890 
to double Forte back down and trying to
figure<00:04:38.000> out<00:04:38.030> how<00:04:38.270> long<00:04:38.510> it's<00:04:38.660> going<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.840> take

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
figure out how long it's going to take

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.500 
figure out how long it's going to take
at<00:04:39.260> that<00:04:39.590> dynamic<00:04:40.580> how<00:04:40.970> much<00:04:41.150> time<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.450> have

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
at that dynamic how much time you have

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.930 
at that dynamic how much time you have
to<00:04:41.630> take<00:04:41.900> in<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.110> breath<00:04:42.340> so<00:04:43.340> because<00:04:43.640> of<00:04:43.670> this

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
to take in a breath so because of this

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.390 
to take in a breath so because of this
because<00:04:44.780> we<00:04:45.200> can<00:04:45.320> circular<00:04:45.740> breathe<00:04:45.950> because

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
because we can circular breathe because

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.620 
because we can circular breathe because
we're<00:04:46.640> learning<00:04:46.730> how<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.000> circular<00:04:47.450> breathe

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
we're learning how to circular breathe

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.840 
we're learning how to circular breathe
we<00:04:47.810> can<00:04:47.930> play<00:04:48.050> chords<00:04:48.560> now<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.040> that's<00:04:49.580> really

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
we can play chords now and that's really

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.010 
we can play chords now and that's really
a<00:04:49.880> lot<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.180> fun<00:04:50.300> especially<00:04:50.450> if<00:04:50.810> you're

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
a lot of fun especially if you're

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.770 
a lot of fun especially if you're
playing<00:04:51.170> jazz<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.470> got<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.770> cadenza<00:04:52.070> somewhere

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
playing jazz you got a cadenza somewhere

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.690 
playing jazz you got a cadenza somewhere
then<00:04:53.780> you<00:04:53.960> want<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:54.230> just<00:04:54.380> have<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.310> little<00:04:55.490> fun

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
then you want to just have a little fun

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:34.550 
then you want to just have a little fun
you<00:04:56.060> don't<00:04:56.240> feel<00:04:56.450> like<00:04:56.600> taking<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:56.930> breath<00:04:57.140> yeah

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.350 

member<00:05:36.630> my<00:05:37.630> fingers<00:05:38.110> are<00:05:38.350> what<00:05:39.010> gave<00:05:39.729> out<00:05:39.970> not

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
member my fingers are what gave out not

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.180 
member my fingers are what gave out not
my<00:05:40.510> embouchure<00:05:42.510> which<00:05:43.510> I've<00:05:43.810> never<00:05:44.229> even

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
my embouchure which I've never even

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.610 
my embouchure which I've never even
thought<00:05:45.460> of<00:05:45.520> before<00:05:45.760> my<00:05:45.970> life<00:05:46.330> so<00:05:46.690> that's<00:05:47.470> the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
thought of before my life so that's the

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.900 
thought of before my life so that's the
discovery<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.220> I've<00:05:48.430> made<00:05:48.610> more

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
discovery that I've made more

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.430 
discovery that I've made more
importantly<00:05:49.389> than<00:05:49.479> learning<00:05:49.690> had<00:05:49.960> a<00:05:49.990> circular

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
importantly than learning had a circular

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.890 
importantly than learning had a circular
breathe<00:05:50.680> I've<00:05:51.160> discovered<00:05:51.460> there's<00:05:52.210> a<00:05:52.479> limit

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
breathe I've discovered there's a limit

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.810 
breathe I've discovered there's a limit
to<00:05:53.050> how<00:05:53.410> long<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:54.100> can<00:05:54.160> move<00:05:54.370> my<00:05:54.430> fingers

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
to how long I can move my fingers

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.120 
to how long I can move my fingers
without<00:05:54.970> having<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:56.110> allow<00:05:56.350> them<00:05:56.650> to<00:05:56.889> take<00:05:56.919> a

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
without having to allow them to take a

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.520 
without having to allow them to take a
breath<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:58.570> other<00:05:58.810> thing<00:05:59.139> is<00:05:59.380> I<00:05:59.410> never

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
breath the other thing is I never

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.810 
breath the other thing is I never
thought<00:06:00.190> in<00:06:00.460> terms<00:06:00.970> of<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.900> big<00:06:02.320> long<00:06:02.979> passage

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
thought in terms of a big long passage

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.060 
thought in terms of a big long passage
at<00:06:04.090> least<00:06:04.330> in<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.770> improvisational<00:06:05.770> sense

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
at least in the improvisational sense

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.600 
at least in the improvisational sense
they<00:06:06.729> will<00:06:06.880> always<00:06:07.060> you<00:06:07.750> know<00:06:07.870> this<00:06:08.770> take<00:06:09.580> a

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
they will always you know this take a

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.840 
they will always you know this take a
breath<00:06:09.880> and<00:06:10.090> have<00:06:10.600> a<00:06:10.630> thought<00:06:11.430> which<00:06:12.430> is<00:06:12.610> going

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
breath and have a thought which is going

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.310 
breath and have a thought which is going
to<00:06:12.910> be<00:06:12.970> more<00:06:13.150> creative<00:06:13.330> anyway<00:06:13.900> if<00:06:14.080> you

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
to be more creative anyway if you

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.409 
to be more creative anyway if you
breathe<00:06:14.590> I've<00:06:15.220> said<00:06:15.520> too<00:06:15.610> many<00:06:15.700> piano<00:06:16.090> players

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
breathe I've said too many piano players

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.529 
breathe I've said too many piano players
when<00:06:17.229> I<00:06:17.260> find<00:06:18.000> that<00:06:19.000> they're<00:06:19.180> playing<00:06:19.419> these

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
when I find that they're playing these

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.779 
when I find that they're playing these
run<00:06:19.840> on<00:06:19.960> phrases<00:06:20.560> I've<00:06:20.710> always<00:06:20.889> said<00:06:21.190> just

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
run on phrases I've always said just

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.520 
run on phrases I've always said just
blow<00:06:22.030> air<00:06:22.270> through<00:06:22.300> your<00:06:22.840> mouth<00:06:22.960> as<00:06:23.260> you're

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
blow air through your mouth as you're

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.529 
blow air through your mouth as you're
playing<00:06:23.650> as<00:06:24.070> soon<00:06:24.430> as<00:06:24.669> the<00:06:24.820> air<00:06:24.940> runs<00:06:25.210> out<00:06:25.360> you

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
playing as soon as the air runs out you

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:26.969 
playing as soon as the air runs out you
got<00:06:25.660> to<00:06:25.750> take<00:06:25.870> a<00:06:25.900> breath<00:06:26.169> lift<00:06:26.560> your<00:06:26.650> fingers

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
got to take a breath lift your fingers

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.920 
got to take a breath lift your fingers
up<00:06:27.130> and<00:06:27.820> think<00:06:28.090> like<00:06:28.240> a<00:06:28.270> horn<00:06:28.539> player<00:06:28.780> and

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
up and think like a horn player and

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.570 
up and think like a horn player and
think<00:06:29.110> that<00:06:29.260> way<00:06:29.470> because<00:06:29.680> we<00:06:29.979> should<00:06:30.280> speak

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
think that way because we should speak

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.480 
think that way because we should speak
in<00:06:30.760> sentences<00:06:31.020> you<00:06:32.020> know<00:06:32.139> not<00:06:32.470> these<00:06:32.620> long<00:06:32.979> run

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
in sentences you know not these long run

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.730 
in sentences you know not these long run
on<00:06:33.700> word<00:06:34.000> after<00:06:34.210> word<00:06:34.419> things<00:06:34.960> so<00:06:35.860> there<00:06:36.400> is<00:06:36.760> my

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
on word after word things so there is my

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.969 
on word after word things so there is my
take<00:06:38.740> on<00:06:38.979> circular<00:06:39.430> breathing<00:06:39.639> for<00:06:40.510> now<00:06:40.979> and

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
take on circular breathing for now and

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.700 
take on circular breathing for now and
as<00:06:42.490> it<00:06:42.699> gets<00:06:42.880> better<00:06:43.150> I<00:06:43.419> will<00:06:44.229> move<00:06:44.410> on<00:06:44.620> to
