don't<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.309> care<00:00:56.579> about<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> kind<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
don't really care about that kind of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.630 
don't really care about that kind of
stuff<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.579> an

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
of people is going to vanish and it's

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.670 
of people is going to vanish and it's
just<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.540> beginning<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.550> would<00:03:12.300> say<00:03:12.680> be

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
just the beginning so I would say be

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.980 
just the beginning so I would say be
prepared<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.400> act<00:03:14.910> now<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.450> biggest<00:03:15.660> risk

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990
