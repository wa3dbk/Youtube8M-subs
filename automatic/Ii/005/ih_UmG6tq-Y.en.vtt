structured<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:41.160> way<00:02:41.310> where<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.880> was<00:02:41.940> all

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
structured it in a way where it was all

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.949 
structured it in a way where it was all
taking<00:02:42.600> place<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:43.790> one<00:02:44.790> place<00:02:45.060> they<00:02:45.540> could<00:02:45.600> be

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
taking place in one place they could be

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.710 
taking place in one place they could be
filmed<00:02:49.400> how<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.459> do<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.760> logistically<00:02:51.150> would

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
filmed how to do that logistically would

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.220 
filmed how to do that logistically would
not<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.019> been<00:02:52.170> as<00:02:52.320> easy<00:02:52.440> as<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:53.120> sounds

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
not have been as easy as it sounds

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.420 
not have been as easy as it sounds
because<00:02:55.230> you're<00:02:55.560> shuttling<00:02:55.860> back<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.190> forth

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
because you're shuttling back and forth

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.180 
because you're shuttling back and forth
between<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.870> House<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.080> Senate<00:02:58.380> different

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
between the House the Senate different

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.080 
between the House the Senate different
offices<00:02:59.610> etc<00:03:00.230> different<00:03:01.230> legislators<00:03:02.030> but<00:03:03.030> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
offices etc different legislators but I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.699 
offices etc different legislators but I
think<00:03:03.330> it's<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.480> legitimate<00:03:03.750> criticism<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.620> on

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
think it's a legitimate criticism so on

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.690 
think it's a legitimate criticism so on
that<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.370> take<00:03:06.090> responsibility<00:03:07.700> with

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700

whether or not the financial system was
melting<00:03:41.640> down<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.140> we<00:03:43.140> had<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.380> make<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.560> whole

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
melting down and we had to make a whole

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.280 
melting down and we had to make a whole
bunch<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.510> emergency<00:03:45.510> decisions<00:03:45.959> about<00:03:46.049> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
bunch of emergency decisions about the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.330 
bunch of emergency decisions about the
economy<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.880> what<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.870> said<00:03:49.410> was<00:03:49.680> let's<00:03:50.010> keep

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
economy so what I said was let's keep

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.539 
economy so what I said was let's keep
them<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.790> minimum<00:03:51.260> but<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.590> couldn't

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
them to a minimum but I couldn't

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.430 
them to a minimum but I couldn't
exercise<00:03:53.790> them<00:03:54.209> all<00:03:55.070> now<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.840> challenge<00:03:58.290> I

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
exercise them all now the challenge I

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.350 
exercise them all now the challenge I
guess<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.739> would<00:03:58.890> have<00:03:58.920> for<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.370> as<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.910> freshman

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
guess I would have for you as a freshman

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.069 
guess I would have for you as a freshman
is<00:04:02.450> what<00:04:03.450> are<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.600> doing<00:04:03.870> inside<00:04:04.109> your<00:04:04.530> caucus

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
is what are you doing inside your caucus

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.490 
is what are you doing inside your caucus
to<00:04:07.880> make<00:04:08.880> sure<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.420> I'm<00:04:09.600> not<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.109> only<00:04:10.260> guy

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
to make sure that I'm not the only guy

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.380 
to make sure that I'm not the only guy
who<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.769> responsible<00:04:11.340> for<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:11.609> stuff<00:04:11.850> so

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
who is responsible for this stuff so

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.150 
who is responsible for this stuff so
that<00:04:12.510> we're<00:04:12.660> working<00:04:12.840> together

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
that we're working together

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.330 
that we're working together
because<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.180> going<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.360> be<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.480> process

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
because this is going to be a process

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.740 
because this is going to be a process

that's<00:04:57.360> come<00:04:57.540> before<00:04:57.660> us<00:04:58.190> now<00:04:59.190> what<00:04:59.790> we<00:04:59.910> did

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
that's come before us now what we did

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.600 
that's come before us now what we did
was<00:05:00.120> if<00:05:00.600> there<00:05:00.870> were<00:05:01.020> lobbyists<00:05:02.010> who<00:05:02.190> were<00:05:02.340> on

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
was if there were lobbyists who were on

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.300 
was if there were lobbyists who were on
boards<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.270> commissions<00:05:03.890> that<00:05:04.890> were

boards and commissions that were

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.360 
boards and commissions that were
carryovers<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.270> their<00:05:06.570> term<00:05:06.810> hadn't

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
carryovers and their term hadn't

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.580 
carryovers and their term hadn't
completed<00:05:08.370> we<00:05:08.850> didn't<00:05:09.060> kick<00:05:09.210> them<00:05:09.360> off<00:05:09.590> we

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
completed we didn't kick them off we

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.770 
completed we didn't kick them off we
simply<00:05:10.830> said<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.250> moving<00:05:11.670> forward<00:05:11.820> any<00:05:12.420> time

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
simply said that moving forward any time

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.140 
simply said that moving forward any time
a<00:05:13.050> new<00:05:13.320> slot<00:05:13.590> opens<00:05:13.980> they're<00:05:14.700> being<00:05:14.940> replaced

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
a new slot opens they're being replaced

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.570 
a new slot opens they're being replaced
so<00:05:16.110> we've<00:05:16.320> actually<00:05:16.530> been<00:05:16.890> very<00:05:16.950> consistent

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
so we've actually been very consistent

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.440 
so we've actually been very consistent
in<00:05:18.450> making<00:05:18.720> sure<00:05:19.140> that<00:05:19.950> we<00:05:20.730> are<00:05:22.250> eliminating

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
in making sure that we are eliminating

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.050
