00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello everyone with you music in my asset 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.509
 name is Dmitry and today our video review 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.429
 dedicated to the new digital model 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.429
 piano called 245 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.690
 at 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.790
 at 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.400
 So 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.629
 by 45 is a compact 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.019
 digital piano with weighted 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.340
 88 keys mechanism 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.440
 The keyboard here is very installed 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.880
 high quality and cool actually 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.099
 yamaha they don't do anything wrong 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.170
 never done in terms of digital 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.910
 piano especially but as for 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.060
 the mechanism is it will protect 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.980
 Hummer standard is a weighted mechanism 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.629
 as I said, but itâ€™s great 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.060
 suitable even for those who never 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.340
 Grodno we weigh it a little lightweight and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.170
 In principle, for beginners you can easily cope 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.360
 on the other hand, to all those who love 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.130
 it is a weighted mechanism that mechanics 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.989
 I think I really like it too because 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.420
 she meets all the dynamic nuances 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.560
 games besides there are four used 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.690
 sensitivity so that you can 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.269
 set up the tool for yourself that way 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.069
 how do you need another important 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.930
 aspect of an important plus of this 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.480
 tool or keyboard itself which 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.310
 it is used on weight as it is 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.480
 we have a compact tool and he is the first 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.019
 I think the queue will be interesting exactly 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.150
 stage pianist here 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.739
 An important aspect is weight weight 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.630
 this tool is only 11 s 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.380
 a half kilo is very little 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.780
 for 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.459
 measured mechanics trust me among 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.709
 tools and do not tear your back 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.709
 so if you are looking for a compact 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.359
 tool and weighted mechanics p45 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.220
 pay attention to her besides yet 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.150
 very inexpensive tool and very 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.549
 not bad for you more often 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.620
 as for the sound engine here 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.549
 used updated sound engine 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.319
 a vm is a sampler 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.359
 the engine has built-in effects here 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.639
 it sounds all great principle you more 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.220
 than realistic there are 10 different 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.440
 two types of sounds two types of piano 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.889
 electric piano 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.079
 2 string harpsichord and vibraphone can be 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.010
 work with these sounds 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.810
 besides every sound 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.489
 supports split function 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.829
 keyboard and timbres 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.409
 one more important bonus 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.980
 here is the built-in metronome 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.829
 metronome activate 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.599
 miracle here including any temp you can 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.720
 Set to work for example if you need 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.180
 do this metronome 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.250
 there is a very comfortable and pleasant lot 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.329
 an important feature of all these compact 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.310
 tools from yamaha 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.289
 well tools from the p series is 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.330
 very simple and comfortable design is not here 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.880
 nothing complicated almost pay attention 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.830
 on the front toolbar all that u 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.930
 here we have this power button 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.030
 shutdown protection and we can't just 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.570
 so score so no problems with it 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.400
 will arise 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.410
 further we have volume control and 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.150
 fan button which sap become 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.669
 allows you to access all 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:47.620
 tools that says here 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.510
 to metronome metronome size settings 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.160
 and so on to do everything through one 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.800
 the single button is very cool and 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.330
 comfortable on the back of the instrument 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.699
 there is a connector for the unit 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.580
 power connector for pedal 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.270
 sustain it is very important for digital 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.190
 piano 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.300
 Further we have a headphone jack is 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.550
 necessarily an element too 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.310
 here you can connect any speakers you 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.650
 will leave the instrument on a big sound and in 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.090
 the left side we have a usb connector with 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.729
 by which we will connect 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.050
 computer built-in tool 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.880
 the acoustics of this instrument allows 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.270
 working with him quite self offline 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.460
 here there are two speakers each 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.660
 of which has a power of 6 watts if 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.090
 you need for example a tool for 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.580
 homework to practice it 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.830
 principle is a very good option except 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.639
 In addition, the acoustics of the net produces bright 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.380
 pleasant timbre 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.729
 Well, in general in my opinion this is one of 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.470
 the best options if you are 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.150
 planning to buy inexpensive 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.460
 tool without tricked out functional 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.620
 without training without any there 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.479
 accompaniment section note 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.699
 on cheap yamaha tools 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.000
 this is probably the best that is on our 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.370
 market in terms of price and quality 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.770
 well, yamaha psr ak5 is one of the most 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.479
 new tools as known digital 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.560
 piano than believe me as 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.130
 thread tools have the property 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.740
 become obsolete so hurry pay 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.280
 attention to this tool he is in 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.110
 the presence of 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.880
 now in stores musicals come 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.849
 test well and on this our review
