is<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.779> personal<00:00:19.640> little<00:00:20.640> cubbyhole<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.300> when

is my personal little cubbyhole for when

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.480 
is my personal little cubbyhole for when
I<00:00:21.660> want<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> come<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.560> farm<00:00:22.859> some<00:00:23.100> iron<00:00:23.250> horde

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
I want to come and farm some iron horde

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.269 
I want to come and farm some iron horde
scraps<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.029> couple<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.630> reasons<00:00:24.750> why<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.070> mobs

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
scraps a couple of reasons why the mobs

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.490 
scraps a couple of reasons why the mobs
here<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.640> level<00:00:26.880> 94<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.380> be

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
here are level 94 so they can be

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.679 
here are level 94 so they can be
defeated<00:00:28.800> with<00:00:29.310> relative<00:00:29.789> ease<00:00:29.910> which<00:00:30.390> allows

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
defeated with relative ease which allows

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.440 
defeated with relative ease which allows
you<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.279> obviously<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> more<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.210> dead

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
you to obviously the more that's dead

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.819 
you to obviously the more that's dead
the<00:00:33.630> more<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.110> looted<00:00:34.500> gives<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the more that can be looted gives you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.310 
the more that can be looted gives you
more<00:00:34.950> chance<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.399> getting<00:00:35.460> iron<00:00:35.760> horde<00:00:36.000> scraps

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
more chance of getting iron horde scraps

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.750 
more chance of getting iron horde scraps
another<00:00:37.320> good<00:00:37.500> reason<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.040> they<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
another good reason is they have a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.720 
another good reason is they have a
really<00:00:39.090> quick<00:00:39.719> respawn<00:00:40.350> time<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.890> well<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.129> by

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
really quick respawn time as well so by

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.299 
really quick respawn time as well so by
time<00:00:42.090> I've<00:00:42.719> done<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> circuit<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.860> area

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
time I've done a circuit of the area

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.720 
time I've done a circuit of the area
then<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.660> should<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.079> ready<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.399> them<00:00:47.610> all

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
then I should be ready to do them all

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.500 
then I should be ready to do them all
over<00:00:47.760> again

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
over again

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.770 
over again

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
just let's just put it into that kind of

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.490 
just let's just put it into that kind of
perspective<00:01:14.270> but<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> wanted<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> wee<00:01:16.350> bit

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
perspective but I wanted to do a wee bit

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490 
perspective but I wanted to do a wee bit
of<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> test<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.220> wanted<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:18.030> how<00:01:18.750> things

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
of a test I wanted to see how things

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.370 
of a test I wanted to see how things
could<00:01:19.860> change<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.580> other<00:01:20.790> areas<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:22.080> we

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
could change in other areas so as we

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.609 
could change in other areas so as we
come<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> last<00:01:23.700> 20<00:01:24.420> odd<00:01:24.450> seconds<00:01:25.170> of

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
come now to the last 20 odd seconds of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.130 
come now to the last 20 odd seconds of
my<00:01:26.369> our<00:01:26.640> stint<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> do<00:01:28.020> an

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
hour here and then I'm gonna take myself

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
hour here and then I'm gonna take myself
to<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> level<00:01:31.860> 100<00:01:33.320> iron<00:01:34.320> horde<00:01:34.619> base<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> see

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to a level 100 iron horde base and see

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
to a level 100 iron horde base and see
if<00:01:35.820> there's<00:01:36.090> any<00:01:36.299> difference<00:01:36.799> you<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:38.250> with

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
if there's any difference you know with

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
if there's any difference you know with
the<00:01:39.090> drop<00:01:39.509> rates<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> iron<00:01:40.409> horde<00:01:40.710> scraps

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the drop rates of the iron horde scraps

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
the drop rates of the iron horde scraps
is<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.939> better<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.570> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
is it going to be better here is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.230 
is it going to be better here is
actually<00:01:43.619> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.009> better<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:45.090> I'm

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
actually going to be better when I'm

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.420 
actually going to be better when I'm
tackling<00:01:45.720> mobs<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> same<00:01:46.920> sort<00:01:47.310> of

times<00:01:52.619> run<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.130> let's<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.460> let's<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.149> move

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
times run out let's just let's just move

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
times run out let's just let's just move
away<00:01:54.479> from<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.810> dude<00:01:55.049> let's<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:56.100> how<00:01:56.460> many

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
away from that dude let's see how many

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.749 
away from that dude let's see how many
scraps<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.600> managed<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.490> hour

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
scraps I managed to get in the one hour

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.630 
scraps I managed to get in the one hour
so<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> take<00:02:00.689> away<00:02:00.869> 6<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.219> all<00:02:02.490> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so I take away 6 because that's all I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.560 
so I take away 6 because that's all I
already<00:02:03.030> had<00:02:03.350> 52<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.490> an<00:02:05.610> hours<00:02:06.060> farming

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
already had 52 so when an hours farming

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.999 
already had 52 so when an hours farming
here<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.049> got<00:02:07.409> 52<00:02:08.129> iron<00:02:09.090> horde<00:02:09.479> scraps<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.830> let's

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
here I got 52 iron horde scraps so let's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.800 
here I got 52 iron horde scraps so let's
move<00:02:11.220> myself<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:11.940> new<00:02:12.120> area

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
move myself to this new area

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.040 
move myself to this new area
goto<00:02:13.080> blade<00:02:13.590> Furies<00:02:14.489> command<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
goto blade Furies command this is the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.190 
goto blade Furies command this is the
area<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.590> links<00:02:17.190> talador<00:02:17.849> with<00:02:18.540> gorgrond

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
area that links talador with gorgrond

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.610 
area that links talador with gorgrond
also<00:02:19.980> takes<00:02:20.280> into<00:02:20.580> Frostfire<00:02:21.060> Ridge<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.630> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
also takes into Frostfire Ridge and to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.410 
also takes into Frostfire Ridge and to
tanaan<00:02:22.980> jungle<00:02:23.010> which<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:23.940> available<00:02:24.300> you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
tanaan jungle which is not available you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.240 
tanaan jungle which is not available you
have<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.599> go<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> world<00:02:25.140> map<00:02:25.530> you'll<00:02:26.069> get<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
have to go to the world map you'll get a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.490 
have to go to the world map you'll get a
much<00:02:26.550> better<00:02:26.819> idea<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.420> where<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> currently<00:02:28.290> am

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
much better idea of where I currently am

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.850 
much better idea of where I currently am
now<00:02:29.310> all<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.849> iron<00:02:30.180> horde<00:02:30.690> dudes<00:02:31.110> around<00:02:31.410> here

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
now all the iron horde dudes around here

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.839 
now all the iron horde dudes around here
and<00:02:32.130> dudettes<00:02:32.930> all<00:02:33.930> over<00:02:34.140> 100<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:35.489> I'm<00:02:35.730> gonna

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
and dudettes all over 100 so I'm gonna

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.199 
and dudettes all over 100 so I'm gonna
buff<00:02:36.180> myself<00:02:36.720> up<00:02:37.099> getting<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.400> area<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
buff myself up getting to this area and

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.839 
buff myself up getting to this area and
let's<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.780> see<00:02:39.959> exactly<00:02:40.170> how<00:02:41.160> many<00:02:41.220> iron

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
let's just see exactly how many iron

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.020 
let's just see exactly how many iron
horde<00:02:42.239> scraps<00:02:42.720> are<00:02:42.840> gonna<00:02:42.930> drop<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.380> another

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
horde scraps are gonna drop in another

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.539 
horde scraps are gonna drop in another
hours<00:02:45.030> worth<00:02:45.299> of<00:02:45.569> farming<00:02:46.140> now<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.340> not

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
hours worth of farming now this is not

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.940 
hours worth of farming now this is not
an<00:02:47.670> exact<00:02:48.030> science<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.569> course<00:02:48.810> because<00:02:49.290> these

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
an exact science of course because these

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.120 
an exact science of course because these
drop<00:02:50.370> rates<00:02:50.610> are<00:02:50.880> complete<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.480> utter<00:02:51.630> RNG<00:02:52.380> so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
drop rates are complete and utter RNG so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.110 
drop rates are complete and utter RNG so
I<00:02:53.160> could<00:02:53.519> have<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:54.140> huge<00:02:55.140> drop<00:02:55.739> right<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.250> but

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
I could have a huge drop right here but

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.820 
I could have a huge drop right here but
that<00:02:57.150> doesn't<00:02:57.269> necessarily<00:02:57.780> mean<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:58.620> any

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
that doesn't necessarily mean it's any

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.100 
that doesn't necessarily mean it's any
better<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.910> be<00:03:00.030> perfectly<00:03:00.540> honest<00:03:00.870> with<00:03:01.049> you

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
better to be perfectly honest with you

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.759 
better to be perfectly honest with you
the<00:03:01.560> drop<00:03:01.830> rates<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.280> iron<00:03:02.459> horde<00:03:02.730> scraps<00:03:03.120> seem

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
the drop rates of iron horde scraps seem

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.979 
the drop rates of iron horde scraps seem
ridiculously<00:03:04.769> low<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.340> I've<00:03:05.910> done<00:03:06.239> plenty<00:03:06.599> of

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
ridiculously low and I've done plenty of

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.630 
ridiculously low and I've done plenty of
dungeons<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.680> well<00:03:07.860> where<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.160> lot<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.430> people

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
dungeons as well where a lot of people

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.280 
dungeons as well where a lot of people
saying<00:03:08.849> go<00:03:09.090> into<00:03:09.269> dungeons<00:03:09.660> cuz<00:03:09.840> dungeons

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
saying go into dungeons cuz dungeons

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.410 
saying go into dungeons cuz dungeons
seem<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.799> much<00:03:10.950> better<00:03:11.220> area<00:03:11.700> for<00:03:12.330> them

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
seem to be the much better area for them

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.630 
seem to be the much better area for them
to<00:03:12.599> drop<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.380> in<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.680> dungeons<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.400> i've

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
to drop that in the dungeons that i've

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.240 
to drop that in the dungeons that i've
done<00:03:14.970> i've<00:03:15.360> only<00:03:15.630> got<00:03:15.870> ten<00:03:16.230> iron<00:03:16.470> horde<00:03:16.799> scraps

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
done i've only got ten iron horde scraps

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.220 
done i've only got ten iron horde scraps
and<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.970> was<00:03:18.090> actually<00:03:18.450> from<00:03:18.600> warlords

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
and that was actually from warlords

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.740 
and that was actually from warlords
ealer<00:03:19.590> at<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.859> end<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.880> black<00:03:21.090> rock<00:03:21.329> spire

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
ealer at the end up a black rock spire

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.710 
ealer at the end up a black rock spire
so<00:03:22.410> again<00:03:22.739> it's<00:03:23.010> very<00:03:23.190> very<00:03:23.790> difficult<00:03:24.150> to

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
so again it's very very difficult to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.410 
so again it's very very difficult to
understand<00:03:25.380> or<00:03:25.530> appreciate<00:03:26.120> what<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.239> kind

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
understand or appreciate what the kind

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.720 
understand or appreciate what the kind
of<00:03:27.540> orangey<00:03:27.900> drop<00:03:28.380> rates<00:03:28.620> are<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> think

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
of orangey drop rates are so I think

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.610 
of orangey drop rates are so I think
outside<00:03:29.940> in<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> world<00:03:30.660> you've<00:03:31.140> probably<00:03:31.380> got

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
outside in the world you've probably got

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.170 
outside in the world you've probably got
a<00:03:31.650> little<00:03:31.799> bit<00:03:31.950> more<00:03:32.040> control<00:03:32.700> over<00:03:32.730> things

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
a little bit more control over things

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.080 
a little bit more control over things
and<00:03:33.510> what<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.049> mean<00:03:34.260> by<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.459> you're

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
and what I mean by that is that you're

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.030 
and what I mean by that is that you're
deciding<00:03:36.660> how<00:03:36.840> long<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.230> stay<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.560> an<00:03:37.769> area

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
deciding how long you stay in an area

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
deciding how long you stay in an area
you're<00:03:38.130> not<00:03:38.160> queueing<00:03:38.700> up<00:03:38.790> you're<00:03:38.970> not

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
you're not queueing up you're not

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.120 
you're not queueing up you're not
wasting<00:03:39.269> your<00:03:39.569> time<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.620> let's<00:03:40.829> have<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.040> look

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
wasting your time so let's have a look

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.890 
wasting your time so let's have a look
now<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> actually<00:03:41.639> got<00:03:42.060> two<00:03:42.299> more<00:03:42.510> scraps

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
now I actually got two more scraps

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.650 
now I actually got two more scraps
before<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.319> arrived<00:03:43.680> here<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.280> after<00:03:45.000> half<00:03:45.329> an

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
before I arrived here and after half an

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.890

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
hour half an hour of farming here I've

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.620 
hour half an hour of farming here I've
only<00:03:49.170> managed<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.920> obtain<00:03:50.690> 16<00:03:52.459> 16<00:03:53.459> scraps<00:03:54.030> so

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
only managed to obtain 16 16 scraps so

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.900 
only managed to obtain 16 16 scraps so
again<00:03:54.870> let's<00:03:55.380> flip<00:03:55.650> back<00:03:55.680> an<00:03:55.950> hour<00:03:56.370> at<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
again let's flip back an hour at the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.550 
again let's flip back an hour at the
other<00:03:57.030> location<00:03:57.720> 52<00:03:58.560> scraps<00:03:59.600> here<00:04:00.600> half<00:04:01.290> an

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
other location 52 scraps here half an

other location 52 scraps here half an
hour<00:04:02.090> 16<00:04:03.090> scraps<00:04:03.690> that's<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.290> when<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.100> was

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
hour 16 scraps that's it when I was

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.640 
hour 16 scraps that's it when I was
leaving<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.900> previous<00:04:06.900> area<00:04:07.139> one<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
leaving the the previous area one of the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.199 
leaving the the previous area one of the
guards<00:04:08.010> run<00:04:08.190> after<00:04:08.459> me<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.730> just<00:04:08.790> stopped

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
guards run after me so I just stopped

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.449 
guards run after me so I just stopped
killed<00:04:09.510> him<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.840> he<00:04:10.350> dropped<00:04:10.560> two<00:04:10.680> scraps<00:04:11.010> so

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
killed him and he dropped two scraps so

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.520 
killed him and he dropped two scraps so
it<00:04:11.549> took<00:04:11.700> about<00:04:11.790> 58<00:04:12.389> to<00:04:12.630> 60<00:04:13.019> so<00:04:13.200> it's<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:13.350> great

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
it took about 58 to 60 so it's a great

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.170 
it took about 58 to 60 so it's a great
little<00:04:13.650> starting<00:04:14.130> point<00:04:14.400> for<00:04:14.519> here<00:04:14.730> but

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
little starting point for here but

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.860 
little starting point for here but
obviously<00:04:15.630> as<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:16.019> level<00:04:16.470> 100<00:04:16.729> area<00:04:17.729> these<00:04:18.539> guys

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
obviously as a level 100 area these guys

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.590 
obviously as a level 100 area these guys
the<00:04:19.109> same<00:04:19.320> level<00:04:19.650> as<00:04:19.739> me<00:04:19.950> I'm<00:04:20.130> killing

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
the same level as me I'm killing

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.410 
the same level as me I'm killing
just<00:04:22.190> pretty<00:04:23.190> much<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.520> same<00:04:23.730> if<00:04:24.060> not<00:04:24.360> more

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
just pretty much the same if not more

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.350 
just pretty much the same if not more
because<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.580> areas<00:04:26.910> in<00:04:27.060> which<00:04:27.150> they

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
because the the areas in which they

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.860 
because the the areas in which they
spawn<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:28.020> slightly<00:04:28.470> more<00:04:28.850> concentrated

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
spawn in a slightly more concentrated

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.780 
spawn in a slightly more concentrated
and<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.080> respawn<00:04:31.560> time<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:32.070> them<00:04:32.250> is<00:04:32.400> pretty

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
and the respawn time of them is pretty

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.510 
and the respawn time of them is pretty
low<00:04:33.120> as<00:04:33.270> well<00:04:33.450> so<00:04:33.780> even<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:34.620> smaller<00:04:35.070> area

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
low as well so even in this smaller area

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.280 
low as well so even in this smaller area
that<00:04:35.670> I'm<00:04:35.790> in<00:04:35.970> at<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.420> top<00:04:36.630> there<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:36.900> go<00:04:37.080> look

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
that I'm in at the top there you go look

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.740 
that I'm in at the top there you go look
they're<00:04:37.770> already<00:04:37.920> coming<00:04:38.520> back<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.570> again

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
they're already coming back so again

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.780 
they're already coming back so again
let's<00:04:39.990> fast<00:04:40.290> forward<00:04:40.440> time<00:04:40.950> this<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.610> last

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
let's fast forward time this is the last

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.890 
let's fast forward time this is the last
25<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:43.080> seconds<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:44.550> my<00:04:45.030> buffs<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.570> they're

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
25 of seconds of my buffs that they're

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.290 
25 of seconds of my buffs that they're
my<00:04:46.080> time<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.920> know<00:04:46.980> I've<00:04:47.250> been<00:04:47.280> here<00:04:47.670> for

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
my time is I know I've been here for

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.730 
my time is I know I've been here for
exactly<00:04:48.690> an<00:04:49.020> hour<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.440> I'm<00:04:49.530> going<00:04:49.680> to

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
exactly an hour and I'm going to

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.920 
exactly an hour and I'm going to
probably<00:04:49.980> manage<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.520> take<00:04:50.700> out<00:04:50.940> another<00:04:51.300> four

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
probably manage to take out another four

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.850 
probably manage to take out another four
or<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.730> of<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.510> iron<00:04:54.690> horde<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.680> only

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
or so of the the iron horde the only

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.650 
or so of the the iron horde the only
ones<00:04:56.070> that<00:04:56.190> are<00:04:56.430> relatively<00:04:57.120> annoying<00:04:57.450> to

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
ones that are relatively annoying to

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.660 
ones that are relatively annoying to
fight<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.410> bulwark<00:04:58.830> ones<00:04:59.190> because<00:04:59.430> they<00:04:59.520> put

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
fight the bulwark ones because they put

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.880 
fight the bulwark ones because they put
a<00:04:59.730> reflective<00:05:00.330> shield<00:05:00.630> on<00:05:00.990> them<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.590> only<00:05:01.770> way

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
a reflective shield on them the only way

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.470 
a reflective shield on them the only way
to<00:05:01.950> get<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.340> reflective<00:05:02.850> shield<00:05:03.030> off<00:05:03.270> is

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
to get the reflective shield off is

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.590 
to get the reflective shield off is
either<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.230> wait<00:05:04.410> it<00:05:04.620> out<00:05:04.740> or<00:05:05.730> to<00:05:06.120> stun<00:05:06.420> them

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
either to to wait it out or to stun them

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.480 
either to to wait it out or to stun them
to<00:05:06.750> incapacitate<00:05:07.020> not<00:05:07.740> fear<00:05:08.010> them<00:05:08.250> because

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
to incapacitate not fear them because

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.430 
to incapacitate not fear them because
they'll<00:05:08.670> just<00:05:08.880> reflect<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.390> but<00:05:09.570> some<00:05:10.140> sort<00:05:10.380> of

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
they'll just reflect it but some sort of

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.010 
they'll just reflect it but some sort of
stun<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.700> will<00:05:11.820> knock<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.090> off<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:12.780> there

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
stun and that will knock it off so there

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.420 
stun and that will knock it off so there
you<00:05:13.050> go<00:05:13.140> I<00:05:13.200> think<00:05:13.470> that's<00:05:13.590> pretty<00:05:13.950> much<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.370> I

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
you go I think that's pretty much it I

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.410 
you go I think that's pretty much it I
think<00:05:14.610> we'll<00:05:14.700> just<00:05:14.820> do<00:05:14.940> this<00:05:15.060> one<00:05:15.270> more

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
think we'll just do this one more

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.380 
think we'll just do this one more
because<00:05:16.410> I<00:05:16.710> need<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.220> leave<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:17.790> body<00:05:18.030> over

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
because I need to leave that body over

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.910 
because I need to leave that body over
there<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:18.720> I'll<00:05:18.780> just<00:05:18.960> take<00:05:19.170> out<00:05:19.380> one<00:05:19.410> more<00:05:19.890> I

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
there so I'll just take out one more I

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.640 
there so I'll just take out one more I
don't<00:05:20.130> think<00:05:20.460> it's<00:05:20.610> going<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.910> affect<00:05:21.650> the

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
don't think it's going to affect the

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.770 
don't think it's going to affect the
science<00:05:23.220> of<00:05:23.520> this<00:05:23.730> little<00:05:24.090> experiment<00:05:24.360> too

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
science of this little experiment too

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.210 
science of this little experiment too
much<00:05:24.990> especially<00:05:25.230> if<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.650> doesn't<00:05:25.890> drop<00:05:26.040> any

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
much especially if it doesn't drop any

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.520 
much especially if it doesn't drop any
hard<00:05:26.430> scores<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.420> horde<00:05:27.660> scraps<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.170> it

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
hard scores and horde scraps and it

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.220 
hard scores and horde scraps and it
didn't<00:05:28.860> so<00:05:29.520> let's<00:05:29.760> see<00:05:30.030> what<00:05:30.420> number<00:05:30.780> we<00:05:30.930> ended

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
didn't so let's see what number we ended

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.710 
didn't so let's see what number we ended
up<00:05:31.350> on<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.830> you're<00:05:32.070> gonna<00:05:32.190> be<00:05:32.460> amazed<00:05:33.270> here

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
up on and you're gonna be amazed here

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.660 
up on and you're gonna be amazed here
because<00:05:34.260> in<00:05:34.770> half<00:05:35.190> an<00:05:35.370> hour

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
because in half an hour

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.090 
because in half an hour
I<00:05:35.760> found<00:05:36.150> 16<00:05:36.920> by<00:05:37.920> the<00:05:37.980> end<00:05:38.340> of<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.730> I<00:05:39.090> found<00:05:40.100> 53

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
I found 16 by the end of it I found 53

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.320 
I found 16 by the end of it I found 53
in<00:05:41.490> total<00:05:42.180> actually<00:05:42.930> one<00:05:43.320> more<00:05:43.800> than<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:44.940> area

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
in total actually one more than the area

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.450 
in total actually one more than the area
that<00:05:45.450> I<00:05:45.480> was<00:05:45.660> previously<00:05:45.990> in<00:05:46.320> yes<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.920> second

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
that I was previously in yes the second

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.060 
that I was previously in yes the second
30<00:05:47.760> minutes<00:05:48.180> that<00:05:48.330> was<00:05:48.450> here<00:05:48.690> was<00:05:49.440> won't<00:05:49.950> so

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
30 minutes that was here was won't so

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.390 
30 minutes that was here was won't so
much<00:05:50.100> say<00:05:50.520> raining<00:05:51.390> iron<00:05:51.840> horde<00:05:52.080> scraps<00:05:52.500> but

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
much say raining iron horde scraps but

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.280 
much say raining iron horde scraps but
they<00:05:53.550> were<00:05:53.610> certainly<00:05:53.940> coming<00:05:54.390> at<00:05:54.660> a<00:05:54.810> greater

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
they were certainly coming at a greater

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.550 
they were certainly coming at a greater
rate<00:05:55.770> of<00:05:55.830> knots<00:05:56.370> so<00:05:57.090> 52<00:05:57.960> in<00:05:58.260> the<00:05:58.470> level<00:05:58.740> 94<00:05:59.400> area

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560

53<00:06:01.560> in<00:06:01.980> the<00:06:02.040> level<00:06:02.850> 100<00:06:03.780> area<00:06:04.140> so<00:06:05.040> what<00:06:05.190> can<00:06:05.370> we

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
53 in the level 100 area so what can we

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.430 
53 in the level 100 area so what can we
discern<00:06:05.880> from<00:06:06.120> this<00:06:06.300> wee<00:06:06.540> bit<00:06:06.810> of<00:06:06.900> a<00:06:06.960> test<00:06:07.260> a

honest<00:06:57.080> with<00:06:57.170> you<00:06:57.350> I<00:06:57.530> think<00:06:57.950> that's<00:06:58.460> not<00:06:58.790> bad

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
honest with you I think that's not bad

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.290 
honest with you I think that's not bad
at<00:06:59.480> all<00:06:59.540> because<00:07:00.290> that<00:07:00.320> is<00:07:00.770> pretty<00:07:01.490> much<00:07:01.790> one

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
at all because that is pretty much one

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.040 
at all because that is pretty much one
piece<00:07:02.720> of<00:07:03.340> transmog<00:07:04.340> gear<00:07:04.700> so<00:07:05.390> if<00:07:05.540> you<00:07:05.660> were<00:07:05.840> to

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
piece of transmog gear so if you were to

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.110 
piece of transmog gear so if you were to
farm<00:07:06.620> from<00:07:06.890> let's<00:07:07.100> say<00:07:07.280> nine<00:07:07.580> o'clock<00:07:07.940> in<00:07:07.970> the

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120

morning till five o'clock at night into

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.410 
an eight hour stint of farming the

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.350 
an eight hour stint of farming the
likelihood<00:07:12.980> is<00:07:13.010> you're<00:07:13.520> gonna<00:07:13.640> pick<00:07:14.000> up<00:07:14.180> a

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
likelihood is you're gonna pick up a

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.930 
likelihood is you're gonna pick up a
hell<00:07:14.870> of<00:07:14.900> a<00:07:15.110> lot<00:07:15.290> of<00:07:15.500> iron<00:07:15.980> horde<00:07:16.280> scraps<00:07:16.730> in

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
hell of a lot of iron horde scraps in

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.020 
hell of a lot of iron horde scraps in
the<00:07:17.090> process<00:07:17.600> but<00:07:18.170> I'm<00:07:18.860> quite<00:07:19.190> happy<00:07:19.400> with<00:07:19.850> it

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
the process but I'm quite happy with it

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.960 
the process but I'm quite happy with it
ring<00:07:20.270> roughly<00:07:20.780> around<00:07:21.290> 50<00:07:21.830> in<00:07:22.010> either<00:07:22.580> area

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
ring roughly around 50 in either area

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.080 
ring roughly around 50 in either area
doesn't<00:07:23.420> matter<00:07:23.570> if<00:07:23.750> it's<00:07:23.870> 94<00:07:24.500> or<00:07:24.740> level<00:07:25.430> 100

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090

doesn't matter if it's 94 or level 100
so<00:07:26.300> if<00:07:26.420> you<00:07:26.540> want<00:07:26.780> to<00:07:26.870> get<00:07:26.990> these<00:07:27.110> fantastic

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410 
so if you want to get these fantastic

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.970 
so if you want to get these fantastic
transmog<00:07:28.310> sets<00:07:28.640> get<00:07:29.570> out<00:07:29.690> there<00:07:30.020> do<00:07:30.710> a<00:07:30.740> little

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:30.980 
transmog sets get out there do a little

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.920 
transmog sets get out there do a little
bit<00:07:31.100> of<00:07:31.130> farming<00:07:31.400> so<00:07:32.120> I<00:07:32.150> hope<00:07:32.390> you<00:07:32.510> enjoyed<00:07:32.780> the
