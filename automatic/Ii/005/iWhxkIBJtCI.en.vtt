00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929 

a<00:00:00.170> wood<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.410> off<00:00:01.620> youtube<00:00:02.040> scroll<00:00:02.490> I<00:00:02.520> came<00:00:02.760> here

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
a wood is off youtube scroll I came here

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.380 
a wood is off youtube scroll I came here
again<00:00:03.240> back<00:00:04.460> what's<00:00:05.460> another<00:00:05.700> video<00:00:06.089> and

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
again back what's another video and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.789 
again back what's another video and
today<00:00:06.569> we're<00:00:06.960> going<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.109> be<00:00:07.259> doing<00:00:07.470> some

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
today we're going to be doing some

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.160 
today we're going to be doing some
parkour<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.820> GTA<00:00:10.250> this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.790> mod<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.840> was

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
parkour on GTA this is a mod that was

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.230 
parkour on GTA this is a mod that was
just<00:00:13.410> released<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.700> think<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.030> pretty

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
just released and I think it's pretty

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.460 
just released and I think it's pretty
cool<00:00:15.920> it<00:00:16.920> basically<00:00:17.130> uses<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.900> ragdoll

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
cool it basically uses the ragdoll

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.980 
cool it basically uses the ragdoll
physics<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:23.930> so<00:00:24.930> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
physics to do it you can see here so it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.349 
physics to do it you can see here so it
bro<00:00:25.279> but<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> have<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> get<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> timings

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
bro but you have to get the timings

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
bro but you have to get the timings
right<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.439> key<00:00:28.560> tail<00:00:28.740> Obama<00:00:29.099> says<00:00:29.250> rag

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
right like the key tail Obama says rag

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.190 
right like the key tail Obama says rag
doll<00:00:29.760> has<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.099> jump<00:00:33.200> just

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
doll has to be on and then you jump just

00:00:34.200 --> 00:01:00.340 
doll has to be on and then you jump just
to<00:00:34.260> get<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> timing<00:00:34.770> Dre

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:09.610 

whew<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.280> was<00:01:01.489> good

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:23.149 

ok<00:01:10.520> ok<00:01:13.720> ok<00:01:14.720> ok<00:01:18.220> got<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.370> hang<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.730> it

the<00:02:24.500> video<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:25.700> was<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.910> pretty<00:02:26.060> short<00:02:26.330> video

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
the video this was a pretty short video

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.200 
the video this was a pretty short video
just<00:02:27.440> showing<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.830> this<00:02:28.070> part<00:02:28.520> form<00:02:28.820> out<00:02:29.030> of

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
just showing you this part form out of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.990 
just showing you this part form out of
that<00:02:29.390> someone<00:02:30.350> just<00:02:30.560> released<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.790> pretty

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
that someone just released it's pretty

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.780 
that someone just released it's pretty
cool<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:32.900> uses<00:02:33.050> ragdoll<00:02:33.710> physics

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
cool it just uses ragdoll physics

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.140 
cool it just uses ragdoll physics
basically<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.210> can<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.510> here<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:37.310> flip<00:02:37.670> it's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
basically you can see here the flip it's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.900 
basically you can see here the flip it's
kind<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:39.620> kind<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.160> hard<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.490> control

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
kind of it's kind of hard to control

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.550 
kind of it's kind of hard to control
though<00:02:41.180> that's<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.510> only<00:02:41.690> like<00:02:41.840> downside<00:02:42.380> to

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
though that's the only like downside to

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.280 
though that's the only like downside to
it<00:02:43.300> because<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.390> got<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.630> get<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> time<00:02:45.080> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
it because you got to get the time and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.710 
it because you got to get the time and
drink<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.230> jump<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.940> turn<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.240> on<00:02:53.390> and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
drink but if you jump you turn it on and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.900 
drink but if you jump you turn it on and
your<00:02:53.870> stew<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.570> should<00:02:56.750> be<00:02:56.780> good<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:58.550> if

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
your stew and you should be good so if

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.160 
your stew and you should be good so if
you<00:02:58.970> guys<00:02:59.090> like<00:02:59.300> this<00:02:59.330> video<00:02:59.600> make<00:02:59.810> sure<00:02:59.990> you
