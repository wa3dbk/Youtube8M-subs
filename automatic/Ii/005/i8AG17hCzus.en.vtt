00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
or you work it into the meat it causes

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
or you work it into the meat it causes
the<00:01:20.160> meat<00:01:20.310> proteins<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.940> break<00:01:21.149> down<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.660> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the meat proteins to break down and it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.690

makes it stickier and then you're going

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.400
