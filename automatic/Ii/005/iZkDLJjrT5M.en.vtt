00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.520 
I'll be able to tank a little bit more
and<00:02:18.879> one<00:02:19.060> downside<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.659> that<00:02:19.689> is<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:19.959> am<00:02:20.109> 31

and one downside of that is I am 31

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.339 
and one downside of that is I am 31
prayer<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:22.269> reason<00:02:22.569> why<00:02:22.629> I'm<00:02:22.810> 31<00:02:23.140> prays

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
prayer and the reason why I'm 31 prays

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.709

probably<00:03:24.790> have<00:03:24.970> 90<00:03:25.329> to<00:03:25.540> 95<00:03:26.409> strength<00:03:26.919> if

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
probably have 90 to 95 strength if

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.409 
probably have 90 to 95 strength if
they're<00:03:27.400> an<00:03:27.459> issue<00:03:27.609> up<00:03:27.760> here<00:03:27.940> probably<00:03:28.150> have

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
they're an issue up here probably have

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.939 
they're an issue up here probably have
the<00:03:28.510> same<00:03:28.690> strength<00:03:28.930> around<00:03:29.079> me<00:03:29.319> maybe<00:03:29.560> one<00:03:29.829> or

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
the same strength around me maybe one or

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.110 
the same strength around me maybe one or
two<00:03:29.979> higher<00:03:30.250> depending<00:03:30.549> on<00:03:30.729> their<00:03:30.909> prayer

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
two higher depending on their prayer

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.750 
two higher depending on their prayer
level<00:03:31.449> that's<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.139> good<00:03:32.290> thing<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.400> can<00:03:33.459> still

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
level that's a good thing so I can still

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.599 
level that's a good thing so I can still
smack<00:03:34.060> good<00:03:34.359> DBS<00:03:34.900> specs<00:03:35.199> and<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:36.099> also<00:03:36.280> have<00:03:36.519> the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
smack good DBS specs and I also have the

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.729 
smack good DBS specs and I also have the
option<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.090> having<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.599> dragon<00:03:38.199> battle<00:03:38.409> axe

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
option of having the dragon battle axe

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.640 
option of having the dragon battle axe
and<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.129> dragon<00:03:39.609> mace<00:03:40.109> more<00:03:41.109> so<00:03:41.319> of<00:03:41.530> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
and the dragon mace more so of the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.409 
and the dragon mace more so of the
dragon<00:03:42.010> mace<00:03:42.129> because<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.669> more<00:03:42.909> powerful

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
dragon mace because it is more powerful

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.550 
dragon mace because it is more powerful
in<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.989> while<00:03:44.169> and<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.639> costs<00:03:45.639> less<00:03:45.879> so<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.560> that

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
in a while and it costs less so I that

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.140 
in a while and it costs less so I that
is<00:03:47.680> more<00:03:47.889> ideal<00:03:48.099> for<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.639> wild

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
is more ideal for the wild

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.110 
is more ideal for the wild
I<00:03:49.180> could<00:03:49.840> probably<00:03:49.959> smack<00:03:50.349> like<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.530> 44<00:03:51.120> with

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
I could probably smack like a 44 with

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.689 
I could probably smack like a 44 with
the<00:03:52.269> D<00:03:52.419> mace<00:03:52.629> which<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.930> really<00:03:53.169> cool<00:03:53.699> it's

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
the D mace which is really cool it's

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.219 
the D mace which is really cool it's
pretty<00:03:54.760> cool<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.629> it<00:03:55.690> was<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.840> dragon<00:03:56.049> battle

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
pretty cool and it was a dragon battle

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.500 
pretty cool and it was a dragon battle
ox<00:03:56.409> probably<00:03:56.680> smack<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:57.069> like<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.370> 40<00:03:57.790> maybe<00:03:58.060> 39

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
ox probably smack it like a 40 maybe 39

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.719 
ox probably smack it like a 40 maybe 39
38<00:03:58.810> something<00:03:59.139> around<00:03:59.260> there<00:03:59.439> and<00:04:00.430> then<00:04:00.549> with

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
38 something around there and then with

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.360 
38 something around there and then with
the<00:04:00.790> D<00:04:00.909> long<00:04:01.090> probably<00:04:01.479> 38<00:04:02.109> 39<00:04:02.349> 40<00:04:02.500> around

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
the D long probably 38 39 40 around

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.300 
the D long probably 38 39 40 around
there<00:04:03.519> with<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.150> speck<00:04:04.419> of<00:04:04.870> course<00:04:05.310> that's

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
there with the speck of course that's

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.819 
there with the speck of course that's
pretty<00:04:06.549> fun<00:04:06.729> and<00:04:07.510> that's<00:04:08.229> kind<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.590> reason

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
pretty fun and that's kind of the reason

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.949 
pretty fun and that's kind of the reason
why<00:04:08.949> I<00:04:08.979> got<00:04:09.129> 35<00:04:09.430> defense<00:04:09.909> another<00:04:10.659> point<00:04:10.900> I

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
why I got 35 defense another point I

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.199 
why I got 35 defense another point I
want<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.109> bring<00:04:11.169> up<00:04:11.439> is<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.650> I'm<00:04:12.430> 35<00:04:12.849> defense

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
want to bring up is that I'm 35 defense

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.270 
want to bring up is that I'm 35 defense
but<00:04:13.449> I<00:04:13.629> can<00:04:13.870> still<00:04:14.109> get<00:04:14.259> 40<00:04:14.590> defense<00:04:14.859> if<00:04:14.949> I<00:04:15.040> want

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
but I can still get 40 defense if I want

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.729 
but I can still get 40 defense if I want
to<00:04:15.430> know<00:04:15.879> I<00:04:15.909> can<00:04:16.150> still<00:04:16.419> get<00:04:16.630> 40<00:04:17.049> defense<00:04:17.440> and

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
to know I can still get 40 defense and

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.699 
to know I can still get 40 defense and
be<00:04:18.009> a<00:04:18.280> room<00:04:18.639> peer<00:04:19.169> just<00:04:20.169> like<00:04:20.259> everyone<00:04:20.560> else

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
be a room peer just like everyone else

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.610 
be a room peer just like everyone else
no<00:04:21.479> actually<00:04:22.479> most<00:04:22.599> people<00:04:22.900> are<00:04:22.990> Zurcher<00:04:23.349> Z's

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
no actually most people are Zurcher Z's

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.339 
no actually most people are Zurcher Z's
days<00:04:23.860> because<00:04:24.279> I<00:04:24.750> can't<00:04:25.750> get<00:04:25.840> burrows<00:04:26.110> close

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
days because I can't get burrows close

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.420 
days because I can't get burrows close
without<00:04:26.560> being<00:04:26.680> forward

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
without being forward

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.040 
without being forward
one<00:04:27.610> defense<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.240> most<00:04:28.419> people<00:04:28.479> say<00:04:28.930> it

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
one defense so most people say it

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.999 
one defense so most people say it
I'll<00:04:29.470> just<00:04:29.500> get<00:04:29.770> 45<00:04:30.130> defense<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:31.360> um<00:04:32.009> that's

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
I'll just get 45 defense so um that's

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.310 
I'll just get 45 defense so um that's
another<00:04:33.310> reason<00:04:33.639> is<00:04:33.880> that<00:04:34.120> high<00:04:34.900> level<00:04:35.259> is

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
another reason is that high level is

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.659 
another reason is that high level is
that<00:04:35.440> your<00:04:35.560> your<00:04:35.949> fighting<00:04:36.160> are<00:04:36.340> mostly

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
that your your fighting are mostly

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.189 
that your your fighting are mostly
Zurcher<00:04:37.120> they're<00:04:37.300> not<00:04:37.389> gonna<00:04:37.509> be<00:04:37.660> for<00:04:37.840> defense

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
Zurcher they're not gonna be for defense

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.570 
Zurcher they're not gonna be for defense
peers<00:04:38.470> because<00:04:38.620> they<00:04:38.830> want<00:04:39.009> those<00:04:39.190> barrows

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
peers because they want those barrows

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.330 
peers because they want those barrows
gloves<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.180> max<00:04:40.419> strength<00:04:40.750> bonus<00:04:41.340> so

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
gloves for the max strength bonus so

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.590 
gloves for the max strength bonus so
most<00:04:42.520> people<00:04:42.639> are<00:04:42.759> suckers<00:04:42.940> out<00:04:43.210> there<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:43.570> I

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
most people are suckers out there so I

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.140 
most people are suckers out there so I
have<00:04:43.810> ten<00:04:44.139> less<00:04:44.380> streamed<00:04:44.830> levels<00:04:45.190> in<00:04:45.370> them<00:04:45.580> if

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
have ten less streamed levels in them if

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.210 
have ten less streamed levels in them if
you<00:04:46.270> think<00:04:46.300> about<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:46.960> it's<00:04:47.830> not<00:04:48.009> just

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
you think about it that it's not just

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.760 
you think about it that it's not just
five<00:04:48.460> it's<00:04:49.360> cuz<00:04:49.509> not<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.810> mean<00:04:49.990> not<00:04:50.350> many<00:04:50.530> people

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
five it's cuz not I mean not many people

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.020 
five it's cuz not I mean not many people
have<00:04:51.130> 40<00:04:51.520> defense

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
have 40 defense

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.760 
have 40 defense
most<00:04:52.240> people<00:04:52.479> have<00:04:52.600> 45<00:04:52.990> so<00:04:53.350> that's<00:04:53.530> another

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
most people have 45 so that's another

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.439 
most people have 45 so that's another
reason<00:04:54.120> why<00:04:55.120> I'm<00:04:55.240> 35<00:04:55.600> defense<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:57.580> can<00:04:58.270> also

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
reason why I'm 35 defense and I can also

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.879 
reason why I'm 35 defense and I can also
get<00:04:58.690> four<00:04:58.900> defend<00:04:59.229> so<00:04:59.320> I<00:04:59.350> just<00:04:59.590> want<00:04:59.770> to<00:04:59.800> do
