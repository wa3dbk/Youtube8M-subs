00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:09.080
 good speaks to them is a way that calls 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:11.849
 ultra extreme other 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.349
 Thank pretty good for if you 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.749
 wants to improve in minecraft that's the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.529
 perfect way to do if you want 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:22.080
 if you want to get seriously minecraft 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.830
 survival 100 that's the way very very very 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 I recommend Bacano the anger as 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.320
 you can see here in my hearts I 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.850
 right now I know it extreme way like how 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 we are going to attack 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.320
 look at the survival mode 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:45.270
 then in the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.570
 to see if this comes in 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:54.620
 this is already a map so good this 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.620
 mode in is an ultra extreme mode 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.239
 then if you lower your life there 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.239
 loses life does not regenerate 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.660
 all right 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:18.040
 that is, what he regenerated, not all 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.040
 the full meals because it did not regenerate me 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.200
 good but then there are only two ways 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.740
 to regenerate by making an apple of 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.159
 gold 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.210
 that is for 12.5 not then that apple 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 of gold is made like this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.250
 in this mode it would normally be like this 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.550
 this value is usually taken 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.450
 Once here, take out these and I shot here the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.330
 Apple 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.370
 normally so be apple neighbor 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.650
 gold in mein kampf but this model makes 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.240
 a little harder does it so that it 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.280
 have to make the golden apple like this 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.260
 we'll see 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.350
 then the apple has to be made 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.450
 and obligatorily, look, because if not, 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.250
 it's going to work out well and that's what we do 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 how I love 1 foot 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.860
 well then if you do not pay the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.630
 so then you touch them and then that 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.940
 makes the model something much harder 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.790
 because they have to find gold now 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.920
 makes everything have a very 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.660
 valuable in this game that has 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.270
 minecraft and and I hope that already in the new 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.350
 1.3 update is going to have many 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.100
 more uses of gold and just like someone is 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.490
 the advanced of the cob 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.620
 and it only regenerates me two hearts no more 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.170
 it does not regenerate me anymore 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.570
 so from hard in the other way is 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.670
 making the position and position of 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.710
 discovery as the commands that are 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.780
 make 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.590
 first with this we can a bowl of 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.569
 Aragon 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.060
 water we put it here we put it and 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.879
 we put him sneijder guard and we wait for a 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.269
 In the meantime we have to 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.780
 do an email on listening and then 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.450
 we wait for the co2 melon what 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.080
 we do this 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.180
 but as it is there is forgiveness is that the bar 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.969
 gold pearls to coca 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.140
 if I'm not wrong it's like that because 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:25.280
 that I had it and the beginning what there is not 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.280
 There is how it would be 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.360
 but what happens 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.240
 how is this thing 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.690
 come come here then you know 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.400
 how it's done you need nine blocks 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.400
 to to create that then that simile 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.420
 to create a gold minecraft block 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.450
 we put it like that and that's how melon is made 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.890
 glycerin in this mode usually mainka 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.720
 normal would be like that and already 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.180
 but as is the external engine 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.319
 then it has to be like this we get the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.980
 minor we already have our bodies and 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.860
 we put in here at least the interaction in 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.440
 the car and we hope because here they are 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.440
 and it takes a puncture of cure while 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.730
 It was perfect end here of a 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.870
 instant to have here but I take off 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.870
 what I do not like 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.400
 if they saw that priest also two hearts 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.920
 perfect 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.560
 and nothing that is the mode then you 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.960
 has to go with being extremely careful 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.530
 because if he loses well he can not 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.230
 regenerate only like that and then only 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.680
 this has to play with your friends 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:53.260
 then wait for something, wait for something 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.390
 part of us with this love I know 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.550
 that you are going to like it says that you 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.560
 will like and much 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.220
 So nothing 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.660
 in the next video something rather is more 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.730
 only in sanitation and already super break 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.410
 so we're good now we're here 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.139
 start something good because here we have the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.500
 mode is here has inside for the 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.139
 server I go for server and for the 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.880
 normal customer so it's very simple 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.880
 product we put to each app data 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.420
 a pp-a is where we have here and what 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.150
 we put here to minecraft abÃ­n main 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.920
 we create right click to open with windows 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.150
 selling file to have is what 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.510
 first thing we have to do is that 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.150
 folder metamos the deleted yes 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.010
 completely removed after we arrived 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.660
 you are going to take this in a download 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:54.410
 in double click they double click here 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.890
 come down here and this one that says ssp version 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.410
 1.2 point 5 is so they have to use 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:03.790
 Double - click these files 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.790
 they select the rearmament 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.749
 we accept 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.089
 we pass them here and we accept and 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:13.059
 is completely installed, remember 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:16.129
 if they are going to play with this world in that 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.899
 then come and have to have the mod 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.149
 for the server and for the delicacy 

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:22.360
 you also have to have both in the 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:22.360
 mod 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.789
 and nothing is all that, so I hope that you 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.300
 have liked to see you in the next 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.689
 video 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.689
 then
