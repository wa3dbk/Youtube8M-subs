kind<00:05:30.889> of<00:05:31.010> steep<00:05:31.280> just<00:05:31.610> after<00:05:31.940> this<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.270> also

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
kind of steep just after this and also

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.690 
kind of steep just after this and also
there's<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:32.900> risk<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.290> people<00:05:34.280> coming<00:05:34.580> in
