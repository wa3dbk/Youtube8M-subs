now we've cut already over 317 corrected
the<00:00:20.410> bowel<00:00:20.949> mouthing<00:00:21.580> in<00:00:21.730> the<00:00:21.939> guide<00:00:22.150> and<00:00:22.509> now

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
the bowel mouthing in the guide and now

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.140 
the bowel mouthing in the guide and now
we<00:00:22.990> have<00:00:23.169> to<00:00:23.439> bring<00:00:23.619> it<00:00:23.769> back<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.220> 312<00:00:24.820> with

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
we have to bring it back to 312 with

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.329 
we have to bring it back to 312 with
this<00:00:25.390> knurling<00:00:25.929> Arbor<00:00:26.380> if<00:00:26.769> you<00:00:26.890> notice<00:00:27.189> the

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
this knurling Arbor if you notice the

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.210 
this knurling Arbor if you notice the
knurling<00:00:27.699> Arbor<00:00:28.210> here<00:00:28.599> has<00:00:29.019> some<00:00:29.529> hide<00:00:29.859> and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
knurling Arbor here has some hide and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.670 
knurling Arbor here has some hide and
low<00:00:30.490> areas<00:00:31.060> basically<00:00:31.779> what's<00:00:31.989> happening<00:00:32.079> is

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
low areas basically what's happening is

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.280 
low areas basically what's happening is
we're<00:00:32.980> cutting<00:00:33.460> with<00:00:33.670> interference<00:00:34.600> to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
we're cutting with interference to

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.400 
we're cutting with interference to
distort<00:00:36.130> the<00:00:36.340> material<00:00:36.820> so<00:00:37.000> it<00:00:37.149> creates<00:00:37.570> less

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
distort the material so it creates less

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.090 
distort the material so it creates less
surface<00:00:38.800> area<00:00:39.219> inside<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.090> valve<00:00:40.539> guide<00:00:41.100> so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
surface area inside the valve guide so

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.830 
surface area inside the valve guide so
when<00:00:42.340> you<00:00:42.430> put<00:00:42.640> this<00:00:42.820> in<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.329> should<00:00:43.570> sit

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
when you put this in it should sit

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.930 
when you put this in it should sit
directly<00:00:44.109> in<00:00:44.469> there<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.039> it<00:00:45.250> should<00:00:45.489> not<00:00:45.670> go

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
directly in there and it should not go

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.939 
directly in there and it should not go
through<00:00:46.239> any<00:00:46.449> further<00:00:46.809> there's<00:00:47.079> a<00:00:47.230> pilot<00:00:47.829> on

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
through any further there's a pilot on

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.139 
through any further there's a pilot on
the<00:00:48.100> end<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.670> sits<00:00:49.000> into<00:00:49.210> the<00:00:49.449> 317<00:00:50.289> hole<00:00:51.149> then

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
the end that sits into the 317 hole then

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.779 
the end that sits into the 317 hole then
what<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.329> want<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.629> introduce<00:00:52.780> is<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:53.800> two<00:00:54.640> and

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
what I want to introduce is the two and

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.720 
what I want to introduce is the two and
a<00:00:54.820> half<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.239> one<00:00:55.589> reduction<00:00:56.589> motor<00:00:57.370> or

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
a half to one reduction motor or

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.810 
a half to one reduction motor or
apparatus<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.929> allows<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.559> drill<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.609> run

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
apparatus that allows the drill to run

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.479 
apparatus that allows the drill to run
at<00:01:01.089> maximum<00:01:01.719> torque<00:01:02.019> and<00:01:02.320> speed<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:03.010> then

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
at maximum torque and speed and then

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.189 
at maximum torque and speed and then
reduce<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:03.969> amount<00:01:04.420> here<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:04.930> we<00:01:05.019> can

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
reduce the amount here so we can

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.470 
reduce the amount here so we can
actually<00:01:05.379> cut<00:01:05.980> through<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.820> material<00:01:07.300> that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
actually cut through the material that

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.390 
actually cut through the material that
we've<00:01:07.630> started<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:08.170> correct<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.890> head

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.280 

prior<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.729> starting<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.689> cutting<00:01:14.110> process

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
prior to starting the cutting process

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.440 
prior to starting the cutting process
it's<00:01:14.950> important<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.490> make<00:01:15.670> sure<00:01:15.700> we<00:01:16.000> use<00:01:16.210> the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
it's important to make sure we use the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.960 
it's important to make sure we use the
appropriate<00:01:16.540> amount<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.560> cutting<00:01:18.009> oil<00:01:18.460> so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
appropriate amount of cutting oil so

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.389 
appropriate amount of cutting oil so
it's<00:01:19.150> easier<00:01:19.540> on<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.900> tool<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.470> easier<00:01:21.189> on

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
it's easier on the tool and easier on

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.030 
it's easier on the tool and easier on
the<00:01:21.880> head<00:01:22.119> when<00:01:22.479> we're<00:01:22.720> cutting<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.649> guide

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the head when we're cutting the guide

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.440 
the head when we're cutting the guide
taking<00:01:27.040> a<00:01:27.100> look<00:01:27.220> at<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.430> end<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.729> this<00:01:27.880> reamer

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
taking a look at the end of this reamer

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.350 
taking a look at the end of this reamer
here<00:01:28.930> or<00:01:29.110> actually<00:01:29.530> knurling<00:01:30.009> bit<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.579> has<00:01:31.329> a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
here or actually knurling bit it has a

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.810 
here or actually knurling bit it has a
dr<00:01:31.720> dog<00:01:32.049> on<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.380> end<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.770> meets<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.250> dr<00:01:33.520> dog

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
dr dog on the end that meets the dr dog

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.719 
dr dog on the end that meets the dr dog
on<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.329> end<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:35.020> reduction<00:01:35.290> motor<00:01:35.770> so

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
on the end of the reduction motor so

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.789 
on the end of the reduction motor so
once<00:01:36.969> we<00:01:37.149> start<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.600> process<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.530> process

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
once we start the process that process

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.039 
once we start the process that process
has<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.369> be<00:01:39.490> continued<00:01:40.180> all<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.450> way<00:01:40.600> through

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
has to be continued all the way through

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.620 
has to be continued all the way through
until<00:01:41.259> we've<00:01:41.740> knurled<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.520> guide<00:01:42.790> completely

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
until we've knurled the guide completely

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.139 
until we've knurled the guide completely
and<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.320> tool<00:01:44.740> comes<00:01:45.100> out<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.460> other<00:01:45.490> side<00:01:45.729> of

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
and the tool comes out the other side of

00:01:46.149 --> 00:02:11.280 
and the tool comes out the other side of
the<00:01:46.479> head

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.259 

now<00:02:12.290> once<00:02:12.920> you've<00:02:13.129> gone<00:02:13.310> all<00:02:13.579> the<00:02:13.700> way<00:02:13.730> through

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
now once you've gone all the way through

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.000 
now once you've gone all the way through
as<00:02:14.599> you<00:02:14.780> seen<00:02:15.019> with<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> drill<00:02:15.530> motor<00:02:15.769> it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
as you seen with the drill motor it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.459 
as you seen with the drill motor it
drops<00:02:16.310> off<00:02:16.549> fairly<00:02:16.909> quickly<00:02:17.299> what<00:02:18.109> we<00:02:18.200> want<00:02:18.379> to

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
drops off fairly quickly what we want to

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.190 
drops off fairly quickly what we want to
do<00:02:18.590> now<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:18.799> lift<00:02:19.340> up<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:20.209> head<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.719> remove

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
do now is lift up the head and remove

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.080 
do now is lift up the head and remove
the<00:02:21.379> knurling<00:02:21.709> tool<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.189> as<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.849> can<00:02:23.060> see

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the knurling tool and as you can see

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.000 
the knurling tool and as you can see
there's<00:02:23.569> been<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> lot<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.049> material<00:02:24.590> removed

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
there's been a lot of material removed

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.899 
there's been a lot of material removed
again<00:02:26.590> okay<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.739> next<00:02:27.889> process<00:02:28.189> once<00:02:28.700> we've

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
again okay the next process once we've

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.309 
again okay the next process once we've
gone<00:02:29.120> ahead<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.389> we've<00:02:29.599> done<00:02:29.750> our<00:02:29.810> knurling

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
gone ahead and we've done our knurling

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.520 
gone ahead and we've done our knurling
is<00:02:30.469> to<00:02:30.980> go<00:02:31.099> back<00:02:31.310> inside<00:02:31.609> with<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.629> hardcore

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
is to go back inside with a hardcore

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.319 
is to go back inside with a hardcore
brush<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:34.969> remove<00:02:35.420> any<00:02:35.989> debris

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
brush so that we can remove any debris

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.479 
brush so that we can remove any debris
that<00:02:38.329> we've<00:02:38.540> created<00:02:38.780> from<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:39.680> machining

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
that we've created from the machining

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.490 
that we've created from the machining
process<00:02:42.519> give<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:43.639> a<00:02:43.700> little<00:02:43.819> twist<00:02:44.349> clean<00:02:45.349> it

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
process give it a little twist clean it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.369 
process give it a little twist clean it
out<00:02:45.819> now<00:02:46.819> will<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> shop<00:02:47.480> air<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.930> remove<00:02:48.230> any

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
out now will you shop air to remove any

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.740 
out now will you shop air to remove any
of<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.650> other<00:02:48.769> debris<00:02:49.159> and<00:02:49.579> then<00:02:50.480> what<00:02:50.629> we

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
of the other debris and then what we

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.690 
of the other debris and then what we
need<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.079> do<00:02:51.230> from<00:02:51.470> there<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:51.799> check<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
need to do from there is check the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.500 
need to do from there is check the
actual<00:02:53.209> fit<00:02:53.599> of<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.230> valve<00:02:57.939> the<00:02:58.939> valve<00:02:58.969> does

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
actual fit of the valve the valve does

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.199 
actual fit of the valve the valve does
not<00:02:59.719> fit<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.469> reason<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.519> valve<00:03:01.700> does<00:03:02.030> not

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
not fit the reason the valve does not

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.959 
not fit the reason the valve does not
fit<00:03:02.599> is<00:03:02.780> because<00:03:03.290> we've<00:03:03.760> oversized<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
fit is because we've oversized the

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.259 
fit is because we've oversized the
dimension<00:03:05.510> originally<00:03:06.340> we've<00:03:07.340> corrected<00:03:07.939> it

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
dimension originally we've corrected it

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.300 
dimension originally we've corrected it
by<00:03:08.419> distorting<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.349> surface<00:03:09.829> area<00:03:10.099> creating

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
by distorting the surface area creating

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.250 
by distorting the surface area creating
an<00:03:10.549> interference<00:03:11.060> cut<00:03:11.450> with<00:03:11.659> the<00:03:11.689> knurling

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
an interference cut with the knurling

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.309 
an interference cut with the knurling
tool<00:03:12.560> creating<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.549> smaller<00:03:14.120> hole<00:03:14.659> than<00:03:15.199> we

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
tool creating a smaller hole than we

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.439 
tool creating a smaller hole than we
originally<00:03:15.470> started<00:03:15.919> with<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.669> that's<00:03:17.120> why

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:17.449 
originally started with and that's why

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.599 
originally started with and that's why
the<00:03:17.510> valve<00:03:17.900> does<00:03:18.199> not<00:03:18.379> fit<00:03:18.739> directly<00:03:18.949> into<00:03:19.579> it

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
the valve does not fit directly into it

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.360 
the valve does not fit directly into it
so<00:03:20.389> what<00:03:20.599> we<00:03:20.720> need<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.930> do<00:03:21.199> now<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:22.040> need<00:03:22.159> to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
so what we need to do now is we need to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.689 
so what we need to do now is we need to
select<00:03:22.699> the<00:03:23.470> manufacturer's<00:03:24.470> minimum<00:03:25.459> or

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
select the manufacturer's minimum or

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.589 
select the manufacturer's minimum or
maximum<00:03:25.930> requirement<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:28.120> clearance<00:03:29.120> for<00:03:29.569> the

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
maximum requirement of clearance for the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.500 
maximum requirement of clearance for the
valve<00:03:29.959> at<00:03:31.269> 312<00:03:32.949> so<00:03:33.949> we<00:03:34.069> install<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.430> 312<00:03:35.120> reamer

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
valve at 312 so we install a 312 reamer

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.089 
valve at 312 so we install a 312 reamer
and<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.079> shouldn't<00:03:36.319> go<00:03:36.560> through<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.859> whole

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
and it shouldn't go through the whole

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.240 
and it shouldn't go through the whole
either<00:03:37.459> it's<00:03:38.389> piloted<00:03:39.169> and<00:03:39.290> tapered<00:03:39.829> so<00:03:40.069> that

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
either it's piloted and tapered so that

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.670 
either it's piloted and tapered so that
it<00:03:40.340> fits<00:03:40.609> into<00:03:40.939> the<00:03:41.120> hole<00:03:41.389> up<00:03:41.689> to<00:03:41.870> these<00:03:42.049> relief

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
it fits into the hole up to these relief

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.580 
it fits into the hole up to these relief
areas<00:03:43.189> to<00:03:44.180> guide<00:03:44.389> it<00:03:44.599> use<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.500> appropriate

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
areas to guide it use the appropriate

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.050 
areas to guide it use the appropriate
lubrication<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:46.819> lots<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.419> it<00:03:47.599> and<00:03:48.759> then<00:03:49.759> once

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
lubrication and lots of it and then once

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.720 
lubrication and lots of it and then once
again<00:03:50.479> using<00:03:51.169> a<00:03:51.319> hand<00:03:51.769> arbor

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.670 

to<00:03:58.349> cut<00:03:59.349> any<00:03:59.790> high<00:04:00.790> points<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:02.349> can<00:04:02.470> see

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
to cut any high points and you can see

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.110 
to cut any high points and you can see
it<00:04:02.799> goes<00:04:02.980> through<00:04:03.340> with<00:04:03.549> a<00:04:03.580> lot<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.030> ease

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.740 

and<00:04:09.450> we're<00:04:10.019> through<00:04:10.879> so<00:04:11.879> again<00:04:12.180> cutting<00:04:12.540> in

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
and we're through so again cutting in

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.839 
and we're through so again cutting in
the<00:04:12.780> same<00:04:13.049> direction<00:04:13.400> continuing<00:04:14.400> right<00:04:14.640> out

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
the same direction continuing right out

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.099 
the same direction continuing right out
and<00:04:15.060> removing<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.900> from<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.199> head<00:04:16.590> once<00:04:16.979> again

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
and removing it from the head once again

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.960 
and removing it from the head once again
now<00:04:19.109> next<00:04:19.530> procedure<00:04:19.979> would<00:04:20.220> be<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.430> go<00:04:20.729> back

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
now next procedure would be to go back

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:29.000 
now next procedure would be to go back
in<00:04:21.269> andrey<00:04:22.079> clean<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.560> whole<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:28.500> remove<00:04:28.800> any

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
in andrey clean the whole to remove any

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.290 
in andrey clean the whole to remove any
debris<00:04:30.710> ok<00:04:31.710> after<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.130> process<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.790> complete

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
debris ok after the process is complete

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.750 
debris ok after the process is complete
and<00:04:33.630> it's<00:04:34.080> been<00:04:34.260> cleaned<00:04:34.590> out<00:04:34.889> we<00:04:35.460> should<00:04:35.490> be

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
and it's been cleaned out we should be

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.000 
and it's been cleaned out we should be
able<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:36.000> take<00:04:36.180> our<00:04:36.360> valve<00:04:36.630> put<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.590> in<00:04:37.740> and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
able to take our valve put it in and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.510 
able to take our valve put it in and
drop<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.790> directly<00:04:39.330> back<00:04:39.810> into<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:40.740> new<00:04:40.979> surface

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
drop it directly back into a new surface

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.000 
drop it directly back into a new surface
area<00:04:42.000> between<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.720> valve<00:04:43.139> stem<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.949> the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
area between the valve stem and the

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.670 
area between the valve stem and the
guide<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.630> next<00:04:45.930> thing<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.199> do<00:04:46.320> would<00:04:46.470> be<00:04:46.530> to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
guide the next thing to do would be to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.560 
guide the next thing to do would be to
slightly<00:04:47.130> take<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.669> off<00:04:47.789> of<00:04:48.000> its<00:04:48.120> seat<00:04:48.360> and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
slightly take it off of its seat and

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.750 
slightly take it off of its seat and
feel<00:04:48.840> how<00:04:49.020> much<00:04:49.169> clearance<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.830> there<00:04:50.010> very

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
feel how much clearance is there very

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.719 
feel how much clearance is there very
very<00:04:51.270> minimal<00:04:51.630> clearance<00:04:52.729> manufacturers

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
very minimal clearance manufacturers

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.820 
very minimal clearance manufacturers
specification<00:04:54.289> indicates<00:04:55.289> we<00:04:55.470> should<00:04:55.680> have

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
specification indicates we should have

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.100 
specification indicates we should have
one<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.310> three<00:04:56.610> thousand<00:04:57.270> maximum<00:04:57.750> clearance

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
one to three thousand maximum clearance

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.730 
one to three thousand maximum clearance
and<00:04:58.470> we'll<00:04:59.340> go<00:04:59.460> through<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.820> procedure<00:05:00.240> of

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
and we'll go through the procedure of
