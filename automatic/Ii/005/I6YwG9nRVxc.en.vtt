in<00:00:00.179> the<00:00:00.299> previous<00:00:00.630> videos<00:00:00.870> we<00:00:00.900> discuss<00:00:01.290> about

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
in the previous videos we discuss about

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.169 
in the previous videos we discuss about
introduction<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.310> in<00:00:02.429> equations<00:00:02.879> then<00:00:03.149> we

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
introduction to the in equations then we

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.030 
introduction to the in equations then we
learned<00:00:03.510> about<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.929> solution<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.410> animation

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
learned about the solution of animation

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.289 
learned about the solution of animation
and<00:00:05.160> now<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.490> video<00:00:05.640> lesson<00:00:05.879> we're<00:00:06.150> going

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
and now in this video lesson we're going

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.020 
and now in this video lesson we're going
to<00:00:06.359> learn<00:00:06.509> three<00:00:07.170> very<00:00:07.589> very<00:00:07.680> important<00:00:08.400> rules

to learn three very very important rules

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.490 
to learn three very very important rules
of<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.420> equation<00:00:09.750> R<00:00:09.870> there<00:00:10.139> are<00:00:10.230> three

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
of the in equation R there are three

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.049 
of the in equation R there are three
rules<00:00:10.740> alright<00:00:11.219> three<00:00:12.090> rules<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:13.080> equation

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
rules alright three rules of in equation

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.330 
rules alright three rules of in equation
you<00:00:15.059> must<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.750> learn<00:00:15.900> if<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.039> want<00:00:17.250> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
you must have to learn if you want to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
you must have to learn if you want to
solve<00:00:17.520> any<00:00:17.730> questions<00:00:18.119> related<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.900> in

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
solve any questions related to the in

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.450 
solve any questions related to the in
equations<00:00:19.470> alright<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> first<00:00:20.039> rule<00:00:20.340> I'm

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
equations alright the first rule I'm

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.000 
equations alright the first rule I'm
gonna<00:00:20.670> write<00:00:20.880> here<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:22.020> rule<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
gonna write here the first rule is the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.529 
gonna write here the first rule is the
same<00:00:23.039> number<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:23.939> same<00:00:25.070> number<00:00:27.529> can<00:00:28.529> be

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
same number you know same number can be

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.040 
same number you know same number can be
added<00:00:30.539> or<00:00:31.550> subtracted<00:00:34.070> from<00:00:35.660> both<00:00:36.660> side<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
added or subtracted from both side of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.540 
added or subtracted from both side of
the<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.380> equation<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:37.890> both<00:00:38.420> side<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.550> in

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the in equation from both side of the in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.840 
the in equation from both side of the in
equation<00:00:42.559> in<00:00:43.559> equation

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
equation in equation

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.209 
equation in equation
it<00:00:45.360> means<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.960> if<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.530> any<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.860> equation

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it means like if I have any in equation

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.569 
it means like if I have any in equation
let's<00:00:47.579> say<00:00:47.730> X<00:00:47.940> square<00:00:48.300> minus<00:00:48.539> 3x<00:00:49.320> plus<00:00:49.440> 5<00:00:50.280> is

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
let's say X square minus 3x plus 5 is

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
let's say X square minus 3x plus 5 is
greater<00:00:50.760> than<00:00:51.059> or<00:00:51.180> equal<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> 0<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.620> in

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
greater than or equal to 0 so in this in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
greater than or equal to 0 so in this in
equation<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.940> add<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.660> well<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.140> can

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
equation I can add as well as I can

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
equation I can add as well as I can
subtract<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> same<00:00:56.190> number<00:00:56.250> boats<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.879> suppose

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
subtract the same number boats I suppose

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.630 
subtract the same number boats I suppose
if<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:57.570> gonna<00:00:57.780> add<00:00:58.020> alright<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:00:59.430> gonna

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
if I'm gonna add alright if I'm gonna

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.819 
if I'm gonna add alright if I'm gonna
add<00:00:59.789> five<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.570> both<00:01:00.600> side<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.469> happen

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
add five to both side what will happen

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.600 
add five to both side what will happen
then<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.460> will<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.730> X<00:01:02.940> square<00:01:03.359> minus<00:01:03.930> 3x<00:01:04.559> plus<00:01:05.189> 5

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
then it will be X square minus 3x plus 5

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.030 
then it will be X square minus 3x plus 5
alright<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> I'm<00:01:06.420> gonna<00:01:06.630> add<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.740> I'm

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
alright and I'm gonna add it so I'm

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920 
alright and I'm gonna add it so I'm
gonna<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.640> plus<00:01:08.880> 5<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.450> less<00:01:09.869> than

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
gonna right here plus 5 is less than

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.160 
gonna right here plus 5 is less than
equals<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.350> again<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.610> five<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.270> added

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
equals to again here also five I added

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.600 
equals to again here also five I added
in<00:01:13.409> both<00:01:13.680> side<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.280> ya

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
in both side now see ya

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
in both side now see ya
here<00:01:14.970> also<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.240> added<00:01:15.479> five<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.140> also<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
here also I added five and here also I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
here also I added five and here also I
added<00:01:16.560> five<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.240> do

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
added five so this thing we can do

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.880 
added five so this thing we can do
instead<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.020> writing<00:01:19.140> five<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.740> write

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
instead of writing five you can write

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.410 
instead of writing five you can write
here<00:01:20.009> 10<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.759> write<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.090> 10<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
here 10 you can write here 10 if you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.539 
here 10 you can write here 10 if you
want<00:01:21.509> hundred<00:01:22.170> hundred<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:22.950> write<00:01:23.220> minus

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
want hundred hundred you can write minus

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.420 
want hundred hundred you can write minus
5<00:01:23.820> minus<00:01:24.270> 5<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.409> already<00:01:25.680> told<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.979> we

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
5 minus 5 because I already told you we

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.200 
5 minus 5 because I already told you we
can<00:01:26.640> add<00:01:26.850> or<00:01:27.770> we<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.920> subtract<00:01:29.310> alright<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.970> if

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
can add or we can subtract alright so if

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.020 
can add or we can subtract alright so if
you<00:01:30.299> want<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> subtract<00:01:31.079> alright<00:01:31.729> if<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.909> want

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you want to subtract alright if you want

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.249 
you want to subtract alright if you want
to<00:01:33.119> subtract<00:01:33.450> let's<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.049> want<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to subtract let's say if you want to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.010 
to subtract let's say if you want to
subtract<00:01:34.590> 5<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.329> will<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.630> X<00:01:36.840> square

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
subtract 5 then it will be X square

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.020 
subtract 5 then it will be X square
minus<00:01:37.650> 3x<00:01:38.310> plus<00:01:38.579> 5<00:01:40.549> now<00:01:43.100> now<00:01:44.100> minus<00:01:44.579> 5<00:01:45.000> here

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
minus 3x plus 5 now now minus 5 here

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.380 
minus 3x plus 5 now now minus 5 here
also<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.399> minus<00:01:47.399> 5<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:47.640> also

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
also and minus 5 here also

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.490 
also and minus 5 here also
alright<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:49.820> X<00:01:50.820> square

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
alright so it's going to be now X square

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.590 
alright so it's going to be now X square
minus<00:01:52.820> 3x<00:01:53.820> plus<00:01:54.170> 5<00:01:55.200> alright<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.850> 5<00:01:57.119> +<00:01:57.299> 5<00:01:57.420> is

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
minus 3x plus 5 alright this 5 + 5 is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.660 
minus 3x plus 5 alright this 5 + 5 is
cancelled<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.100> gonna<00:01:59.280> write<00:01:59.490> these

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
cancelled so I'm not gonna write these

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.520 
cancelled so I'm not gonna write these
things<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.750> greater<00:02:01.049> than<00:02:01.110> or<00:02:01.290> equals

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
things right it's greater than or equals

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.429 
things right it's greater than or equals
to<00:02:01.560> minus<00:02:01.770> 5<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.060> added<00:02:03.869> also<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.380> I

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
to minus 5 so I added also and I

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.080 
to minus 5 so I added also and I
subtracted<00:02:04.920> also<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> same<00:02:05.520> normal<00:02:05.880> from

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
subtracted also the same normal from

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059 
subtracted also the same normal from
both<00:02:06.270> side<00:02:06.509> alright<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
both side alright so we can do this and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.030 
both side alright so we can do this and
the<00:02:08.819> second<00:02:09.270> rule<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.950> we<00:02:10.950> can

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
the second rule is we can

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.470 
the second rule is we can
multiplied<00:02:14.040> or<00:02:16.340> divided<00:02:18.140> by<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.200> same<00:02:19.710> number

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
multiplied or divided by the same number

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.980 
multiplied or divided by the same number
same<00:02:21.480> number<00:02:22.050> both<00:02:22.650> side<00:02:23.390> without<00:02:24.390> changing

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
same number both side without changing

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.630 
same number both side without changing
the<00:02:25.140> inequality<00:02:25.800> sign<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.160> sign<00:02:26.310> will<00:02:26.490> not

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
the inequality sign the sign will not

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.370 
the inequality sign the sign will not
get<00:02:26.850> changed<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.540> sign<00:02:27.750> will<00:02:27.930> never<00:02:28.200> get

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
get changed like the sign will never get

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.730 
get changed like the sign will never get
change

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
change

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.070 
change
I<00:02:28.770> give<00:02:29.190> up<00:02:29.370> an<00:02:29.580> equation<00:02:29.850> let's<00:02:30.120> say<00:02:30.240> X<00:02:30.720> minus

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
I give up an equation let's say X minus

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.400 
I give up an equation let's say X minus
3<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:32.010> greater<00:02:32.580> than<00:02:32.640> equals<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.180> 0<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.200> can

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
3 is greater than equals to 0 then I can

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.760 
3 is greater than equals to 0 then I can
I<00:02:34.709> can<00:02:35.459> multiply<00:02:35.910> both<00:02:36.150> side<00:02:36.450> or<00:02:36.750> divide<00:02:37.290> by

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
I can multiply both side or divide by

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.949 
I can multiply both side or divide by
certain<00:02:38.160> number<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.850> can<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.540> multiply

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
certain number like I can I can multiply

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.680 
certain number like I can I can multiply
this<00:02:40.020> whole<00:02:40.170> thing<00:02:40.470> by<00:02:40.800> 3<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:41.790> also<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
this whole thing by 3 here also and I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.420 
this whole thing by 3 here also and I
can<00:02:42.870> multiply<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.290> whole<00:02:43.440> thing<00:02:43.650> by<00:02:43.890> 3<00:02:44.280> here

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
can multiply this whole thing by 3 here

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.670 
can multiply this whole thing by 3 here
also<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.180> be<00:02:45.360> 3x<00:02:45.630> minus<00:02:46.260> 9<00:02:46.290> is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
also so it's going to be 3x minus 9 is

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.070 
also so it's going to be 3x minus 9 is
greater<00:02:46.800> than<00:02:47.070> or<00:02:47.190> equal<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.550> 3<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.030> still<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
greater than or equal to 3 and still the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.080 
greater than or equal to 3 and still the
sign<00:02:49.350> will<00:02:49.620> not<00:02:49.860> change<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.580> sign<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.910> same

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
sign will not change the sign is same

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.910 
sign will not change the sign is same
greater<00:02:51.870> than<00:02:52.020> or<00:02:52.110> equal<00:02:52.320> Stone<00:02:52.530> all<00:02:52.770> right

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
greater than or equal Stone all right

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.729 
greater than or equal Stone all right
similarly<00:02:53.550> if<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.360> x<00:02:55.110> squared<00:02:55.500> plus

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
similarly if I have like x squared plus

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.440 
similarly if I have like x squared plus
2x<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:57.290> greater<00:02:58.290> than<00:02:58.620> 3<00:02:59.310> suppose<00:02:59.670> then<00:03:00.239> that

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
2x is greater than 3 suppose then that

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.540 
2x is greater than 3 suppose then that
time<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.050> want<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.380> multiply<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.770> both

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
time if I want to multiply this both

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.220 
time if I want to multiply this both
side<00:03:02.790> then<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.270> both<00:03:03.690> side<00:03:03.870> by<00:03:03.900> sorry

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
side then I can both side by sorry

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.260 
side then I can both side by sorry
number<00:03:04.530> let's<00:03:04.680> say<00:03:04.739> let's<00:03:05.310> say<00:03:05.430> 10<00:03:05.670> all<00:03:06.120> right

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
number let's say let's say 10 all right

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.940 
number let's say let's say 10 all right
so<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.840> only<00:03:06.959> by<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.290> side<00:03:07.470> also<00:03:07.650> by

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
so I have to only by this side also by

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.910 
so I have to only by this side also by
10<00:03:08.580> so<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.120> going<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.390> be<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:09.600> 10<00:03:10.080> X<00:03:10.350> square

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
10 so it's going to be now 10 X square

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.590 
10 so it's going to be now 10 X square
plus<00:03:11.239> 20x<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.690> greater<00:03:13.020> than<00:03:13.670> 10<00:03:14.670> into<00:03:15.000> 3<00:03:15.030> right

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
plus 20x is greater than 10 into 3 right

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.259 
plus 20x is greater than 10 into 3 right
that<00:03:15.750> will<00:03:15.900> be<00:03:16.049> 30<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.519> can<00:03:17.760> multiply<00:03:17.880> as

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
that will be 30 so so I can multiply as

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.150 
that will be 30 so so I can multiply as
well<00:03:18.390> as<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.570> can<00:03:18.720> divide<00:03:19.200> for<00:03:19.590> dividing<00:03:20.010> let's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
well as I can divide for dividing let's

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.380 
well as I can divide for dividing let's
say<00:03:20.280> if<00:03:20.850> I'm<00:03:21.060> X<00:03:21.989> square<00:03:22.380> plus<00:03:22.430> 3<00:03:23.430> X<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.880> greater

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
say if I'm X square plus 3 X is greater

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.920 
say if I'm X square plus 3 X is greater
than<00:03:24.600> or<00:03:24.930> equals<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:26.120> 99<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:27.810> an

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
than or equals to 99 this is just an

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.810 
than or equals to 99 this is just an
example<00:03:28.049> right<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:29.070> time<00:03:29.280> if<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.519> want<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
example right that time if I want to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.910 
example right that time if I want to
divide<00:03:30.060> both<00:03:30.299> side<00:03:30.600> then<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.830> easily

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
divide both side then I can easily

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.410 
divide both side then I can easily
divide<00:03:32.340> let's<00:03:32.670> say<00:03:32.790> here<00:03:33.000> oh<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.180> I'm<00:03:33.269> dividing

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
divide let's say here oh so I'm dividing

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.090 
divide let's say here oh so I'm dividing
by<00:03:33.660> 99<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.260> here<00:03:34.380> also<00:03:34.620> I'm<00:03:34.680> dividing<00:03:34.980> about

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
by 99 and here also I'm dividing about

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.470 
by 99 and here also I'm dividing about
99<00:03:35.580> so<00:03:35.820> my<00:03:36.360> result<00:03:36.570> n<00:03:36.840> will<00:03:36.989> be<00:03:37.140> X<00:03:37.590> square<00:03:37.920> plus

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
99 so my result n will be X square plus

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.960 
99 so my result n will be X square plus
3<00:03:39.480> X<00:03:39.690> divided<00:03:40.260> by<00:03:40.290> 99<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:41.190> greater<00:03:41.519> than<00:03:41.760> or

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
3 X divided by 99 is greater than or

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.420 
3 X divided by 99 is greater than or
equal<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.450> 1<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:43.350> can<00:03:43.470> divide<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:44.100> well<00:03:44.250> as<00:03:44.340> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
equal to 1 so I can divide as well as I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.460 
equal to 1 so I can divide as well as I
can<00:03:44.610> multiply<00:03:45.120> by<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.510> same<00:03:45.750> more<00:03:45.989> both<00:03:46.230> side

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
can multiply by the same more both side

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.140 
can multiply by the same more both side
and<00:03:46.650> here<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.579> one<00:03:47.760> thing<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:47.940> need<00:03:48.090> to

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
and here is the one thing you need to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.280 
and here is the one thing you need to
check<00:03:48.450> here<00:03:48.900> very<00:03:49.290> very<00:03:49.440> importantly<00:03:51.230> if<00:03:52.230> we

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
check here very very importantly if we

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.500 
check here very very importantly if we
multiply<00:03:52.950> if<00:03:53.250> we<00:03:53.790> multiply<00:03:54.269> by<00:03:54.450> negative

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
multiply if we multiply by negative

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.610 
multiply if we multiply by negative
number<00:03:55.170> all<00:03:55.350> right<00:03:55.380> if<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:55.769> multiply<00:03:56.430> or

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
number all right if we multiply or

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:07.340 
number all right if we multiply or
divide<00:04:00.950> by<00:04:02.420> negative<00:04:03.420> number<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.760> symbol<00:04:06.350> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
divide by negative number the symbol the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.860 
divide by negative number the symbol the
symbol<00:04:07.500> or<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.829> can<00:04:07.980> see<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.220> sign<00:04:08.870> get

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
symbol or you can see the sign get

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.240 
symbol or you can see the sign get
reversed<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:11.329> reversed<00:04:12.980> reversed<00:04:13.980> means

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
reversed get reversed reversed means

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.969 
reversed get reversed reversed means
this<00:04:14.670> sign<00:04:14.940> will<00:04:15.450> be<00:04:15.600> just<00:04:15.780> opposite<00:04:16.200> here<00:04:16.500> all

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
this sign will be just opposite here all

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.949 
this sign will be just opposite here all
right<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.310> let's<00:04:18.030> take<00:04:18.180> example<00:04:18.660> let's<00:04:18.810> say<00:04:18.900> I

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
right so let's take example let's say I

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.320 
right so let's take example let's say I
have<00:04:19.169> X<00:04:19.620> square<00:04:20.220> plus<00:04:20.479> 2x<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.860> greater<00:04:22.860> than

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
have X square plus 2x is greater than

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.180 
have X square plus 2x is greater than
let's<00:04:24.330> see<00:04:24.539> 9<00:04:25.229> okay<00:04:25.680> so<00:04:25.770> this<00:04:26.039> is<00:04:26.160> my

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
let's see 9 okay so this is my

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.950 
let's see 9 okay so this is my
inequality<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:27.030> what<00:04:27.390> does<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:27.690> mean<00:04:27.930> that

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
inequality and what does this mean that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.320 
inequality and what does this mean that
if<00:04:28.470> I'm<00:04:28.800> gonna<00:04:29.010> multiply<00:04:29.160> both<00:04:29.430> side<00:04:30.060> or

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
if I'm gonna multiply both side or

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.540 
if I'm gonna multiply both side or
divide<00:04:30.930> by<00:04:31.349> some<00:04:31.620> negative<00:04:31.950> number<00:04:32.220> let's<00:04:32.400> say

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
divide by some negative number let's say

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.850 
divide by some negative number let's say
by<00:04:32.789> negative<00:04:33.300> 3<00:04:33.900> here<00:04:34.110> I'm<00:04:34.260> multiplying<00:04:34.380> and

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
by negative 3 here I'm multiplying and

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.100 
by negative 3 here I'm multiplying and
here<00:04:35.400> are<00:04:35.490> some<00:04:35.669> multiplying<00:04:36.419> by<00:04:36.570> negative<00:04:36.599> 3

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
here are some multiplying by negative 3

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.260 
here are some multiplying by negative 3
then<00:04:37.710> after<00:04:38.070> that<00:04:38.220> in<00:04:38.490> next<00:04:38.700> step<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.180> know

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
then after that in next step you know

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.440 
then after that in next step you know
what<00:04:39.450> happens<00:04:40.310> this<00:04:41.310> particular<00:04:41.910> sign<00:04:42.180> gets

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
what happens this particular sign gets

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.450 
what happens this particular sign gets
just<00:04:42.690> reversed<00:04:43.140> now<00:04:43.229> it<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.710> like<00:04:43.860> this<00:04:43.919> next

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
just reversed now it is like this next

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.040 
just reversed now it is like this next
time<00:04:44.669> it<00:04:44.789> will<00:04:44.880> be<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.210> mean<00:04:45.539> this<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.780> greater

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
time it will be I mean this is greater

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.210 
time it will be I mean this is greater
than<00:04:46.140> sign<00:04:46.349> now<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.590> will<00:04:46.650> be<00:04:46.770> smaller<00:04:47.039> than

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
than sign now it will be smaller than

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.730 
than sign now it will be smaller than
sign<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.729> mean<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.479> say<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.870> will<00:04:49.050> be<00:04:49.140> now<00:04:49.289> minus

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
sign I mean to say it will be now minus

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.820 
sign I mean to say it will be now minus
3<00:04:50.400> X<00:04:50.550> square<00:04:50.760> minus<00:04:51.510> 3<00:04:51.720> into<00:04:52.080> 2<00:04:52.320> X<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.650> will<00:04:52.770> be

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
3 X square minus 3 into 2 X it will be

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.430 
3 X square minus 3 into 2 X it will be
minus<00:04:53.130> 6<00:04:53.430> X<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.570> was<00:04:54.780> greater<00:04:55.080> than<00:04:55.260> and

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
minus 6 X and it was greater than and

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.650 
minus 6 X and it was greater than and
now<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.650> will<00:04:55.740> be<00:04:55.890> now<00:04:56.039> smaller<00:04:57.030> than<00:04:57.330> keep<00:04:57.539> in

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
now it will be now smaller than keep in

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.870 
now it will be now smaller than keep in
mind<00:04:57.870> this<00:04:58.560> will<00:04:58.770> be<00:04:58.919> now<00:04:59.039> smaller<00:04:59.370> than<00:04:59.610> and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
mind this will be now smaller than and

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.110 
mind this will be now smaller than and
now<00:05:00.450> 3<00:05:00.750> times<00:05:00.900> 9<00:05:01.200> that<00:05:01.410> is<00:05:01.530> 27<00:05:02.430> all<00:05:02.849> right<00:05:02.970> so

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
now 3 times 9 that is 27 all right so

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.570 
now 3 times 9 that is 27 all right so
this<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.300> what<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.840> seen<00:05:04.080> just<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:05.099> the<00:05:05.250> simple

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
this is what I seen just just the simple

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.670 
this is what I seen just just the simple
get<00:05:05.760> change<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.150> sign<00:05:06.570> get<00:05:06.780> reversed<00:05:07.050> let's

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
get change the sign get reversed let's

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.560 
get change the sign get reversed let's
say<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.830> have<00:05:08.039> another<00:05:08.160> in<00:05:08.490> equation<00:05:08.849> let's<00:05:09.000> see

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
say I have another in equation let's see

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.680 
say I have another in equation let's see
39<00:05:10.409> X<00:05:10.740> square<00:05:11.159> plus<00:05:12.020> 3<00:05:13.760> is<00:05:14.760> less<00:05:14.820> than<00:05:15.330> or<00:05:15.390> equal

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
39 X square plus 3 is less than or equal

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.529 
39 X square plus 3 is less than or equal
to<00:05:15.900> 12<00:05:16.470> X<00:05:17.070> all<00:05:17.580> right<00:05:17.640> this<00:05:17.849> is<00:05:17.940> my<00:05:18.060> in<00:05:18.150> equation

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
to 12 X all right this is my in equation

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.440 
to 12 X all right this is my in equation
and<00:05:18.720> if<00:05:19.200> I<00:05:19.320> want<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.590> divide<00:05:19.800> both<00:05:20.039> side<00:05:20.300> if<00:05:21.300> I

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
and if I want to divide both side if I

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.399 
and if I want to divide both side if I
want<00:05:21.630> to<00:05:21.690> divide<00:05:22.020> by<00:05:23.010> let's<00:05:23.310> say<00:05:23.460> minus<00:05:24.419> 3<00:05:24.960> all

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
want to divide by let's say minus 3 all

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.649 
want to divide by let's say minus 3 all
right<00:05:25.440> both<00:05:26.099> side<00:05:26.370> then<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.970> sign<00:05:27.210> will<00:05:27.479> get

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
right both side then the sign will get

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.649 
right both side then the sign will get
automatically<00:05:28.229> changed<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:28.979> will<00:05:29.099> be<00:05:29.220> now

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
automatically changed so it will be now

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.430 
automatically changed so it will be now
39<00:05:30.659> X<00:05:31.020> square<00:05:31.500> plus<00:05:32.280> 3<00:05:32.789> divided<00:05:33.720> by<00:05:33.840> minus<00:05:34.409> 3

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
39 X square plus 3 divided by minus 3

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.029 
39 X square plus 3 divided by minus 3
and<00:05:34.890> this<00:05:35.430> is<00:05:35.610> 12<00:05:35.970> X<00:05:36.210> divided<00:05:36.870> by<00:05:36.900> minus<00:05:37.380> 3<00:05:37.409> but

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
and this is 12 X divided by minus 3 but

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.940 
and this is 12 X divided by minus 3 but
the<00:05:38.280> symbol<00:05:38.729> is<00:05:38.970> now<00:05:39.180> here<00:05:39.680> this<00:05:40.680> thing<00:05:40.890> is

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
the symbol is now here this thing is

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.130 
the symbol is now here this thing is
less<00:05:41.700> than<00:05:41.849> or<00:05:41.970> equal<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.210> 12<00:05:42.510> and<00:05:42.690> now<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:43.020> will

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
less than or equal to 12 and now it will

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.870 
less than or equal to 12 and now it will
be<00:05:43.200> greater<00:05:44.099> than<00:05:44.340> or<00:05:44.550> equals<00:05:44.940> 2/3<00:05:45.780> x<00:05:45.990> over<00:05:46.470> -3

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
be greater than or equals 2/3 x over -3

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.219 
be greater than or equals 2/3 x over -3
when<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:47.909> multiply<00:05:48.300> by<00:05:48.450> my<00:05:48.599> negative<00:05:48.960> number

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
when I multiply by my negative number

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.740 
when I multiply by my negative number
the<00:05:49.590> sign<00:05:49.830> get<00:05:50.039> changed<00:05:50.430> alright<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:51.210> this<00:05:51.570> is

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
the sign get changed alright so this is

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.330 
the sign get changed alright so this is
what<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:51.990> need<00:05:52.140> to<00:05:52.229> learn<00:05:52.620> this<00:05:52.890> is<00:05:53.039> this<00:05:53.190> is

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
what you need to learn this is this is

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.710 
what you need to learn this is this is
the<00:05:53.430> rule<00:05:53.580> actually<00:05:53.940> what<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.090> was<00:05:54.270> talking<00:05:54.630> is

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
the rule actually what I was talking is

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.240 
the rule actually what I was talking is
the<00:05:54.840> second<00:05:55.140> rule<00:05:55.260> and<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.860> third<00:05:56.159> rule<00:05:56.430> is

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
the second rule and the third rule is

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.870 
the second rule and the third rule is
you<00:05:59.250> can<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.640> can<00:06:01.039> know<00:06:02.039> I'm<00:06:02.430> not<00:06:02.610> gonna<00:06:02.760> write

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
you can you can know I'm not gonna write

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.270 
you can you can know I'm not gonna write
again<00:06:03.120> actually<00:06:03.479> you<00:06:03.659> can<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:04.229> can<00:06:04.409> shift<00:06:04.979> any

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
again actually you can you can shift any

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.130 
again actually you can you can shift any
number<00:06:05.610> from<00:06:05.849> left<00:06:06.510> hand<00:06:06.539> side<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.810> right<00:06:06.990> hand

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.570 
number from left hand side to right hand
side<00:06:07.349> and<00:06:07.680> from<00:06:07.830> right<00:06:08.039> hand<00:06:08.220> side<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.550> the

left hand side without any change in the

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.040 
left hand side without any change in the
symbol<00:06:11.460> I'm<00:06:11.640> gonna<00:06:11.849> say<00:06:12.000> if<00:06:12.330> I<00:06:12.570> have<00:06:12.659> let's<00:06:12.840> say

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
symbol I'm gonna say if I have let's say

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.730 
symbol I'm gonna say if I have let's say
3<00:06:13.620> X<00:06:13.800> square<00:06:14.070> plus<00:06:14.659> 2x<00:06:15.659> minus<00:06:17.780> 1<00:06:18.780> is<00:06:19.380> greater

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
3 X square plus 2x minus 1 is greater

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.330 
3 X square plus 2x minus 1 is greater
than<00:06:19.950> or<00:06:20.280> equals<00:06:21.060> to<00:06:21.150> 0<00:06:22.020> then<00:06:22.650> that<00:06:22.800> time<00:06:23.039> any

term<00:06:23.729> you<00:06:23.760> know<00:06:23.970> anytime<00:06:24.750> I<00:06:25.020> can<00:06:25.080> I<00:06:25.440> can<00:06:25.770> shift

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
term you know anytime I can I can shift

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.649 
term you know anytime I can I can shift
into<00:06:26.250> the<00:06:26.460> left<00:06:26.729> from<00:06:27.060> left<00:06:27.240> hand<00:06:27.300> side<00:06:27.419> to<00:06:27.539> the

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
into the left from left hand side to the

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.600 
into the left from left hand side to the
right<00:06:27.750> hand<00:06:27.870> side<00:06:28.020> so<00:06:28.259> here<00:06:28.710> is<00:06:28.830> minus<00:06:29.190> 1<00:06:29.370> and

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
right hand side so here is minus 1 and

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.100 
right hand side so here is minus 1 and
if<00:06:29.910> I<00:06:30.000> want<00:06:30.210> to<00:06:30.300> take<00:06:30.479> into<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:30.780> right<00:06:30.930> hand

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
if I want to take into the right hand

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.080 
if I want to take into the right hand
side<00:06:31.290> then<00:06:31.800> I<00:06:31.919> can<00:06:32.070> easily<00:06:32.400> take<00:06:32.550> but<00:06:32.790> I<00:06:32.820> need

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
side then I can easily take but I need

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.520 
side then I can easily take but I need
to<00:06:33.180> change<00:06:33.389> the<00:06:33.540> sign<00:06:33.720> here<00:06:33.750> is<00:06:34.050> minus<00:06:34.380> so<00:06:34.470> it

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
to change the sign here is minus so it

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.290 
to change the sign here is minus so it
will<00:06:34.710> be<00:06:34.860> a<00:06:34.889> plus<00:06:35.160> now<00:06:35.370> so<00:06:35.850> I<00:06:35.880> can<00:06:36.120> write<00:06:36.270> like

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
will be a plus now so I can write like

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.879 
will be a plus now so I can write like
this<00:06:36.620> 3x

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
this 3x

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.279 
this 3x
plus<00:06:38.370> 2<00:06:38.639> X<00:06:38.849> is<00:06:39.300> greater<00:06:39.599> than<00:06:39.900> or<00:06:39.990> equals<00:06:40.229> to

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
plus 2 X is greater than or equals to

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.339 
plus 2 X is greater than or equals to
now<00:06:40.469> plus<00:06:41.370> 1<00:06:41.729> all<00:06:42.090> right<00:06:42.240> this<00:06:42.449> -<00:06:42.810> get<00:06:42.960> changed

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349 
now plus 1 all right this - get changed

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.459 
now plus 1 all right this - get changed
just<00:06:43.710> like<00:06:43.919> while<00:06:44.370> we<00:06:45.120> changed<00:06:45.509> in<00:06:46.050> equation

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:46.469 
just like while we changed in equation

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.589 
just like while we changed in equation
in<00:06:46.680> equation<00:06:47.009> you<00:06:47.460> know<00:06:47.580> like<00:06:47.969> like<00:06:48.180> if<00:06:48.419> we

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
in equation you know like like if we

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.350 
in equation you know like like if we
have<00:06:48.779> 3x<00:06:49.050> squared<00:06:49.529> plus<00:06:49.770> 2x<00:06:50.340> minus<00:06:50.909> 1<00:06:51.060> equals

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
have 3x squared plus 2x minus 1 equals

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.480 
have 3x squared plus 2x minus 1 equals
to<00:06:51.479> 0<00:06:51.689> so<00:06:52.110> while<00:06:52.259> solving<00:06:52.590> that<00:06:52.830> equation<00:06:53.009> what

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
to 0 so while solving that equation what

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.309 
to 0 so while solving that equation what
do<00:06:53.550> is<00:06:53.669> to<00:06:53.789> do<00:06:53.939> we<00:06:54.330> can<00:06:54.509> write<00:06:54.659> easily<00:06:55.020> 3x

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
do is to do we can write easily 3x

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.950 
do is to do we can write easily 3x
squared<00:06:55.590> plus<00:06:55.800> 2x<00:06:56.039> equals<00:06:56.789> to<00:06:56.879> 1<00:06:57.060> just<00:06:57.569> like

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
squared plus 2x equals to 1 just like

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.839 
squared plus 2x equals to 1 just like
that<00:06:58.169> just<00:06:58.590> like<00:06:58.860> that<00:06:58.919> you<00:06:59.129> can<00:06:59.159> you<00:06:59.370> can<00:06:59.400> you

00:06:59.839 --> 00:06:59.849 
that just like that you can you can you

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.730 
that just like that you can you can you
can<00:06:59.879> place<00:07:00.300> any<00:07:00.569> time<00:07:00.810> anywhere<00:07:01.199> all<00:07:01.379> right<00:07:01.439> if

will<00:07:31.439> not<00:07:31.560> get<00:07:31.740> changed<00:07:32.099> the<00:07:32.189> middle<00:07:32.430> sign

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
will not get changed the middle sign

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.010 
will not get changed the middle sign
will<00:07:32.789> not<00:07:32.909> get<00:07:33.089> changed<00:07:33.360> central<00:07:33.689> sign<00:07:33.870> will

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
will not get changed central sign will

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.050 
will not get changed central sign will
never<00:07:34.289> change<00:07:34.529> just<00:07:35.219> you<00:07:35.400> can<00:07:35.550> you<00:07:35.909> can

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 
never change just you can you can

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.929 
never change just you can you can
replace<00:07:36.870> the<00:07:37.020> term<00:07:37.259> right<00:07:38.039> if<00:07:38.279> it<00:07:38.550> is<00:07:38.669> plus

00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:38.939 
replace the term right if it is plus

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:40.640 
replace the term right if it is plus
another<00:07:39.389> side<00:07:39.599> it<00:07:39.719> will<00:07:39.779> be<00:07:39.960> minus<00:07:39.990> if<00:07:40.439> it<00:07:40.589> is

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.650 
another side it will be minus if it is

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.170 
another side it will be minus if it is
here<00:07:40.800> minus<00:07:41.189> another<00:07:41.339> side<00:07:41.610> it<00:07:41.729> will<00:07:41.819> be<00:07:41.969> plus

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 
here minus another side it will be plus

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.510 
here minus another side it will be plus
that's<00:07:42.629> it<00:07:42.870> so<00:07:43.199> this<00:07:43.349> is<00:07:43.409> where<00:07:43.740> the<00:07:43.919> maze<00:07:44.129> of<00:07:44.279> 3

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 
that's it so this is where the maze of 3

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.219 
that's it so this is where the maze of 3
rules<00:07:44.729> around<00:07:44.969> and<00:07:45.240> you<00:07:45.419> have<00:07:45.689> to<00:07:45.839> understand

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:46.229 
rules around and you have to understand

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:47.570 
rules around and you have to understand
this<00:07:46.319> rule<00:07:46.529> there<00:07:46.949> is<00:07:47.039> a<00:07:47.069> great<00:07:47.400> application

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 
this rule there is a great application

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.279 
this rule there is a great application
of<00:07:48.000> these<00:07:48.150> three<00:07:48.389> rules<00:07:48.539> while<00:07:48.870> solving<00:07:49.110> the

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:49.289 
of these three rules while solving the

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:51.379 
of these three rules while solving the
in<00:07:49.770> equations<00:07:50.250> alright<00:07:50.669> in<00:07:50.789> the<00:07:50.909> next<00:07:50.939> video

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:51.389 
in equations alright in the next video

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:54.110 
in equations alright in the next video
lesson<00:07:51.870> will<00:07:52.169> will<00:07:52.830> discuss<00:07:53.159> about<00:07:53.279> what<00:07:53.669> are

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 
lesson will will discuss about what are

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.600 
lesson will will discuss about what are
the<00:07:54.330> steps<00:07:54.389> while<00:07:55.349> solving<00:07:55.710> the<00:07:55.949> in<00:07:56.219> equation

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.610 
the steps while solving the in equation

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.740 
the steps while solving the in equation
right<00:07:56.759> so<00:07:57.060> see<00:07:57.180> you<00:07:57.240> in<00:07:57.270> the<00:07:57.330> next<00:07:57.539> video

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:57.750 
right so see you in the next video

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.110 
right so see you in the next video
