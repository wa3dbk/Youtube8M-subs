00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.690
 I work on two things that the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.800
 People think it's not my job 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.199
 designer and teacher 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.039
 everybody knows what it's for 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.830
 but a designer for a 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.740
 has already happened in my life . 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.540
 Some will engrave the cushions 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.340
 ask this kind of thing 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.200
 Ah, I thought I was going to look for a job. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 true because this business is doing 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.110
 a drawing or else I can not 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.510
 understand how you can apply this 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.340
 Even if you do it's called work. 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.030
 is to avoid any of these comments 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.449
 falls into the same question as what it 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.000
 Designer when I ask you something. 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.239
 of those who know if they respond 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.809
 let me make one thing clear 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.400
 everything that is of human creation for our 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.260
 own use 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.140
 at some point needed drawing 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.229
 I'm not exaggerating too much 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.540
 I challenge you to find any 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.150
 thing that has been created by man 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 for his own use that does not have 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.650
 needed by a designer in some 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.720
 moment this kind of vision of not 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.810
 understand for those who serve a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.759
 designer or what function he would have 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.220
 for society is because people 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.770
 today is all very things 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 ready so let's assume you buy one 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.150
 car that has bought a refrigerator a 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.369
 You do not have someone sew your 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.290
 clothes you go on a logic in several 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.750
 models you will choose something that 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.450
 you 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.850
 that's what they 're ready for then 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.910
 Immediate vision ends up giving the illusion 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.880
 that things are easy without 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.460
 to get but everything that exists in some 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.720
 accurate time in drawings and for you 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.110
 understand this better 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.930
 you just realize everything that is created 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.750
 man is undergoing a process of 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.870
 production process and in this 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.170
 construction of the idea of ​​the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.590
 from the beginning to the end of the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.760
 some time a designer was part of 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.370
 of this production 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.000
 So when someone asks you what 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.270
 A designer can serve you can respond 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.840
 The designer serves to do all that. 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.950
 You never wondered why? 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.989
 it's all right then this is it 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.989
 we are talking 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.960
 for a while
