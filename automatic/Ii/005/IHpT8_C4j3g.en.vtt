00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
for a while for a few months when they

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.510 
for a while for a few months when they
were<00:00:32.489> old<00:00:32.669> enough<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.030> digest<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:34.070> I'm<00:00:35.070> not

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
were old enough to digest them I'm not

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.459 
were old enough to digest them I'm not
straight<00:00:36.300> obviously<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.320> an

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
straight obviously just as like an

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.740 
straight obviously just as like an
occasional<00:00:38.309> treat<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.030> always<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.420> crazy

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
occasional treat and it always go crazy

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.889 
occasional treat and it always go crazy
for<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:41.700> I've<00:00:42.270> stopped<00:00:42.629> feeding

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
for them but now I've stopped feeding

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.029 
for them but now I've stopped feeding
the<00:00:43.140> male<00:00:43.379> ones<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.860> over<00:00:44.309> two<00:00:45.210> weeks<00:00:45.239> now<00:00:45.780> and

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.600 

the<00:00:51.050> reason<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.649> mealworms

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the reason for this is because mealworms

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.110 
the reason for this is because mealworms
are<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.360> really<00:00:54.809> addictive<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:58.609> though<00:00:59.609> they'll

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
are a really addictive so though they'll

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.029 
are a really addictive so though they'll
just<00:01:00.420> eat<00:01:00.719> mealworms<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.530> won't<00:01:01.829> eat

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
just eat mealworms and they won't eat

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.250 
just eat mealworms and they won't eat
anything<00:01:02.399> else<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.750> why<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.229> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
anything else so this is why a lot of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.859 
anything else so this is why a lot of
people<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.339> trouble<00:01:05.610> getting<00:01:06.570> their

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
people have trouble getting their

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.399 
people have trouble getting their
dragons<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.409> eat<00:01:07.530> salad<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:09.140> just<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.229> variety

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
dragons to eat salad and just a variety

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
dragons to eat salad and just a variety
of<00:01:10.740> foods<00:01:11.100> especially<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.299> feed<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of foods especially when they feed the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.859 
of foods especially when they feed the
mealworms<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:14.150> yeah<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.479> said<00:01:15.509> that

it's<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:59.420> don't<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.869> often<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.469> all

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it's just like don't do it often at all

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
it's just like don't do it often at all
like<00:02:02.479> maybe<00:02:06.409> probably<00:02:07.409> once<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:08.690> week<00:02:09.690> maybe

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
like maybe probably once a week maybe

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.309 
like maybe probably once a week maybe
just<00:02:10.800> one<00:02:11.069> every<00:02:11.400> week<00:02:11.550> or<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:11.849> but<00:02:12.840> even<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
just one every week or so but even that

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.890 
just one every week or so but even that
might<00:02:13.530> be<00:02:13.680> too

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
might be too

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.380 
might be too
often<00:02:14.230> because<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:16.060> might<00:02:16.209> get

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
often because then they might get

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.899 
often because then they might get
addicted<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.049> or<00:02:17.260> something<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:17.670> if<00:02:18.670> you

as<00:02:23.500> much<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.129> other<00:02:24.280> food<00:02:24.579> or<00:02:24.849> something

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
as much of the other food or something

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.759 
as much of the other food or something
like<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.329> I<00:02:25.540> definitely<00:02:25.780> stop<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> while

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
like that I definitely stop for a while

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.280 
like that I definitely stop for a while
and<00:02:27.720> then<00:02:28.950> startled<00:02:29.950> up<00:02:30.040> again<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:31.079> they<00:02:32.079> are

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
and then startled up again but they are

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.360 
and then startled up again but they are
a<00:02:32.319> good<00:02:32.620> source<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:33.069> fat<00:02:33.370> for<00:02:33.700> them<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:35.370> they're

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
a good source of fat for them so they're

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.259 
a good source of fat for them so they're
good<00:02:36.640> but<00:02:36.939> they're<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.239> really<00:02:37.359> addictive

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
good but they're just really addictive

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.930 
good but they're just really addictive

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
see here I have a bunch of male ones

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.949 
see here I have a bunch of male ones
the<00:02:52.060> reason<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.329> got<00:02:52.450> amazed<00:02:52.780> because

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
the reason I got amazed because

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.680 
the reason I got amazed because
obviously<00:02:53.349> I<00:02:53.709> haven't<00:02:53.950> been<00:02:54.129> feeding<00:02:54.519> them

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
obviously I haven't been feeding them

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.970 
obviously I haven't been feeding them
but<00:02:57.540> I've<00:02:58.540> got<00:02:58.689> two<00:02:58.840> types<00:02:59.109> in<00:02:59.349> here<00:02:59.590> I've<00:02:59.739> got

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
but I've got two types in here I've got

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.920 
but I've got two types in here I've got
just<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> normal<00:03:00.760> one<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.000> these<00:03:01.450> types<00:03:01.780> of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
just the normal one so these types of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.270 
just the normal one so these types of
beetles<00:03:02.349> and<00:03:04.230> like<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.349> smaller<00:03:05.680> male<00:03:06.040> ones

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
beetles and like the smaller male ones

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.670 
beetles and like the smaller male ones
like<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.670> common<00:03:06.970> mealworms<00:03:07.420> I'm<00:03:08.260> sure<00:03:08.500> if<00:03:08.590> I

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
like the common mealworms I'm sure if I

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.220 
like the common mealworms I'm sure if I
have<00:03:08.859> any<00:03:09.010> they're<00:03:09.280> okay<00:03:09.819> here's<00:03:10.060> one<00:03:13.230> just

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
these this one it's fully grown then I

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.159 
these this one it's fully grown then I
got<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.319> giant<00:03:17.530> male<00:03:17.829> ones<00:03:18.069> in<00:03:18.250> there<00:03:19.169> and

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
got the giant male ones in there and

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.319 
got the giant male ones in there and
just<00:03:20.859> at<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.160> pole<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:21.609> if<00:03:21.669> y'all<00:03:21.940> gonna<00:03:22.030> fade

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
just at a pole so if y'all gonna fade

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.939 
just at a pole so if y'all gonna fade
the<00:03:22.510> mealworms<00:03:22.900> try<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.410> get<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.590> ones<00:03:23.769> that

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
the mealworms try and get the ones that

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.860 
the mealworms try and get the ones that
have<00:03:24.040> shedded<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:25.510> then<00:03:25.690> they<00:03:25.840> don't

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
have shedded because then they don't

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.309 
have shedded because then they don't
have<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.260> hard<00:03:26.470> carapace<00:03:27.069> I<00:03:27.959> don't<00:03:28.959> think<00:03:29.109> I

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
have the hard carapace I don't think I

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.720 
have the hard carapace I don't think I
pronounced<00:03:29.859> that<00:03:29.919> right<00:03:30.129> I<00:03:30.190> think<00:03:30.340> it's<00:03:30.579> just

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
pronounced that right I think it's just

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.479 
pronounced that right I think it's just
shed<00:03:31.590> yeah<00:03:32.590> trying<00:03:32.829> get<00:03:32.949> the<00:03:33.010> ones<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.400> have

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
shed yeah trying get the ones that have

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.789 
shed yeah trying get the ones that have
shed<00:03:34.109> because<00:03:35.109> they<00:03:35.199> don't<00:03:35.409> have<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.620> hot

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
shed because they don't have the hot

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.979 
shed because they don't have the hot
carapace<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.430> it'll<00:03:37.359> be<00:03:37.419> a<00:03:37.449> lot<00:03:37.569> easier<00:03:37.629> to

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
carapace and it'll be a lot easier to

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.170 
carapace and it'll be a lot easier to
pull<00:03:38.560> them<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.829> digest<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.790> centrum

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
pull them to digest it and the centrum

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.670 
pull them to digest it and the centrum
it<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.419> I<00:03:43.599> haven't<00:03:43.900> fed<00:03:44.049> them<00:03:44.079> any<00:03:44.440> yet

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
it is I haven't fed them any yet

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.800 
it is I haven't fed them any yet
obviously<00:03:45.340> because<00:03:45.669> they<00:03:45.819> are<00:03:45.879> too<00:03:46.150> small<00:03:46.510> but

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
obviously because they are too small but

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.189 
obviously because they are too small but
I'll<00:03:47.769> only<00:03:48.069> be<00:03:48.280> feeding<00:03:48.549> them<00:03:48.790> mealworms<00:03:49.720> when

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
I'll only be feeding them mealworms when

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.800 
I'll only be feeding them mealworms when
they're<00:03:50.379> like<00:03:50.560> almost<00:03:51.489> fully<00:03:51.760> grown<00:03:52.090> they<00:03:52.629> can

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
they're like almost fully grown they can

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.689 
they're like almost fully grown they can
digest<00:03:52.989> them<00:03:53.319> properly<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.060> when<00:03:56.489> like<00:03:57.489> I

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
digest them properly and when like I

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.839 
digest them properly and when like I
will<00:03:58.269> only<00:03:58.510> feed<00:03:58.840> them<00:03:59.049> mealworms<00:03:59.620> like

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
will only feed them mealworms like

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.649 
will only feed them mealworms like
probably<00:04:00.849> once<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.389> month<00:04:01.569> or<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:04.180> only<00:04:04.569> in

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
probably once a month or so and only in

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.830 
probably once a month or so and only in
a<00:04:04.750> small<00:04:05.019> amount<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:07.239> yeah<00:04:09.329> also<00:04:10.329> tell<00:04:10.720> you

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
a small amount so yeah also tell you

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.689 
a small amount so yeah also tell you
another<00:04:10.989> story<00:04:11.349> when<00:04:11.769> I<00:04:11.799> first<00:04:12.159> got<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.430> little

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
another story when I first got a little

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:18.719 
another story when I first got a little
red<00:04:12.940> he<00:04:13.690> wouldn't<00:04:13.959> hate<00:04:14.639> so<00:04:17.190> what<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.250> did<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.609> I

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
red he wouldn't hate so what I did is I

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.610 
red he wouldn't hate so what I did is I
started<00:04:18.789> feeding<00:04:19.329> him<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.570> few<00:04:19.810> mealworms<00:04:20.289> and

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
started feeding him a few mealworms and

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.740 
started feeding him a few mealworms and
he<00:04:20.769> only<00:04:20.919> IMail<00:04:21.430> ones<00:04:21.699> and<00:04:22.029> this<00:04:22.120> is<00:04:22.330> before

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
he only IMail ones and this is before

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.779 
he only IMail ones and this is before
and<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.169> knew<00:04:23.919> fully<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:24.520> they<00:04:24.729> were

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
and I knew fully that they were

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.360 
and I knew fully that they were
addictive<00:04:25.360> or<00:04:25.740> whatever

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
addictive or whatever

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.510 
addictive or whatever
so<00:04:28.139> yeah<00:04:29.139> he<00:04:29.590> just<00:04:29.830> wouldn't<00:04:30.190> eat<00:04:30.280> anything

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
so yeah he just wouldn't eat anything

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.990 
so yeah he just wouldn't eat anything
but<00:04:31.000> mealworms<00:04:31.480> so<00:04:31.930> he's<00:04:32.320> basically<00:04:32.760> starved

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
but mealworms so he's basically starved

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.250 
but mealworms so he's basically starved
unless<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.840> fed<00:04:35.080> him<00:04:35.230> male<00:04:35.470> worms<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:37.080> this<00:04:38.080> was

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
unless I fed him male worms so this was

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.060 
unless I fed him male worms so this was
before<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.680> moved<00:04:38.919> him<00:04:39.160> out<00:04:39.310> here<00:04:39.700> outside<00:04:41.070> and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
before I moved him out here outside and

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.550 
before I moved him out here outside and
then<00:04:42.190> he<00:04:42.430> he<00:04:43.270> met<00:04:43.450> Daisy<00:04:43.720> or<00:04:44.080> whatever<00:04:44.440> and

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560
