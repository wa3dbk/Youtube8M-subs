some<00:00:29.680> don't<00:00:29.920> I<00:00:30.070> just<00:00:30.369> find<00:00:30.520> it<00:00:30.670> makes<00:00:30.850> it<00:00:31.000> a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
some don't I just find it makes it a

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.360 
some don't I just find it makes it a
little<00:00:31.180> bit<00:00:31.420> easier<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.619> I'm<00:00:32.890> gonna<00:00:33.070> go<00:00:33.250> ahead

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
little bit easier and I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.549 
little bit easier and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:00:33.550> do<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.300> same<00:00:34.510> on<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.899> other<00:00:34.930> one<00:00:35.289> since

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
and do the same on the other one since

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.500 
and do the same on the other one since
our<00:00:35.710> fingers<00:00:36.039> are<00:00:36.190> already<00:00:38.760> saturated<00:00:39.760> here

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
our fingers are already saturated here

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.350 
our fingers are already saturated here
and<00:00:41.290> I<00:00:41.620> just<00:00:42.100> find<00:00:42.309> that<00:00:42.430> it<00:00:42.610> helps<00:00:43.149> out<00:00:43.329> a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
and I just find that it helps out a

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.720 
and I just find that it helps out a
little<00:00:43.600> bit<00:00:43.899> and<00:00:44.350> at<00:00:44.920> this<00:00:45.040> point<00:00:45.370> I'm<00:00:45.520> also

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
little bit and at this point I'm also

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.670 
little bit and at this point I'm also
going<00:00:46.090> to<00:00:46.180> take<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.480> small<00:00:46.930> amount<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:49.559> put<00:00:50.559> it

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
going to take a small amount and put it

00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:01.140 
going to take a small amount and put it
on<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.010> shock<00:00:51.340> shafts<00:00:51.700> themselves

we'll get it over real easily and again
I'm<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.560> gonna<00:02:15.709> scrunch<00:02:16.190> this<00:02:16.400> down<00:02:19.090> turn<00:02:20.090> it

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
I'm just gonna scrunch this down turn it

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.430 
I'm just gonna scrunch this down turn it
a<00:02:20.329> little<00:02:20.359> bit<00:02:20.569> inside<00:02:21.019> out<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.620> stays<00:02:23.440> just

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
a little bit inside out so it stays just

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.000 
a little bit inside out so it stays just
like<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:26.049> we're<00:02:27.049> going<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.230> go<00:02:27.319> ahead<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
like so we're going to go ahead and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.569 
like so we're going to go ahead and
insert<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.730> ball<00:02:29.000> into<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.260> end<00:02:30.859> of<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
insert the ball into the end of the

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.610 
insert the ball into the end of the
shock<00:02:32.329> cap<00:02:32.660> I'm<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.079> going<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.230> use<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> pair

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
shock cap I'm just going to use a pair

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.789 
shock cap I'm just going to use a pair
of<00:02:33.650> pliers<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:34.340> do<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.639> like<00:02:34.850> we<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:35.209> in

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
of pliers to do this like we have in

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.500 
of pliers to do this like we have in
several<00:02:36.799> other<00:02:37.000> tutorials<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.319> again<00:02:39.319> it's<00:02:39.590> a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
several other tutorials and again it's a

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.270 
several other tutorials and again it's a
pretty<00:02:41.510> simple<00:02:41.840> process<00:02:42.019> we're<00:02:42.769> gonna<00:02:42.859> repeat

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
pretty simple process we're gonna repeat

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.410 
pretty simple process we're gonna repeat
that<00:02:43.519> on<00:02:43.579> both<00:02:43.880> sides

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.700 

and<00:02:51.420> get<00:02:51.570> those<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:53.600> let's<00:02:54.600> go<00:02:54.750> ahead<00:02:54.900> at<00:02:55.440> this

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
and get those in let's go ahead at this

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.200 
and get those in let's go ahead at this
point<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.450> grab<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:58.400> bottom<00:02:59.400> cap<00:02:59.610> assemblies

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
point and grab the bottom cap assemblies

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.110 
point and grab the bottom cap assemblies
that<00:03:00.390> we<00:03:00.510> worked<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.900> earlier<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.730> we're

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
that we worked on earlier and we're

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.700 
that we worked on earlier and we're
going<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.270> go<00:03:03.450> ahead<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:04.110> slide<00:03:04.770> those<00:03:05.130> over

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
going to go ahead and slide those over

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.580 
going to go ahead and slide those over
the<00:03:07.710> shafts<00:03:08.210> at<00:03:09.210> this<00:03:09.420> point<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.960> actually<00:03:10.110> like

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the shafts at this point I actually like

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.700 
the shafts at this point I actually like
to<00:03:11.390> put<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.690> liberal<00:03:13.500> amount<00:03:13.740> of<00:03:14.660> fluid<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
to put a liberal amount of fluid on the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.550 
to put a liberal amount of fluid on the
shock<00:03:16.950> shafts<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.640> then<00:03:17.760> also<00:03:18.560> concentrate

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
shock shafts and then also concentrate

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.010 
shock shafts and then also concentrate
and<00:03:19.770> put<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.010> lot<00:03:20.460> on<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> threads<00:03:23.750> I'm<00:03:24.750> also

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
and put a lot on the threads I'm also

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.190 
and put a lot on the threads I'm also
going<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.500> drop<00:03:26.300> some<00:03:27.300> fluid<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.990> whole

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
going to drop some fluid not a whole

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.990 
going to drop some fluid not a whole
bunch<00:03:28.440> but<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:29.010> couple<00:03:29.520> drops<00:03:29.850> down<00:03:30.410> into<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
bunch but a couple drops down into the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.270 
bunch but a couple drops down into the
top<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.300> another<00:03:34.260> drop<00:03:34.530> or<00:03:34.740> two<00:03:34.890> into<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
top and another drop or two into the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.840 
top and another drop or two into the
bottom<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.660> lubricate<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.320> inside<00:03:37.730> what<00:03:38.730> we

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
bottom to lubricate the inside what we

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.970 
bottom to lubricate the inside what we
don't<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.390> happen<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:40.050> as<00:03:40.200> we<00:03:40.230> push<00:03:40.740> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
don't want to happen is as we push the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.480 
don't want to happen is as we push the
shaft<00:03:41.280> through<00:03:41.960> for<00:03:42.960> it<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.170> catch<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.010> dry

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
shaft through for it to catch on a dry

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.820 
shaft through for it to catch on a dry
portion<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.150> those<00:03:45.300> silicone<00:03:46.050> gaskets<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
portion of those silicone gaskets and to

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.000 
portion of those silicone gaskets and to
rip<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.460> tear<00:03:47.730> them<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.440> what<00:03:49.830> we're<00:03:49.950> gonna

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
rip and to tear them so what we're gonna

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.949 
rip and to tear them so what we're gonna
do<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.730> take<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.340> part<00:03:53.640> with<00:03:54.630> that

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
do is take it so that the part with that

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.860 
do is take it so that the part with that
is<00:03:55.080> hexed<00:03:55.470> off<00:03:55.620> here<00:03:55.950> is<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:56.940> bottom<00:03:57.209> or

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
is hexed off here is to the bottom or

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.360 
is hexed off here is to the bottom or
you<00:03:58.860> can<00:03:59.010> also<00:03:59.160> look<00:03:59.310> at<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.000> orange<00:04:00.890> seal<00:04:01.890> and

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
you can also look at the orange seal and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.690 
you can also look at the orange seal and
that<00:04:02.640> goes<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.180> bottom<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:04.160> very<00:04:05.160> gently

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
that goes to the bottom and very gently

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.320 
that goes to the bottom and very gently
just<00:04:05.820> gonna<00:04:06.180> set<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.989> over<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.500> top<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:09.150> you

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
just gonna set that over the top and you

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.940 
just gonna set that over the top and you
don't<00:04:09.510> want<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:09.870> shove<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.410> on<00:04:10.500> because

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
don't want to just shove it on because

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.530 
don't want to just shove it on because
you'll<00:04:11.130> you'll<00:04:11.400> rip<00:04:11.640> those<00:04:11.880> gaskets<00:04:12.150> and

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
you'll you'll rip those gaskets and

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.479 
you'll you'll rip those gaskets and
you'll<00:04:12.690> get<00:04:12.840> leaking<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.010> want<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.310> put

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
you'll get leaking so you want to put

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.750 
you'll get leaking so you want to put
that<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:15.150> very<00:04:15.930> gently<00:04:16.520> go<00:04:17.520> ahead

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
because you will end up with leaky

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.580 
because you will end up with leaky
shocks<00:04:32.730> if<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.090> do<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.450> this<00:04:34.080> is<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.320> very

and<00:04:42.650> not<00:04:45.650> tear<00:04:46.650> those<00:04:46.830> gaskets<00:04:47.130> you<00:04:47.700> like<00:04:47.850> that

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
and not tear those gaskets you like that

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.399 
and not tear those gaskets you like that
I'm<00:04:48.150> putting<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.480> on<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.690> same<00:04:48.900> shaft

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
I'm putting it on the same shaft

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:51.869 
I'm putting it on the same shaft
because<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.159> should<00:04:51.339> watch<00:04:51.489> what<00:04:51.699> I'm<00:04:51.849> doing

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879 
because I should watch what I'm doing

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:58.259 
because I should watch what I'm doing
instead<00:04:52.479> of<00:04:52.599> the<00:04:52.689> camera<00:04:55.679> there<00:04:56.679> we<00:04:56.830> go<00:04:57.269> just

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:58.269 
instead of the camera there we go just

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:01.619 
instead of the camera there we go just
like<00:04:58.419> so<00:04:58.689> you<00:04:59.759> take<00:05:00.759> this<00:05:00.879> opportunity<00:05:01.059> to

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
like so you take this opportunity to

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.759 
like so you take this opportunity to
wipe<00:05:02.199> my<00:05:02.379> hands<00:05:02.769> off<00:05:03.059> all<00:05:04.059> right<00:05:04.379> the<00:05:05.379> next

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:05.769 
wipe my hands off all right the next

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:08.429 
wipe my hands off all right the next
thing<00:05:06.099> that<00:05:06.129> we're<00:05:06.369> going<00:05:06.519> to<00:05:06.639> do<00:05:06.969> is<00:05:07.809> to<00:05:08.229> put

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:08.439 
thing that we're going to do is to put

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.939 
thing that we're going to do is to put
the<00:05:08.559> wipers<00:05:09.179> onto<00:05:10.179> the<00:05:10.300> Pistons<00:05:10.749> and<00:05:10.959> let's
