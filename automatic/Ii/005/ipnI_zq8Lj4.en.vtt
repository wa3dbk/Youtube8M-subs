we can take a look at those in just a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.899 
we can take a look at those in just a
second<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:02.850> ahead

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
second as well so now we can go ahead

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.719 
second as well so now we can go ahead
and<00:02:03.000> take<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> headphones<00:02:03.509> out<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> here

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
and take the headphones out of here

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.649 
and take the headphones out of here
since<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.030> take<00:02:06.119> me<00:02:06.240> quite<00:02:06.390> some

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
since it's going to take me quite some

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.580 
since it's going to take me quite some
time<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:06.990> I'm<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> go<00:02:07.439> ahead<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
time so I'm just going to go ahead and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.880 
time so I'm just going to go ahead and
fast-forward<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.190> video<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> guys

so<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.099> was<00:02:18.190> probably<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.489> hardest<00:02:18.849> time

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
so that was probably the hardest time

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.490 
so that was probably the hardest time
