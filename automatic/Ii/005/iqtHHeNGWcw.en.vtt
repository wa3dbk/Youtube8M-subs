f50 these guys are going to clock in at

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.200 
f50 these guys are going to clock in at
five<00:01:28.860> point<00:01:29.100> eight<00:01:29.220> ounces<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.759> definitely

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
five point eight ounces so definitely

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.420 
five point eight ounces so definitely
the<00:01:30.329> latest<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.470> leather<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.890> 50<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the latest one on the leather of 50 is

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.080 
the latest one on the leather of 50 is
still<00:01:33.210> lighter<00:01:33.450> than<00:01:33.689> both<00:01:34.140> vapors

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
still lighter than both vapors

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.480 
still lighter than both vapors
surprisingly<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:37.049> 6.1<00:01:37.710> ounces<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.430> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
surprisingly at 6.1 ounces so it's a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.160 
surprisingly at 6.1 ounces so it's a
little<00:01:38.700> bit<00:01:38.820> heavier<00:01:39.240> than<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.960> synthetic

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
little bit heavier than the synthetic

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.670 
little bit heavier than the synthetic
one<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.720> very<00:01:42.720> soft<00:01:43.079> leather<00:01:43.320> upper

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
one but you get very soft leather upper

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
one but you get very soft leather upper
it's<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:43.979> different<00:01:44.130> than<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> synthetic

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
it's a lot different than the synthetic

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.359 
it's a lot different than the synthetic
one<00:01:45.229> obviously<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.439> feel<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.920> touch<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
one obviously and feel and touch you

to I do like the leather ones a little
bit<00:03:40.950> better<00:03:41.040> than<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.310> synthetic<00:03:41.489> just

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
bit better than the synthetic just

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:42.620 
bit better than the synthetic just
because<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.000> feel<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.389> get<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> little

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
because I feel like you get a little

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.879 
because I feel like you get a little
more<00:03:42.780> substance<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.650> sacrifice

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
more substance and you know sacrifice

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.280 
more substance and you know sacrifice
weight<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.669> ton<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.780> would<00:03:45.930> say<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.109> leather

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
weight a ton so I would say the leather

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.250 
weight a ton so I would say the leather
as<00:03:46.470> far<00:03:46.650> as<00:03:46.739> fit<00:03:46.950> for<00:03:46.980> those<00:03:47.220> two<00:03:47.459> about<00:03:48.260> moving

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.830 
as far as fit for those two about moving

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
on to the vapor family right here we can

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.030 
on to the vapor family right here we can
back<00:03:51.989> these<00:03:52.200> up<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.650> take<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.829> better

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
back these up so you can take a better

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.610 
back these up so you can take a better
look<00:03:53.810> obviously<00:03:54.810> smoother<00:03:55.169> more<00:03:55.380> leather

bit<00:04:59.410> easier<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.860> do<00:05:00.100> like<00:05:00.340> as<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.580> said<00:05:00.760> before

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
the fit of these ones I felt like they

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.050 
the fit of these ones I felt like they
were<00:05:02.500> maybe<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.830> little<00:05:03.010> wider<00:05:03.310> whether<00:05:03.850> that's

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060

synthetic fit out of these three I felt

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.410 
synthetic fit out of these three I felt
like<00:05:53.050> they<00:05:53.200> fit<00:05:53.380> my<00:05:53.530> foot<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.890> best<00:05:54.130> as<00:05:55.120> far<00:05:55.300> as

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
like they fit my foot the best as far as

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.270 
like they fit my foot the best as far as

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.160 
whiff just a wider shoe that 50 is

whether it be the leather and synthetic

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.560 
whether it be the leather and synthetic
it's<00:06:03.640> a<00:06:03.700> little<00:06:03.880> bit<00:06:04.030> wider<00:06:04.180> in<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.420> vapor

it's a little bit wider in the vapor

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.700 
it's a little bit wider in the vapor
which<00:06:04.900> it's<00:06:05.110> tends<00:06:05.320> to<00:06:05.410> be<00:06:05.500> a<00:06:05.530> little<00:06:05.590> more

guess<00:06:17.860> you<00:06:17.980> can<00:06:18.130> say<00:06:18.220> the<00:06:18.340> same<00:06:18.370> thing<00:06:18.610> as<00:06:18.730> as

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
guess you can say the same thing as as

guess you can say the same thing as as
fit<00:06:19.360> but<00:06:19.600> I<00:06:19.810> gotta<00:06:20.200> go<00:06:20.320> leather<00:06:20.530> 50s<00:06:21.100> and<00:06:21.190> if<00:06:21.280> i

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
fit but I gotta go leather 50s and if i

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.650 
fit but I gotta go leather 50s and if i
was<00:06:21.430> going<00:06:21.550> synthetic<00:06:22.030> again<00:06:22.300> i<00:06:22.330> would<00:06:22.570> go

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
was going synthetic again i would go

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.399 
was going synthetic again i would go
with<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.990> vapor<00:06:23.530> 9<00:06:23.800> so
