the slow section at the end is a real

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.130 
the slow section at the end is a real
trick<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> name<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:23.610> know<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:24.450> drivers<00:01:24.959> we

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
trick in a name you know as drivers we

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.080 
trick in a name you know as drivers we
always<00:01:25.500> love<00:01:25.709> fast<00:01:26.039> corners<00:01:26.550> but<00:01:26.729> fast

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
always love fast corners but fast

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.639 
always love fast corners but fast
corners<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.630> technically<00:01:28.170> challenging

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
corners are technically challenging

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.010 
corners are technically challenging
thing<00:01:29.190> about<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.580> one<00:01:29.789> is<00:01:29.819> that<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.539> you<00:01:30.720> lead

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
thing about this one is that it you lead

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.469 
thing about this one is that it you lead
in<00:01:31.289> through<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> flat<00:01:32.459> out<00:01:32.640> left-hander<00:01:33.300> then

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
in through a flat out left-hander then

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.969 
in through a flat out left-hander then
you've<00:01:33.630> got<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.929> try<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.229> attack<00:01:34.530> into<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you've got to try and attack into the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.559 
you've got to try and attack into the
next<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:35.819> into<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.179> life<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
next right and then into this life and

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.359 
next right and then into this life and
this<00:01:36.899> long<00:01:37.349> long<00:01:37.740> right-hander<00:01:38.250> you're

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this long long right-hander you're

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.820 
this long long right-hander you're
always<00:01:38.700> searching<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.810> exit<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.679> also

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
always searching for the exit but also

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.859 
always searching for the exit but also
if<00:01:41.039> you<00:01:41.160> come<00:01:41.369> down<00:01:41.399> a<00:01:41.580> little<00:01:41.819> bit<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.690> see

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
if you come down a little bit you see

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.960 
if you come down a little bit you see
the<00:01:43.020> rods<00:01:43.229> falling<00:01:43.770> away<00:01:43.979> from<00:01:44.039> you<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.580> drops

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the rods falling away from you it drops

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.669 
the rods falling away from you it drops
away<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.450> therefore<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.050> point<00:01:46.319> even

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
away so therefore at this point even

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.139 
away so therefore at this point even
although<00:01:46.920> we've<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.310> huge<00:01:47.759> amounts<00:01:48.090> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
although we've got huge amounts of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.820 
although we've got huge amounts of
downforce<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:48.720> grip<00:01:48.929> from<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.140> big<00:01:49.349> tires<00:01:49.590> as

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
downforce and grip from the big tires as

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.650 
downforce and grip from the big tires as
well<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.550> turn<00:01:50.789> in<00:01:50.910> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> front<00:01:51.450> Wash

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
well we just turn in in the front Wash

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.029 
opportunity around here but I can tell
you<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.720> one<00:01:58.050> where<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> heart<00:01:58.649> rates<00:01:58.890> are

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
you it's one where the heart rates are

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.320 
you it's one where the heart rates are
going<00:01:59.069> it's<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.550> where<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.819> drivers<00:02:00.209> are

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
going it's one where the drivers are

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.630 
going it's one where the drivers are
working<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.319> one<00:02:01.590> place<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.610> can

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
working and it's one place you can

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.930 
working and it's one place you can
really<00:02:03.239> see<00:02:03.569> the<00:02:03.709> modern<00:02:04.709> sports<00:02:05.280> car<00:02:05.580> doing

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
really see the modern sports car doing

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:14.200 
really see the modern sports car doing
its<00:02:06.060> job<00:02:06.470> flat<00:02:07.470> out

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.240 

one<00:02:15.210> thing<00:02:15.450> about<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.840> circuit<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
one thing about this circuit is that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.220 
one thing about this circuit is that
it's<00:02:17.400> made<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.820> of<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.090> lot<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.480> corners<00:02:19.050> that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
it's made up of a lot of corners that

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.710 
it's made up of a lot of corners that
are<00:02:19.290> recognized<00:02:19.920> from<00:02:20.100> other<00:02:20.310> tracks<00:02:20.720> triple

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
are recognized from other tracks triple

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.500 
are recognized from other tracks triple
right-hander<00:02:22.320> that's<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.220> triple<00:02:23.510> left-hander

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
right-hander that's a triple left-hander

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.090 
right-hander that's a triple left-hander
in<00:02:24.660> Turkey<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:26.280> one's<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.790> little<00:02:27.060> bit<00:02:27.360> easier

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
in Turkey this one's a little bit easier

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.580 
in Turkey this one's a little bit easier
but<00:02:29.100> as<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.460> hear<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:30.840> happened<00:02:31.470> to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
but as you can hear it's happened to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.350 
but as you can hear it's happened to
what<00:02:31.770> car<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.220> tyres<00:02:32.490> are<00:02:32.730> squealing<00:02:32.760> all<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
what car the tyres are squealing all the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.420 
what car the tyres are squealing all the
way<00:02:33.450> down<00:02:33.830> I'm<00:02:34.830> not<00:02:34.980> sure<00:02:35.040> where<00:02:35.340> this

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
way down I'm not sure where this

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.300 
way down I'm not sure where this
left-hander<00:02:36.120> comes<00:02:36.330> from<00:02:36.570> bataye<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.100> new

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
left-hander comes from bataye it's a new

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.640 
left-hander comes from bataye it's a new
difficult<00:02:39.090> corner<00:02:41.660> that's<00:02:42.660> one<00:02:42.990> lap<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
difficult corner that's one lap of the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.750 
difficult corner that's one lap of the
circuit<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.130> Americas

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
circuit of Americas

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.570 
circuit of Americas
what<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.390> fantastic<00:02:46.659> track<00:02:47.439> it<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.769> I've<00:02:48.220> got<00:02:48.459> to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
what a fantastic track it is I've got to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.509 
what a fantastic track it is I've got to
see<00:02:48.760> first<00:02:49.360> time<00:02:49.599> here<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.290> I'm<00:02:50.439> a<00:02:50.470> huge<00:02:51.040> huge

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
see first time here and I'm a huge huge
