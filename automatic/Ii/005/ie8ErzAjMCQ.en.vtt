00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
if I can get the goggles to flip over it

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.990 
if I can get the goggles to flip over it
was<00:03:17.510> kind<00:03:17.720> of<00:03:17.750> tricky<00:03:17.989> we<00:03:18.830> get<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> hand<00:03:19.760> here

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
was kind of tricky we get a hand here

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.979 
was kind of tricky we get a hand here
with<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.180> camera<00:03:22.000> take<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.030> figure<00:03:23.390> out<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
with a camera take the figure out of the

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:33.759 
with a camera take the figure out of the
Batpod<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:29.319> basically<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:32.030> goggles<00:03:32.769> flip

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
Batpod so basically the goggles flip

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.110 
Batpod so basically the goggles flip
forward<00:03:35.050> like<00:03:36.050> so<00:03:36.459> they're<00:03:37.459> very<00:03:37.489> tight<00:03:37.940> on

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
forward like so they're very tight on

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.280 
forward like so they're very tight on
mine<00:03:38.330> I<00:03:38.360> don't<00:03:38.660> know<00:03:38.750> if<00:03:38.840> they're<00:03:38.989> like<00:03:39.019> that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290

with everyone but be careful use two

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.030 
with everyone but be careful use two
hands<00:03:42.049> so<00:03:42.760> they<00:03:43.760> flip<00:03:44.000> over<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:45.040> so

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
hands so they flip over like that so
