00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.439
 and very good friends of youtube 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.790
 welcome to this new video and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.180
 they looked for guys here we are back 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.879
 in one more video I had already started that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 I did not upload videos but because I had some 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.210
 how many problems with my device and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.210
 I could not record 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.160
 so here's a new video because 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.320
 I owed them and then guys are going in this 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.550
 video I will teach you a way that could 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.650
 be very useful in this new update 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.870
 of minecraft since the worlds are more 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.900
 big and it's easier to get lost 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.080
 with this mode it will no longer be so 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.970
 that this mod is called waypoints and therefore 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.680
 allows you to indicate at a certain point that you 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.680
 you want to make a way point as well 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.190
 the mode that is called race minimal that 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.160
 You can leave a little dot of colors in your 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.460
 location you can leave a little 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.790
 colors in this in a certain place that here 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 that you look welcoming only do not stop 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:39.460
 heck, I do not know what's going on 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.460
 I'm possessed maybe if I put pause 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.230
 no no 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.980
 it was the curse of the moment excuse me 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.560
 for those guys as I said 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.890
 like in the minecraft mode of pc the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.390
 world is called minimum race allows you 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.540
 lets leave a 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.120
 one allows to indicate a point in the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.590
 that you have done something a place where 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.410
 Do not want to lose and be able to go back there 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.060
 because this mode is like this you can not put 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 little color but it is similar 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.989
 and then this mode works from the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.620
 next way let me change the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.620
 view 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.150
 good for example 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.190
 this place or heck this place is 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.450
 beautiful to make my order and home 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.489
 or my temporary shelter 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.680
 We really need to activate the waypoint 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.230
 good for that they will have to go to the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.780
 visit that appears on the top 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.190
 I have it hidden from the screen 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.810
 that you can not see we give in 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.400
 manage scripts mode 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.200
 and as you can see here I already have it 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.140
 waypoints you will have to look for 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.160
 and they will have to import the blog 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.850
 launching we give you activate 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.850
 we do not go out 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.680
 and as you can see we see a 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.080
 small square with a double vee in the part 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.629
 top left of the screen good 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.500
 as we said or heck this 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.500
 place I like 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.550
 we give in the double u and we give in creating 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.350
 waypoint for example I want this 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.000
 place is called because there appear the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.320
 coordinates can erase it and put it 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.640
 the name that you want for 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.640
 example I will put xd or devils xd 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.680
 and now let's do a recreation 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.680
 of when can we use this mod 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.560
 or hell I've spent all day 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.560
 felling trees or yes 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.410
 or demons where my refuge was 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:08.319
 I need to go there as soon as possible 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.319
 demons and now what do I do 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.910
 yes the waypoint 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.810
 we simply select in the x of what 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.360
 it's something I had created 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.450
 previously and as you can see us 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.690
 a little arrow appears or if 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.800
 and that little arrow tells us where 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.920
 is the waypoint that we had marked 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.450
 previously or devils and indicated and 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.450
 little arrow indicates me 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.570
 and how can you see when we are in the 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.300
 where we wanted to be the little arrow 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.550
 starts to spin like crazy and how can 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.340
 see here is the place was easy 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.569
 locate it and then I saying that this mod 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.210
 it's too useful 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.370
 and that would be all I also wanted 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.949
 inform them that we have arrived 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.530

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.870

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.720

 trying to record the special 100 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.190
 subscribers but as I said 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.330
 I previously had problems when recording 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.970
 and then I could not was very inspired 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.020
 to do the special but everything went 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.740

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.919

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.380

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.470
