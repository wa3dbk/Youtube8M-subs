00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.060
 during a state visit 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.670
 the meeting was just such an honorary one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.960
 guard report guards and 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.450

 several times in the last 24 hours 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.370
 talked to one-on-one members 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.140
 english delegation 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.360
 wandered around the residence corridors and

 journalist and asked about democracy 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 I think the journalist who asked the question 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.550
 This is the first visit to Kazakhstan. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.990
 usually this is the first time 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.090
 visit means your island is seen 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.209
 that everything about the Soviet space is 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.790
 medieval who distinctly

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.100

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.410

 initiative at a press conference 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.459
 the Kazakh side needed 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.500
 immediately consolidate the success and followed 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.140
 The issue of visas is most recently British 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.519
 authorities did not give permission to enter 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.200
 a disabled Kazakhstani artist 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.570
 could leave the embassy prints 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.400
 fingers he had no hands British 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.910
 perhaps the prime minister did not blush and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.769
 The episode began to apologize to the artist 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.239
 handicapped was very wrong and very 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.370
 sorry this should not have happened 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.440
 we discussed this too with your 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.480
 President after this became clear have 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.739
 There is no Kazakhstan and Great Britain 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.769
 no other choice but to become 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.790
