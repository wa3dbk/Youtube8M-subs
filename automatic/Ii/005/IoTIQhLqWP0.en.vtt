00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.940
 before buying your first car 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.970
 many boys love big and cool 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.369
 machines later comes the understanding that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.520
 great car better not to possess a 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 photograph such a car 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.759
 most spectacular to photograph in 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.650
 movement how to do it right 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.750
 There are two main ways to shoot in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.850
 movement 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.220
 1 with a blurred background which 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.589
 especially emphasizes driving dynamics 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.649
 This is an interesting, very complicated trick. 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.420
 photos but its study will require 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.550
 additional theoretical knowledge 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.930
 let's talk about it in detail in a few 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.579
 new series to begin to deal with 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.989
 the second way how to shoot in motion 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.340
 so that the photo was clear and sharp 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.000
 the camera takes pictures with a specific 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.370
 an exposure 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.009
 to freeze the object in the frame will allow 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 shorter shutter speed and shorter 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.110
 excerpt for example one five hundredth share 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.490
 seconds or one thousandth especially 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.140
 frozen motion in the frame 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.819
 to control the modern camera 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.319
 shutter speed must go to mode 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.979
 shutter priority 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.929
 the day before it will be tivi when turned on 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.030
 this function, the photographer indicates the camera 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.979
 what you need to work out an excerpt a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.520
 the camera independently picks up 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.080
 Aperture required for shooting conditions 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.509
 if the camera has no priority mode 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.959
 excerpts then maybe sport mode or 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.940
 movement in these modes is best and 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.870
 shoot in motion the traffic of people and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.330
 of animals 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.820
 modern cameras focus on 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.250
 automatically using autofocus 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.630
 but when shooting a moving plot 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.060
 every autofocus can work 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.650
 effective in simple cameras autofocus 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.720
 can slow down 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.970
 think a little and and behave not 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.500
 fully adequate 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.090
 therefore it is advisable to focus on 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.910
 in advance to the place where will enter 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.130
 subject to shoot and disable autofocus 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.790
 as soon as the object is in the right 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.530
 place you can click on the trigger 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.510
 hello you wish with one touch on 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.150
 descent can take a whole series of shots 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.420
 watching the camera behind a moving object like 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.120
 would enter it overs make it allow 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.250
 burst mode in this mode 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.080
 just press the trigger once 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.260
 the camera will shoot a whole series of frames 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.090
 until the button is released 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.950
 autofocus shooting method 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.739
 will allow to remove cars 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.329
 motorcycles when staged shooting or 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.090
 for example when driving on a ring 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.379
 track 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.239
 staging photos always allow 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.730
 get more spectacular predictable 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.709
 shoot result so convince 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.030
 beautiful transport owners in 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.650
 that your pictures will be very useful to them 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.599
 the location is always worth seeing. 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.239
 pre-select a spectacular background 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.040
 where the main character will go 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.690
 pre-plan the composition and when 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.599
 the object will be in the right place 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.849
 shoot shoot but don't forget about 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.510
 safety when shooting sports 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.310
 cars and motorcycles 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.470
 shooting in motion is very exciting 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.870
 photography genre and the ability to shoot 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.540
 staged give the most memorable 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.540
 what frames do you want
