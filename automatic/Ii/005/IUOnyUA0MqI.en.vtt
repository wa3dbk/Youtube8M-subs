00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.379
 most of them will need a normal car to get from a to b 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.990
 there are also winter sports enthusiasts on the street 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.990
 they are ready and deep why actually 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.630
 most of them opt for the first 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.839
 a sporting fell a larger falls 17 18 inches 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.870
 in the end, even shallow as you can see here is this sporty style 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.540
 Much flatter than the standard advice as the old wheel is now mounted this 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.510
 sporty way own car so you can see that the distance between helped and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.840
 Causer gets much bigger here you need a sports suspension now 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.560
 8 the athlete is so low has a sports suspension fell on both 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.290
 you can see 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.440
 but there are also differences you should know what you want or need 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 that they use it for example a series shock absorber with one as their spring 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.690
 and Seal is it 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.460
 Foster vehicle to lower and many do take some of the spring 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.980
 just cut that is forbidden 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.130
 it's called such a solution a complete suspension 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.150
 the vehicle has a certain height lap corresponding to Hoppes push 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.630
 set with the spring on the few time and for the athletic 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.520
 Of course there is this solution here you can do that ambitious park 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.760
 she still screws the height of the parliament adjust 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.270
 and also adjust the damper with the hardness accordingly 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.090
 Cost 600 to 1200 euros 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.240
 in the starting gun there are two chambers one with only one third 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.150
 filled 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.420
 I would follow the whole trend 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.560
 this is the one coming out of the clinic in Tim Farron's 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.390
 Here are the benefits here, two major benefits in three 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.280
 pubs 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.900
 I have a better braking effect and no bite fast corners 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.480
 As you can see very nicely here, the father has been lowered so far 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.160
 thereby 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.960
 the vehicle's center of gravity is now the lower I have no bank and 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.500
 Rheumatism lung is overall a very sporty vote smaller 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.879
 Downside is 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.510
 that the ride comfort is a bit lost through the tight suspension 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.510
 and reach through the flames 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.369
 With so many benefits, some may resort to austerity themselves 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.809
 to the tool without expertise but that can go to the eye 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.179
 the Dinner for Men is a very complex topic 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.749
 Therefore, my tip let them a pale basically in a specialist workshop 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.979
 by a specialist a tree 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:41.159
 Traces Camber Caster must be checked and it must be entered 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.459
 my last time 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.060
 if they go on buses ride practice before because the driving behavior changes 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.769
 seriously 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.199
 therefore, everyone should be aware of what the actual 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.489
 not acceptable 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.810
 Advice is also available in specialist workshops which is also necessary to 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.209
 On bad roads with a part, this one is particularly obscure 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.939
 strain 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:04.040
