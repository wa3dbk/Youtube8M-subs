00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.320 
the perspective close enough what's the
game<00:02:47.790> can<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:49.860> lot<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.640> people<00:02:50.940> think<00:02:51.060> oh<00:02:51.209> if

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
game can see a lot of people think oh if

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.789 
game can see a lot of people think oh if
i<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.690> bigger<00:02:51.870> army<00:02:52.260> i'll<00:02:52.350> win<00:02:52.560> that's

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
i have the bigger army i'll win that's

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.250 
i have the bigger army i'll win that's
not<00:02:52.950> necessarily<00:02:53.489> true<00:02:53.810> more<00:02:54.810> often<00:02:54.959> than<00:02:55.200> not

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
not necessarily true more often than not

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.020 
not necessarily true more often than not
if<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.799> map<00:02:56.040> control<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.880> where

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
if you have map control to know where

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.059 
if you have map control to know where
your<00:02:57.150> partner<00:02:57.480> your<00:02:57.660> opponent<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.260> going<00:02:58.470> if

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
your partner your opponent is going if

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.800 
your partner your opponent is going if
you<00:02:59.220> know<00:02:59.400> he's<00:02:59.580> exchanging<00:02:59.880> if<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.420> go<00:03:00.569> at

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
you know he's exchanging if you go at

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.610 
you know he's exchanging if you go at
least<00:03:00.959> relatively

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.050 

you<00:03:03.739> have<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:03.920> smaller<00:03:04.220> army<00:03:04.489> but<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.879> have<00:03:04.970> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
you have a smaller army but you have the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.410 
you have a smaller army but you have the
right<00:03:05.209> counter<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.140> can<00:03:06.290> definitely<00:03:06.530> win<00:03:07.420> and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
right counter you can definitely win and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.630 
right counter you can definitely win and
I<00:03:08.510> think<00:03:08.690> that's<00:03:08.840> what<00:03:08.989> hape<00:03:09.140> rose<00:03:09.319> gold<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.769> he

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
I think that's what hape rose gold is he

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.809 
I think that's what hape rose gold is he
didn't<00:03:10.940> really<00:03:11.659> control<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> map<00:03:12.890> on<00:03:13.129> i<00:03:13.610> would

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
didn't really control the map on i would

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.880 
didn't really control the map on i would
say<00:03:13.940> his<00:03:14.060> other<00:03:14.209> two<00:03:14.480> wins<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.959> then<00:03:15.590> his<00:03:15.709> two

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
say his other two wins and then his two

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.520 
say his other two wins and then his two
losses<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:16.459> really<00:03:17.150> have<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.989> map<00:03:18.140> control

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
losses you really have the map control

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.559 
losses you really have the map control
them<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:21.620> again<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:22.519> what<00:03:22.760> i<00:03:23.030> was

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
them so again just like what i was

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.089 
them so again just like what i was
guessing<00:03:23.810> april<00:03:24.349> is<00:03:24.470> going<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.799> go<00:03:24.890> for<00:03:25.069> that

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
guessing april is going to go for that

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.309 
guessing april is going to go for that
expenditure<00:03:25.610> control<00:03:26.569> this<00:03:26.659> entire<00:03:26.720> left

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319

side<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.159> really<00:03:28.700> at<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.090> point

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
side of that and really at this point

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.700 
side of that and really at this point
that<00:03:29.959> he<00:03:30.049> knows<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.290> was<00:03:30.950> heaven

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
that he knows that was heaven

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.530 
that he knows that was heaven
I<00:03:31.740> would<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.430> go<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.760> take<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.120> pace<00:03:33.360> as

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
I would just go and take this pace as

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.140 
I would just go and take this pace as
well<00:03:34.070> suzuki<00:03:35.070> second<00:03:35.490> done<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.850> don't<00:03:36.000> want

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
well suzuki second done you don't want

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.180 
well suzuki second done you don't want
to<00:03:36.270> search<00:03:36.660> your<00:03:36.870> minerals<00:03:37.290> too<00:03:37.440> much<00:03:37.650> but

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
to search your minerals too much but

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.010 
to search your minerals too much but
he's<00:03:38.280> got<00:03:38.460> so<00:03:38.670> much<00:03:38.820> extra<00:03:39.150> minerals<00:03:39.450> so

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
he's got so much extra minerals so

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.280 
he's got so much extra minerals so
little<00:03:40.320> get<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:41.760> at<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.150> point<00:03:42.420> he<00:03:43.020> needs

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
little get that at this point he needs

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.850 
little get that at this point he needs
to<00:03:43.500> but<00:03:43.860> good<00:03:44.160> job<00:03:44.220> solutions<00:03:44.850> on<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:46.530> as<00:03:46.650> well

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
to but good job solutions on it as well

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.960 
to but good job solutions on it as well
so

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.220 

he<00:03:51.970> needs<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.300> start<00:03:52.480> building<00:03:52.720> up<00:03:52.930> on<00:03:53.080> bills

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
he needs to start building up on bills

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.650 
he needs to start building up on bills
how<00:03:53.710> much<00:03:53.860> lower<00:03:54.160> he<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.580> is<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.300> off<00:03:55.390> basically

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
how much lower he is is it off basically

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.110 
how much lower he is is it off basically
a<00:03:55.990> hundred<00:03:56.350> fifty<00:03:56.740> hundred<00:03:56.830> fifty<00:03:57.400> become<00:03:58.090> a
