often<00:00:47.410> anyway<00:00:47.710> able<00:00:48.040> I<00:00:48.190> just<00:00:48.640> thought

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
often anyway able I just thought

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.420 
often anyway able I just thought
mentioned<00:00:49.420> that<00:00:49.570> well<00:00:49.870> as<00:00:50.050> on<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.800> Sigma<00:00:51.220> and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
mentioned that well as on the Sigma and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.580 
mentioned that well as on the Sigma and
stuff<00:00:51.760> like<00:00:51.970> lights<00:00:52.210> much<00:00:52.540> better<00:00:52.840> but<00:00:53.470> the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
stuff like lights much better but the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.890 
stuff like lights much better but the
lens<00:00:53.770> itself<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.850> really<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.390> really<00:00:55.720> good

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
lens itself is really the really good

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.430 
lens itself is really the really good
it's<00:00:56.829> crystal<00:00:57.190> sharp<00:00:57.720> really<00:00:58.720> sharp<00:00:58.960> image<00:00:59.290> is

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
it's crystal sharp really sharp image is

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.280 
it's crystal sharp really sharp image is
even<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.800> tall<00:01:00.010> pine<00:01:00.250> hey<00:01:00.520> it's<00:01:01.450> 2.8<00:01:02.020> from<00:01:02.200> the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
even a tall pine hey it's 2.8 from the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.529 
even a tall pine hey it's 2.8 from the
full<00:01:02.470> vocal<00:01:02.710> range<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.910> end<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.329> lens

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
full vocal range the end of the lens

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.510 
full vocal range the end of the lens
does<00:01:04.809> come<00:01:05.109> in<00:01:05.259> and<00:01:05.740> out<00:01:08.039> he<00:01:09.039> comes<00:01:09.069> with<00:01:09.460> a

does come in and out he comes with a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.099 
does come in and out he comes with a
flower<00:01:09.729> look<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.069> standard<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.960> your

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
flower look at the standard there's your

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:17.520 
flower look at the standard there's your

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
this lens it really really is and a

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.819 
this lens it really really is and a
stonking<00:01:27.609> lens<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.359> put<00:01:28.539> this<00:01:28.659> Sigma<00:01:29.439> cap<00:01:29.649> on

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
stonking lens just put this Sigma cap on

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.459 
stonking lens just put this Sigma cap on
it<00:01:31.679> sit<00:01:32.679> it<00:01:32.829> over<00:01:33.100> yeah<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:34.209> can't<00:01:34.929> really<00:01:35.020> I

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469

bite father's a bit of chromatic

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.559 
bite father's a bit of chromatic
aberration<00:01:52.539> but<00:01:52.659> this<00:01:53.139> lens<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:54.299> can't<00:01:55.299> find

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569
