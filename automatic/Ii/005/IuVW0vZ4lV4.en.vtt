00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.170
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.820
 be well today I'm happy 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.250
 to find you in my complete test 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.690
 wan more like last year 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.830
 a law no longer to hit hard in 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.630
 proposing a few days ago a 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.430
 new smartphone with performance 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.170
 and a design worthy of top smartphones 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.830
 of range but keeping its price 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.630
 rather low 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.970
 let's see if they have managed their bet this 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.440
 year the one piece everything is proposed in 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.930
 two different versions the input of 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.079
 range with 16 gigabytes of storage and 3 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.550
 giga ram is offered at 339 euros and 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.130
 the second version the one I have 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.230
 has 64 gigabytes of storage with 4 gigas 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.420
 of ram the dozen smartphones is 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.950
 clearly successful in my taste found 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.050
 a metal architecture on 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.570
 sides a large slab gorilla glass 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.280
 four in front and he has a dol 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.410
 slightly curved with a superb 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.200
 texture on it a bit confusing at 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.160
 early but we get used to it very quickly 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.360
 however, if you like this shell 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.280
 not you can always there changed 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.780
 since it is removable on the shop 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.159
 wan more you find hulls in 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.360
 bamboo in Kevlar carbon etc 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.770
 since we are on the back of the smartphone remains 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.680
 11 and it is here that you can 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.060
 put your nano sim card (s) 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.280
 yes the one piece all board a slot 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.960
 double sim very handy if you have a 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.430
 pro and personal phone 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.260
 but on the other hand as you could 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.729
 notice the battery is not a word 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.890
 bible so unfortunately you do not 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.720
 will not be able to change the battery you 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.549
 even in terms of the camera 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.799
 back and 7 13 megapixels I was 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.150
 pleasantly surprised the photos are 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.799
 stuffed with details with colors 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.220
 alive but does not distort the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.220
 landscape 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.439
 when it comes to videos you can 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.700
 to film in hd 10 81 or in 4k I filmed 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.140
 the same place with these two qualities 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.909
 different and I must say that I do not 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.200
 am not bluffed it's true that the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.369
 colors stand out a bit more about 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.689
 the right image but hey it's not crazy 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.369
 the optical stabilizer have him 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.290
 clearly not terrible if we compare 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.020
 quickly with that of the iphone here 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.560
 what it gives 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 afterwards for the application 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.820
 photo it is rather easy to use 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.650
 I found the photos are a little bit 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.600
 long to take for my taste and you have 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.569
 the photo and video mode of course 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.780
 but also the slow-motion panorama mode and 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.709
 accelerate to the advanced 5 megapixel camera and 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.970
 but I must say that 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.970
 quality is great 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.340
 around the smartphone we have on the right 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.330
 volume and lock buttons 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.060
 on the left we have a button 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.980
 three notch notification very buttons 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.270
 well thought out wholesale when pushed 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.950
 all the time all the ringtones are 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.420
 disabled in the middle these are the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.220
 priority ringtones by wholesale 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.850
 call the messages but not the games 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.440
 for example 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.250
 and finally all the way down 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.720
 ringtones are activated at the top of 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.510
 the device we have a microphone and the plug 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.800
 jack 3.5 mm down we will find in 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.140
 a first time the speakers who 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.990
 are pretty good the sound goes up without 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.480
 to be distorted or too saturated in addition to 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.700
 + has set up max audio effect which 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.960
 allows to equalize the sound that comes out of 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.880
 speakers depending on whether you 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.440
 listen to the music you watch 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.120
 a movie or if you play a game 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.830
 and it works pretty well 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.200
 of course if you do not like it 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.460
 can always disable it and 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.890
 finally you have the catch for 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.660
 recharge the smartphone jack usb c 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.170
 it's a great first on a 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.700
 smartphone 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.960
 we saw this take appears on the 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.590
 new macbook or of course 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.880
 chromebook 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.530
 but this time there are the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.990
 smartphone manufacturers are getting into 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.250
 Also at the front of the unit has 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.540
 sure the front camera which I am 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.030
 spoke earlier but he is also 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.560
 a notification led indicating 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.720
 if the one piece everything being refills 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.820
 that he has almost no battery or 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.010
 if you have a message a call or a 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.570
 any notification at the bottom we have the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.950
 home button this button is only 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.200
 touch as it embeds a sensor 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.270
 fingerprint sensors really 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.730
 super fast whether it's configured or 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.140
 good to use sometimes she and responds 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.030
 not good when you put your finger 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.620
 anywhere but good if it is good 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.960
 asked there is no problem and that's 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.370
 super fast I repeat to you for 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.020
 go back to the button I confess that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.670
 it was pretty stressful at the beginning of 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.800
 not be able to press on it like on a 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.080
 samsung or iphone but we get used to it 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.610
 finally and between us I prefer 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.800
 anyway when I can squeeze a 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.720
 button next to you have the button of 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.140
 multitasking and on the other there is the button 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.330
 return 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.500
 these two are configurable in the 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.090
 settings to apply them to others 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.860
 functions when you press once 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.780
 when you double-tap 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.340
 if you do not like buttons too much 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.170
 the outside of the screen and you're 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.799
 rather accustomed to using this to 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.720
 interior 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.010
 Well, it's quite possible 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.270
 you 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.520
 finished khm years of choosing her in the 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.190
 settings for what is the screen there 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.840
 has a glass gorilla glass 4 of 5 5 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.290
 diagonal inches with a resolution 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.150
 of 1920 by 10 81 it's a very screen 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.750
 beautiful very bright with colors 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.460
 pÃ©tantes 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.320
 it is not the most beautiful screen that I could 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.390
 see but he's doing very well 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.710
 little thing to know too or no longer 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.570
 we directly apply a film 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.970
 on it what's pretty cool about 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.380
 their performance level share it's 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.720
 very good whether it's a simple body or 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.150
 a dual-core not as good as an iphone 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.500
 6 or a galaxy s 600 single body but 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.970
 if it starts pretty well 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.320
 in any case it turns all 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.000
 gourmet games of the moment without any 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.250
 problem if not the fact that it 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.900
 heats up because of his snapdragon 810 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.340
 and yes you have to know that it heats 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.320
 only on the upper part of 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.910
 the device is not down it can be 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.860
 a little disturbing when we play 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.080
 but personally it did not really 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.520
 to be of concern to those who ask 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.900
 the question is what this overheating 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.260
 influences the life of the 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.930
 drums 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.310
 I will probably answer you yes despite 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.990
 that these really hold the road 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.640
 for the use that I had these 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.140
 last days not counting the days of 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.850
 tests or games downloaded full 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.070
 of applications and where I was doing market 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.060
 the young benchmarks and about a day 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.760
 a day and a half 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.380
 it depends on the times in large user 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.420
 bones I had no trouble using 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.030
 luan plus turning everything on android 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.760
 lollipop 5.1.1 with its overlayer 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.210
 the oxygen 2.0.1 the device is very 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.040
 fluid 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.510
 we know where to look for things it's not 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.040
 the clutter the operating system 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.120
 is rather pretty 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.080
 the only thing that bothers me is 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.460
 really the fact that there are 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.530
 applications with different shapes 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.690
 and suddenly on the home screen its 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.820
 Ramp not very beautiful but hey it's my 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.920
 point of view finally at the level of 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.510
 features we were spoiled first 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.920
 you can activate the economy mode 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.170
 of energy when you find yourself at 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.790
 5 10% battery and to have it 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.090
 used I can assure you that you 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.200
 will save a lot of time 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.790
 finally on the locked screen you have 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.850
 access to a few gestures like double 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:16.110
 tap to awaken the screen drawn in v 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:19.070
 and you will light the flashlight made 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.070
 the same for tender 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:26.229
 3 and 1 go or 1 0 for lens and the camera 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.889
 photo quickly makes the pause sign 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.539
 to start or stop the music and 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.820
 does the superior or inferior gesture 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:37.419
 to move forward or backward in your 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.800
 music playlist to conclude this one 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.120
 more everything is really excellent for 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.900
 its price which is I remind you of 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.310
 339 euros or 399 euros he has a 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.669
 device worthy of top smartphones 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.320
 range 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.180
 a very fingerprint sensor 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.400
 reagent that works even if your 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.539
 screen is locked the battery she 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.650
 is very suitable in any case she 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.750
 is not less than a samsung 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.880
 galaxy ace 6 for example or an iphone 6 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.690
 the smartphone itself is compact 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.849
 solid 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.139
 he holds well in hand he has a back 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:04.780
 removable so you can customize 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.550
 your smartphone without worry the software 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.770
 is also very pleasant to use 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.990
 however, there is no nfc chip on 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.979
 this device no removable battery and 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.349
 as I told you just now 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:15.280
 the fact that the home button on the smartphone 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:16.750
 not clickable 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.430
 it's rather disturbing for me 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.590
 apart from that I think a 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.180
 once again one + has achieved his bet in 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.889
 offering a smartphone with a price of 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.449
 mid-range and features 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.190
 of this high-end smartphone 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:28.930
 so if you want to change 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.180
 smartphone and that your budget does not 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.030
 not authorize to offer you a 46 aces 6 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.780
 or an iphone 6 luan plus everything will be 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.870
 without a doubt 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.580
 perfect for you here is what I want 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.500

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:45.539

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.539
