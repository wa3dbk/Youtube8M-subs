one again so and it's been colored and
all<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.130> stuff<00:03:19.370> because<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.760> was<00:03:19.850> originally

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
all that stuff because it was originally

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.699 
all that stuff because it was originally
a<00:03:20.329> 27<00:03:20.989> but<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:23.450> was<00:03:23.540> just<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:23.989> thin<00:03:24.380> see<00:03:25.370> how

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
a 27 but it was just so thin see how

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.599 
a 27 but it was just so thin see how
look<00:03:27.709> at<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.870> they<00:03:30.650> did<00:03:30.889> make<00:03:31.099> it<00:03:31.310> I<00:03:31.430> mean

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
look at that and they did make it I mean

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.199 
look at that and they did make it I mean
it's<00:03:31.730> pretty<00:03:31.940> full<00:03:32.359> up<00:03:32.720> top<00:03:33.280> it's<00:03:34.280> okay<00:03:34.730> but

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
it's pretty full up top it's okay but

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.089 
it's pretty full up top it's okay but
once<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.230> get

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
once you get

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.569 
once you get
I<00:03:38.129> mean<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.060> halfway<00:03:39.359> is<00:03:39.659> like<00:03:40.170> salted<00:03:40.920> you

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
I mean like halfway is like salted you

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.989 
I mean like halfway is like salted you
could<00:03:41.790> tell<00:03:41.999> like<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.359> can<00:03:42.480> actually<00:03:42.629> see<00:03:43.999> the

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:44.999 
could tell like you can actually see the

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.619 
could tell like you can actually see the
difference<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.719> the<00:03:45.930> nodding<00:03:46.409> look<00:03:46.980> at<00:03:47.069> that

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
difference in the nodding look at that

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.550 
difference in the nodding look at that
so<00:03:48.629> I<00:03:48.659> won't<00:03:49.079> be<00:03:49.230> ordering<00:03:49.530> order<00:03:50.069> wigs<00:03:50.280> online

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
so I won't be ordering order wigs online

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.619 
so I won't be ordering order wigs online
anymore<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> think<00:03:52.950> because<00:03:53.639> that<00:03:53.819> was<00:03:54.030> one<00:03:54.510> of

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
anymore I think because that was one of

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.819 
anymore I think because that was one of
the<00:03:54.719> main<00:03:54.900> issues<00:03:55.079> I<00:03:55.439> had<00:03:55.650> with<00:03:55.680> them<00:03:56.129> was<00:03:57.829> how

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
the main issues I had with them was how

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.610 
the main issues I had with them was how
