00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
so much in that and get back down really

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.910 
so much in that and get back down really
really<00:00:38.790> hard<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.809> fact<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.469> they<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
really hard in fact here they like to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.850 
really hard in fact here they like to
call<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.129> Sierra<00:00:41.520> Sandman<00:00:42.440> they<00:00:43.440> keep<00:00:43.649> driving

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
call it Sierra Sandman they keep driving

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.020 
call it Sierra Sandman they keep driving
on<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.309> driving<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
on it and driving on it and the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.610 
on it and driving on it and the
freeze-thaw<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.780> makes<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.350> hard

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
freeze-thaw just makes it really hard

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.529 
freeze-thaw just makes it really hard
and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.070> bonds<00:00:47.340> through<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> street<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and then it bonds through the street so

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
and then it bonds through the street so
when<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> plow<00:00:49.050> drivers<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.680> down<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> street

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
when the plow drivers go down the street

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160 
when the plow drivers go down the street
and<00:00:50.460> they<00:00:50.550> try<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> plow<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.960> don't

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
and they try to plow that they don't

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.689 
and they try to plow that they don't
actually<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.710> ice<00:00:52.920> move<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.550> it's

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
actually get the ice move because it's

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
actually get the ice move because it's
bonded<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> street<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.899> basically

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
bonded to the street so basically

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.099 
bonded to the street so basically
becomes<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.640> sanding<00:00:57.000> operation<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> those

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
becomes the sanding operation and those

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.470 
becomes the sanding operation and those
few<00:00:58.350> hours<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.649> day<00:00:58.739> when<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.370> flushes<00:00:59.820> up<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
few hours a day when it flushes up and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.720 
few hours a day when it flushes up and
it<00:01:01.440> loosens<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:02.100> we're<00:01:02.250> able<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it loosens up we're able to get that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.580 
it loosens up we're able to get that
amount<00:01:03.210> off<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.780> generally<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.350> only<00:01:04.619> down

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010 

the<00:01:08.100> crews<00:01:08.399> got<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:09.060> help<00:01:09.329> on<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.780> day

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the crews got a little help on this day

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350 
the crews got a little help on this day
as<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.229> Sun<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.979> warmer<00:01:11.310> temperature<00:01:11.880> made

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
as the Sun and warmer temperature made

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.999 
as the Sun and warmer temperature made
it<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.810> easier<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.649> the<00:01:13.799> white

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
it a little easier to get the white

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.910 
it a little easier to get the white
stuff<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.579> but<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> still<00:01:15.780> takes<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.350> lot<00:01:16.619> longer

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
stuff up but it still takes a lot longer

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.219 
stuff up but it still takes a lot longer
to<00:01:17.189> clear<00:01:17.610> neighborhood<00:01:18.119> streets<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.079> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to clear neighborhood streets one of the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
to clear neighborhood streets one of the
issues<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.649> you<00:01:19.860> run<00:01:20.009> into<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
issues that you run into and the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.819 
issues that you run into and the
residential<00:01:20.970> streets<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> mile<00:01:22.649> of

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
residential streets is for a mile of

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.499 
residential streets is for a mile of
residential<00:01:23.430> street<00:01:23.729> takes<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> same

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
residential street takes about the same

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.630 
residential street takes about the same
amount<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.049> time<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.590> three<00:01:25.890> miles<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.399> four

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
amount of time as three miles or four

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.249 
amount of time as three miles or four
miles<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> priority<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:27.899> two<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.229> three

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
miles of the priority one two or three

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.529 
miles of the priority one two or three
just<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.580> amount<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.909> ice<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
just because of the amount of ice and

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.030 
just because of the amount of ice and
the<00:01:31.170> amount<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.500> obstacles<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> have

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
the amount of obstacles that you have

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.500 
the amount of obstacles that you have
so<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.460> takes<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.760> lot<00:01:33.940> longer<00:01:34.150> to<00:01:34.330> do

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
so it takes a lot longer to do

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.180 
so it takes a lot longer to do
Residential's<00:01:35.140> than<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:35.350> does<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.680> clear<00:01:35.950> a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
Residential's than it does to clear a

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.070 
Residential's than it does to clear a
wide-open<00:01:36.700> road<00:01:37.210> where<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:37.390> have<00:01:37.570> snow

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
storage there are obstacles like cars

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.080 
storage there are obstacles like cars
parked<00:01:41.290> on<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.470> street<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.490> issue<00:01:42.670> of

is our one number ones they're still
emergency<00:02:50.080> routes<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.220> get<00:02:51.370> into<00:02:51.610> those

so that's how it's going to be storm and
another<00:02:58.829> thing<00:02:59.099> is<00:02:59.310> if<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.609> does<00:02:59.819> snow<00:02:59.969> and<00:03:00.420> we

another thing is if it does snow and we

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.569 
another thing is if it does snow and we
