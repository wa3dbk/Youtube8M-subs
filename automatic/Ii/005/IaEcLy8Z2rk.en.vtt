fold-out<00:02:16.680> deck<00:02:16.950> right<00:02:17.250> here<00:02:17.430> we're<00:02:17.580> probably

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
fold-out deck right here we're probably

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.250 
fold-out deck right here we're probably
going<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> put<00:02:18.270> decking<00:02:18.570> on<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.780> sooner<00:02:19.080> than

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
going to put decking on that sooner than

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.480 
going to put decking on that sooner than
later<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.560> might<00:02:19.860> even<00:02:19.920> want<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
later I might even want to get the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.950 
later I might even want to get the
decking<00:02:20.790> down<00:02:20.910> before<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.300> put<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.540> door<00:02:21.780> in

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
decking down before we put the door in

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.940 
decking down before we put the door in
since<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.590> door<00:02:23.430> railing<00:02:23.850> will<00:02:24.000> go<00:02:24.120> over<00:02:24.240> that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
since the door railing will go over that

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.740 
since the door railing will go over that
here's<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.160> back<00:02:26.610> end<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.940> house<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.720> you

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
here's the back end of the house so you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
here's the back end of the house so you
can<00:02:28.050> see<00:02:28.410> now<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.310> take<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> close<00:02:29.730> look

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
can see now if you take a close look

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.450 
can see now if you take a close look
you'll<00:02:30.390> notice<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:32.310> spacing<00:02:33.060> here<00:02:34.460> that

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
you'll notice that the spacing here that

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.630 
you'll notice that the spacing here that
wall<00:02:36.240> on<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.570> left<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
wall on the left that you see there the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.760 
wall on the left that you see there the
top<00:02:38.940> plate<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.360> actually<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> bit<00:02:39.930> higher<00:02:40.320> than

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
top plate is actually a bit higher than

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.790 
top plate is actually a bit higher than
the<00:02:41.310> top<00:02:41.460> plate<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.000> section<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.800> that's

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
the top plate of this section and that's

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.850 
the top plate of this section and that's
not<00:02:43.890> what<00:02:44.370> happened<00:02:44.990> over<00:02:45.990> on<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.260> side<00:02:46.320> if

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
not what happened over on this side if

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.580 
not what happened over on this side if
you<00:02:46.980> take<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> look<00:02:47.430> here<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.810> top<00:02:49.050> plate<00:02:49.380> is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
you take a look here the top plate is

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.070 
you take a look here the top plate is
right<00:02:50.040> above<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:51.360> can't<00:02:51.570> actually<00:02:51.810> see

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
right above it you can't actually see

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.180 
right above it you can't actually see
that<00:02:52.170> because<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> top<00:02:52.650> plate<00:02:52.830> doesn't<00:02:52.980> come

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that because the top plate doesn't come

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.340 
that because the top plate doesn't come
all<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.460> way<00:02:53.490> over<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.030> side<00:02:54.230> anyway<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
all the way over on that side anyway the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.990 
all the way over on that side anyway the
spacing<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:55.830> off<00:02:55.950> by<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> few<00:02:56.430> inches<00:02:56.490> but<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
spacing is off by a few inches but the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.110 
spacing is off by a few inches but the
nice<00:02:57.150> thing<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.450> on<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.020> side<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.440> house

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120

studs<00:03:47.070> on<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.460> side<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.970> window<00:03:48.270> they

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
studs on the side of the window they

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.220 
studs on the side of the window they
usually<00:03:49.080> just<00:03:49.110> use<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:51.330> main<00:03:51.600> king<00:03:51.930> stud

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
is the side of the window but I decided

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.750 
is the side of the window but I decided
to<00:03:54.060> put<00:03:54.240> those<00:03:54.390> because<00:03:54.840> that's<00:03:55.800> how<00:03:56.640> it

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
to put those because that's how it

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.040 
to put those because that's how it
looked<00:03:56.910> in<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> diagram<00:03:57.420> but<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:57.720> looked<00:03:57.930> up

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
looked in the diagram but I looked up

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.750 
looked in the diagram but I looked up
online<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.340> what<00:03:59.460> I<00:03:59.490> was<00:03:59.610> talking

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
online and this is what I was talking

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.470 
online and this is what I was talking
about<00:04:00.030> how<00:04:00.300> I<00:04:00.330> have<00:04:00.630> spaced<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:02.790> two<00:04:03.030> by<00:04:03.180> fours

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
about how I have spaced to two by fours

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.720 
about how I have spaced to two by fours
just<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.110> save<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:04.650> extra<00:04:04.830> third<00:04:05.460> one<00:04:05.700> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
just to save that extra third one I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.120 
just to save that extra third one I
don't<00:04:05.970> think<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.510> really<00:04:06.780> need<00:04:06.960> that<00:04:06.990> now<00:04:07.980> on

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
don't think I really need that now on

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.220 
don't think I really need that now on
this<00:04:08.250> side<00:04:08.550> on<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:08.850> corner<00:04:09.330> you'll<00:04:09.840> notice<00:04:10.110> I

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
this side on this corner you'll notice I

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.430 
this side on this corner you'll notice I
didn't<00:04:10.530> do<00:04:10.650> two<00:04:11.460> or<00:04:11.730> three<00:04:12.000> two<00:04:12.120> by<00:04:12.270> fours<00:04:12.510> so

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
didn't do two or three two by fours so

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.810 
didn't do two or three two by fours so
this<00:04:13.680> wall<00:04:13.890> what<00:04:14.070> I'm<00:04:14.160> probably<00:04:14.340> going<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.700> do

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
this wall what I'm probably going to do

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.300 
this wall what I'm probably going to do
is<00:04:14.940> put<00:04:15.120> some<00:04:15.270> two-by-fours<00:04:15.980> sideways<00:04:16.980> like

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
is put some two-by-fours sideways like

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.849

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
this on to this one just wherever we

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.099 
this on to this one just wherever we
want<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.280> attach<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:21.060> wall<00:04:21.450> material<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:22.020> the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
want to attach the wall material in the

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:22.629 
want to attach the wall material in the
inside

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
inside

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.890 
inside
