balls<00:01:40.999> in<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.450> air<00:01:41.479> at<00:01:41.749> once<00:01:41.779> and<00:01:42.469> if<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:42.889> lose

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
balls in the air at once and if you lose

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.459 
balls in the air at once and if you lose
concentration<00:01:43.369> for<00:01:44.179> even<00:01:44.419> a<00:01:44.509> second<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
concentration for even a second the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.800 
concentration for even a second the
balls<00:01:45.709> start<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.159> drop<00:01:46.399> this<00:01:47.179> is<00:01:47.359> an<00:01:47.479> area<00:01:47.779> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
balls start to drop this is an area that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.809 
balls start to drop this is an area that
really<00:01:48.200> holds<00:01:48.560> draw<00:01:48.950> for<00:01:49.279> me<00:01:49.429> and<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:49.609> really

environment<00:01:52.069> of<00:01:52.159> production<00:01:52.909> which<00:01:53.599> was<00:01:53.810> why

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
environment of production which was why

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.469 
environment of production which was why
this<00:01:54.020> was<00:01:54.439> ultimately<00:01:54.770> suited<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.459> myself<00:01:55.849> I'm
