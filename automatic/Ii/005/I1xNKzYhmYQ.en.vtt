00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
do you get your own style I mean that's

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.639 
do you get your own style I mean that's
the<00:00:32.850> big<00:00:33.149> question<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.929> I<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.440> face

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the big question and I know that I face

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.259 
the big question and I know that I face
that<00:00:34.679> too<00:00:35.219> when<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.519> a<00:00:35.850> young<00:00:36.089> photographer

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
that too when I was a young photographer

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.989 
that too when I was a young photographer
and<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.530> found<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.789> your<00:00:38.940> own

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:38.999 
and I found that you don't get your own

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.090 
and I found that you don't get your own
style<00:00:39.449> it's<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.809> something<00:00:40.289> you<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.620> create

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
style it's not something you just create

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.709 
style it's not something you just create
or<00:00:41.339> a<00:00:41.370> decision<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.269> make<00:00:42.480> it's

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
or a decision that you make it's

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.680 
or a decision that you make it's
something<00:00:43.019> that<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.289> honed<00:00:43.820> naturally<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
something that is honed naturally and to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.590 
something that is honed naturally and to
really<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.199> your<00:00:46.499> true<00:00:46.890> own<00:00:47.249> style<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.570> have

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
really have your true own style you have

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.419 
really have your true own style you have
to<00:00:48.899> let<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.469> looking<00:00:49.769> for<00:00:49.949> it<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.219> let<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
to let go of looking for it and let it

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.340 
to let go of looking for it and let it
literally<00:00:50.820> emerge<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.749> there's<00:00:51.960> no<00:00:52.109> way<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
literally emerge and there's no way of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.809 
literally emerge and there's no way of
knowing<00:00:52.679> when<00:00:53.159> it<00:00:53.280> will<00:00:53.399> emerge<00:00:53.550> some

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:53.819 
knowing when it will emerge some

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.669 
knowing when it will emerge some
photographers<00:00:54.359> it<00:00:54.539> could<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.989> year<00:00:55.289> some

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
photographers it could be a year some

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.139 
photographers it could be a year some
could<00:00:55.859> be<00:00:55.890> four<00:00:56.219> years<00:00:56.429> some<00:00:56.850> could<00:00:56.999> be<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
could be four years some could be a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.639 
could be four years some could be a
lifetime

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.520 

well<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:00.739> oftentimes<00:01:01.070> compared<00:01:02.410> from<00:01:03.410> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
well it oftentimes compared from the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.130 
well it oftentimes compared from the
wedding<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.850> creating<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.300> feast<00:01:05.540> like<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.810> chef

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
wedding to creating a feast like a chef

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.530 
wedding to creating a feast like a chef
and<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.250> reason<00:01:07.550> being<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:08.180> really

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
and the reason being is that I really

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.560 
and the reason being is that I really
wanted<00:01:08.780> clients<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.409> understand<00:01:09.950> why<00:01:10.880> the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
wanted clients to understand why the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.960 
wanted clients to understand why the
retouching<00:01:11.930> phase<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:12.680> important<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.310> so

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
retouching phase is so important and so

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.480 
retouching phase is so important and so

but<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.240> found<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.869> there<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:48.259> no<00:01:48.530> formula

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
but what I found is there is no formula

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.790 
but what I found is there is no formula
and<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.429> every<00:01:50.390> single<00:01:50.780> image<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.289> every

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
and I every single image and every

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.219 
and I every single image and every
single<00:01:52.190> action<00:01:52.670> per<00:01:53.210> se<00:01:53.390> needs<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:54.080> be

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
single action per se needs to be

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.980 
single action per se needs to be
customized<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.250> tweaked<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.330> each<00:01:56.720> image

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
customized and tweaked and each image

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.590 
customized and tweaked and each image
calls<00:01:57.649> for<00:01:57.979> something<00:01:58.280> different<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:59.450> that's

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
calls for something different and that's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.990 
calls for something different and that's
you<00:02:00.170> know<00:02:00.259> taking<00:02:00.619> your<00:02:00.649> time<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.340> sort<00:02:01.910> of

you know taking your time and sort of

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.240 
you know taking your time and sort of

allowing the vision of the image and the

story to really come through the Wacom

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.130 
story to really come through the Wacom
tablet<00:02:10.040> drastically<00:02:11.030> reduces<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.630> time<00:02:11.959> that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
tablet drastically reduces the time that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.460 
tablet drastically reduces the time that
I'm<00:02:12.489> retouching<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.910> not<00:02:14.630> having<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.260> use<00:02:15.440> a

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
I'm retouching so not having to use a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.140 
I'm retouching so not having to use a
mouse<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:15.980> having<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> control<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
mouse and having the control and the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.690 
mouse and having the control and the
fluidity<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.720> movements<00:02:18.440> but<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.459> would<00:02:19.610> say

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
fluidity of movements but I would say

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.970 
fluidity of movements but I would say
more<00:02:19.940> than<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.269> is<00:02:20.510> control<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.709> think

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
more than that is control and I think

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.180 
more than that is control and I think
for<00:02:22.370> for<00:02:22.910> me<00:02:23.060> my<00:02:23.269> goal<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.870> always<00:02:24.350> for<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
for for me my goal is always for the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.760 
for for me my goal is always for the
image<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.430> not<00:02:25.910> look<00:02:26.180> retouched

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.350 

every<00:02:29.770> single<00:02:30.160> image<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.610> different<00:02:31.120> and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
every single image is different and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.300 
every single image is different and
every<00:02:31.900> image<00:02:32.080> calls<00:02:32.650> for<00:02:33.010> something

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
every image calls for something

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.890 
every image calls for something
different<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> lighting<00:02:34.120> change<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.540> angle

different the lighting change the angle
change<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.410> subject<00:02:35.740> change<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:36.940> really

blanket recipe for that I think one of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.350 
blanket recipe for that I think one of
my<00:02:52.330> favorite<00:02:53.140> aspects<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:54.000> retouching<00:02:55.000> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
my favorite aspects of retouching and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.000 
my favorite aspects of retouching and
sharing<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.959> images<00:02:56.260> with<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.470> client<00:02:56.890> is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
sharing the images with the client is

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.860 
sharing the images with the client is
that<00:02:57.580> when<00:02:58.180> they<00:02:58.300> see<00:02:58.360> it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
that when they see it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.400 
that when they see it
they<00:02:59.110> really<00:02:59.739> don't<00:03:00.069> see<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.700> retouching

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
they really don't see the retouching

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.630 
they really don't see the retouching
