00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.290
 by process 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.260
 this thread and here 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.260
 on the roof of the famous kind of question to 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.460
 tension can be turning vector do 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.750
 these orients yes no fee weasley the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.130
 sensor men either 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.130
 I'll try to give 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 hands on least 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.720
 With these cool neck copter twist like 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:56.500
 started over we are talking 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:56.500
 and since on rails 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.770
 tuning is to make smooth 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.030
 were by the way I have from all the poker 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.810
 I did there somehow lay it not 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.810
 attacked the cot 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.450
 not clear here reset and still or not by the way 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.920
 actually show of course vibration 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.409
 gigantic from this whole thing is necessary 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.310
 set dampers so that the vibration of the copter 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.240
 the pipe did not go away 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.329
 if it shows a given price level 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.710
 Schuman's high accelerometer is very 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.759
 high level he's probably there 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 useful constituents 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.710
 so test mouse up to 14 alarm 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.390
 pilot 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.060
 Sparta 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.719
 everything 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.780
 sit down 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.510
 bye everyone
