hi today we're going to talk about

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.039 
hi today we're going to talk about
insulin<00:00:03.500> why<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.580> insulin<00:00:05.580> called<00:00:06.089> insulin

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
insulin why is insulin called insulin

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.430 
insulin why is insulin called insulin
well<00:00:07.740> perhaps<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.550> because<00:00:08.970> insulin<00:00:09.450> brings

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
well perhaps is because insulin brings

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.430 
well perhaps is because insulin brings
the<00:00:10.740> sugar<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.610> inside<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.840> cell

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440

what do you draw first slow or fast it's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
what do you draw first slow or fast it's
this<00:01:23.640> song<00:01:24.150> slow<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:25.049> fast<00:01:27.259> now<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.710> fast

which comes first clear or cloudy now
you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.159> answer

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
you know the answer

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.740 
you know the answer
draw<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.990> clear<00:01:52.380> first<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.899> shake<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.670> no

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
draw the clear first can I shake it no

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
draw the clear first can I shake it no
can<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.869> roll<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.700> yes

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
can I roll it yes

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.120 
can I roll it yes
can<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.810> mix<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.670> yes<00:02:02.719> but<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.680> only<00:02:04.950> one

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
can I mix it yes but there is only one

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.390 
can I mix it yes but there is only one
that's<00:02:05.969> okay<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.810> mixing

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
that's okay for mixing

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.120 
that's okay for mixing
and<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:08.180> is<00:02:08.420> your<00:02:08.720> n<00:02:09.729> pH<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:11.150> pH<00:02:12.020> can<00:02:12.770> mix

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
and this is your n pH and pH can mix

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.350 
and this is your n pH and pH can mix
