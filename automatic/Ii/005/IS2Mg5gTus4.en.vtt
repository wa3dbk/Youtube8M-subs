 today i'm talking about the minuk this 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.730
 it's not a device that can be found 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.410
 in shops 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.740
 it's a device that can be found by 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.840
 amazon ip would be about 200 bucks 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.960
 the resolutions of laziness and 5000 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.810
 officer 60 years of success right now 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.840
 now by a device for 90 drac 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.300
 June 14, 2010 so has already how to buy 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.150
 this cd nostalgic a bit of the vintage of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.670
 the film allies in a small 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 box like that it's interesting side 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.149
 presentation is pretty cool when 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.250
 even to buy it like what we I 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.430
 will buy for the lot it's true 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.910
 mami li it's really in the optics of 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.010
 lake at the 1954 hole there are all 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.410
 functions the focus is done 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.530
 tattoo month in the month of less than 5 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.480
 meters put back and infinite his device 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.960
 which is still enough need for 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.670
 for the smallness of the thing I would say 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.129
 that the quality of the images is still 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.590
 interesting if we want to make an 8/10 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 but if we want to go up more than on his 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.890
 closing ribs what is a little bit tomorrow 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.760
 just in paris louvre is we can 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.110
 to choose the disou the iso and he sees 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.030
 its 200 400 the flyer of the mynock 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.090
 saint-quentin I said pretty much like 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.320
 the size of the minho xi is very thin 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.549
 it's very flat for this subject and this 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 something I did not like 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.570
 price of a cameron cameron camera 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.759
 what are you looking at midnight 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.810
 absolutely nothing is left 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.240
 how it works 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.409
 it's really too functions the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.360
 function m 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.100
 function 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 iso the function to extinguish 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.700
 the device 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.250
 it's enough scouts in one 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.560
 music but more explanations 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.840
 obviously I'm looking for a photographer 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.500
 little that I found so the people I 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.720
 am cold who try test phase 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.229
 at 6o the quality still interesting 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.549
 the 200 iso it's like I'm telling you 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.780
 can pollute what we can not know what 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.680
 who's going to decide it's less than the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.009
 version already there is a lot a lot 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.890
 more for 200 iso musicians six months 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.420
 that a month I'm not I do not know 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.930
 I guess I think that they have 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.489
 surrendered 2 which dates from ten hours but to 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.170
 too that's life the next battle blow it 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.160
 that's what it's really companion 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.680
 watch this cluster site 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.940
 that's what this seal would eat I 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.800
 advises that people who already have 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.690
 cameras that want a 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.280
 babble because that I consider that 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.850
 when I consider myself more like a 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.790
 babel like a camera to the isie then 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.319
 makes beautiful pictures the autonomy of the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.360
 pile still interesting I made 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.980
 about 400 photos for a good pub 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.880
 jumps it's the wizernes side 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.010
 suppliers left here is here 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.090
 small so that's really for the look 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.880
 but his fans 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.180
 we walk with his son chatted 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.180
