00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
lot for the guitar its first got into

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.429 
lot for the guitar its first got into
the<00:01:51.549> mix<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:51.970> now<00:01:52.060> one<00:01:52.329> of<00:01:52.840> my<00:01:53.140> favorite

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
the mix and now one of my favorite

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.499 
the mix and now one of my favorite
things<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:53.979> thumbnail<00:01:54.189> in<00:01:54.460> lace<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.970> mean

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
things is the thumbnail in lace I mean

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.240 
things is the thumbnail in lace I mean
that<00:01:55.720> doesn't<00:01:56.200> seem<00:01:56.409> like<00:01:56.590> much<00:01:56.770> but<00:01:56.829> I<00:01:57.070> think

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
that doesn't seem like much but I think

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.310 
that doesn't seem like much but I think
it's<00:01:57.369> really<00:01:57.520> cool<00:01:57.790> because<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.810> just<00:01:59.020> looks

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
it's really cool because it just looks

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.830 
it's really cool because it just looks
different<00:01:59.560> than<00:01:59.950> most<00:02:00.130> other<00:02:00.369> guitars<00:02:00.840> now

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
different than most other guitars now

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
the one big con about these guitars that

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.770 
the one big con about these guitars that
I<00:02:05.140> can<00:02:05.350> tell<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.649> is<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:07.000> intonation<00:02:07.299> I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
I can tell you is that the intonation I

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.389 
I can tell you is that the intonation I
don't<00:02:07.990> know<00:02:08.079> why<00:02:08.259> but<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.649> intonation<00:02:08.890> on<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
don't know why but the intonation on the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.390 
don't know why but the intonation on the
a<00:02:09.429> string<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.119> really<00:02:11.110> not<00:02:11.530> what<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.010> should<00:02:12.250> be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
a string is really not what it should be

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.250 
a string is really not what it should be
I<00:02:12.430> almost<00:02:12.760> bought<00:02:13.180> one<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.630> ones<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.989> was

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
intonation scorable in this I took it

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.770 
intonation scorable in this I took it
you<00:02:24.489> know<00:02:24.610> had<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.790> set<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.329> still<00:02:25.600> wasn't

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
you know had it set and it still wasn't

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.680 
you know had it set and it still wasn't
right<00:02:26.049> tried<00:02:26.739> another<00:02:26.980> one<00:02:27.239> get<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.390> one<00:02:28.510> set

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
right tried another one get that one set

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.800 
right tried another one get that one set
up<00:02:28.810> still<00:02:29.260> wasn't<00:02:29.410> right<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:31.480> may<00:02:31.690> have

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
up still wasn't right so it may have

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.710 
up still wasn't right so it may have
been<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.319> batch<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:33.010> may<00:02:33.459> be<00:02:34.330> just<00:02:34.599> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
been just that batch it may be just the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.390 
been just that batch it may be just the
design<00:02:35.170> of

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
design of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.940 
design of
guitar<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.090> once<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.450> up<00:02:36.510> about<00:02:36.950> past

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
guitar but once you get up about past

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.589 
guitar but once you get up about past
the<00:02:38.099> seventh<00:02:38.459> fret<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.819> intonation<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
the seventh fret the intonation on the a

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.789 
the seventh fret the intonation on the a
string<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:40.079> starts<00:02:40.379> getting<00:02:40.470> kind<00:02:40.769> of

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
string really starts getting kind of

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.179 
string really starts getting kind of
funky<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.939> I<00:02:42.239> don't<00:02:42.420> think<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:43.769> has<00:02:43.950> anything

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
funky and I don't think it has anything

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.619 
funky and I don't think it has anything
to<00:02:44.340> do<00:02:44.549> with<00:02:44.579> a<00:02:44.730> series<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> guitar<00:02:45.269> but<00:02:45.480> right

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
to do with a series of guitar but right

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.140 
to do with a series of guitar but right
off<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.900> shelf<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.430> borrow<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.879> guitar

guys<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.930> volume<00:02:55.260> knob<00:02:55.439> had<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> short<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.159> think

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
guys the volume knob had a short I think

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.770
