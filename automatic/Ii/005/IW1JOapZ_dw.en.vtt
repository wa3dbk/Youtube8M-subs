00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.180 
could we do we could do like a massive
redstone<00:00:40.649> contraption<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.450> cool

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
redstone contraption would that be cool

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.229 
redstone contraption would that be cool
and<00:00:44.190> maybe<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.239> could<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.600> let's<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:47.239> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this is an interesting one okay let's do

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
this is an interesting one okay let's do
a<00:01:00.690> queue<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a queue but like so so it's like a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.060 
a queue but like so so it's like a
redstone<00:01:03.750> block<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.460> big<00:01:06.240> size<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
redstone block like in a big size in the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.760 
redstone block like in a big size in the
big<00:01:08.250> fuzz<00:01:09.260> gah<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.299> should<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.770> okay

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
big fuzz gah then this should be okay

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
big fuzz gah then this should be okay
this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:14.220> idea<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.600> red

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this is my idea it's like gonna be red

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.830 
this is my idea it's like gonna be red
stone<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.530> massive<00:01:17.310> red<00:01:17.490> stone<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.630> like

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
stone but like massive red stone so like

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.240 
stone but like massive red stone so like
that's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.470> redstone<00:01:19.770> block<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:23.040> like

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that's a redstone block and I have like

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.380 
that's a redstone block and I have like
a<00:01:23.640> hen<00:01:23.970> AT&amp;T<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.780> no<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> Redstone

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
a hen AT&amp;T or no so there's the Redstone

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.140 
a hen AT&amp;T or no so there's the Redstone
dose<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> repeater

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
dose and then we can have a repeater

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.260 
dose and then we can have a repeater
what<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> repeater<00:01:31.110> look<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.579> let's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
what is a repeater look like and let's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.929 
what is a repeater look like and let's
see<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> rest<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> pizza<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.790> this

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
see a rest on the pizza we can do this

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:36.940 
see a rest on the pizza we can do this
and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950
