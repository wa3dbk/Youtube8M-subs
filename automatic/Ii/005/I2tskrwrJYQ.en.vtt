00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.259 

this<00:00:03.189> is<00:00:03.399> like<00:00:03.610> the<00:00:04.210> way<00:00:04.359> I<00:00:04.689> was<00:00:05.680> taught<00:00:05.920> first

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.430 

well<00:00:10.269> one<00:00:10.719> thing<00:00:10.990> you<00:00:11.080> might<00:00:11.200> want<00:00:11.259> to

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
well one thing you might want to

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.419 
well one thing you might want to
consider<00:00:11.679> if<00:00:11.889> you<00:00:11.980> don't<00:00:12.160> want<00:00:12.280> to<00:00:12.339> get

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
consider if you don't want to get

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.900 
consider if you don't want to get
spotters<00:00:12.969> is<00:00:13.920> look<00:00:14.920> up<00:00:15.009> the<00:00:15.129> sky<00:00:17.550> keep<00:00:18.550> doing

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
spotters is look up the sky keep doing

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.490 
spotters is look up the sky keep doing
that<00:00:19.090> because<00:00:19.630> if<00:00:19.899> you<00:00:19.989> don't<00:00:20.110> have<00:00:20.290> to<00:00:20.380> do

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
that because if you don't have to do

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.839 
that because if you don't have to do
backflip<00:00:20.860> on<00:00:20.980> trampoline<00:00:21.430> you'd<00:00:21.610> be<00:00:21.700> like

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
backflip on trampoline you'd be like

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.290 
backflip on trampoline you'd be like
this<00:00:23.040> but<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:25.090> you<00:00:25.180> do<00:00:25.329> it<00:00:25.450> be<00:00:25.660> like<00:00:25.779> that<00:00:25.860> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
this but when you do it be like that and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.479 
this but when you do it be like that and
so<00:00:28.300> like<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:30.369> look<00:00:30.579> up<00:00:30.700> at<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:30.880> sky<00:00:31.119> or<00:00:34.109> not

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so like that look up at the sky or not

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.500 
so like that look up at the sky or not
running<00:00:36.489> first<00:00:36.699> and<00:00:36.850> you<00:00:36.969> want<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.179> do<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.269> power

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
running first and you want to do a power

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.500 
running first and you want to do a power
jump<00:00:37.870> and<00:00:38.260> just<00:00:38.469> keep<00:00:38.649> doing<00:00:38.949> that<00:00:39.039> and<00:00:39.100> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
jump and just keep doing that and to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.060 
jump and just keep doing that and to
like<00:00:40.510> try<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:40.929> just<00:00:41.559> keep<00:00:41.710> going<00:00:41.739> like<00:00:42.010> this

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
like try it just keep going like this

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.939 
like try it just keep going like this
and<00:00:42.489> every<00:00:43.239> other<00:00:43.269> time<00:00:43.719> or<00:00:44.260> every<00:00:44.589> two<00:00:44.620> of

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
and every other time or every two of

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.819 
and every other time or every two of
them<00:00:45.129> try<00:00:45.940> doing<00:00:46.359> the<00:00:46.510> back<00:00:46.629> foot<00:00:46.839> bend<00:00:47.109> and

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
them try doing the back foot bend and

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.069 
them try doing the back foot bend and
then<00:00:47.949> you<00:00:48.010> can<00:00:48.190> go<00:00:48.370> neck<00:00:48.640> until<00:00:48.940> one<00:00:49.809> time

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
then you can go neck until one time

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.430 
then you can go neck until one time
don't<00:00:50.859> hide<00:00:51.100> out<00:00:51.309> from<00:00:51.429> your<00:00:51.870> legs<00:00:52.870> over<00:00:53.079> and

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.090 

hey<00:01:51.970> works<00:01:52.970> perfectly<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.810> then<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.799> just<00:01:54.920> do

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
hey works perfectly and then you just do

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.289 
hey works perfectly and then you just do
that<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.280> couple<00:01:55.369> times<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:58.119> then<00:01:59.119> you'll

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
that a couple times and then you'll

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.570 
that a couple times and then you'll
naturally<00:01:59.479> get<00:01:59.900> it<00:02:00.080> by<00:02:00.470> yourself<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.369> you

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
naturally get it by yourself and you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.370 
naturally get it by yourself and you
would<00:02:01.909> go<00:02:02.090> with<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:04.040> ah<00:02:06.610> some<00:02:07.610> things<00:02:07.850> though

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
would go with that ah some things though

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.160 
would go with that ah some things though
wait<00:02:09.380> like<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.979> weight<00:02:10.250> limit<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.840> don't<00:02:12.020> want

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
wait like a weight limit you don't want

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.620 
wait like a weight limit you don't want
to<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:18.819> like<00:02:19.819> you<00:02:20.300> don't<00:02:20.450> want<00:02:20.569> to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
to have like a like you don't want to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.140 
to have like a like you don't want to
get<00:02:21.050> something<00:02:21.260> that's<00:02:21.470> all<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.400> can't<00:02:23.030> lift

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
get something that's all I can't lift

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.330 
get something that's all I can't lift
you<00:02:23.239> up<00:02:23.330> because<00:02:23.870> if<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.170> do<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:24.500> there

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
you up because if you do that there

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.100 
you up because if you do that there
again<00:02:25.550> they<00:02:25.820> can<00:02:26.030> get<00:02:26.120> hurt<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.630> can<00:02:26.780> get<00:02:26.900> hurt

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
again they can get hurt you can get hurt

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.990 
again they can get hurt you can get hurt
and<00:02:27.230> then<00:02:27.680> you'll<00:02:28.160> probably<00:02:28.519> land<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:28.880> your

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
and then you'll probably land on your

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.670 
and then you'll probably land on your
neck<00:02:29.739> also<00:02:30.739> some<00:02:30.950> tips<00:02:31.930> don't<00:02:32.930> try<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> double

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
neck also some tips don't try a double

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.800 
neck also some tips don't try a double
backflip<00:02:34.040> until<00:02:34.340> you're<00:02:34.550> actually<00:02:34.760> ready

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.540 

backhand<00:02:38.810> spring<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.500> just<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.830> same<00:02:40.069> except

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
backhand spring is just the same except
