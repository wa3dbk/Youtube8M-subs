00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and there was a research report that

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.139 
and there was a research report that
really<00:00:46.620> looked<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> main<00:00:47.730> purpose

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
of the research report was to look at

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.729 
of the research report was to look at
ways<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:49.980> which<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.520> slow<00:00:51.300> down<00:00:51.570> or<00:00:51.899> change

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
ways in which we can slow down or change

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
ways in which we can slow down or change
the<00:00:53.520> effect<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> damaging<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> fact<00:00:54.899> that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the effect the damaging the fact that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.689 
the effect the damaging the fact that
we're<00:00:55.170> having<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.920> climate<00:00:56.309> however

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
we're having on the climate however

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.619 
we're having on the climate however
obviously<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.050> take<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> obverse<00:00:58.559> view

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
obviously if you take the obverse view

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.090 
obviously if you take the obverse view
you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> somewhat<00:01:02.010> you

that we know that the CIA attempted to

Vietnam War they tried to make it rain

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.360 
Vietnam War they tried to make it rain
so<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.350> would<00:02:25.500> rain<00:02:25.709> over<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> Ho<00:02:26.340> Chi

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
so that it would rain over the Ho Chi

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
so that it would rain over the Ho Chi
Minh<00:02:26.640> Trail<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.510> make<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.810> impossible<00:02:28.200> because

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
Minh Trail to make it impossible because

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
Minh Trail to make it impossible because
it<00:02:28.770> was<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.040> muddy<00:02:29.310> that's<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.330> think<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.690> was

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it was so muddy that's I think that was

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.930 
it was so muddy that's I think that was
a<00:02:30.840> fairly<00:02:31.170> well<00:02:31.410> established<00:02:31.440> fact<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.820> was

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
a fairly well established fact that was

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.690 
a fairly well established fact that was
a<00:02:32.970> strategy<00:02:33.209> there<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:34.320> after<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:35.490> been

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
a strategy there there after it's been

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.630 
a strategy there there after it's been
outlawed<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.660> obviously<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:38.040> feeling<00:02:38.430> is

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
outlawed but obviously the feeling is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.310 
outlawed but obviously the feeling is
that<00:02:38.670> they're<00:02:39.090> looking<00:02:39.270> heavily<00:02:39.959> into<00:02:40.230> it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
that they're looking heavily into it

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.350 
that they're looking heavily into it
they<00:02:40.410> also<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:41.370> research<00:02:41.730> report<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.209> came

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
they also this research report that came

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.780 
they also this research report that came
out<00:02:42.510> into<00:02:42.750> climate<00:02:43.440> change<00:02:43.680> was<00:02:44.069> also<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
out into climate change was also the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.110 
out into climate change was also the
main<00:02:45.569> thunder<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.860> research<00:02:47.220> report<00:02:47.640> was

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
main thunder of this research report was

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.710 
main thunder of this research report was
the<00:02:48.570> CIA<00:02:48.870> or<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.410> CIA<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.850> one<00:02:51.060> wonders<00:02:51.180> why

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the CIA or is the CIA so one wonders why

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.440 
the CIA or is the CIA so one wonders why
would<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.050> CIA<00:02:52.080> be<00:02:52.620> funding<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.220> report<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
would the CIA be funding a report and a

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.270 
would the CIA be funding a report and a
research<00:02:54.930> report<00:02:55.110> into<00:02:55.560> climate<00:02:55.860> change<00:02:56.100> if

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
research report into climate change if

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.170 
research report into climate change if
it<00:02:56.459> wasn't<00:02:56.820> for<00:02:56.850> nefarious<00:02:57.840> purposes<00:02:58.910> well<00:02:59.910> it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
it wasn't for nefarious purposes well it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.759 
it wasn't for nefarious purposes well it
seems<00:03:00.570> as<00:03:00.810> though<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:01.140> they<00:03:01.290> were<00:03:01.350> going<00:03:01.709> to

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
seems as though if they were going to

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.770 
seems as though if they were going to
dosometing<00:03:01.980> bring<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.610> nefarious<00:03:03.150> purposes

dosometing bring a nefarious purposes

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.060 
dosometing bring a nefarious purposes

they wouldn't put their name on it they

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
obviously they wanted so the argument is

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.949 
obviously they wanted so the argument is
is<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.190> they<00:03:56.310> wanted<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.760> corrupt<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.840> and

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
is that they wanted to corrupt it and

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.720 
is that they wanted to corrupt it and
use<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.530> particular<00:03:59.130> way<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.400> they<00:03:59.610> had

speeding<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.519> up<00:04:08.640> that's<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.060> start<00:04:09.390> well

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
speeding it up that's a start well

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.000 
speeding it up that's a start well
that's<00:04:10.079> really<00:04:10.350> what<00:04:10.500> they<00:04:10.620> came<00:04:10.769> up<00:04:10.829> with

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
that's really what they came up with

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.539 
that's really what they came up with
which<00:04:11.310> was<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.880> know<00:04:12.000> don't<00:04:12.450> don't<00:04:12.810> and

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
which was that you know don't don't and

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.800 
which was that you know don't don't and
reduce<00:04:14.549> carbon<00:04:14.850> emissions<00:04:15.000> was<00:04:15.420> basically

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
reduce carbon emissions was basically

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.509 
reduce carbon emissions was basically
the<00:04:16.049> upshot<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:16.590> 600<00:04:16.979> million<00:04:17.160> dollar<00:04:17.340> by

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
the upshot this 600 million dollar by

specifically believe this is already
taking<00:04:52.560> place<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.430> maybe<00:04:53.639> maybe<00:04:54.060> who<00:04:54.449> knows

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
taking place and maybe maybe who knows

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:55.790 
taking place and maybe maybe who knows
whether<00:04:54.840> they're<00:04:55.080> thinking<00:04:55.439> along<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.770> lines

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
whether they're thinking along the lines

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.969 
whether they're thinking along the lines
of<00:04:56.159> what<00:04:56.279> we're<00:04:56.789> seeing<00:04:57.000> in<00:04:57.120> these<00:04:57.210> extreme

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
of what we're seeing in these extreme

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.350 
of what we're seeing in these extreme
flows<00:04:58.979> and<00:04:59.279> ebbs<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.789> flows<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.180> weather

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
flows and ebbs and flows the weather

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.760 
flows and ebbs and flows the weather
conditions<00:05:00.870> that<00:05:01.020> we're<00:05:01.139> getting<00:05:01.229> maybe<00:05:01.500> that

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
conditions that we're getting maybe that

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.959 
conditions that we're getting maybe that
that's<00:05:02.009> where<00:05:02.219> they're<00:05:02.370> thinking<00:05:02.789> in<00:05:02.879> the

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
that's where they're thinking in the

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.939 
that's where they're thinking in the
that<00:05:03.750> perhaps<00:05:03.960> somebody<00:05:04.319> is<00:05:04.500> interfering

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
that perhaps somebody is interfering

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.830 
that perhaps somebody is interfering
with<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.159> already<00:05:05.479> unbeknownst<00:05:06.479> to<00:05:06.599> us<00:05:06.719> and

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
with it already unbeknownst to us and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.820 
with it already unbeknownst to us and
that's<00:05:06.900> probably<00:05:07.199> what<00:05:07.349> may<00:05:07.529> be<00:05:07.590> where

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
that's probably what may be where

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.839 
that's probably what may be where
they're<00:05:07.949> asking<00:05:08.069> the<00:05:08.340> question<00:05:08.669> as<00:05:08.789> to

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
they're asking the question as to

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.070 
they're asking the question as to
whether<00:05:09.060> we<00:05:09.300> would<00:05:09.449> know<00:05:09.569> about<00:05:09.719> it<00:05:09.840> whether

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
whether we would know about it whether

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.719 
whether we would know about it whether
they're<00:05:10.289> doing<00:05:10.560> yeah<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:10.919> when<00:05:11.069> the<00:05:11.159> CIA<00:05:11.340> shows

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
they're doing yeah so when the CIA shows

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.459 
they're doing yeah so when the CIA shows
something<00:05:11.939> says<00:05:12.180> excuse<00:05:12.900> me<00:05:13.050> could<00:05:13.319> you<00:05:13.379> tell

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
something says excuse me could you tell

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.050 
something says excuse me could you tell
me<00:05:13.740> if<00:05:13.860> it's<00:05:14.009> possible<00:05:14.219> to<00:05:14.580> change<00:05:14.849> the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
me if it's possible to change the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.390 
me if it's possible to change the
weather<00:05:15.259> and<00:05:16.259> then<00:05:16.830> they<00:05:16.949> come<00:05:17.099> out<00:05:17.219> with<00:05:17.370> a

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
weather and then they come out with a

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.040

they announced they were shutting down

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.820 
they announced they were shutting down
harp<00:05:30.270> in<00:05:30.449> May<00:05:30.659> of<00:05:30.689> last<00:05:30.839> year<00:05:31.139> ladies<00:05:31.680> and

here's<00:05:35.129> nothing<00:05:35.339> to<00:05:35.639> worry<00:05:35.819> about<00:05:35.909> this<00:05:36.330> I

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
here's nothing to worry about this I

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.760 
here's nothing to worry about this I
think<00:05:36.719> scientists<00:05:37.229> have<00:05:37.379> gone<00:05:37.500> on<00:05:37.650> record

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
think scientists have gone on record

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.339 
think scientists have gone on record
saying<00:05:38.279> that<00:05:38.460> harp<00:05:39.419> in<00:05:39.689> of<00:05:39.779> itself<00:05:39.870> was<00:05:40.319> a

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
saying that harp in of itself was a

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.529 
saying that harp in of itself was a
nonsense<00:05:41.069> anyway<00:05:41.310> it<00:05:41.669> couldn't<00:05:42.060> even<00:05:42.419> though

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
nonsense anyway it couldn't even though

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.899 
nonsense anyway it couldn't even though
they<00:05:42.779> could<00:05:43.050> potentially<00:05:43.740> affect<00:05:43.949> some<00:05:44.610> kind

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
they could potentially affect some kind

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.639 
they could potentially affect some kind
of<00:05:44.969> change<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.270> would<00:05:45.389> be<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.839> analogy<00:05:46.409> used

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:46.649 
of change it would be the analogy used

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:47.839 
of change it would be the analogy used
was<00:05:46.770> like<00:05:46.919> throwing<00:05:47.219> a<00:05:47.310> pebble<00:05:47.460> into<00:05:47.789> the

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
was like throwing a pebble into the

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.189 
was like throwing a pebble into the
Pacific<00:05:48.210> Ocean<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.569> really<00:05:48.839> wouldn't<00:05:49.020> make

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
Pacific Ocean it really wouldn't make

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.959 
Pacific Ocean it really wouldn't make
that<00:05:49.229> much<00:05:49.560> of<00:05:49.589> an<00:05:49.770> impact<00:05:49.979> but<00:05:50.430> now<00:05:50.639> you<00:05:50.699> have

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
that much of an impact but now you have

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:52.999 
that much of an impact but now you have
this<00:05:51.149> guy<00:05:51.389> a<00:05:51.419> credible<00:05:51.960> source<00:05:52.020> going<00:05:52.770> on

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
this guy a credible source going on

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.559 
this guy a credible source going on
record<00:05:53.219> and<00:05:53.490> saying<00:05:53.729> actually<00:05:54.149> I<00:05:54.180> think<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.539> is

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
record and saying actually I think it is

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.839 
record and saying actually I think it is
a<00:05:54.960> problem<00:05:55.560> i<00:05:55.770> think<00:05:55.979> i<00:05:56.069> am<00:05:56.279> concerned<00:05:56.729> about

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
a problem i think i am concerned about

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.730 
a problem i think i am concerned about
it<00:05:57.089> made<00:05:57.240> me<00:05:57.360> very<00:05:57.389> nervous<00:05:57.810> he<00:05:58.409> went<00:05:58.620> on<00:05:58.710> to

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
it made me very nervous he went on to

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.260 
it made me very nervous he went on to
say<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.069> following<00:05:59.219> I<00:05:59.430> think<00:05:59.639> this<00:05:59.819> research

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
say the following I think this research

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.209 
say the following I think this research
should<00:06:00.569> be<00:06:00.719> out<00:06:00.930> in<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.259> open<00:06:01.379> and<00:06:01.710> it<00:06:02.039> has<00:06:02.189> to

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
should be out in the open and it has to

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.800 
should be out in the open and it has to
be<00:06:02.430> international<00:06:03.089> so<00:06:03.210> there<00:06:03.360> won't<00:06:03.479> be<00:06:03.659> any

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
be international so there won't be any

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.450 
be international so there won't be any
question<00:06:04.199> that<00:06:04.229> this<00:06:04.409> technology<00:06:05.009> will<00:06:05.399> be

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
question that this technology will be

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.010 
question that this technology will be
used<00:06:05.580> for<00:06:05.909> hostile<00:06:06.240> purposes<00:06:06.479> now<00:06:06.870> he's<00:06:06.990> a

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
used for hostile purposes now he's a

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.320 
used for hostile purposes now he's a
credible<00:06:07.469> source<00:06:07.529> he's<00:06:07.860> not<00:06:08.039> a<00:06:08.069> kook<00:06:09.060> or

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
credible source he's not a kook or

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.999 
credible source he's not a kook or
somebody<00:06:10.020> who<00:06:10.080> with<00:06:10.259> a<00:06:10.289> tone<00:06:10.500> with<00:06:10.770> his<00:06:10.919> own

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
somebody who with a tone with his own

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.149 
somebody who with a tone with his own
agenda<00:06:11.370> or<00:06:12.120> an<00:06:12.719> ax<00:06:12.839> to<00:06:12.990> grind<00:06:13.080> and<00:06:13.560> he's<00:06:13.949> going

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
agenda or an ax to grind and he's going

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:15.619 
agenda or an ax to grind and he's going
on<00:06:14.370> record<00:06:14.520> as<00:06:14.789> saying<00:06:14.819> this<00:06:15.240> so<00:06:15.449> i<00:06:15.479> think

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629 
on record as saying this so i think

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:17.029 
on record as saying this so i think
that's<00:06:15.870> interesting<00:06:16.379> and<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:16.589> itself<00:06:16.919> but

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
that's interesting and of itself but

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.679 
that's interesting and of itself but
you're<00:06:17.279> right<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.610> be<00:06:17.699> skeptical<00:06:18.089> but<00:06:18.539> you're

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
you're right to be skeptical but you're

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.760 
you're right to be skeptical but you're
skeptical<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.229> the<00:06:19.349> skepticism<00:06:19.979> yes<00:06:20.580> exactly

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
skeptical of the skepticism yes exactly

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.629
