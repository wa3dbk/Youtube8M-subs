00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 relatively frequent new updates 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.750
 and other change of champions and even 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.820
 textures again these thousand words new move 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 apologize something more like that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.619
 you two things do not need my name is Maxim 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.570
 this show league of legends on the couch all the most 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.399
 fresh and new from the world and lola gebi 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.600
 sports you learn from us and so drove in 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.250
 update 5.2 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.129
 roar and prepared for us a whole range 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 pleasant and unpleasant surprises 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.940
 h13 champions have been changed 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.800
 perhaps we will start with the loudest and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.969
 long-awaited change babe tristan 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.120
 and and power removal of the deadly 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.070
 flame power let's goodbye we 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.570
 we will miss read and decide on 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.920
 certain considerations remove this 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.649
 subject referring to some imbalance 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.350
 the gameplay was supposedly magicians became 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.240
 Much stronger well Well magnesium is bad 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.590
 or not yet difficult to judge by how 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.979
 many have not learned to live 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.510
 an active country so he is poker 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.979
 wave your pen to the old tristan and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.200
 she started up almost to full 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.630
 unrecognizability of what is generally very 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.369
 well reflected in the course of the game for me 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.320
 300 also partially underwent 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.090
 change passive aiming skill 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.189
 now increases attack range by 7 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.619
 They are at level 9 Kushka remained the same 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.150
 except that the icon has become prettier than Yashka 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.890
 explosive projectile remember became so many times 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.049
 cooler than before even though the passive effect 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 not changed but the active effect can 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.380
 you quite pleased now 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.030
 tristana fired elegant enemy 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.189
 who can sum up increase 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990
 missile damage every attack 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.430
 against target increase damage 25 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.380
 percent and stacks up to four times 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.149
 after four it is so charge 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.250
 immediately explodes and the most interesting 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.899
 perhaps in the updated defeat of the projectile 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.159
 now you can attach the tower 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.229
 this is probably good news for 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.880
 lovers split-push the damage from the tower 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.799
 rocket jump now increases by 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.479
 25 percent for each explosive charge 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.850
 charge but the coefficient of damage from the forces and 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.869
 skills have been reduced from 80 percent to 50 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.630
 as some so to speak 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.890
 compensation ult expelling charge remained 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.690
 unchanged except maybe 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.720
 damage from strength skill that decreased a hundred 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.810
 forty percent to 100 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.520
 it's time for the rest of the beasts quickly 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 fox and reed also underwent 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.700
 significant changes korea here and 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.620
 decided to completely change the list 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.960
 recommended items for these what 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.520
 concerns skills then kitty spheres of deception with 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.740
 dea lari more quick on the line 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.090
 thanks to the new effect on the skill yet 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.770
 sphere moves speed 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.930
 movement greatly increased now 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.390
 mobility no limit also been 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.130
 improved school target search system 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.020
 of this fire its use now 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.790
 no longer invokes auto-attacks arias even 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.100
 base magical damage from a spark was 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.390
 increased ghostly jerk ult tepre 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.980
 allows ari to jump over 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.140
 more obstacles 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.030
 but how did you enjoy the good news? 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.950
 now cook sad faces because 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.959
 as yashka charm is now no longer 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 increases damage to target by 20 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.090
 percent as it was before a well good 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.500
 whether these changes or not yet too early 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.330
 to judge we can say with certainty 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.250
 what to kill or finish this creepy 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.730
 straining tail especially 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.140
 more difficult 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.030
 sad news for amateur on 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.130
 pushbutton champions and forgive dross 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.780
 you already give everybody a wave of the crescent 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.040
 now no longer activates any 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.020
 killers and also range 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.739
 use of dancing shadows changed to 800 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.780
 by 700 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.790
 but I think that even these minor 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.380
 changes will not affect the ability of a 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.450
 if you kill almost anyone before 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.980
 queries procast veteran league of legends they 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.620
 also started up with some additions 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.360
 It was feeling right now not getting 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.790
 only the most not but i'm a true defender 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.680
 fibers tibbers call earlier reminded 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.570
 something like godzilla twisting everything on 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.070
 your way 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.900
 it turns out tiber took up fitness and 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.060
 noticeably thinner which now allows him 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.860
 pass between minions form mario there 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.480
 to taste all the same small then morons 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.220
 rather than the Soviet huge Medvedev 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.350

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.420
 our channel and you get out of bronze for sure 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.420
