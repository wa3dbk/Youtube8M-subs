00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
better deliver on on camera but I mean

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.010 
better deliver on on camera but I mean
is<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.220> safe<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.790> say<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.000> maybe<00:01:36.329> oh<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.840> don't

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is it safe to say that maybe oh I don't

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.140 
is it safe to say that maybe oh I don't
know<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> puppy<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> puppy

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
know a puppy so you just get a puppy

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
know a puppy so you just get a puppy
maybe<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.500> protein<00:01:41.250> being<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
maybe that's not the the protein being a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 
maybe that's not the the protein being a
good<00:01:41.729> point<00:01:42.060> Jeff<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.540> probably<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> good

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
good point Jeff it's probably not a good

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
good point Jeff it's probably not a good
idea<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.649> bring<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.890> baby<00:01:44.040> baby<00:01:44.310> puppy<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.970> I

help with the house training so I would

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.530 
help with the house training so I would
probably<00:01:56.330> stay<00:01:56.930> away<00:01:57.110> from<00:01:57.170> baby<00:01:57.950> dogs<00:01:58.540> right

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.249 
a huge fan of dogs I love tricks right
so<00:02:07.250> can<00:02:07.700> we<00:02:07.759> teach<00:02:08.060> some<00:02:08.300> tricks<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:08.959> easy

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
so can we teach some tricks is that easy

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.470 
so can we teach some tricks is that easy
i<00:02:09.500> think<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:10.039> between<00:02:10.399> now<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.729> Friday<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.270> is

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
i think in between now and Friday it is

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.020 
i think in between now and Friday it is
perfectly<00:02:12.100> doable<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.489> teach<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.790> couple

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
perfectly doable to teach a couple

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.850 
perfectly doable to teach a couple
tricks<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.510> think<00:02:14.720> probably<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.260> standard

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
tricks and I think probably the standard

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.380 
tricks and I think probably the standard
would<00:02:16.040> be<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.400> giving<00:02:16.730> your<00:02:16.819> paw<00:02:17.000> cuz<00:02:17.239> it's
