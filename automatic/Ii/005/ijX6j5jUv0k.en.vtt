without indenting the wall panel you

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.670

where the square is touching both the
ball<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> table<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:47.700> distance<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
ball and the table the distance of this

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
ball and the table the distance of this
spot<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> diameter<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> ball<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
spot is the diameter of the ball and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.860 
spot is the diameter of the ball and
centimeters<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:51.120> measure<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.629> distance

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
centimeters now measure that distance

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720 
centimeters now measure that distance
with<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> centimeter<00:00:52.860> ruler<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.520> then

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
with a centimeter ruler and then

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180 
with a centimeter ruler and then
multiply<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> measurement<00:00:54.930> by<00:00:55.079> 3.14

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
multiply the measurement by 3.14

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.170 
multiply the measurement by 3.14
and<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> result<00:00:56.940> would<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and the result would be the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.369 
and the result would be the
circumference<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> ball<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
circumference of the ball and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.410 
circumference of the ball and
centimeters<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.760> important<00:01:00.300> to

centimeters this is important to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
centimeters this is important to
remember<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.930> use<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> fine<00:01:01.379> grater<00:01:01.649> rule<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.250> a
