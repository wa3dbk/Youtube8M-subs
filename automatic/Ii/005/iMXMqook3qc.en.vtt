00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.930
 I think that those who label me facho 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.880
 it's a facho 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.600
 because he does not like that I think 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.600
 different from him 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.600
 and I think I'm so controversial and there 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.720
 people who love me and there are people who hate me 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.540
 as a source of who faces, there is 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.830
 people who hate him and the people who love him 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.509
 people who hate him hate him deeply 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.329
 the people who love you the most 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.399
 deep is that way life can not be 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.720
 conform to the world almost sometimes 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.560
 a means of protest 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.649
 legitimate 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.640
 for me the limit is in the scratch the 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.640
 scratch I think an attitude 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.640
 nazi-fascist 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.300
 and escrachar to oyarbide me home 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.089
 it seems of terror to go to escrachar a swarthy 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.010
 I think home horror as I 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.530
 it would seem like terror to go to the house of 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.460
 macri is escracharlo or to the lady carrió 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.100
 those attitudes really go 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.519
 nazifascists 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.960
 but I'm not against absolutely 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.100
 the violence of the sky 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 I would kick 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.540
 it's because of the violent attitude by another 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.220
 He died because I think he brings 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.130
 little the president of the republic me 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.549
 it seems that you have to add not after the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.549
 2015 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.660
 I do not know, I do not think I do not think that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.160
 it seems that today at eight thirty of the 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.740
 tomorrow when I got to the radio and I 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.710
 I asked my producer that there is this 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.640
 night in situation room they did not raise 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.640
 the program did not find out 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.970
 Friday that way but I give my 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.790
 word that they did not raise it for a by 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.380
 brown or by this lady dispatcher of 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.610
 customs 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.530
 and they picked it up why 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.530
 because they are sloppy 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.799
 he notices a useless is a subject 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.299
 totally overcome is already spoken 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.680
 they admitted that it was a 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.320
 mistake do not tell me 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.090
 is totally outdated that we 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.180
 we know with those managers does 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.310
 many years with 113 and with another makes 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.640
 fifteen 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.340
 are those problems that usually happen 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.810
 I like to work with tranquility 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.990
 and stability I think that at this moment 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.850
 there is a moment you see 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.780
 the truth that things are a bit 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.000
 revolts but I am a professional 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.520
 is recent how to get to the channel is what 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.010
 same as six months ago is the same 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.709
 that five years ago when 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.810
 I do not have any problems and hopefully 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.540
 I wish I stayed 30 more years in the cinema 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.189
 I think that January 5 is going to be the channel 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.710
 of the most watched news of the country is going to 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.560
 surpass absolutely tn in a year year 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:57.550
 he gave two years I see him 50 and he has a 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.160
 really impressed potential 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.290
 Daniel Hadad did he made that channel 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.510
 the most modern news channel in the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.790
 republic argentina and cristóbal lopez and 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.220
 de souza pretend to make it bigger 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.680
 still and if I ask you for hector 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.050
 magnetto for example look 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.580
 to see I worked for the clarion diary 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.160
 not for the newspaper but for the group 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.690
 clarin six years 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.980
 I was one of the 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.980
 of the radio miter journalists 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.460
 I was very comfortable with that group what 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.030
 I would be a group 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.630
 sensational with sensational people and 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.430
 manitos a man 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.050
 how do you evaluate that they are now so 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.800
 questioned the magnetto media of 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.400
 horrible bugle and I told you that the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.890
 escraches that look terrifying and 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.570
 sexist I also thought it terrifying 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.770
 the persecution that the lady suffered 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.160
 noble herrera with the theme of her 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.310
 children and what was left 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.470
 the boys were not the son of the disappeared 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.010
 and who apologizes to the lady of 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.700
 noble 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.680
 expression appeared from terror of 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.750
 terror of terror when they shouted at 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.170
 the journalists of the bugle group itself 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.170
 return 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.510
 lopez is that you could tell me about 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.949
 I know him two years ago three years 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.500
 and a half or so before he gets 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.460
 take over the group 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.979
 and I always found a gentleman 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.150
 I think it seems to me that it is one of the 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.419
 most important entrepreneurs that has 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.210
 this country a lot of people do not know but it has 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.770
 infinity of 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.810
 of companies 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.040
 has 15,000 people in his charge 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.650
 he is one of the most businessmen 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.650
 important in the country the pass a a lord
