to say about a year of your life we

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.810 
to say about a year of your life we
started<00:00:07.259> last<00:00:07.410> July<00:00:07.859> doing<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> research

thousands of websites trying to find

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.980 
thousands of websites trying to find
what<00:00:13.440> could<00:00:13.620> argue<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.190> called<00:00:14.630> the<00:00:15.630> trophy

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
what could argue we called the trophy

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.179 
what could argue we called the trophy
water<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> particular<00:00:17.190> state<00:00:18.949> only<00:00:19.949> then

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
water for a particular state only then

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.830 
water for a particular state only then
did<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.640> plot<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> map<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.480> very<00:00:21.689> first

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
did we plot a map for the very first

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.370 
did we plot a map for the very first
time<00:00:22.519> it<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.580> 15,000<00:00:24.570> miles<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
time it was 15,000 miles and the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.259 
time it was 15,000 miles and the
question<00:00:25.560> came<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
question came how are we going to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.019 
question came how are we going to
possibly<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.550> one<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.699> first<00:00:29.910> things

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
possibly do this one of the first things

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.700 
possibly do this one of the first things
that<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.420> came<00:00:30.630> up<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:31.140> doubleheader

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that we came up with was doubleheader

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.530 
that we came up with was doubleheader
days<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> turns<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.940> there's<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> number

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
days and it turns out there's a number

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.600 
days and it turns out there's a number
of<00:00:33.719> states<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> driving<00:00:35.460> distance

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
of states where the driving distance

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340 
of states where the driving distance
between<00:00:36.180> them<00:00:36.480> would<00:00:36.660> afford<00:00:36.960> us<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.140> ability

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
between them would afford us the ability

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.220 
between them would afford us the ability
to<00:00:38.219> fish<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> morning<00:00:39.149> drive<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> short

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
to fish in the morning drive a short

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
to fish in the morning drive a short
distance<00:00:40.410> fish<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> evening<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.210> still

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
distance fish in the evening and still

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.750 
distance fish in the evening and still
only<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> short<00:00:43.530> distance<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.460> get

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
only have a short distance to go to get

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
only have a short distance to go to get
to<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> third<00:00:45.149> state<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.440> still<00:00:46.620> sleep

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to the third state so we can still sleep

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.200 
to the third state so we can still sleep
that<00:00:47.129> night<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> what's<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.110> trophy<00:00:49.469> water<00:00:50.210> well

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that night so what's a trophy water well

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.900 
that night so what's a trophy water well
for<00:00:51.360> most<00:00:51.480> people<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.020> fish<00:00:52.730> but<00:00:53.730> there's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
for most people it's fish but there's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.479 
for most people it's fish but there's
natural<00:00:54.090> beauty<00:00:54.719> there's<00:00:55.530> conservation

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
natural beauty there's conservation

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.540 
natural beauty there's conservation
there's<00:00:57.180> historical<00:00:57.600> significance<00:00:58.460> now<00:00:59.460> I'll

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
there's historical significance now I'll

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
st. Croix was one of those I think

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.040 
st. Croix was one of those I think
Hawaii<00:03:08.130> not<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:08.880> much<00:03:09.060> because<00:03:09.270> everybody
