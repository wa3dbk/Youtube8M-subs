00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello again friends ethhon ethh this is 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.040
 the tablet z study the recent tablet 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.040
 sony that is a product that according to 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.629
 they encompass the best of are and what 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.700
 does this mean that we are going to find 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.110
 many technologies that we have seen 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.120
 in other products such as sensors 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.010
 Exmor ar for cameras including 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.380
 is that technify and this one that we have 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.030
 here we also have bravia engine which is 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.650
 what we see on screens 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.590
 allows us to have one from experience 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.210
 image and a host of applications and 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.399
 integrations with the entire ecosystem of 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.810
 sony that is quite broad even for 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.160
 many of their houses are full of 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.510
 sony devices so this 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.970
 tablet can be the ideal complement 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.160
 the first thing is that if the weight surprises 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.510
 then at 495 grams but with a 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.980
 impressive distribution in what it does 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.720
 that feels so light that it may not 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.640
 do this without any problem and 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.530
 succeeding in giving his conclusion tablet van 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.170
 to see that something else is not so simple 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.510
 It has dust resistance certification 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.760
 water and impacts so good impacts 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.920
 it is perhaps the least we could 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.629
 but there we have which subidits we can 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.309
 be seeing the review on how the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.020
 We put in the water or if you take it to the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.880
 beach do not suffer doors in mt of the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.500
 sand almost all gadgets end up 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.360
 screaming the recently granites of 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.490
 sand including my phones and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.689
 things a few times so this tablet 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.090
 has a lot to offer we are going to 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.320
 show them everything you have to sandro 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.259
 it is opera with android has a screen 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.729
 10.1 inches and includes processor 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.860
 snapdragon so we have quite 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.509
 power to take advantage of it 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.070
 including high quality games that 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.770
 you can synchronize them with your control of 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.050
 playstation 3 so well yes lower 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.220
 to the review of the sevilla 7 tablet what 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.810
 first we have our letter is 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.470
 written tablet z is that we already have the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 branding xperia then contrary to what 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.210
 what happened to the two generations 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.210
 previous 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.620
 the sony tablets is already has the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.330
 name xperia also the branding already 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.430
 it is according to the whole experience 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.220
 mobile xperia is now if instead of 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.130
 all sony mobile experiences 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.040
 we have access as a product of sony 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.420
 I know with limits well limits is going to 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.740
 be in the future but social there is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.180
 it is one of the applications that come 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.410
 that integrated and that in the future 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.410
 we will also be able to have 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.019
 in the rest of the applications then 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.150
 finally we have the same thing just 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.890
 we add special link that is one of 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.230
 the news also has to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.810
 link to spirit and with products 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.129
 devices we only have application 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.959
 also like another fall that is also 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.250
 available place thorax and that even 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.469
 even if you did not have a device 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.379
 swan and you can download it and it works 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.659
 as an identifier of songs already 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.180
 speaking specifically of the hardware 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.200
 we have a 10.1 inch screen 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.340
 with a pixel density of 224 this 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.159
 is for a resolution of 1200 x 1920 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.169
 so we have this this way 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.970
 full resolution but maybe the 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.069
 most important detail is that all the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.099
 device is built to be 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.889
 scratch-resistant in case of 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.230
 screen but it can also be 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.849
 submerged in water and resist dust this 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.769
 thanks to the sealed equipment 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.230
 completely here is the slot on 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.629
 charger that is also worth much to highlight 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.489
 that the charger is a universal charger 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.599
 micro usb class b which is the same as 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.079
 we use on all devices 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.079
 android 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.680
 by special cables then if you have 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.300
 a phone with android 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.160
 you basically know half the world with 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.200
 Android phones access doors 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.770
 here we have the memory slot and 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.740
 I also work card slot 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.260
 sim the device has capacity 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.470
 also connect by connectivity 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.090
 4g to the network is going to be available with 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.890
 telcel in fact from this version the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.290
 that price will dictate telcel 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.690
 but this is like one of the things that 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.920
 we must also highlight its weight because it is 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.260
 of 495 grams 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.530
 and the screen also has another detail 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.610
 that we must emphasize that is the bravia 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.280
 engine 2 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.970
 on mobile this that will give us a better 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.010
 video experience 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.800
 we even go to this proportion brought 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.930
 of our elements 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.810
 The experience of colors is much more 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.730
 vivid it is impressive to see the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.090
 difference with the previous generation of 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.209
 he sent her the tablet that was the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.620
 last that lazio are and against is the 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.450
 anger and indignation work 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.610
 awesome colors in incredible 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.890
 the flow everything we finally have 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.050
 technology that for energy they learned 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.790
 in his leadership on screens like that of the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.320
 two screen development all this 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.230
 technology this bet is why 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.940
 I just wanted to call the best of the sun but 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.100
 It is not the only thing also depending on the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.920
 camera we have the sensor 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.170
 you can explore a mobile browser 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.670
 which allows us to take pictures in 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.730
 low light conditions and also 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.560
 improve lighting this thanks to 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.620
 its processing systems that has 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.250
 they are and in different aspects and we have 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.230
 a main camera but also 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.660
 we have a front camera there so 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.800
 here, we need a little more 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.510
 lighting is already done 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.640
 start working the exmor sensor that 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.710
 is available for both parties 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.840
 the camera we have an automatic mode 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.390
 top this is available let's say in 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.190
 the entire photographic line of the brand and 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.260
 we also have the modes of change of 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.480
 burst video you can even take 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.510
 panoramic and the important thing is that 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.150
 also how can you submerge the camera 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.100
 I say the one with the device you can record 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.840
 videos also underwater and obviously 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.180
 the resistance is not like for that 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.740
 you record extreme videos but even if 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.270
 your aesthetic was long you want to record 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.610
 nothing more or take a picture under the 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.680
 pool or tablets can do it 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.420
 Main camera offers us 8.1 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.569
 megapixels while the camera 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.129
 frontal they offer us 2.2 minus 16 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.719
 we also have the ability to record 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:53.539
 1080p video at 30 frames per second 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:56.279
 one last detail that should not stop 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.770
 consider in this type of product is 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:00.659
 which includes nfc connectivity the chip is 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.919
 find right in this area that is going 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.629
 to allow to do let's be able to 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.279
 exchange documents but also 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.919
 thanks to the new line of 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:10.589
 bravia products that he has launched are and 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.959
 they have nfc connectivity 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:15.569
 you can also simply what you do 

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:17.580
 is making a tap of your control here and 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.559
 immediately sent the signal of what you are 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.869
 watching on your tablet to your television 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:23.759
 so the nfc technology known as 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.319
 One touch for Sony is also one of 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.520
 the texts that this tablet has 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.159
 offer you and they do it as a 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.529
 distinctive element additional things 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.809
 well it has android operates with the 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:36.930
 version and the living but it also has 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:39.479
 a man planned 4.2 his processor is 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.959
 a staff drown qualcomm of 4 cores to 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:45.779
 1.5 gigahertz that your gpu is an adreno 

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:47.429
 320 and well with this gives us also the 

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:49.180
 ability to have high games 

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:50.830
 performance 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.919
 and you can live an experience 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.039
 totally study so this is the former 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.580
 via tablet z if you are interested 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:00.220
 return 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.259
 throw him there a hand before 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.360
 buy them we already gave them some 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:06.070
 points to check however is a team 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.870
 that the truth is worth it 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.970
 I would even say that it is in 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.729
 these moments the best android tablet 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.620
 of the market thanks to its weight to its 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.630
 design to its resistance and like all 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.490
 extras that they offer so 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.530
 Check the already available in Mexico 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.000
 the prices are showing up in this 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.259
 moment on the screen are also in 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.570
 the written review and in the note of 

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:28.180
 launch that we did so well without 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.520
 more we leave here with this this 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.419
 review that I am development and remember 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.419
 that they read them the central ethical
