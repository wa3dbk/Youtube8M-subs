00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:54.530 
oil than did I guess I guess I better
check<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> oil<00:02:47.299> yeah<00:02:50.090> that's<00:02:51.090> too<00:02:51.269> dirty<00:02:53.540> sexy

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
check the oil yeah that's too dirty sexy

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
check the oil yeah that's too dirty sexy
see-through<00:02:55.019> huh<00:02:55.530> well<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:56.580> we<00:02:56.640> could<00:02:56.730> stay<00:02:56.940> in

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
see-through huh well if we could stay in

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.880 
see-through huh well if we could stay in
the<00:02:57.120> ground<00:02:57.299> 65<00:02:57.930> million<00:02:58.200> years<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.709> good

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the ground 65 million years it's good

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.380 
the ground 65 million years it's good
enough<00:02:59.130> for<00:02:59.280> me<00:02:59.430> I'm<00:02:59.670> sure<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.030> been<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.269> this

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
enough for me I'm sure it's been in this

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.080 
enough for me I'm sure it's been in this
machine<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:01.079> at<00:03:01.950> least<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.340> last<00:03:02.370> 25<00:03:03.060> years

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
machine for at least the last 25 years

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.250 
machine for at least the last 25 years
or<00:03:03.450> more<00:03:03.600> since<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.140> last<00:03:04.560> changed<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:06.260> levels

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
or more since I last changed it levels

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.310 
or more since I last changed it levels
right<00:03:07.500> now<00:03:10.850> I've<00:03:11.850> just<00:03:12.150> unhooked<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.019> spark

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
right now I've just unhooked the spark

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.990 
right now I've just unhooked the spark
plug<00:03:13.530> wires<00:03:13.769> from<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.100> engine<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.549> stuck<00:03:14.820> to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
plug wires from the engine and stuck to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.300 
plug wires from the engine and stuck to
random<00:03:15.450> spark<00:03:15.780> plugs<00:03:16.019> on<00:03:16.590> each<00:03:17.250> side<00:03:19.100> just<00:03:20.100> for

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
random spark plugs on each side just for

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
random spark plugs on each side just for
a<00:03:20.370> spark<00:03:20.730> test<00:03:21.920> coils<00:03:22.920> look<00:03:23.130> intact<00:03:24.079> so<00:03:25.079> let's

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
a spark test coils look intact so let's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:38.479 
a spark test coils look intact so let's
crank<00:03:25.680> ER<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.010> see<00:03:32.090> hmm<00:03:34.250> no<00:03:35.250> luck<00:03:37.190> well<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.400> you

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
crank ER and see hmm no luck well if you

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.140 
crank ER and see hmm no luck well if you
look<00:03:38.670> inside<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.299> air<00:03:39.540> scoop<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:41.150> believe

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
look inside this air scoop I believe

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.910 
look inside this air scoop I believe
that's<00:03:42.510> where<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.780> points<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.380> condensers

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
that's where the points and condensers

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.170 
that's where the points and condensers
well<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> mean<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.579> points<00:03:44.940> are<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
well I mean the points are the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.330 
well I mean the points are the
condensers<00:03:45.660> are<00:03:45.780> at<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.959> back<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.500> I'll<00:03:47.220> have

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
condensers are at the back so I'll have

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.270 
condensers are at the back so I'll have
to<00:03:47.489> take<00:03:47.639> that<00:03:47.819> cover<00:03:48.090> off<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:49.799> air<00:03:49.920> scoop

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
to take that cover off and the air scoop

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.050 
to take that cover off and the air scoop
too<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:52.230> do<00:03:52.410> my<00:03:52.590> typical<00:03:52.950> point<00:03:53.340> sanding<00:03:53.940> and

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
too and do my typical point sanding and

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.150 
too and do my typical point sanding and
seeding<00:03:54.420> technique<00:03:54.840> that's<00:03:55.470> probably<00:03:55.769> all<00:03:56.100> it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
seeding technique that's probably all it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.129 
seeding technique that's probably all it
needs

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
needs

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.870 
needs
back<00:03:58.139> to<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.410> carbs<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:58.950> good<00:03:59.130> little<00:03:59.579> tiny

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
back to the carbs a good little tiny

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.259 
back to the carbs a good little tiny
brass<00:04:00.239> pin<00:04:03.919> jets<00:04:04.919> are<00:04:05.130> cool<00:04:05.609> we<00:04:05.729> thought<00:04:05.970> Jets

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
brass pin jets are cool we thought Jets

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.510 
brass pin jets are cool we thought Jets
queer<00:04:06.540> I'll<00:04:06.660> have<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.870> check<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.199> other<00:04:07.320> side

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
queer I'll have to check the other side

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.660 
queer I'll have to check the other side
Smith<00:04:11.810> now<00:04:12.810> one<00:04:13.110> more<00:04:13.380> check<00:04:13.740> before<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.190> try<00:04:14.610> to

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
Smith now one more check before I try to

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.410 
Smith now one more check before I try to
sand<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.120> points<00:04:16.100> I've<00:04:17.100> got<00:04:17.340> my<00:04:17.550> meter<00:04:18.150> hooked

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
sand the points I've got my meter hooked

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.130 
sand the points I've got my meter hooked
up<00:04:18.660> negative<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.739> too<00:04:19.860> negative<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.310> course

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
up negative is too negative of course

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.800 
up negative is too negative of course
and<00:04:22.140> I'll<00:04:22.560> see<00:04:22.890> with<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.460> key<00:04:23.640> on<00:04:23.850> on<00:04:24.270> position

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
and I'll see with the key on on position

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.370 
and I'll see with the key on on position
if<00:04:25.110> there's<00:04:25.760> power<00:04:26.760> at<00:04:27.330> least<00:04:27.540> positive<00:04:28.170> going

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
if there's power at least positive going

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.110 
if there's power at least positive going
to<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.590> coil<00:04:30.860> yeah<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:31.920> guess<00:04:32.160> there<00:04:32.430> is<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:32.880> it

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
to the coil yeah I guess there is so it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.970 
to the coil yeah I guess there is so it
definitely<00:04:33.570> has<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.930> be<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.200> point<00:04:34.470> sanding

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
definitely has to be a point sanding

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:42.020 
definitely has to be a point sanding
problem<00:04:36.980> well<00:04:37.980> next<00:04:38.460> step<00:04:40.670> cut<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:41.820> side

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
problem well next step cut the side

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.370 
problem well next step cut the side
cover<00:04:42.330> off<00:04:42.570> now<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.200> can<00:04:43.410> see<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.710> old<00:04:43.860> motor

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
cover off now you can see the old motor

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.750 
cover off now you can see the old motor
now<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.530> for<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:46.830> little<00:04:46.980> cover<00:04:48.860> no<00:04:49.860> comes

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
now it for that little cover no comes

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:58.900 
now it for that little cover no comes
out<00:04:50.940> no<00:04:51.120> problem<00:04:53.090> gotta<00:04:54.090> love<00:04:54.330> your<00:04:54.510> Honda's

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.270 

there<00:04:59.910> they<00:05:00.180> are

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
there they are

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.010 
there they are
the<00:05:02.280> old<00:05:02.550> fashioned<00:05:03.180> points<00:05:03.540> a<00:05:03.600> condenser

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
the old fashioned points a condenser

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.770 
the old fashioned points a condenser
system<00:05:04.670> now<00:05:05.670> I<00:05:05.700> just<00:05:05.790> got<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.240> stand<00:05:06.420> there<00:05:06.750> and

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
system now I just got to stand there and

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.740 
system now I just got to stand there and
there<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.290> check<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.980> gap<00:05:08.420> let's<00:05:09.420> give<00:05:09.630> her

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
there and check the gap let's give her

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:19.360 
there and check the gap let's give her
another<00:05:09.960> crank<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.650> see<00:05:11.570> what's<00:05:12.570> happening

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.160 

well<00:05:20.370> when<00:05:20.760> points<00:05:21.150> are<00:05:21.300> an<00:05:21.450> open<00:05:22.020> position

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
well when points are an open position

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.650 
well when points are an open position
like<00:05:23.070> on<00:05:23.280> any<00:05:23.490> engine<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.090> doesn't<00:05:24.450> use<00:05:24.630> a

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
like on any engine that doesn't use a

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.280 
like on any engine that doesn't use a
CDI<00:05:25.110> system<00:05:25.290> that<00:05:25.920> needs<00:05:26.130> a<00:05:26.250> battery<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.820> start

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
CDI system that needs a battery to start

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.870 
CDI system that needs a battery to start
you<00:05:28.290> can<00:05:28.530> jump<00:05:29.100> across<00:05:29.370> with<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.670> screwdriver

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
you can jump across with a screwdriver

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.150 
you can jump across with a screwdriver
and<00:05:30.810> see<00:05:31.020> if<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.260> get<00:05:31.440> spark<00:05:31.800> let's<00:05:31.980> see<00:05:32.070> what

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
and see if you get spark let's see what

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.690 
and see if you get spark let's see what
happens<00:05:32.610> oh<00:05:33.170> yeah<00:05:34.170> I<00:05:34.350> see<00:05:34.710> spark<00:05:35.070> look<00:05:35.400> at<00:05:35.550> that

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
happens oh yeah I see spark look at that

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.280 
happens oh yeah I see spark look at that
plug<00:05:35.970> I<00:05:38.900> hear<00:05:39.900> it<00:05:39.990> too

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
plug I hear it too

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:47.070 
plug I hear it too
let's<00:05:40.440> try<00:05:40.590> the<00:05:40.650> other<00:05:40.860> side

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.379 

yeah<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.110> can<00:05:48.470> do<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.710> snapping<00:05:49.190> so<00:05:49.490> definitely

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
yeah I can do the snapping so definitely

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.480 
yeah I can do the snapping so definitely
is<00:05:50.539> just<00:05:50.870> points<00:05:51.669> they're<00:05:52.669> dirty<00:05:54.490> best

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
is just points they're dirty best

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.059 
is just points they're dirty best
sandpaper<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:56.270> use<00:05:56.590> well<00:05:57.590> it<00:05:57.680> comes<00:05:57.860> in

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
sandpaper to use well it comes in

00:05:58.069 --> 00:05:59.710 
sandpaper to use well it comes in
different<00:05:58.099> brands<00:05:58.879> but<00:05:59.060> it's<00:05:59.240> basically

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
different brands but it's basically

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.230 
different brands but it's basically
called<00:06:00.020> silicon<00:06:00.500> carbide<00:06:00.979> it's<00:06:01.759> the<00:06:02.000> black

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
called silicon carbide it's the black

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.420 
called silicon carbide it's the black
stuff<00:06:02.599> it's<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.900> hardest<00:06:03.349> it<00:06:03.740> does<00:06:04.009> the<00:06:04.190> best

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
stuff it's the hardest it does the best

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.149 
stuff it's the hardest it does the best
job<00:06:04.669> for<00:06:04.699> sanding<00:06:05.330> points<00:06:05.770> so<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:06.830> tear<00:06:07.129> a

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
job for sanding points so you tear a

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.960 
job for sanding points so you tear a
little<00:06:07.370> strip<00:06:07.639> off<00:06:08.080> fold<00:06:09.080> it<00:06:09.289> over<00:06:09.409> so<00:06:09.770> there's

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
little strip off fold it over so there's

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.610 
little strip off fold it over so there's
bristly<00:06:10.970> side<00:06:11.180> on<00:06:11.389> both<00:06:11.569> sides<00:06:11.900> shove<00:06:12.379> it<00:06:12.530> into

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
bristly side on both sides shove it into

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.999 
bristly side on both sides shove it into
points<00:06:13.009> and<00:06:13.159> stand<00:06:13.400> back<00:06:13.580> and<00:06:13.759> forth<00:06:14.030> like<00:06:14.870> so

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:18.009 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.680 

and<00:06:19.009> just<00:06:19.039> open<00:06:19.669> them<00:06:19.759> up<00:06:19.880> a<00:06:19.970> little<00:06:20.150> bit<00:06:20.330> shove

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
and just open them up a little bit shove

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.480 
and just open them up a little bit shove
it<00:06:20.840> in<00:06:20.960> and<00:06:21.169> start<00:06:21.500> sanding<00:06:21.740> you<00:06:22.190> may<00:06:22.340> even

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
it in and start sanding you may even

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.309 
it in and start sanding you may even
want<00:06:22.639> to<00:06:22.849> rotate<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.449> engine<00:06:23.780> so<00:06:23.930> they<00:06:24.110> come

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
want to rotate the engine so they come

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.320 
want to rotate the engine so they come
closed<00:06:24.710> and<00:06:25.009> pinch<00:06:25.280> your<00:06:25.370> sandpaper<00:06:25.759> harder

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
closed and pinch your sandpaper harder

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.749 
closed and pinch your sandpaper harder
and<00:06:26.840> just<00:06:27.050> keep<00:06:27.199> working<00:06:27.680> it<00:06:27.770> like<00:06:27.979> that<00:06:28.460> and

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
and just keep working it like that and

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:36.640 
and just keep working it like that and
straight<00:06:29.060> back<00:06:29.300> and<00:06:29.479> forth<00:06:34.870> never<00:06:35.870> touch<00:06:36.380> the

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
straight back and forth never touch the

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.040 
straight back and forth never touch the
part<00:06:36.889> of<00:06:36.949> the<00:06:37.039> sandpaper<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:37.699> makes<00:06:38.060> contact

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
part of the sandpaper that makes contact

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:50.680 
part of the sandpaper that makes contact
with<00:06:39.229> the<00:06:39.380> points<00:06:42.219> now<00:06:43.219> the<00:06:43.340> other<00:06:43.610> side<00:06:49.690> now

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
with the points now the other side now

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.809 
with the points now the other side now
time<00:06:51.020> to<00:06:51.050> give<00:06:51.319> them<00:06:51.409> a<00:06:51.560> blow<00:06:51.800> while<00:06:52.639> they're

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
time to give them a blow while they're

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:57.100 
time to give them a blow while they're
an<00:06:52.940> open<00:06:53.180> position<00:06:53.300> Oh

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.469 

compressor<00:06:57.740> turned<00:06:57.919> on<00:06:58.069> then<00:06:58.699> you<00:06:58.880> rotate<00:06:59.270> the

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
compressor turned on then you rotate the

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.240 
compressor turned on then you rotate the
engine<00:06:59.630> until<00:07:00.020> they're<00:07:00.169> in<00:07:00.289> closed<00:07:00.620> position

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
engine until they're in closed position

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.180 
engine until they're in closed position
and<00:07:01.569> you<00:07:02.650> grab<00:07:03.650> the<00:07:04.009> points<00:07:04.400> arm<00:07:04.610> and<00:07:06.190> it

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
and you grab the points arm and it

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.890 
and you grab the points arm and it
always<00:07:07.430> moves<00:07:07.819> back<00:07:08.090> and<00:07:08.300> forth<00:07:08.539> a<00:07:08.630> little<00:07:08.659> bit

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
always moves back and forth a little bit

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.719 
always moves back and forth a little bit
pretty<00:07:09.229> much<00:07:09.409> in<00:07:09.560> any<00:07:09.680> engine<00:07:10.190> and<00:07:10.370> you<00:07:10.580> move

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:10.729 
pretty much in any engine and you move

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.219 
pretty much in any engine and you move
it<00:07:10.880> back<00:07:10.909> and<00:07:11.180> forth<00:07:11.270> while<00:07:11.719> pushing<00:07:12.050> the

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
it back and forth while pushing the

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:14.499 
it back and forth while pushing the
points<00:07:12.620> even<00:07:12.800> more<00:07:13.009> close<00:07:13.279> and<00:07:13.580> you<00:07:14.029> rub<00:07:14.300> them

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.509 
points even more close and you rub them

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:18.490 
points even more close and you rub them
together<00:07:14.719> so<00:07:15.229> it<00:07:15.289> makes<00:07:15.380> a<00:07:15.680> good<00:07:15.949> contact<00:07:17.500> now

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
together so it makes a good contact now

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.940 
together so it makes a good contact now
I<00:07:18.529> get<00:07:18.770> a<00:07:18.800> rotate<00:07:19.190> that<00:07:19.340> side

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.830 

it's<00:07:23.950> closed

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
it's closed

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.150 
it's closed
rub<00:07:25.840> them<00:07:28.230> don't<00:07:29.230> be<00:07:29.350> moving<00:07:29.530> less<00:07:29.919> than<00:07:30.100> a

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 
rub them don't be moving less than a

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.280 
rub them don't be moving less than a
millimeter<00:07:30.580> but<00:07:30.850> they<00:07:31.300> can<00:07:31.480> feel<00:07:31.780> the<00:07:31.960> texture

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.290 
millimeter but they can feel the texture

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.080 
millimeter but they can feel the texture
now<00:07:33.130> I<00:07:33.310> can<00:07:33.460> see<00:07:33.610> if<00:07:33.700> it<00:07:33.790> sparks<00:07:35.880> mmm<00:07:36.940> that

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
now I can see if it sparks mmm that

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.190 
now I can see if it sparks mmm that
one's<00:07:37.270> making<00:07:37.450> contact<00:07:37.990> I<00:07:38.080> see<00:07:38.260> the<00:07:38.380> sparks

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.200 
one's making contact I see the sparks

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.730 
one's making contact I see the sparks
hear<00:07:41.200> them<00:07:41.320> too

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740 
hear them too

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.520 
hear them too
you<00:07:42.160> can<00:07:42.280> hear<00:07:42.460> the<00:07:42.580> sparkplug<00:07:43.000> jumping<00:07:43.530> try

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
you can hear the sparkplug jumping try

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.090 
you can hear the sparkplug jumping try
the<00:07:44.590> other<00:07:44.800> side

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.100 
the other side

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:51.330 
the other side
I<00:07:47.430> think<00:07:48.430> that's<00:07:48.639> closed<00:07:49.560> let's<00:07:50.560> see<00:07:51.160> if<00:07:51.250> it

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:51.340 
I think that's closed let's see if it

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:57.240 
I think that's closed let's see if it
sparks<00:07:52.290> whoo<00:07:54.750> that's<00:07:55.750> working<00:07:56.200> good<00:07:56.500> I<00:07:56.800> think

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.250 
sparks whoo that's working good I think

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.710 
sparks whoo that's working good I think
she's<00:07:57.400> ready<00:07:57.550> to<00:07:57.730> fire<00:07:57.940> up<00:07:58.030> as<00:07:58.390> soon<00:07:58.510> as<00:07:58.600> I

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 
she's ready to fire up as soon as I

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.460 
she's ready to fire up as soon as I
clean<00:07:58.930> that<00:07:58.960> ball<00:07:59.350> out<00:07:59.460> add<00:08:00.460> some<00:08:00.790> gas<00:08:01.470> so

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:02.470 
clean that ball out add some gas so

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.280 
clean that ball out add some gas so
final<00:08:02.919> test<00:08:03.220> turn<00:08:03.460> the<00:08:03.640> key<00:08:03.820> on<00:08:04.140> crank<00:08:05.140> the

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.290 
final test turn the key on crank the

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:13.830 
final test turn the key on crank the
engine<00:08:05.620> and<00:08:05.740> check<00:08:05.860> for<00:08:05.919> spark<00:08:09.990> huh<00:08:10.990> oh<00:08:12.810> yeah

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 
engine and check for spark huh oh yeah

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.560 
engine and check for spark huh oh yeah
there's<00:08:14.140> spark
