 his regulation from time to time there is a runner who will be treated 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.789
 until the last moment because he was hurt and every time it will be 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.389

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.300
 on these on thibault exposure by its excesses in the 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.720
 in order to let you know a little bit about our association 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.550
 we have the back to the goal of restoring places of life and motorcycles and cars 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.410
 and that's why we're a little expo bridge to make us 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.140
 know daniel stifle for cyclos motorbikes so it could be 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.130
 especially it's patrick it will be very complicated 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.420
 while the rating was ranked 7th and brian eno type missed 1929 this is a 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.210
 time model

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.300
 who replace the models between whoever happens to you 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.099
 the analogy with her the tank between all the doors 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.520
