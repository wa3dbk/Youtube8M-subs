 minus 107 pounds in training 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.890
 that you could witness the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.730
 last Thursday in our program 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.559
 He impressed very much the beloved Panterite 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.360
 usual that we had to stop the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.670
 training because I was about to 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.159
 knock out the sparring 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.580
 Ursúa is a boxer who practically 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.790
 his great chance of victory is based 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.070
 in his strong punch as of 25 or 27 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.530
 wins has 22 fights won by 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.600
 knockout while hilario zapata his 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.090
 skill is in his fencing in his boxing 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.280
 in his debug boxing that is a man 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.950
 that knows how to deal with very situations 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.130
 difficult 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.950
 and that also connects at a certain moment 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.170
 with regular solidity we would say 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.909
 perhaps very frequently and produces 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.030
 the 9th cases that so far have 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.259
 hilario zapata in his professional career 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.770
 We are definitely going to see the classic 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.030
 fight of a fajador before a stylist 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.360
 action of the first assault they have not 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.969
 taken from study we are looking at the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.439
 euro panterita rise fail hit and 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.439
 we are seeing the world champion 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.070
 maybe a little risky before a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.470
 Boxer as a punch 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.220
 extraordinarily strong as is the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.810
 case of beloved panterita ursúa the only 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.160
 possibility that we should give Ursúa 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.319
 is that a team is produced 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.450
 won by knockout hilario zapata has 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.430
 all the resources to be able to prevail 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.230
 by either way 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.379
 good to get there I have left the first 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.879
 assault to find the fight is what he said if 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.879
 I was not looking Ursua I'll find I 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.500
 little desperate maybe the style of 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.360
 that lack in this first round 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.480
 both presented conditions 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.250
 extraordinary physics is dominating 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.250
 the goddess so that this first assault 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.750
 very confident the area 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.790
 and this is the kind of fight that we 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.900
 we imagine that it interests you so that 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.900
 I look shoe 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.150
 good in this first assault be 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.000
 exchanged the papers we have we are 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.650
 seeing an aggressive shoe and a 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.810
 challenger retreating 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.370
 interesting first assault and clear the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.909
 domain to the moment of the Panamanian 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.909
 hilario zapata 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.560
 it should take about two to three inches 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.250
 of scope and several of apat well ended 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.250
 the first assault 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.500
 good with penthouses friends the days the 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.140
 second regulation to start 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.760
 this second assault of the extraordinary 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.620
 fight that must hold hilario it 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.260
 sets world champion against his 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.330
 aspiring ursúa from mexico the first 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.930
 assault like this seen by all of you 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.520
 it was a practically regular domain of 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.100
 shoes that always came on the offensive 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.690
 we are in the second round and it seems to be 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.330
 that the world champion will follow the 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.090
 same fight tactics went to the bottom 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.220
 he hit a lot and he changed blow with his 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.220
 enemy panterita ursúa 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.930
 the humberto officers asked for 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.860
 panama jorge alberto méndez from nicaragua 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.860
 and josemaría 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.759
 of anxiety in mexico 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.110
 the world champion always wearing his 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.060
 green trousers its opposite pants 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.880
 purple with yellow stripes 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.880
 there is a fell shoe you are telling him 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.680
 345 and the account is not fine 678 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.360
 protection fell shoe tremendous 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.820
 right hook and he sent it to the canvas 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.280
 in a delayed way it surprised him 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.320
 panterita and has to recover 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.419
 quickly the world champion if 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.419
 I want to hold it as it says pipe 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.730
 do not 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.080
 there is no fall 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.020
 tremendous left of hilario zapata already 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.600
 recovered he was given tarps he attacks and he 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.030
 he recovered and he also had the Mexican 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.800
 in the fight is going to put the rodrigo 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.360
 I do not understand the hooks down the 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.390
 paw right now panteritas 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.310
 expresses much to the left and fails with 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.950
 the right 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.590
 the zapata area tested the canvas for the first 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.440
 possible time in his career as 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.840
 world champion 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.270
 previous only showed that he has power 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.729
 in his fists and boy sitting there 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:39.349
 receiving punishment by uploading songs 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.349
 I feel at this moment 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.599
 the referee works violently 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.740
 bolter panterita and connects that part 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:51.380
 bad shoe is wrong shoe is wrong 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.000
 he received another powerful right from 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.000
 hit is dangerous for hot shoe 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.470
 the fight in the middle of the parquet 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.680
 boy has a tremendous right and 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.080
 there is a shoe completely folding 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.350
 to his opponent the referee calls them the 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.350
 Attention 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.139
 immediately in size with the hook of 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.820
 left shoe hilario zapata is 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:22.120
 as enraged and fell 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.930
 I can already queue 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.930
 5 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:32.360
 7-8 9-10 and the fight is over it's over 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.360
 first direct friends Juan Carlos 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.330
 we had also said it in the first 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.540
 assault that hilario zapata was 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.480
 risking himself a lot in this fight he is 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.820
 a stylist and it's not a fader and that 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.280
 it was what made hilario zapata 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.650
 lost the world championship and what 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.380
 painful of all this is that he has lost 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.200
 to a man who does not know much that 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.910
 all he has to win is a one 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.100
 right hand very strong and a left 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.650
 very strong we had said that it radiated 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.170
 zapata was risking a long time ago 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.010
 we took a first assault where it seemed 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.010
 zapata the challenger 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.280
 the world champion this shows a 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.840
 time more than someone has cheated on that 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.070
 departure said that you are a fajador and that 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.440
 He is a blocker when he has won 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:23.340
 all your fights in most of your 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.340
 fight for decision
