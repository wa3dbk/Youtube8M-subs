sort of blocks i'll use stone then we'll
need<00:00:55.399> normal<00:00:56.399> piston<00:00:58.489> we<00:00:59.489> will<00:00:59.789> need<00:01:02.870> um

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
need normal piston we will need um

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.270 
need normal piston we will need um
redstone<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.979> repeaters<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:11.720> button

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
redstone and repeaters and a button

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.640 
redstone and repeaters and a button
pretty<00:01:14.280> sure<00:01:14.520> that's<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.939> I'll<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:16.020> laid<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:35.260 
forget so first we'll need to put make
six<00:01:21.900> Pistons<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.830> upwards<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:33.439> that

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
six Pistons going upwards like this that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.179 
six Pistons going upwards like this that
then<00:01:36.270> right<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.810> front<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> piston<00:01:37.890> bleep

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
then right in front of this piston bleep

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:55.330 
then right in front of this piston bleep
up<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:50.490> I'll<00:01:50.810> pissing<00:01:51.810> down

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
okay now just put an escalator now you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.120 
okay now just put an escalator now you
need<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:06.770> create<00:02:07.770> a

need to do is create a
I<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.330> six<00:02:10.840> right<00:02:11.710> like<00:02:12.340> six<00:02:12.640> long

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.580 

and<00:02:22.469> now<00:02:24.049> so<00:02:25.049> put<00:02:25.409> Pistons<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.879> think

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
and now so put Pistons in for think

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:45.679 
and now so put Pistons in for think
repeaters<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.540> five<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:44.040> now<00:02:44.510> for<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
repeaters so in five and now for the

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.989 
repeaters so in five and now for the
first<00:02:46.230> row<00:02:47.569> three<00:02:48.569> clicks<00:02:49.489> talk<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.669> the<00:02:50.760> last

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:50.999 
first row three clicks talk to the last

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:57.440 
first row three clicks talk to the last
click<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:52.129> every<00:02:53.129> row<00:02:54.889> you<00:02:55.889> make<00:02:56.159> it<00:02:56.450> one

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
click and then every row you make it one

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.500 
click and then every row you make it one
more<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:59.010> last<00:02:59.250> clip<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.169> last<00:03:01.439> row

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
more of the last clip so the last row

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.409 
more of the last clip so the last row

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
should have all of the Peters on the

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:14.740 
should have all of the Peters on the
last<00:03:06.659> click<00:03:10.310> now<00:03:11.310> put<00:03:12.109> redstone<00:03:13.109> going<00:03:13.769> down

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
last click now put redstone going down

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.159 
last click now put redstone going down
now<00:03:15.750> what<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.109> need<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.379> do<00:03:17.329> is<00:03:19.519> put<00:03:20.519> the
