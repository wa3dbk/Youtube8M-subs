00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.480

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.580
 fines or any other type of noynoy 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.679

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.390

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.860
 for hazelnuts as for souls 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.870
 have the time soaking those 12 hours 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.060
 so wanted to put all night 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.140
 that's all day like you at caen 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.649

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.270

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.820
 other types of nuts it's between two and 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.320
 eight o'clock so after you adapt 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.180
 I prefer thirty and a little bit 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.000
 longer than not enough you do 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.879
 soak the others tomorrow 8am and so the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.789
 less used for sackhoff recipe 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.949
 g of hazelnuts that I already put in 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.050
 shake and I'm going to use 500 liters 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.640
 water for equipment and 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.430
 ingredients you will need a 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.130
 blender of a salad bowl with a rampage 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.530
 50 g hazelnuts 500 milliliters of water 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.950
 a rehydrate date and vanilla in 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.540
 powder 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.460
 once you have put your hazel 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.259
 shivered for 12 hours so you 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.630
 have missed a little colorful do not forget 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.579
 to rinse your nuts even if 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.960
 they are organic so there you just have 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.100
 empty and the other in page and launch it a 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.200
 sir little story that water is 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.899
 clear then for the recipe it's 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.820
 really very simple just put 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.409
 all the ingredients in the blender and 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.000
 2000 is long enough for that 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:43.299
 make a preparation in the running 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 so we put the 50 g of hazelnuts 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.280
 date of kerning and hydrate it 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:02.350
 the 500 liters of water and vanilla in 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.350
 powder 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.560
 it remains more than mixing everything 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.560
 until before a preparation to nice 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.600
 so that's pretty much what we get 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.120
 there for now we see all 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.560
 small pieces of hazelnut in it so 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.240
 there we will just spend the preparation 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.610
 in the rampage had to be able to get 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.610
 a drink that is all smooth 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.220
 alas as for the judge I'm just 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.220
 to press to keep only the liquid 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.150
 so that's the result at holding so 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.740
 half a liter of hazelnut milk 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.330
 I'm going to enjoy it right now 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.720
 in front of you to tell you what I 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.310
 thought 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.890
 already we have a good smell of 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:27.510
 hazelnuts it was great that's 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.620
 really it's really very woody without 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.880
 seems to me that the taste of hazelnut 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.440
 unlike milk that you can buy 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.810
 at a trade that are a little bit 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:40.410
 thicker I find pretty slow the super 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:42.210
 round really I love especially I 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.820
 almost forgot to tell you do not hesitate 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.950
 not to keep the pulp as gets to the 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.800
 end there so these dramas not much 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.540
 for 50 g of hazelnuts but hey that's 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.550
 that for in 2006 did a rite you 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.870
 twice'll necessarily but 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.980
 if you do it regularly 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.320
 can keep it and geoffrey says if 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.300
 before long a video to show you what 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.910
 we can do with 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.460
 with the pulp of oleaginous 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.460
 use to make milk so that's it 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.870
 for their hazelnut milk recipes 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.470
 I like to go back to milk to taste 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.660
 tomorrow morning with my granola we have 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.270
 invite you to make this recipe and 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.950
 to identify and also on facebook 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.720
 or on instagram if you want to realize 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.759
 it will be nice to see you doing 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.380
 also my recipes we could do 7 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:33.380
 this recipe with as I wanted to say 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.729
 the beginning of video all kinds of nuts 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.530
 you can also mix yourself 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.110
 can make half hazelnuts or half 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.020
 not far from that can be nice too my 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.580
 pre do your imagination 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.370
 it's a recipe that can be used 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.050
 as well for the cereals milk of 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.050
 breakfast only for any other 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.759
 sweet preparation based students that 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.020
 it's nutty it's a guy has a 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.550
 little bit sweet 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.590
 if you do not put dassa wants to do a 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.509
 little bit our so after to really 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.530
 use in various ways really 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.389
 make you happy 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.979
 vegetable milk is really a very 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.750
 very good alternative to cow's milk 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.320
 which is really very very bad for 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.870
 the health 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.400
 and personally or me I prefer 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.380
 largely plant milks 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.520
 I really hope this video has you 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.780
 more than 6 km 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.910
 do not hesitate to put a little thumb 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.220
