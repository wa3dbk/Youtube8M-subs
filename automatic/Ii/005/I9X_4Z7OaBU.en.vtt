00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.420
 You already know me I'm jorge jiménez and 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.210
 dotcom personal development and in this 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.200
 video article we are going to talk about a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 a book that should be absolutely 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.350
 all the houses and they should 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.510
 have all the people of equal the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.270
 age or profession or at the time of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.750
 your life where you are 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.820
 what is that book the code of deterioration 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.070
 the code of the money that has worked for me 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.550
 there is a bit of raimon samsó 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.090
 reynosa is not a writer 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.790
 of Catalonia and it could be called the 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.420
 robert kiyosaki spanish as mentioned 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.510
 in the article and although this comparative 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.460
 Well, it's not entirely correct because its 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.920
 styles do not look alike but good both 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.620
 of financial freedom to speak 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.250
 financial intelligence that yes for me 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.019
 raimon samsó without a doubt is although 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.120
 they are different to me personally I 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:06.490
 I like it more, it seems to me that it is much more 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.990
 current that is more practical and the jump 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.289
 obviously the cultural leap that there is 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.240
 a writer can be the national who is 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.360
 much closer their way of thinking 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.090
 one jackie, it shows 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.090
 this book is composed of two parts this 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.820
 is the first part that works on 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.760
 the beliefs that we have associated with 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.650
 money and to work and then already the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.200
 second part begins to prepare us already 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.270
 give practical advice to go jumping 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.700
 of employed employees to 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.200
 entrepreneur and captain of our own 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.300
 life because in this book because remonda 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.150
 He proposes that we take the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.009
 reins of our financial health and 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.750
 being then he became the owners of 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.240
 our own business and entrepreneurs 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.050
 Well, because the rules of the game 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.630
 they have changed the jobs are the 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.450
 graphics are in extinction that has been 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.280
 a thing a few years back comes a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.470
 time of free projects 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.600
 collaborations of having your own 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.080
 business because we're not going to have 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.800
 retirement people under 40 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.630
 40 years old in Spain they are sorry and 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.459
 I guess I already knew it I only knew 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.400
 subconsciously but the state does not give 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.520
 for more the 'ponzi scheme' the scam 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.430
 pyramid of social security does not give 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.810
 for more it is unsustainable and only if 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.660
 we started to own our own 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.330
 business and over to undertake in business 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.830
 with heart 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.450
 to do projects that really do 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.920
 fill the illusions and be things that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.960
 practically in our daily life 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.930
 we would have made it free to turn them into 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.280
 business models because it is possible to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.810
 that is what this book invites us to do and 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.540
 honestly this is one of the books 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.970
 that I recommend to all my friends 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.950
 in the process of going on increasing your 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.870
 financial intelligence and also a 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.640
 problem a lot to the people of the world of 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.460
 coaching although he always puts a 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.500
 little bit of cane in some things 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.420
 it seems it's brutal because if you're 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.060
 helping people for example 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.440
 do executive coaching process or 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.920
 corporate coaching 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.960
 and there are beliefs associated with money and 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.440
 the jobs that you have to go too 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.790
 modifying postu you're the first 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.370
 person who should have these 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.370
 knowledge so to be able to make some 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.460
 more effective processes and thus help 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.380
 your coaches so do not cut yourself of 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.110
 truth every book is full of pearls 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:48.150
 of wisdom is to open it by any 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.340
 side and it 's very direct and it does not cut a 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.920
 hair does not have hairs on the tongue and the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.340
 book sincerely to everyone who 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.340
 I left it 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.000

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.010
 recommend veil I'm a 'crack' and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.420
 almost everyone starts to see more things 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.730
 raymond because he sincerely hooks you 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.070
 on the page I have a couple of videos 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.859
 interviews the reds of raimon 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.580
 look for them in the video section the 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.980
 financial freedom you will find them and

 do not cut you get what 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.800
 and finally one devotes a chapter 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.270
 whole although the chapters are 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.260
 short chapters that talk about themes 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.820
 practical and does not unwind dedicated to a 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.370
 chapter of multilevel marketing as 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.870
 entrepreneurial form and he calls it 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.850
 as a great business school and 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.680
 bar drinks and the action of that process 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.420
 from employee to entrepreneur so you do not 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.830
 cortes acquires the book if you do not know what 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.590
 is multilevel marketing I have mind 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.290
