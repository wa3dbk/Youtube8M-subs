00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
updated opinion on it I thought it was a

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.860 
updated opinion on it I thought it was a
mixed<00:02:41.680> bag<00:02:41.860> personally<00:02:42.610> not<00:02:43.030> really<00:02:43.420> good<00:02:43.629> but

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
mixed bag personally not really good but

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.089 
mixed bag personally not really good but
I<00:02:44.110> didn't<00:02:44.680> think<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.829> was<00:02:44.980> absolutely

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
I didn't think it was absolutely

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.849 
I didn't think it was absolutely
atrocious<00:02:45.670> or<00:02:46.209> anything<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.959> if<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.590> hate<00:02:47.829> it

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
atrocious or anything and if you hate it

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.220 
atrocious or anything and if you hate it
I<00:02:48.099> completely<00:02:48.280> understand<00:02:49.000> why<00:02:49.060> if<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:50.049> liked

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
I completely understand why if you liked

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.420 
I completely understand why if you liked
it<00:02:50.410> or<00:02:50.500> maybe<00:02:50.650> even<00:02:50.769> loved<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.280> that's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
it or maybe even loved it that's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.910 
it or maybe even loved it that's
completely<00:02:51.879> fine<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.930> understand<00:02:53.319> why<00:02:53.500> but

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
completely fine I can understand why but

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.240 
completely fine I can understand why but
me<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.329> didn't<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:56.230> hit<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.129> right

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
me it just didn't really hit the right

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.559 
me it just didn't really hit the right
notes<00:02:57.519> if<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.700> know<00:02:57.879> what<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.030> mean<00:02:58.150> but<00:02:58.299> all

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
notes if you know what I mean but all

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.270 
notes if you know what I mean but all
that<00:02:58.840> aside<00:02:59.079> I<00:02:59.140> thought<00:02:59.470> Henry<00:02:59.739> Cavill<00:03:00.129> made<00:03:00.250> a

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
that aside I thought Henry Cavill made a

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.250 
that aside I thought Henry Cavill made a
pretty<00:03:00.489> good<00:03:00.609> Superman<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.480> some<00:03:02.109> of<00:03:02.200> the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
pretty good Superman and some of the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.110 
pretty good Superman and some of the
score<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.739> pretty<00:03:02.950> good<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:03.489> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
score was pretty good and the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.330 
score was pretty good and the
cinematography<00:03:04.840> well<00:03:05.019> I'll<00:03:05.829> address<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.250> at

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.949 
cinematography well I'll address it at
some<00:03:06.519> point<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:06.940> future<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.659> I<00:03:07.720> still

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
some point in the future but I still

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.420
