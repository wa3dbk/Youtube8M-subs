yeah<00:02:44.070> at<00:02:44.190> first<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.670> was<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:45.030> surprised<00:02:45.510> by

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
yeah at first I was really surprised by

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.210 
yeah at first I was really surprised by
this<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.990> was<00:02:46.110> kind<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.380> bummed<00:02:46.590> especially<00:02:47.040> for

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
this I was kind of bummed especially for

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.140 
this I was kind of bummed especially for
theater<00:02:47.490> mode<00:02:47.610> because<00:02:47.760> that's<00:02:48.000> been<00:02:48.120> a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
theater mode because that's been a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.240 
theater mode because that's been a
staple<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.750> call<00:02:48.960> duty<00:02:49.140> for<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> while<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.920> it's

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
staple of call duty for a while and it's

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.370 
staple of call duty for a while and it's
been<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.640> cool<00:02:50.970> mode<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> Tino's<00:02:52.200> save

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
been a really cool mode to a Tino's save

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.630 
been a really cool mode to a Tino's save
your<00:02:52.500> game<00:02:52.620> plays<00:02:52.890> or<00:02:53.040> go<00:02:53.130> back<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.490> break

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
your game plays or go back and break

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.070 
your game plays or go back and break
them<00:02:53.760> down<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.120> do<00:02:54.210> interactive<00:02:54.660> series<00:02:54.930> and

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
them down and do interactive series and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.270 
them down and do interactive series and
things<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:56.010> more<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.220> thought

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
things like that but the more I thought

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.790 
things like that but the more I thought
about<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.940> more<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.870> kind<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.260> makes<00:02:58.500> sense

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
about it the more it kind of makes sense

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.950 
about it the more it kind of makes sense
like<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.130> really<00:02:59.310> not<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.700> big<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.750> deal

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
like it's really not that big of a deal

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.110 
like it's really not that big of a deal
it's<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.350> as<00:03:01.470> bad<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.950> seems<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.610> if

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it's not as bad as it seems it is so if

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.400 
it's not as bad as it seems it is so if
you<00:03:03.270> think<00:03:03.300> about<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.020> mean<00:03:04.050> there's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
you think about it I mean there's

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.380 
you think about it I mean there's
there's<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:05.190> as<00:03:05.400> much<00:03:05.550> of<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.790> need<00:03:06.060> for

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
there's really not as much of a need for

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.760 
there's really not as much of a need for
any<00:03:06.600> more<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.020> purpose<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.500> theater

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
any more you know the purpose of theater

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.170 
any more you know the purpose of theater

was to be able to save your game plays

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.670 
was to be able to save your game plays
if<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.420> didn't<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> capture<00:03:10.260> card<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.650> you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
if you didn't have a capture card so you

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.560 
if you didn't have a capture card so you
can<00:03:10.860> go<00:03:10.950> back<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.310> look<00:03:11.820> at<00:03:12.030> them<00:03:12.150> later<00:03:12.180> or

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
can go back and look at them later or

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.180 
can go back and look at them later or
record<00:03:12.960> them<00:03:13.050> later<00:03:13.200> anything<00:03:13.650> like<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.800> and

record them later anything like that and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.890 
record them later anything like that and
because<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.030> year<00:03:15.300> we're<00:03:15.480> making<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
because this year we're making the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.260 
because this year we're making the
switch<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.170> next<00:03:16.620> gen<00:03:16.650> consoles<00:03:17.400> they<00:03:18.000> both

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
switch to next gen consoles they both

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.970 
switch to next gen consoles they both
have<00:03:18.540> built-in<00:03:19.020> capture<00:03:19.470> card<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.890> can

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
have built-in capture card so you can

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.860 
have built-in capture card so you can
already<00:03:20.250> record<00:03:20.700> your<00:03:20.850> gameplay<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.480> then

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
already record your gameplay and then

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.690 
already record your gameplay and then

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
also they both have a live streaming

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.940 
also they both have a live streaming
feature<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:25.350> live<00:03:25.500> stream<00:03:25.740> straight

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
feature so you can live stream straight

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.260 
feature so you can live stream straight
from<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.130> console<00:03:26.490> there's<00:03:26.640> no<00:03:26.790> reason<00:03:27.240> to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
from the console there's no reason to

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.910 
from the console there's no reason to
have<00:03:27.450> an<00:03:27.600> in-game<00:03:27.990> live<00:03:28.350> streaming<00:03:28.710> feature

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
have an in-game live streaming feature

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.740 
have an in-game live streaming feature
built-in<00:03:29.490> you<00:03:29.700> know<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:30.000> black<00:03:30.120> ops<00:03:30.390> 2<00:03:30.600> did

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
built-in you know like black ops 2 did

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.620 
built-in you know like black ops 2 did
so<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.230> know<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.190> reason<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:33.240> not<00:03:33.480> as

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
so I know for that reason it's not as

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.480 
so I know for that reason it's not as
much<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.960> a<00:03:34.110> necessity<00:03:34.260> as<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.010> anymore<00:03:35.250> and

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
much of a necessity as it is anymore and

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.580 
much of a necessity as it is anymore and
then<00:03:35.580> also<00:03:35.790> there<00:03:36.720> are<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.870> lot<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.080> people<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.470> a

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
then also there are a lot of people in a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.470 
then also there are a lot of people in a
lot<00:03:37.710> of<00:03:37.740> rumors<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.550> theater<00:03:38.940> mode<00:03:39.120> had

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
lot of rumors that theater mode had

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.360 
lot of rumors that theater mode had
something<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.350> do<00:03:40.500> with<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.770> connectivity

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
something to do with the connectivity

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.580 
something to do with the connectivity
issues<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.760> know<00:03:41.910> it's<00:03:42.270> partially<00:03:42.780> why<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
issues you know it's partially why you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.840 
issues you know it's partially why you
know<00:03:43.890> sometimes<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.340> get<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.460> bad<00:03:44.580> connection

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
know sometimes you get a bad connection

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.160 
know sometimes you get a bad connection
or<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.240> doesn't<00:03:45.390> seem<00:03:45.600> like<00:03:45.630> your<00:03:45.810> shots<00:03:45.990> on

target or things like that because it's

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.470 
target or things like that because it's
got<00:03:47.460> this<00:03:47.610> thing<00:03:47.820> in<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> game<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.240> trying<00:03:48.420> to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
got this thing in the game is trying to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.150 
got this thing in the game is trying to

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
and it just you know a mess with

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.480 
and it just you know a mess with
everything<00:03:52.770> that<00:03:52.890> was<00:03:52.980> going<00:03:53.130> on<00:03:53.310> in

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
everything that was going on in

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.210 
everything that was going on in
multiplayer<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.450> know<00:03:54.720> if<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:55.320> gone<00:03:55.560> then

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
multiplayer so I know if it's gone then

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.620 
multiplayer so I know if it's gone then
maybe<00:03:56.400> we'll<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:56.760> better<00:03:56.820> connections<00:03:57.450> and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
maybe we'll have better connections and

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.450 
maybe we'll have better connections and
there<00:03:57.750> will<00:03:57.840> be<00:03:57.960> less<00:03:58.200> lag<00:03:58.530> compensation<00:03:59.130> and

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
there will be less lag compensation and

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.830 
there will be less lag compensation and
you<00:03:59.700> know<00:03:59.820> all<00:04:00.000> kinds<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.360> things<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.690> that
