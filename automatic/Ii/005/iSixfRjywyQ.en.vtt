00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.650
 hello to all it's meglio% today the new small exit 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.169
 we are on monday march 15th at jett travolta so i take this opportunity 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.640
 % this is the terrain in question where I'm going I was looking for 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.149
 % and then here I want to stay here for about two hours a little bit more 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.419
 a little over two hours 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.010
 and for having already anticipated it maybe a little too much singing or 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.950
 hunger 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.210
 I think I can find here you go 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 I'm going to change I tell you right now 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.840
 % 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.740
 after a few is that mother's holes which he has as usual the 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.950
 first currency 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.950
 we have here she is here 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.900
 so we try to see what happens 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.900
 on the other hand, the mullahs are so close where they are in a state 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.730
 are not beautiful what 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.770
 for alan wake only 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.770
 a nice little soap what 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.280
 when I miss 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 the earth that you have trouble starting 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.000
 This program 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.740
 go on we continue to malajube make a lead object so I think it's 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.380
 a ball 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 I think it's safe but 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.220
 in any case I have never seen anything like that 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.430
 okay so we continue so the goal is to find the global child at my 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.259
 it's not a bullet because I just found it three kilometers away 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.320
 distance 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.420
 another object in my opinion on rdc it is true that the following 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 here in my opinion this file should be like that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 two meters away 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.420
 lead for me 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.370
 so go on for what 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.949
 you can help yourself 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.139
 alex geijo then continues in this hole 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.819
 Peerless 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.059
 and a currency 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.019
 she is 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.479
 starting at a mode 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.479
 I loved 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.219
 a nice currency 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.959
 for cindy tax cent 1 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.399
 the capabilities of the lift the detector for this product 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.059
 Why 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.649
 although go on we continue 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.679
 good voila I have a currency to the road our currency 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.129
 on the other hand a bizarre shape on the steps g 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.779
 project jouault for a crown 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.599
 with inscriptions 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.569
 here I think I can not tell you more because we're not worth it 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.919
 much 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.919
 in my opinion he is not very young this anger 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.659
 at the same time I find 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.139
 we continue 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.189
 this time however the hole for a new currency 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.679
 the North 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.959
 we are ashamed 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.959
 it's 1 5 cents to Pau 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.089
 we see the colors 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.699
 you see a little relief 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.159
 go on continue 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.159
 so I still notice a currency 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.659
 yeah 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.639
 it's an aluminum piece 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.819
 some French francs 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.439
 1943 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.000
 for me when the agreement the land is bought 2 of brown spots the art in 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.419
 general and money money he kind of great there 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.419
 they are in a catastrophic state 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.669
 with what we continue so here I stopped chatting meadows 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.069
 pursuing in the dead woods 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.069
 so I do not see how one could find a club that I love 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.349
 well me 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.349
 for identification I count on you 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.569
 go on we continue fighting new object 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.779
 duration 1 hour 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.779
 a piece of a key 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.909
 in other words the dde the mechanical clocks 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.710
 we had the trains 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.710
 which is very very long 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.180
 we continue we go again the object 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.180
 this is a very small loop 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.569
 in my opinion it's not all that m 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:30.549
 go we'll continue again
