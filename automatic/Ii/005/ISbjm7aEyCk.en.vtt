shows<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.760> zero<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.600> random<00:00:43.200> through

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
shows like zero which is random through

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.360 
shows like zero which is random through
I<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.829> ten<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:45.180> my<00:00:45.450> money<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.370> barrel

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

roll<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.300> great<00:00:48.570> because<00:00:48.809> what<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
roll like this is great because what it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.260 
roll like this is great because what it
does<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.620> throws<00:00:49.890> light<00:00:50.129> everywhere<00:00:50.820> we're

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
does is throws light everywhere we're

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
does is throws light everywhere we're
just<00:00:51.449> kind<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.660> switching<00:00:52.079> through<00:00:52.289> random

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
just kind of switching through random

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
just kind of switching through random
gobos<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.550> now<00:00:53.850> let<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.390> whatever<00:00:54.600> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
gobos right now let it do whatever it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
gobos right now let it do whatever it
does<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.039> they're<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.430> bright

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
does as you can see they're very bright

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.029 
does as you can see they're very bright
and<00:00:56.910> sharp<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.930> only<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.230> twelve<00:00:58.500> about<00:00:58.680> LED

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and sharp it's only a twelve about LED

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
and sharp it's only a twelve about LED
12<00:00:59.670> watts<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.660> these<00:01:00.899> days

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
12 watts it's a lot these days

12 watts it's a lot these days
look<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.100> those<00:01:02.219> gobos<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> light

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
look at those gobos so let's do a light

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
look at those gobos so let's do a light
