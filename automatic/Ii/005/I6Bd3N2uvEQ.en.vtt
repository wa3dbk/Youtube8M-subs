00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.640
 very good to all I am kings and I bring you 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:08.820
 a guide to how to jump with fit and 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.880
 which is another in champion as they arrive 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 can jump walls but in this case it's 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.460
 quite complicated with him since as 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.150
 do not be in the correct position 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.150
 you stay in the wall 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.670
 the objects that I am using are not the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.460
 recommended I have 1 stubborn that 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.070
 does not go with fit for example I think that 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.520
 can you jump 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.370
 ok this monkey can jump but 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.110
 you have to be right perpendicular 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.750
 because if you do not stay there still 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.410
 then those in red do not find altar 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.680
 for a change they are that white in red 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.320
 as seen this evil then the male is 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.380
 can jump you see but if you do not 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.810
 well you will stay here 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.460
 then you have to right next to and 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.200
 jump because if you do not stay like 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.020
 you have to see 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.860
 well then there is a small difference 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.780
 with the demolition that for example live if 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.720
 is right here at the tip if you can 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.670
 jump but no fit 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.770
 in this case what happens is 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.479
 who is too fat and can not jump 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.740
 but the side as 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.360
 shows now after I made the blue 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.360
 be ' can be seen 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.070
 we jump perfectly then this wall 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.509
 that I remember you can not jump but 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.429
 just in case we are going to try 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.109
 you can not jump like you see the 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.890
 monkey can be skipped 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.890
 instantly 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.140
 to recover a little mana that this 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.770
 consume too much then this wall is 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.979
 the same 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.490
 then this wall as you can see can be 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.020
 jump smoothly after that of 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.890
 dragon and baron can be skipped 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.210
 likewise it is this way and you do like this 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.170
 now well then the ourense to jump 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.790
 perfectly 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.790
 without any problem d 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.450
 that anything is not too fat 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.160
 nothing happens 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.790
 then 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.330
 this wall in the river can be skipped 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.170
 also then you can jump this is 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.120
 this small area here here that you 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.150
 comes in handy to escape with these in 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.360
 tribes then 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.700
 here in wolves can jump but you have 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.180
 to be quite on the edge because if not 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.859
 you also stand 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.260
 what happens with fit that is not 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.409
 as with edging a softer jump this 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.109
 it's smaller and how you neglect a 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.969
 little then you stay in the place that I 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.310
 you are going to me as navas right next you see 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.319
 it's not like above what happens not to see you 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.180
 you stand because it's a 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.580
 location to which you jump 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.680
 I have a beige range 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.800
 then I also trust what you can do 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.210
 is imaginaos you approach here just and 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.490
 then with the second boat you can 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.440
 skip 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.880
 but it is difficult so I recommend it 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.819
 is to jump with the first one here 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.650
 and steels 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.359
 and then that 's pretty much what 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.040
 you have to do, there's not much more 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.799
 mystery the only thing 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.769
 it is quite difficult to jump the walls if 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:32.459
 are not these thin that is thinner 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.540
 those of bahrain and dragon these 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.240
 they are here 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.000
 the goal 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.300
 good our school 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.680
 and you see it can jump so that was what 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.109
 I did not leave before and this wall 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.790
 this world is also the finest and 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.760
 then there are some who are fatter 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.159
 you already have more problems but that 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.719
 this for example is fatter has more 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.969
 problems but this you do well 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.770
 directly and jump you can go 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.990
 quite far away and there is no problem 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.210
 for I hope that this video will also 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.040
 is as useful as the river that you 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.740
 like to use fish is a character that is 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.350
 pretty good it has a lot of damage 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.200
 and that if you liked it back like 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.850
 favorites and if not here you can 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.470
 share it with your friends and if
