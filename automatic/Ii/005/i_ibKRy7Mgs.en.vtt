00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.570
 or people project your mind in this 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.760
 new episode let's make a gun 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.180
 of compressed air very easy to do in 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.180
 home 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.800
 ah 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.809
 ah 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.170
 and as we see the materials are very 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.780
 few a syringe of 10 milliliters or more 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.370
 big if we have a bigger one a lot 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.430
 better because at higher speeds they go to 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.110
 shoot out the projectiles a 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.770
 plastic tube about 11 centimeters 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.770
 long 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.300
 to 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.590
 with an inside diameter of 6 millimeters 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.960
 what is the diameter of the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.730
 projectiles that I'm going to use that are 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.780
 these little balls that fire the 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.780
 toy guns 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.770
 the tube I took it out of a spray 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.540
 but another thing that they can also use 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.540
 it's a straw 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.990
 you also have to keep in mind that it is 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.980
 what we use can be coupled to the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.980
 exit of the syringe 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.320
 and to avoid losses we will use 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.320
 Scotch tape 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.490
 ah 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.490
 Hello 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.970
 to load it is much easier still 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.340
 we take out the plunger a little and put a 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.110
 little ball in the tube we push it with a 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.569
 stick or with the help of any other 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.990
 thing and we would have it ready for 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.990
 shoot 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.830
 and good friends this has been all for the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.780
 today I hope you liked it 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.209
 later we are going to do a project 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.879
 much more powerful and I will be 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.879
 publishing right here until next time 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.459
 ah
