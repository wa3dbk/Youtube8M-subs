one<00:01:55.940> thing<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:56.210> really<00:01:56.420> like<00:01:56.720> about<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.409> the

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
one thing I really like about it is the

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.770 
one thing I really like about it is the
fact<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.220> steering's<00:01:58.700> manages<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.390> be<00:01:59.509> fairly

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
fact the steering's manages to be fairly

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.109 
fact the steering's manages to be fairly
subtle<00:02:00.140> it's<00:02:00.679> not<00:02:00.890> very<00:02:01.069> heavy<00:02:01.340> but<00:02:01.700> it's

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
subtle it's not very heavy but it's

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.149 
subtle it's not very heavy but it's
quite<00:02:02.299> accurate<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.289> lot<00:02:03.530> quicker<00:02:03.799> than<00:02:04.039> i

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
quite accurate it's a lot quicker than i

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.740 
quite accurate it's a lot quicker than i
expected<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.819> be<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.330> does<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.509> great

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
expected it to be and it does a great

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.109 
expected it to be and it does a great
job<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:06.080> allowing<00:02:06.679> me<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.130> make<00:02:07.369> corrections

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
job of allowing me to make corrections

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.150 
job of allowing me to make corrections
mid-corner<00:02:08.959> that<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.530> really<00:02:09.950> wouldn't

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
mid-corner that you really wouldn't

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.470 
mid-corner that you really wouldn't
think<00:02:10.340> would<00:02:10.429> be<00:02:10.550> possible<00:02:10.970> with<00:02:11.120> something

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
think would be possible with something

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.020 
think would be possible with something
sort<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.379> this<00:02:12.530> massive<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:13.580> brakes<00:02:13.849> are

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
sort of this massive the brakes are

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.640 
sort of this massive the brakes are
really<00:02:14.420> impressive<00:02:14.750> for<00:02:15.200> something<00:02:15.500> that's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
really impressive for something that's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.890 
really impressive for something that's
heavy<00:02:15.800> that's<00:02:16.640> one<00:02:16.879> factor<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.750> know

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
heavy that's one factor that you know

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.090 
heavy that's one factor that you know
when<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.260> know<00:02:18.379> that<00:02:18.590> if<00:02:18.680> we're

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
when you know that if we're

when you know that if we're
track<00:02:19.850> even<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> couple<00:02:20.780> laps<00:02:21.050> we're

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
track even for a couple laps we're

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.340

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
obviously not doing long stance gives

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.550 
obviously not doing long stance gives
you<00:02:24.560> an<00:02:24.860> extra<00:02:25.460> amount<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:26.410> assurance<00:02:27.410> that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
you an extra amount of assurance that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
you're going to have something that

the<00:02:43.430> Rubicon<00:02:43.790> Trail<00:02:44.290> probably<00:02:45.290> not<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:45.920> it's

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
the Rubicon Trail probably not but it's

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.800 
the Rubicon Trail probably not but it's
an<00:02:46.160> impressive<00:02:46.430> thing<00:02:46.730> technologically<00:02:47.630> and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
an impressive thing technologically and

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.540 
an impressive thing technologically and
I<00:02:48.020> think<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:48.410> something<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.950> Land<00:02:49.430> Rover
