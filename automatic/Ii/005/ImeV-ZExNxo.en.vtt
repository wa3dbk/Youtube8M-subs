 an important mission to take care of livestock 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.420
 of his family this boy from Kenya had to 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.610
 grazing goats sheep and cows in the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.679
 savannah that surrounds nairobi next to a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.440
 national park where herds of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.270
 lions and the boy hated them because 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.730
 the felines attacked their animals 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.230
 helpless in the early morning touré tried 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 to keep predators away from 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.900
 different ways he lit fires for 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.970
 scare them placed a scarecrow but 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.880
 the clever leonés always discovered the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.469
 ruse and they continued their hunt then 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.510
 one night he realized that his 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.790
 enemies were fleeing the farms when 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.290
 They spotted a human with a flashlight 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 the teenager reflected during 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.000
 weeks on how to take advantage of this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.039
 discovery finally wit a 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 system of flashing lights starting 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.969
 of LED bulbs powered by a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.129
 solar panel and an old battery 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.890
 automobile that emitted flashes of light 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.989
 intermittent lyon lights de touré 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 they achieved what no trap or hunter 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.430
 had managed to keep away until that day 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.799
 the lions of cattle and people 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.409
 and even if the boy had not 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.810
 proposed his invention would also save 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.789
 forward the life of not few beasts in 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.560
 just a decade the population of lions 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.869
 in that African country has fallen 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.450
 dramatically from 15,000 to around 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.909
 2000 the hostile relations with the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.429
 human settlements justify in large 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.439
 measure that decline the news about the 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.599
 invention ran through the neighborhood of 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.280
 remove hella south of nairobi and more 

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.920

 officer the young man had not attended 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.119
 never electronics or engineering courses 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.270
 I did it by myself nobody taught me 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.670
 I just discovered it already said touré to the cnn 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 I had to take care of my cows 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 father and make sure they were 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.539
 sure he pointed out to him there was no other 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.819

 fascinated by his ingenuity and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.920
 natural intelligence as I had designed 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.630
 your light system when the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.220
 presenter asked where he had 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.110
 learned electronic 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.150
 touré replied I think this 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.490
 knowledge comes from god because nobody 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.800
 he taught me he did not have books changed and others 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.690
 experts helped touré to get a 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.910
 scholarship to study in the brow cause 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.760
 international school one of the best 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.740
 teaching centers of kenya something unique 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.370
 of richard is that if you propose a 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.840
 problem 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.570
 will work until you find a 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.210
 solution declared the specialist to cnn 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.760
 he does not give up does not consider that 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.800
 things are too difficult not 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.840
 He is afraid of being unable to solve something and 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.600
 I think that's why he's a good innovator 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.580
 aimed the maximum aspiration of touré is 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.340
 become a pilot and engineer 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.780
 aeronautics his precocious talent presages 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.820
 a bright future for this 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.040
 teenager who already realized the dream of 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.220
 many in their Maasai people beat the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.220
 lions
