hey guys coming to you from out front
here<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.870> I<00:00:03.870> thought<00:00:04.740> I'd<00:00:04.890> show<00:00:05.069> you<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.190> little

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
here and I thought I'd show you a little

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.430 
here and I thought I'd show you a little
closer<00:00:05.700> look<00:00:06.060> at<00:00:06.330> one<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> my<00:00:06.960> cigar<00:00:07.259> box

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
closer look at one of my cigar box

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.009 
closer look at one of my cigar box
guitars<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.580> kind<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.179> did<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> video<00:00:09.599> before<00:00:09.750> and

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
guitars I kind of did a video before and

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.470 
guitars I kind of did a video before and
showed<00:00:10.410> all<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.620> them<00:00:10.889> at<00:00:10.980> once<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.330> thought

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
showed all of them at once but I thought

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.940 
showed all of them at once but I thought
we'd<00:00:12.660> take<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> little<00:00:13.080> more<00:00:13.200> in-depth<00:00:13.559> look<00:00:13.769> at

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
we'd take a little more in-depth look at

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.760 
we'd take a little more in-depth look at
one<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.599> show<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.020> made<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.560> kind

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
one and show you how it's made that kind

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.040 
one and show you how it's made that kind
of<00:00:16.830> stuff<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:18.150> brought<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.480> outside<00:00:18.600> so

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
of stuff and I brought it outside so

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.120 
of stuff and I brought it outside so
maybe<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> lighting<00:00:19.650> would<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> little

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
maybe the lighting would be a little

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.960 
maybe the lighting would be a little
better<00:00:20.250> hopefully<00:00:21.170> but<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.760> my

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
better hopefully but and this is my

you some of the features here as you can
see<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.300> tail<00:00:33.540> piece<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
see this tail piece here this is

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.160 
see this tail piece here this is
actually<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.649> kitchen<00:00:35.040> cabinet<00:00:35.250> hinge<00:00:36.170> and

actually a kitchen cabinet hinge and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.869 
actually a kitchen cabinet hinge and
then<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.829> know<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.160> bolted<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.670> there

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
then you know it's just bolted on there

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.770 
then you know it's just bolted on there
as<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> tail<00:00:39.480> piece<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.780> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
as like a tail piece and then the you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.979 
as like a tail piece and then the you
know<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.930> drilled<00:00:43.260> four<00:00:43.559> holes<00:00:43.800> back<00:00:44.070> here

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
know I drilled four holes back here

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.880 
know I drilled four holes back here
equidistant<00:00:45.989> holes<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.590> could<00:00:46.710> put

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
equidistant holes so that we could put

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
equidistant holes so that we could put
the<00:00:47.039> strings<00:00:47.640> through<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.149> everything

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the strings through there and everything

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
the strings through there and everything
and<00:00:49.500> make<00:00:49.800> sure<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.010> were<00:00:50.070> nice<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.280> smooth

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and make sure they were nice and smooth

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.010 
and make sure they were nice and smooth
and<00:00:50.820> Aaron<00:00:51.120> actually<00:00:51.210> wouldn't<00:00:51.660> cut<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and Aaron actually wouldn't cut the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.319 
and Aaron actually wouldn't cut the
strings<00:00:53.719> this<00:00:54.719> part<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:56.329> trunk

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
strings this part back here is a trunk

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
strings this part back here is a trunk
handle<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.440> off<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> big<00:00:59.010> like

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
handle you know off of a big like

handle you know off of a big like
steamer<00:00:59.550> trunk<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.170> took<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> handle

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
steamer trunk and I just took the handle

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
steamer trunk and I just took the handle
portion<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:02.190> took<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> plate<00:01:03.270> flipped<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
portion out took the plate flipped it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
portion out took the plate flipped it
over<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:04.799> put<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.100> threaded<00:01:05.430> rod<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
over and then put this threaded rod in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.560 
over and then put this threaded rod in
there<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.420> use<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.890> bridge<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
there and use that as a bridge and it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.590 
there and use that as a bridge and it
works<00:01:09.720> pretty<00:01:09.960> well<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.250> look<00:01:11.600> hope

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
works pretty well and if you look hope

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.660 
works pretty well and if you look hope
you<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:14.640> of

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you can see I just you know I kind of

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
you can see I just you know I kind of
use<00:01:14.790> what's<00:01:15.000> around<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.630> put<00:01:15.869> some<00:01:15.900> spacers

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
use what's around and I put some spacers

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.850 
use what's around and I put some spacers
in<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.070> these<00:01:18.000> screws<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
in there and these screws and then you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340 
in there and these screws and then you
can<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.150> swap<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.689> shim<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.290> up

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
can you know swap them out shim it up

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.130 
can you know swap them out shim it up
and<00:01:22.530> down<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> set<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> bridge

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and down so that you can set the bridge

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
and down so that you can set the bridge
height<00:01:25.409> exactly<00:01:25.890> how<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.729> your

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
height exactly how you want it so your

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.819 
height exactly how you want it so your
action<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.350> height<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
action is just the right height and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.780 
action is just the right height and
everything<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:31.100> humbucker<00:01:32.100> pickup<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.640> is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
everything the humbucker pickup here is

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.740 
everything the humbucker pickup here is
like<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.170> fender<00:01:34.170> style<00:01:34.500> humbucker<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.750> just

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
like a fender style humbucker and just

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.080 
like a fender style humbucker and just
like<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.020> any<00:01:37.140> guitar<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:38.070> screw<00:01:38.520> underneath

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
like on any guitar this screw underneath

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
like on any guitar this screw underneath
this<00:01:39.360> plate<00:01:39.630> there's<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> spring<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
this plate there's a spring on that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
this plate there's a spring on that
screw<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.659> goes<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> bottom<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
screw and that goes to the bottom of the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.560 
screw and that goes to the bottom of the
pickup<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.549> turn<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.970> screw<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.420> and

pickup so you can turn this screw in and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.929 
pickup so you can turn this screw in and
out<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.590> raise<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:47.009> lower<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.399> position<00:01:47.820> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
out to raise or lower the position of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.450 
out to raise or lower the position of
the<00:01:48.000> humbucker<00:01:48.509> there<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.220> thing

eyeball<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.949> and<00:03:41.340> get<00:03:42.329> them<00:03:42.419> very<00:03:42.690> nice<00:03:42.959> and

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
eyeball it and get them very nice and

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.699 
eyeball it and get them very nice and

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
and and you can see how well plays by

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.679 
and and you can see how well plays by

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
stuff and you can see that it's fully

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.929 
stuff and you can see that it's fully
functioning<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.230> those<00:03:53.920> frets<00:03:54.220> do<00:03:54.370> just<00:03:54.670> fine

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
functioning and those frets do just fine

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.610 
in this light you can still see a little
line<00:04:06.970> there<00:04:07.000> it's<00:04:07.480> actually<00:04:07.629> made<00:04:08.049> of<00:04:08.260> three

a third larger piece of red oak there
and<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:17.590> laminated<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.639> all<00:04:18.820> together<00:04:19.470> sanded

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
and I laminated that all together sanded

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.939 
and I laminated that all together sanded
it<00:04:20.560> down<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:21.840> it's<00:04:22.840> I<00:04:23.110> mean<00:04:23.260> it's<00:04:23.289> very<00:04:23.440> stout

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
funny strong for four strings obviously

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.920 
funny strong for four strings obviously
and<00:04:27.550> then<00:04:27.699> up<00:04:27.880> here<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.180> can<00:04:28.300> see<00:04:28.449> that<00:04:28.660> she's

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
and then up here you can see that she's

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.500 
and then up here you can see that she's
the<00:04:29.169> brass<00:04:29.440> bolt<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:30.639> know<00:04:30.760> for<00:04:30.940> your<00:04:31.060> nut<00:04:31.270> up

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
the brass bolt you know for your nut up

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.779 
the brass bolt you know for your nut up
here<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.229> this<00:04:32.860> seems<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.130> work<00:04:33.190> really<00:04:33.340> well

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
here and this seems to work really well

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.820 
here and this seems to work really well
and<00:04:34.060> with<00:04:34.539> these<00:04:34.780> uh<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:35.260> use<00:04:35.500> these<00:04:35.650> little

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
and with these uh I use these little

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.040 
and with these uh I use these little
brass<00:04:36.099> eyelets<00:04:36.370> as<00:04:36.820> like<00:04:37.210> string<00:04:37.510> retainers

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
and then in the center here actually did

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.960 
and then in the center here actually did
use<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.900> roller<00:04:41.169> string<00:04:41.500> retainer<00:04:41.919> or<00:04:42.550> string

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
tree we're going to call it and but that

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.550 
tree we're going to call it and but that
just<00:04:45.460> makes<00:04:45.729> sure<00:04:45.789> that<00:04:45.910> your<00:04:46.150> strings<00:04:46.560> stay

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
just makes sure that your strings stay

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
all the electronics and you know it's

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.510 
all the electronics and you know it's
trying<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.620> think<00:05:29.770> ahead<00:05:29.860> in<00:05:30.130> case<00:05:30.280> there<00:05:30.460> was
