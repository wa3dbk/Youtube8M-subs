00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.330
 parts first I'm going to make a little a 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.769

 It is a gift to you both 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 for me I wanted to be able to record much more 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.580
 fast and also you guys are going to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.380
 be able to have the videos in 1080 so 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 of fucking mother and well then I'm going to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.220
 teach a little of my comfort zone busetas 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 game not after having installed the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.310
 computer and everything so you can see how I 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.410
 everything that is my zone of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 game and finally I'll talk to you about 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.130
 little bit of the computer or I will make a small 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 comparative between the old and the new 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.670
 see how he renders each one so nothing 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.440
 Well I hope you like it and forward 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.540
 point is worth it here we are with the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.750
 new button and that is that I bought a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.750
 little bit 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.250
 and one boy opened the little window 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.489
 inhabited word and in half an hour the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.489
 driver 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.579
 therefore we are not going to 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.579
 and we have 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:09.310
 here we have that we do not sell the laptop 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.310
 It has enough lined 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820
 Y 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.820
 there is hard passion with us 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.800
 two 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:40.110
 sabah who handsome flirtante is worth now 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.110
 after teaching this moment 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.390
 and let's see your maxim again 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.390
 here we have 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.380
 the book charger cable 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.469
 also we have 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.909
 when entering the other part of the charger 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.909
 this together with the charger 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.190
 to see here nothing not 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.540
 and under my nothing 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.760
 and here we would have 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.330
 this is the battery basically the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.580
 laptop 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.580
 and I think that nothing else now 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.620
 so that's all teaching as 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.300
 I have installed in the setup and so on 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.280
 that nothing so good until now 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.870
 We are here in the setup 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.940
 of my new room as it is 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.250
 Now you see there I have a computer in 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.260
 the TV the new computer that now what 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.940
 I will teach then good first to introduce you 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.350
 to my colleague the killer monkey that what 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.480
 you have been on my channel for a long time 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.800
 I talk about 5 thousand subscribers or so 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.390
 that I tried so long yes that what 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.920
 you will know what a 6 or so 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.320

 well let's go there here you have the new 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.340
 computer is already installed I have 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.290
 tested at the end of the video I will put a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.820
 little the good test of rendering 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.160
 compared to my other computer from before 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.680
 here I have the mouse and as you see is 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.760
 very handsome the computer and the truth is 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.860
 that's going pretty good took away a little 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.020
 of brightness to the screen so you do not 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.430
 I blurred in the image and good as 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.130
 You see here on this visit, I have 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.620
 down the play 3 the last one that is the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.150
 deletion and here I have the capturing 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.799
 see average you do not see much 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.180
 good here the hard drive connected that 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.560
 where the gameplays are recorded as 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.150
 you know with this captor because I do not 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.069
 it is neither needed for the computer nor 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.099
 Nothing is worth simply element of the disc 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.439
 hard that has 640 gb I give him to record and 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.060
 well it is recorded to me and directly here 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.010
 down I have then it helped me a lot and 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.530
 as you can see from behind there is a mess of cable 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.060
 it is impressive but good the video of 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.799
 music that's pretty good here you see 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.959
 to which I connected my mobile phone 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.030
 example I connect my phone and listen 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.890
 what the video havana here we go 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.390
 to the table as you see we have here the tie 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.890
 good is the face that has brought my 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.139
 colleague to brighter let's try it 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.760
 by default when I recorded this good as 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.579
 you see a pretty big 32 TV 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.129
 inch here we have the command my mobile 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.829
 and this my old computer is worth not 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.750
 you see a little the screen and what is the 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.209
 the lid is quite broken 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.530
 that is, it is totally loose, it is worth it 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.780
 I have here leaning against the wall because if 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.000
 I would not fall and well there are simply 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.500
 the mouse over here you have what I'm going to put 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.960
 a bit far is worth to see more 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.220
 or less as I have the installation worth 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.800
 well so since you have here right now 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.050
 the monkey in which I use who is a whore 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.490
 good good shit but just because 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.949
 down here I have good things 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.199
 and down here in the drawer I have a 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.970
 pile of cables and activate it and this 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.220
 is the mic that I use to record it is worth 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.349
 is the singstar that the truth brings out 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.550
 quite sound quality and I do not have no 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.349
 I have another one at the moment so it's the one 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.990
 used one to teach how I have the 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.330
 information also up here here 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.370
 I have good a pair of cables the command the 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.740
 calculator the remote control or I send you 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.770
 of play all my games worth is good 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.419
 but this one that has not brought you pounds and 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.150
 simply because what I do for 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.850
 record like this to see 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.360
 I put it here on the table and as you see 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.490
 this cushion i am not from madrid but 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.330
 I have here the micro and so recorded voucher or 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.770
 be as botched as this I do not have a single 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.750
 stand or anything to put the micro 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.280
 just as by plug this 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.560
 computer or the other one with which I go 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.730
 to record and without more then this is how 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.860
 I have the installation the truth is that the 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.020
 pretty big tele some more for 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.100
 my taste but good is not there is nothing 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.300
 more to the installation now with two 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.940
 computer that works much more 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.100
 This is a genuine fast tank that is 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.650
 incredible and well while rendering 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.290
 with this one with this one, yes, I can 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.640
 watch youtube reply comments and everything 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.930
 so it's going to be a lot faster and 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.240
 good kids with nothing I hope that you 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.530
 I liked the setup and see you in the 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.640
 next video and as I said now to 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.770
 then I will leave you a little 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.390
 comparison between the rendering of the 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.340
 two computers if you win kid this 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.110
 Well now I'm going to talk to you a little 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.090
 of my pc I do not want to give much 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.790
 can with the features and that but 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.290
 good is a do 15 I'll leave in the 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.480
 description a link with all the 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.800
 characteristics and all that but good what 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.420
 what I want to do mainly is 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.220
 compare the rendering of my old 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.530
 computer with the new one to see 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.850
 how much the performance has improved for 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.140
 that does not know what it is to reuse is what 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.090
 that youtubers have to do to 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.130
 create a video is worth it or us 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.310
 we have to put a project with video 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.900
 audio images of anything goes and to create 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.490
 all that in a video we have to do 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.260
 One thing called rendering is worth 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.180
 that according to be of good of ordered therefore 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.860
 It will be faster or slower and good 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.540
 as you see in the background then to the left 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.820
 you will have the time of the video the time 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.560
 that lasts the video that I'm going to render and 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.900
 then on the right you will have what it takes 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.410
 in v6 my new pc as you see no good 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.300
 then at a quality of 720 pixels in a 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.850
 video minute my old computer 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.370
 it took 18 minutes to render it and my 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.560
 new pc as it takes 3 with 40 minutes or 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.840
 is not even four minutes worth in a video 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.160
 of five minutes that is really this 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.320
 is the time more or less than I just 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.480
 upload my videos of this time and then 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.210
 with the old pc it took me an hour and 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.340
 average and with this new pcm it takes 17 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.140
 minutes so imagine the amount 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.940
 of time that I'm going to save worth goes to 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.400
 be very good for the channel and when 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.350
 we are going to render at 1080 pixels that the 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.830
 highest quality is worth in a minute of 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.180
 video on the old pc it takes me 33 with 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.850
 40 minutes or 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.190
 one thing an incredible urbanity and in the 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.710
 new pc because it takes me 6 with 30 or 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.250
 that pretty well in five minutes of 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.759
 video 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:31.850
 the old pc took me 2 with 47 hours 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:34.340
 that is hours and pass almost three hours and in 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.680
 this new one because it takes me 31 30 minutes 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.090
 not good is good half an hour worth or 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.280
 be that as we can see then I have 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.229
 compared and this new computer is 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.240
 between five and six times faster 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.130
 than the previous one so good the pp a 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.780
 amazing past much faster everything 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.729
 much better you are going to have now
