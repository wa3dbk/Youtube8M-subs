horizontal had been partying with my
comb<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.140> clipped<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> back<00:00:22.650> portion<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.279> of

the way most of the first few steps are
all<00:00:25.830> sectioning<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.789> sometimes<00:00:26.970> feel

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
like extra work but I think that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.769 
like extra work but I think that
straight<00:00:29.519> lines<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:30.029> pay<00:00:30.330> off<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.689> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779

when I got to my forehead I clipped the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.790

to portion of hair directly behind it
very<00:02:18.140> carefully<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.860> then<00:02:19.580> waved<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.239> final

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
very carefully I then waved the final

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.000 
very carefully I then waved the final
section<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.020> hair<00:02:21.200> from<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.560> middle<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.890> the

strand down and back home that gently as

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.920 
strand down and back home that gently as
well<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:28.580> teasing<00:02:28.970> definitely<00:02:29.480> makes<00:02:29.750> him

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
well the teasing definitely makes him

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.510 
well the teasing definitely makes him
heighten<00:02:30.260> my<00:02:30.350> hair<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.130> make<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.400> even

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
heighten my hair but to make it even

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.970 
heighten my hair but to make it even
higher<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:32.209> twisted<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.810> section<00:02:33.290> pushed<00:02:33.800> it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
higher I twisted that section pushed it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.590 
higher I twisted that section pushed it
forward<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.459> used<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.760> pin<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.209> hold<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:35.510> in

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
forward and used a pin to hold it in

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.350 
forward and used a pin to hold it in
place<00:02:37.750> at<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.920> point<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.400> section<00:02:40.819> two<00:02:41.030> small

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
place at this point I section two small

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.150 
place at this point I section two small
pieces<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.900> hair<00:02:42.140> on<00:02:42.349> either<00:02:42.560> side<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
pieces of hair on either side of the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.670 
pieces of hair on either side of the
pouf<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.640> began<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.000> fishtail<00:02:44.450> braid<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.959> did

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
pouf and began a fishtail braid I did

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.170 
pouf and began a fishtail braid I did
three<00:02:45.920> or<00:02:45.950> four<00:02:46.220> stitches<00:02:46.519> in<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:46.940> pattern

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
three or four stitches in that pattern

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.970 
three or four stitches in that pattern
and<00:02:47.569> then<00:02:47.690> very<00:02:47.930> carefully<00:02:48.170> picked<00:02:48.739> up<00:02:48.860> a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
and then very carefully picked up a

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.590 
and then very carefully picked up a
third<00:02:49.190> strand<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.819> switched<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.299> French

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
third strand and switched to a French

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.930 
third strand and switched to a French
braid<00:02:50.870> if<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.040> too<00:02:52.190> confusing<00:02:52.400> though

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
braid if this is too confusing though

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.580 
braid if this is too confusing though
you<00:02:53.000> can<00:02:53.299> always<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.750> plait<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.110> braid<00:02:54.350> with

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
you can always just plait the braid with

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.670 
you can always just plait the braid with
three<00:02:54.830> strands<00:02:55.160> from<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.519> start<00:03:02.380> when<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.470> got

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
three strands from the start when I got

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.320 
three strands from the start when I got
a<00:03:03.709> little<00:03:04.010> closer<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.610> middle<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.940> my<00:03:05.120> head

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
a little closer to the middle of my head

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.270 
a little closer to the middle of my head
I<00:03:05.540> began<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.989> ankle<00:03:06.290> my<00:03:06.440> hands<00:03:06.680> towards<00:03:07.100> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
I began to ankle my hands towards the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.100 
I began to ankle my hands towards the
side<00:03:07.519> so<00:03:07.819> that<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.090> braid<00:03:08.299> would<00:03:08.480> follow<00:03:08.780> and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
side so that the braid would follow and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.770 
side so that the braid would follow and
ultimately<00:03:09.620> rest<00:03:09.980> over<00:03:10.370> my<00:03:10.519> shoulder<00:03:10.910> once

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
ultimately rest over my shoulder once

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.809 
ultimately rest over my shoulder once
all<00:03:12.049> my<00:03:12.200> hair<00:03:12.410> was<00:03:12.560> added<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.069> I<00:03:13.310> did<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.549> few

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
all my hair was added in I did a few

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.729 
all my hair was added in I did a few
more<00:03:13.970> passes<00:03:14.480> before<00:03:14.870> using<00:03:15.049> a<00:03:15.230> small<00:03:15.530> elastic

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
more passes before using a small elastic

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:16.870 
more passes before using a small elastic
to<00:03:16.160> tie<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.370> off

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
to tie it off

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.180 
to tie it off
I<00:03:16.910> also<00:03:17.570> went<00:03:17.870> back<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.380> carefully<00:03:18.590> loosened

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
I also went back and carefully loosened

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.080 
I also went back and carefully loosened
some<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.549> links<00:03:19.820> in<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.030> braid<00:03:21.910> here<00:03:22.910> I'm

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
some of the links in the braid here I'm

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.729 
some of the links in the braid here I'm
telling<00:03:23.329> my<00:03:23.510> side<00:03:23.720> braids<00:03:24.049> together<00:03:24.410> on<00:03:24.620> the

telling my side braids together on the

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.979 
telling my side braids together on the
same<00:03:24.980> angle<00:03:25.370> as<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.489> center<00:03:25.970> braid<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.810> can

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
same angle as the center braid you can

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.630 
same angle as the center braid you can
see<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.530> one<00:03:27.680> on<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.920> right<00:03:28.100> extends

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
see that the one on the right extends

this<00:03:51.500> time<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.040> think<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.910> this<00:03:53.180> is

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
this time I think that this is

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.940 
this time I think that this is
definitely<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.780> fun<00:03:54.049> place<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.530> style<00:03:54.769> to

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
be creative and you can see I twisted my

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.020 
be creative and you can see I twisted my
side<00:03:57.109> braids<00:03:57.410> together<00:03:57.620> tied<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:58.670> some<00:03:58.850> random
