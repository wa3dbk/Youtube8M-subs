00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
the end of the row with a bit of the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.070 
the end of the row with a bit of the
water<00:03:13.710> so<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:14.920> completes<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.870> whole

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
water so that it completes the whole

water so that it completes the whole
process

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.890 

the<00:03:23.360> roll<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.689> start<00:03:24.989> with

the roll it to start with

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.039 
the roll it to start with
ok<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.110> now<00:03:27.620> it's<00:03:27.829> just<00:03:28.040> about<00:03:28.659> meeting<00:03:29.659> itself

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
ok so now it's just about meeting itself
