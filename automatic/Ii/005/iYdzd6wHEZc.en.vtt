00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
necessary for a suit although if you're

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.539 
necessary for a suit although if you're
traveling<00:02:34.609> it<00:02:34.790> could<00:02:34.939> be<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:37.129> is<00:02:37.370> some

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
traveling it could be and this is some

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.099 
traveling it could be and this is some
foundation<00:02:38.120> there's<00:02:38.299> not<00:02:38.450> much<00:02:38.569> left<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:38.959> here

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
foundation there's not much left in here

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.140 
foundation there's not much left in here
actually<00:02:39.439> but<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.829> very<00:02:40.069> pale<00:02:40.340> one<00:02:40.909> of<00:02:41.030> my

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
actually but this is very pale one of my

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.670 
actually but this is very pale one of my
problems<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.689> because<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.019> have<00:02:42.200> such<00:02:42.409> pale

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
problems is because I have such pale

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.020 
problems is because I have such pale
skin<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.280> really<00:02:43.310> difficult<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.909> match

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
skin it's really difficult to match

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.610 
skin it's really difficult to match
colors<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:44.629> if<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.930> do<00:02:45.079> have<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.230> difficult

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620

colors so if you do have a difficult
skin<00:02:45.889> color<00:02:46.549> it's<00:02:46.819> useful<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.209> have<00:02:47.680> something

particularly strong color on the lips

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.640 
particularly strong color on the lips
and<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.599> mark<00:03:02.840> would<00:03:02.989> just<00:03:03.139> say<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.319> me<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.530> don't

and so mark would just say to me I don't

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.129 
and so mark would just say to me I don't
want<00:03:03.980> your<00:03:04.069> lips<00:03:04.189> to<00:03:04.310> look<00:03:04.430> dry<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.780> want<00:03:05.959> it
