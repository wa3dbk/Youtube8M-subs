00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.970 
review during at the japanese animated
Blitzwing<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.060> picked<00:00:19.050> him<00:00:19.170> up<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
Blitzwing here I picked him up with the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.450 
Blitzwing here I picked him up with the
prowl<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.140> saw<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:23.039> other<00:00:23.220> videos<00:00:23.580> I

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.009 

guess<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.670> main<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.330> paint<00:00:30.570> scheme<00:00:30.750> is

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
guess the main the paint scheme is

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.350 
guess the main the paint scheme is
different<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:32.640> reason<00:00:32.940> i<00:00:33.000> picked<00:00:33.180> up

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
different and the reason i picked up

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.100 
different and the reason i picked up
this<00:00:33.600> guy<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:34.170> because<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:38.450> had<00:00:39.450> him<00:00:39.629> when<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this guy was because I had him when I

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.940 
this guy was because I had him when I
was<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.320> kid<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:45.410> maybe<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
was a kid so and maybe the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.389 
was a kid so and maybe the
transformation<00:00:47.760> isn't<00:00:47.910> perfect<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:49.920> don't

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
transformation isn't perfect but I don't

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.610 
transformation isn't perfect but I don't
read<00:00:50.579> instructions<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.899> basically<00:00:52.379> I'm

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
read instructions so basically I'm

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
read instructions so basically I'm
showing<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.250> guy<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.270> what

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
showing you this guy so you can see what

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.279 
showing you this guy so you can see what
he<00:00:54.480> looks<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:55.039> and<00:00:56.149> I'm<00:00:57.149> thinking<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
he looks like and I'm thinking the the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.000 
he looks like and I'm thinking the the
golden<00:00:58.920> yellow<00:00:59.309> silvery<00:01:00.030> paint<00:01:00.420> scheme<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.010> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
golden yellow silvery paint scheme is it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:12.660 
golden yellow silvery paint scheme is it
is<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.359> different<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:07.130> yeah

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.489 

hmm<00:01:13.670> I'll<00:01:13.999> just<00:01:14.210> transform<00:01:14.719> him<00:01:14.840> up<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:15.319> then

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
hmm I'll just transform him up and then

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.510 
hmm I'll just transform him up and then
show<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:15.770> him<00:01:16.219> in<00:01:16.399> his<00:01:16.700> different<00:01:17.030> modes<00:01:17.210> and

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
show you him in his different modes and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.399 
show you him in his different modes and
let<00:01:19.520> him<00:01:19.640> speak<00:01:19.880> for<00:01:19.939> himself<00:01:20.200> which<00:01:21.200> she

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
let him speak for himself which she

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.340 
let him speak for himself which she
can't<00:01:21.619> speak<00:01:21.829> because<00:01:22.359> he<00:01:23.359> has<00:01:23.569> a<00:01:23.600> special

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
can't speak because he has a special

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.249 
can't speak because he has a special
robot<00:01:24.950> voice<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.520> hear<00:01:25.789> in<00:01:25.880> my<00:01:25.909> mind<00:01:26.259> which

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
robot voice that I hear in my mind which

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.330 
robot voice that I hear in my mind which
is<00:01:27.380> kind<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.679> disturbing<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:30.380> let's<00:01:30.920> see<00:01:31.130> let's

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
is kind of disturbing so let's see let's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.740 
is kind of disturbing so let's see let's
get<00:01:31.490> them<00:01:31.609> in<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.759> tank<00:01:31.789> mode<00:01:32.299> I<00:01:32.329> think<00:01:32.599> that's

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
get them in the tank mode I think that's

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.709 
get them in the tank mode I think that's
the<00:01:32.869> easiest<00:01:33.170> mode<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.849> transform<00:01:34.849> from<00:01:35.179> here

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
the easiest mode to transform from here

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:43.449 
the easiest mode to transform from here
into<00:01:38.319> and<00:01:39.729> tank<00:01:40.729> mode<00:01:41.619> you<00:01:42.619> know<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:42.979> old

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
into and tank mode you know in the old

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.459 
into and tank mode you know in the old
Blitzwing<00:01:44.420> just<00:01:44.689> kind<00:01:44.929> of<00:01:44.989> flipped<00:01:45.229> him<00:01:45.349> over

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
Blitzwing just kind of flipped him over

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.260 
Blitzwing just kind of flipped him over
and<00:01:45.709> then<00:01:45.829> he<00:01:45.920> was<00:01:46.069> already<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.429> pretty<00:01:47.209> much

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
and then he was already in pretty much

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.059 
and then he was already in pretty much
in<00:01:47.479> tank<00:01:47.750> mode<00:01:47.959> David<00:01:50.049> like<00:01:51.049> one<00:01:51.259> one<00:01:51.590> side<00:01:51.860> was

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
in tank mode David like one one side was

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.850 
in tank mode David like one one side was
tank<00:01:52.399> one<00:01:52.610> side<00:01:52.819> was<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.140> airplane<00:01:56.860> that's

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
tank one side was a airplane that's

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.719 
tank one side was a airplane that's
pretty<00:01:58.009> much<00:01:58.219> what<00:01:58.939> he<00:01:59.030> does<00:01:59.329> their<00:02:00.579> kind<00:02:01.579> of

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
pretty much what he does their kind of

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.190 
pretty much what he does their kind of
entangled<00:02:02.360> right<00:02:02.659> there<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:05.750> can<00:02:05.929> bend<00:02:06.109> these

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
entangled right there you can bend these

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.809 
entangled right there you can bend these
wings<00:02:06.560> down<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.829> bit<00:02:07.720> maybe<00:02:08.739> there<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:09.859> go<00:02:12.819> all

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
wings down a bit maybe there you go all

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.480 
wings down a bit maybe there you go all
right

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:26.520 

alright<00:02:19.490> pretty<00:02:19.700> close<00:02:19.940> enough<00:02:21.670> huh<00:02:25.390> alright

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
alright pretty close enough huh alright

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.210 
alright pretty close enough huh alright
so<00:02:27.530> his<00:02:27.920> little<00:02:28.130> tank<00:02:28.490> mode<00:02:28.730> there<00:02:29.000> sit<00:02:29.420> up<00:02:30.220> to

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
so his little tank mode there sit up to

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.490 
so his little tank mode there sit up to
rotate<00:02:31.730> him<00:02:31.880> around<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.310> he<00:02:35.260> looks<00:02:36.260> pretty

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
rotate him around and he looks pretty

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.940 
rotate him around and he looks pretty
much<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.770> same<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:38.260> not<00:02:39.260> much<00:02:39.470> difference

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
much the same so not much difference

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.600 
much the same so not much difference
there<00:02:43.360> yeah<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.720> mean<00:02:44.990> is<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.920> gold<00:02:46.160> paint

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
there yeah I mean is the gold paint

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.660 
there yeah I mean is the gold paint
worth<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.510> import<00:02:47.990> costs<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.560> all<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.830> you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
worth the import costs and all the you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.550 
worth the import costs and all the you
know<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:49.940> you're<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> big<00:02:50.330> Blitzwing<00:02:50.900> fan<00:02:51.200> maybe

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
know if you're a big Blitzwing fan maybe

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.430 
know if you're a big Blitzwing fan maybe
yes<00:02:51.920> but<00:02:53.020> if<00:02:54.020> not<00:02:54.290> we'll<00:02:54.650> then<00:02:54.860> maybe<00:02:55.250> not<00:02:56.440> like

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
yes but if not we'll then maybe not like

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.010 
yes but if not we'll then maybe not like
the<00:02:57.590> gun<00:02:57.770> turrets<00:02:58.130> there<00:02:58.370> lady<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.780> little

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
the gun turrets there lady the little

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.490 
the gun turrets there lady the little
blasters<00:03:00.500> they<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:04.780> constructionwise<00:03:05.780> i

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
blasters they can constructionwise i

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.460 
blasters they can constructionwise i
think<00:03:06.800> he's<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> little<00:03:07.370> i<00:03:07.880> did<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> hyper<00:03:08.960> extend

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
think he's a little i did a hyper extend

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.890 
think he's a little i did a hyper extend
one<00:03:09.740> of<00:03:09.860> these<00:03:09.980> wings<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.580> little<00:03:10.640> bit<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.270> i

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
one of these wings a little bit and i

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.210 
one of these wings a little bit and i
did<00:03:12.080> damage<00:03:12.710> it<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:13.160> little<00:03:13.550> bit<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.890> know<00:03:15.950> i

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
did damage it a little bit you know i

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.860 
did damage it a little bit you know i
guess<00:03:16.370> if<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.940> really<00:03:16.970> want<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.600> keep<00:03:17.750> your

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
guess if you really want to keep your

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.360 
guess if you really want to keep your
transformer<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.590> good<00:03:18.770> condition<00:03:19.220> you

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
transformer in good condition you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.150 
transformer in good condition you
probably<00:03:19.730> want<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.030> read<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.330> instructions

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
probably want to read the instructions

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.160 
probably want to read the instructions
but<00:03:22.160> if<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.850> don't<00:03:23.090> really<00:03:23.300> care<00:03:23.540> well<00:03:23.780> then

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.900 

then<00:03:27.170> you'll<00:03:27.350> break<00:03:27.500> him<00:03:27.680> yay<00:03:30.580> say<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.730> course

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
then you'll break him yay say of course

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.370 
then you'll break him yay say of course
you<00:03:32.090> guys<00:03:32.239> know<00:03:32.390> how<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.540> transform<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.200> guy

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
you guys know how to transform this guy

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.960 
you guys know how to transform this guy
already<00:03:33.940> I'm<00:03:34.940> just<00:03:35.209> doing<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:37.340> get<00:03:37.880> them

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
already I'm just doing it just get them

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.180 
already I'm just doing it just get them
in<00:03:38.120> his<00:03:38.239> robot<00:03:38.540> mode<00:03:38.680> show<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.739> all<00:03:40.040> these

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
in his robot mode show you all these

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:50.390 
in his robot mode show you all these
three<00:03:40.459> modes

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.289

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
course I know you guys probably said

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.219 
course I know you guys probably said
this<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:18.010> million<00:05:18.250> times<00:05:20.340> he's<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.370> ripoff<00:05:21.970> of

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
this a million times he's a ripoff of

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.480 
this a million times he's a ripoff of
Manny<00:05:23.229> faces<00:05:24.240> hey<00:05:25.240> man<00:05:26.010> you<00:05:27.010> got<00:05:27.160> a<00:05:27.220> little

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
Manny faces hey man you got a little

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.670 
Manny faces hey man you got a little
lays<00:05:27.760> there<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.810> then<00:05:28.990> he's<00:05:29.139> good<00:05:29.289> as<00:05:29.410> little

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
lays there and then he's good as little

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.610 
lays there and then he's good as little
but<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.400> head<00:05:30.639> is<00:05:30.669> so<00:05:31.060> soft<00:05:31.539> and<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.050> rubbery

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
but the head is so soft and the rubbery

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.820 
but the head is so soft and the rubbery
 is<00:05:33.220> I<00:05:33.810> think<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:34.930> he-man<00:05:35.260> figure<00:05:35.650> was<00:05:35.800> a

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
 is I think the he-man figure was a

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.420 
 is I think the he-man figure was a
lot<00:05:36.039> better<00:05:36.190> built<00:05:37.680> he<00:05:38.680> had<00:05:38.770> a<00:05:38.830> little<00:05:38.979> really

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
lot better built he had a little really

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.800 
lot better built he had a little really
hard<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.789> remember<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.300> those<00:05:40.570> he-man

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
hard I remember that those he-man

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.830 
hard I remember that those he-man
they're<00:05:41.680> really<00:05:42.310> hard<00:05:42.490> plastic<00:05:43.030> sometimes<00:05:45.840> so

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
they're really hard plastic sometimes so

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.050 
they're really hard plastic sometimes so
he'll<00:05:47.289> be<00:05:47.410> a<00:05:47.440> robot<00:05:47.650> there

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
he'll be a robot there

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.460 
he'll be a robot there
mmm<00:05:51.060> other<00:05:52.020> than<00:05:52.229> that<00:05:53.960> hyperextension<00:05:54.960> on

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
mmm other than that hyperextension on

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:02.210 
mmm other than that hyperextension on
the<00:05:55.560> wing<00:05:55.740> I<00:05:55.949> think<00:05:56.190> he's<00:05:56.340> built<00:05:56.639> well<00:05:57.650> I<00:06:01.220> guess

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
the wing I think he's built well I guess

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.950 
the wing I think he's built well I guess
he's<00:06:02.400> a<00:06:02.430> good<00:06:02.699> representation<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.810> the

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
he's a good representation of the

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.499 
he's a good representation of the
original<00:06:04.470> Blitzwing<00:06:05.039> with<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.509> triple

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
original Blitzwing with the triple

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.120 
original Blitzwing with the triple
changer<00:06:06.930> but<00:06:08.569> yeah<00:06:09.569> animated<00:06:10.380> quality

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
changer but yeah animated quality

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.400 
changer but yeah animated quality
control<00:06:11.550> issues<00:06:11.900> I<00:06:12.900> think<00:06:13.830> there<00:06:14.370> are<00:06:14.400> a<00:06:14.520> few

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
control issues I think there are a few

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.469 
control issues I think there are a few
just<00:06:16.410> some<00:06:16.710> of<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.889> painting<00:06:17.430> it's<00:06:18.270> not

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
just some of the painting it's not

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:25.249 
just some of the painting it's not
really<00:06:18.690> perfect<00:06:20.630> but<00:06:21.630> he's<00:06:23.599> a<00:06:24.599> nice<00:06:24.780> figure<00:06:25.050> to

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 
really perfect but he's a nice figure to

it's pretty nice a pretty extensive so
it's<00:07:35.069> better<00:07:35.759> than<00:07:35.969> like<00:07:36.119> the<00:07:36.300> black<00:07:36.719> Arachnia

thing<00:07:37.649> or<00:07:37.889> the<00:07:38.009> RC<00:07:38.459> thing<00:07:38.699> I<00:07:38.849> think<00:07:38.909> but<00:07:39.300> still

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:40.459 
thing or the RC thing I think but still

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.980 
thing or the RC thing I think but still
like<00:07:41.459> some<00:07:41.699> of<00:07:41.789> those<00:07:41.879> quality<00:07:42.479> look<00:07:42.869> at<00:07:42.959> a

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:42.990 
like some of those quality look at a

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.920 
like some of those quality look at a
paint<00:07:43.619> on<00:07:43.800> that<00:07:44.089> not<00:07:45.089> really<00:07:45.360> done<00:07:45.629> all<00:07:45.779> that

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:45.930 
paint on that not really done all that

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:53.659 
paint on that not really done all that
well<00:07:48.709> but<00:07:49.729> you<00:07:50.729> know<00:07:51.559> he<00:07:52.559> is<00:07:52.680> a<00:07:52.709> toy<00:07:53.009> and<00:07:53.339> he<00:07:53.490> is

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:53.669 
well but you know he is a toy and he is

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:56.389 
well but you know he is a toy and he is
meant<00:07:53.939> to<00:07:54.059> be<00:07:54.379> bent<00:07:55.379> and<00:07:55.649> twisted<00:07:55.709> and

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:56.399 
meant to be bent and twisted and

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:58.189 
meant to be bent and twisted and
but<00:07:56.430> I<00:07:56.879> think<00:07:57.659> they<00:07:57.779> could<00:07:57.930> have<00:07:57.959> done<00:07:58.050> a

00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 
but I think they could have done a

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:03.249 
but I think they could have done a
little<00:07:58.409> bit<00:07:58.849> better<00:07:59.849> job<00:08:00.240> of<00:08:00.269> that<00:08:01.999> anyway

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:03.259 
little bit better job of that anyway

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:07.719 
little bit better job of that anyway
