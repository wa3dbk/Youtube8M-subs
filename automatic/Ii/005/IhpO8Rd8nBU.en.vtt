entrance today we are going to be
talking<00:00:13.309> about<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.940> reactor<00:00:14.389> are<00:00:15.019> we<00:00:15.170> the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
talking about the reactor are we the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.890 
talking about the reactor are we the
most<00:00:15.860> exciting<00:00:16.400> of<00:00:16.460> systems<00:00:16.849> yeah<00:00:17.300> it's<00:00:17.810> all

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
most exciting of systems yeah it's all

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.720 
most exciting of systems yeah it's all
control<00:00:18.230> so<00:00:18.560> I'm<00:00:18.980> just<00:00:19.130> gonna<00:00:19.220> I'm<00:00:19.460> just<00:00:19.489> going

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
let's go through this so what do we have

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.440 
let's go through this so what do we have
there<00:00:23.989> you're<00:00:24.169> kind<00:00:24.560> of<00:00:24.619> half<00:00:24.890> my<00:00:25.130> vision<00:00:25.460> star

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
there you're kind of half my vision star

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.720 
there you're kind of half my vision star
here<00:00:26.630> this<00:00:27.470> is<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.770> reactor<00:00:28.250> screen<00:00:28.489> which

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
here this is the reactor screen which

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.790 
here this is the reactor screen which
shows<00:00:28.759> the<00:00:28.970> entire<00:00:29.329> ship<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:30.259> the<00:00:30.380> writer<00:00:30.590> you

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
shows the entire ship of the writer you

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.319 
shows the entire ship of the writer you
control<00:00:31.160> how<00:00:31.340> much<00:00:31.369> power<00:00:31.730> goes<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.239> the

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
control how much power goes to the

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.930 
control how much power goes to the
various<00:00:32.599> systems<00:00:32.930> in<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.079> ship<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:34.579> systems

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
various systems in the ship the systems

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.529 
various systems in the ship the systems
you<00:00:35.059> can<00:00:35.120> power<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.629> can<00:00:35.780> see<00:00:35.960> are<00:00:36.460> slightly

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
you can power you can see are slightly

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.180 
you can power you can see are slightly
lighter<00:00:38.539> shade<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.870> gray<00:00:39.109> and<00:00:39.859> you<00:00:39.980> can<00:00:40.100> click

lighter shade of gray and you can click

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.759 
lighter shade of gray and you can click
on<00:00:40.250> them<00:00:40.429> and<00:00:40.489> stuff<00:00:41.199> also<00:00:42.199> you<00:00:42.289> can<00:00:42.350> see<00:00:42.559> at

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
on them and stuff also you can see at

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.560 
on them and stuff also you can see at
the<00:00:42.859> bottom<00:00:43.010> is<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.640> power<00:00:43.820> bar<00:00:44.000> showing<00:00:44.239> our

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
the bottom is the power bar showing our

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.459 
the bottom is the power bar showing our
current<00:00:45.410> output<00:00:45.589> which<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:45.949> 20<00:00:46.429> megawatts<00:00:47.469> and

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
current output which is 20 megawatts and

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.349 
current output which is 20 megawatts and
the<00:00:49.070> amount<00:00:49.489> that<00:00:49.579> we're<00:00:49.789> supplying<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.210> the

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
the amount that we're supplying to the

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.119 
the amount that we're supplying to the
various<00:00:50.629> systems<00:00:50.960> in<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.109> ship<00:00:51.320> which<00:00:51.530> is<00:00:51.679> 9.6

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
various systems in the ship which is 9.6

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.939 
various systems in the ship which is 9.6
T<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.300> what<00:00:53.449> would<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:53.719> like<00:00:53.809> me<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:53.989> do<00:00:54.109> ok

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
T so what would you like me to do ok

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.939 
T so what would you like me to do ok
well<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.519> think<00:00:55.640> we<00:00:56.030> should<00:00:56.059> start<00:00:56.449> by<00:00:56.570> showing

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
well I think we should start by showing

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.560 
well I think we should start by showing
maybe<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.370> know<00:00:58.460> what<00:00:58.969> happens<00:00:59.269> when<00:00:59.329> you

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
maybe you know what happens when you

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.259 
maybe you know what happens when you
take<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.140> power<00:01:00.440> out<00:01:00.589> of<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.829> system<00:01:01.129> ok<00:01:02.120> yeah

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
take the power out of a system ok yeah

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.090 
take the power out of a system ok yeah
that's<00:01:02.600> good<00:01:02.749> idea<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.260> I'm<00:01:03.409> first<00:01:03.769> I'll<00:01:03.949> do

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
that's good idea so I'm first I'll do

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.280 
that's good idea so I'm first I'll do
door<00:01:04.400> control<00:01:04.780> so<00:01:05.780> at<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.960> moment<00:01:06.080> it's

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
door control so at the moment it's

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.310 
door control so at the moment it's
asking<00:01:06.530> for<00:01:07.299> 2.6<00:01:08.299> kill<00:01:08.479> of<00:01:08.540> what<00:01:08.659> sorry<00:01:09.140> make

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
asking for 2.6 kill of what sorry make

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.920 
asking for 2.6 kill of what sorry make
it<00:01:09.409> was<00:01:09.530> I'm<00:01:09.829> used<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.220> kilowatts<00:01:10.579> and<00:01:10.930> and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
it was I'm used to the kilowatts and and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.289 
it was I'm used to the kilowatts and and
it's<00:01:12.079> getting<00:01:12.229> all<00:01:12.680> over<00:01:12.820> Butler<00:01:13.820> slim<00:01:14.119> sit

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
it's getting all over Butler slim sit

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.910 
it's getting all over Butler slim sit
down<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.720> maybe<00:01:15.399> to<00:01:16.399> kill<00:01:16.729> megawatts<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.920> now

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
down to maybe to kill megawatts and now

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.100 
down to maybe to kill megawatts and now
you<00:01:18.979> can<00:01:19.100> see<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.450> first<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.600> have<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.780> power

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
you can see that first you have a power

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.539 
you can see that first you have a power
icon<00:01:21.380> here<00:01:21.590> showing<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.130> system<00:01:22.399> isn't

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
icon here showing that the system isn't

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.789 
icon here showing that the system isn't
receiving<00:01:23.090> full<00:01:23.210> power<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:24.439> shade<00:01:24.770> of

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
receiving full power and the shade of

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.399 
receiving full power and the shade of
light<00:01:25.520> orange<00:01:25.729> or<00:01:26.119> red<00:01:26.149> shows<00:01:27.079> how<00:01:27.259> little

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
light orange or red shows how little

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.780 
light orange or red shows how little
pirates<00:01:27.829> getting<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.219> if<00:01:28.310> i<00:01:28.369> take<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.610> all<00:01:28.700> way

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
pirates getting so if i take it all way

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.069 
pirates getting so if i take it all way
down<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:30.200> becomes<00:01:30.320> completely<00:01:30.829> red<00:01:31.039> and<00:01:32.079> also

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
down it becomes completely red and also

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.929 
down it becomes completely red and also
you'll<00:01:33.289> see<00:01:33.469> because<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:33.950> controlling<00:01:34.759> the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
you'll see because it's controlling the

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.389 
you'll see because it's controlling the
the<00:01:35.479> various<00:01:35.689> stores<00:01:35.869> around<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.140> ship<00:01:36.399> some

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
the various stores around the ship some

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.639 
the various stores around the ship some
of<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.610> most<00:01:38.210> remote<00:01:38.329> doors<00:01:38.750> aren't<00:01:39.110> getting

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
of the most remote doors aren't getting

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.620 
of the most remote doors aren't getting
the<00:01:39.799> power<00:01:39.920> they<00:01:40.070> want<00:01:40.299> which<00:01:41.299> these<00:01:41.450> ones

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
the power they want which these ones

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.060 
the power they want which these ones
here<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.500> doors<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:42.740> don't<00:01:42.829> get

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
here and the the doors that don't get

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.469 
here and the the doors that don't get
power<00:01:43.280> won't<00:01:43.610> be<00:01:43.700> able<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.969> automatically

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
power won't be able to automatically

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.440 
power won't be able to automatically
open<00:01:44.570> or<00:01:44.960> closed<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:46.130> if<00:01:46.219> I<00:01:46.310> give<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.549> like<00:01:46.729> zero

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
open or closed so if I give it like zero

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.240 
open or closed so if I give it like zero
power<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:47.719> we<00:01:47.750> dad<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.049> walk<00:01:48.259> around<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.159> now

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
power so we dad to walk around so now

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.560 
power so we dad to walk around so now
the<00:01:49.310> doors<00:01:49.549> behind<00:01:49.700> us<00:01:50.030> don't<00:01:50.299> get<00:01:50.420> enough

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
the doors behind us don't get enough

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.230 
the doors behind us don't get enough
power<00:01:50.719> so<00:01:51.320> if<00:01:51.500> we<00:01:51.619> try<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:51.859> yeah<00:01:52.310> now<00:01:53.119> they

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
power so if we try and yeah now they

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.319 
power so if we try and yeah now they
won't<00:01:53.329> open<00:01:53.659> automatically<00:01:54.079> and<00:01:55.119> instead<00:01:56.119> you

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
won't open automatically and instead you

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.719 
won't open automatically and instead you
have<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.509> actually<00:01:56.930> go<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.500> go<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.490> access

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
have to actually go and go to the access

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.200 
have to actually go and go to the access
screen<00:01:58.969> yeah<00:01:59.299> no<00:01:59.600> blame<00:01:59.810> yourself<00:02:00.640> which<00:02:01.640> yeah

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
screen yeah no blame yourself which yeah

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.719 
screen yeah no blame yourself which yeah
is<00:02:02.409> 11<00:02:03.409> really<00:02:03.679> major<00:02:03.890> reason<00:02:04.250> why<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.429> want

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
is 11 really major reason why you want

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.419 
is 11 really major reason why you want
to<00:02:04.939> keep<00:02:05.840> power<00:02:06.109> flow<00:02:06.350> into<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.590> room<00:02:06.859> and<00:02:07.070> it's

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
to keep power flow into a room and it's

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.889 
to keep power flow into a room and it's
and<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.700> also<00:02:07.939> not<00:02:08.270> just<00:02:08.600> through<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
and it's also not just through the

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.080 
and it's also not just through the
system<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.470> power<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.460> be<00:02:10.520> lost<00:02:10.730> two<00:02:10.880> rooms

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
system that power can be lost two rooms

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.330 
system that power can be lost two rooms
but<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:11.830> one<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.980> ways<00:02:13.100> you'll<00:02:13.250> be

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
but this is one of the ways you'll be

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.050 
but this is one of the ways you'll be
expected<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.790> manage<00:02:14.150> it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
expected to manage it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.089 
expected to manage it
to<00:02:15.300> help<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.599> out<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> crisis<00:02:16.230> that's<00:02:16.950> right

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
to help you out in a crisis that's right

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.320 
to help you out in a crisis that's right
you<00:02:17.520> can<00:02:17.640> see<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> bud<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.209> I'm

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
you can see the bud that I'm

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.540 
you can see the bud that I'm
manipulating<00:02:19.170> down<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.310> what

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
manipulating down here this is what

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.800 
manipulating down here this is what
you're<00:02:20.670> limiting<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> power<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
you're limiting the power going to the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.020 
you're limiting the power going to the
system<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.430> click<00:02:23.489> on<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.000> know

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
system is so if I click on like you know

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.330 
system is so if I click on like you know
too<00:02:24.319> that<00:02:25.319> means<00:02:25.470> they<00:02:25.590> won't<00:02:25.739> ever<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.160> any

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
too that means they won't ever get any

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.610 
too that means they won't ever get any
more<00:02:26.550> than<00:02:26.730> two<00:02:26.940> megawatts<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.290> put

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
more than two megawatts and if you put

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.170 
more than two megawatts and if you put
to<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.830> maximum<00:02:29.099> power<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> ship<00:02:29.970> gives

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
to the maximum power that the ship gives

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.490 
to the maximum power that the ship gives
them<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.390> means<00:02:30.750> it'll<00:02:30.930> always<00:02:31.170> try<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
them that means it'll always try and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.520 
them that means it'll always try and
give<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:31.680> much<00:02:31.830> as<00:02:31.980> possible<00:02:33.200> absurd<00:02:34.200> how<00:02:34.410> much

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
give as much as possible absurd how much

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.199 
give as much as possible absurd how much
it<00:02:34.680> once<00:02:34.830> yep<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.459> fulfill<00:02:35.730> how<00:02:35.910> much<00:02:36.060> is

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
it once yep and fulfill how much is

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.600 
it once yep and fulfill how much is
trying<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> draw<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.959> what<00:02:37.950> happens<00:02:38.250> i<00:02:38.340> wonder

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
trying to draw so what happens i wonder

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.040 
trying to draw so what happens i wonder
when<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.849> take<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> power<00:02:39.420> out<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.599> shields

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
when you take the power out of shields

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.380 
when you take the power out of shields
as<00:02:40.890> if<00:02:41.069> shields<00:02:41.340> well<00:02:41.519> i<00:02:41.550> can<00:02:41.760> show<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.150> that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
as if shields well i can show you that

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.059 
as if shields well i can show you that
so<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.110> asking<00:02:43.349> for<00:02:43.410> five<00:02:43.769> point<00:02:44.010> two

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
so that it's asking for five point two

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.250 
so that it's asking for five point two
three<00:02:44.190> let's<00:02:45.030> take<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.330> down<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.720> Norco<00:02:45.959> Nate

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
three let's take it down to Norco Nate

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.229 
three let's take it down to Norco Nate
and<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.280> should<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.459> able<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:47.700> see<00:02:47.790> now<00:02:48.000> I

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
and you should be able to see now I

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.390 
and you should be able to see now I
she'll<00:02:48.810> start<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.170> drop<00:02:49.350> because<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.220> can't

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
she'll start to drop because it can't

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.460 
she'll start to drop because it can't
maintain<00:02:50.580> them<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:52.549> with<00:02:53.549> shields<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:55.260> put

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
maintain them and with shields you put

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.820 
maintain them and with shields you put
it<00:02:55.560> up<00:02:55.709> if<00:02:56.580> i<00:02:56.670> put<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.880> up<00:02:56.940> slightly<00:02:57.799> less<00:02:58.799> than

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
it up if i put it up slightly less than

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.220 
it up if i put it up slightly less than
what<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.310> once<00:02:59.519> it<00:03:00.510> does<00:03:00.630> start<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> fill<00:03:01.140> up

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
what it once it does start to fill up

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.660 
what it once it does start to fill up
but<00:03:01.380> very<00:03:01.560> slowly<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.340> more<00:03:02.459> power<00:03:02.640> it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
but very slowly and the more power it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.539 
but very slowly and the more power it
gets<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.090> faster<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.510> can<00:03:04.400> fill<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
gets the faster it can fill up the

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.309 
gets the faster it can fill up the
shield's<00:03:05.819> an<00:03:06.209> important<00:03:06.690> thing<00:03:06.810> with<00:03:06.959> shields

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
shield's an important thing with shields

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.860 
shield's an important thing with shields
is<00:03:07.440> also<00:03:07.819> when<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:08.970> when<00:03:09.360> she'll<00:03:09.780> turn

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
is also when it's when she'll turn

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.539 
is also when it's when she'll turn
recharging<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.590> draws<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> lot<00:03:11.220> more<00:03:11.370> power

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
recharging it draws a lot more power

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.460 
recharging it draws a lot more power
than<00:03:11.819> when<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.120> not<00:03:12.299> too<00:03:12.480> if<00:03:12.930> we<00:03:13.019> look<00:03:13.200> at<00:03:13.260> how

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
than when it's not too if we look at how

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.190 
than when it's not too if we look at how
much<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.680> rooms<00:03:14.360> asking<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:15.569> on<00:03:15.780> shields

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
much the rooms asking for on shields

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.530 
much the rooms asking for on shields
that's<00:03:16.860> right<00:03:17.010> see<00:03:17.250> ya<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.910> think<00:03:18.209> it's<00:03:18.330> four

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
that's right see ya I think it's four

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.210 
that's right see ya I think it's four
times<00:03:18.720> as<00:03:18.930> much<00:03:19.079> when<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.680> charging<00:03:19.920> up<00:03:20.070> them

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
times as much when it's charging up them

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.130 
times as much when it's charging up them
when<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.459> stable<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.660> see<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
when it's stable and so you can see the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.680 
when it's stable and so you can see the
amount<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.500> requires<00:03:22.859> dropping<00:03:23.489> as<00:03:24.209> shields

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
amount it requires dropping as shields

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.099 
amount it requires dropping as shields
get<00:03:24.810> closer<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.290> their<00:03:26.180> optimum<00:03:27.180> 100-pound

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
get closer to their optimum 100-pound

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.620 
get closer to their optimum 100-pound
capacity<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:29.910> possible<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.329> fully

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
capacity so it's possible to fully

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.240 
capacity so it's possible to fully
shield<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.079> entire<00:03:31.290> ship<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:31.859> if<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.069> try

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
shield the entire ship but if you try

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.250 
shield the entire ship but if you try
and<00:03:32.459> charge<00:03:33.000> up<00:03:33.120> every<00:03:33.390> rooms<00:03:33.600> fields<00:03:34.019> at<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and charge up every rooms fields at the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.620 
and charge up every rooms fields at the
same<00:03:34.470> time<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:35.190> good<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.609> know<00:03:35.730> tell<00:03:36.510> us<00:03:36.569> all

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
same time it's good you know tell us all

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.990 
same time it's good you know tell us all
the<00:03:36.720> engine<00:03:36.959> it's<00:03:37.079> gonna<00:03:37.609> suck<00:03:38.609> up<00:03:38.760> too<00:03:38.910> much

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
the engine it's gonna suck up too much

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.349 
the engine it's gonna suck up too much
power<00:03:39.209> uh-huh<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.489> I<00:03:41.489> wonder<00:03:41.970> what<00:03:42.090> happens

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
power uh-huh and I wonder what happens

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.509 
power uh-huh and I wonder what happens
if<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.600> cancel<00:03:42.840> life<00:03:43.200> supports<00:03:43.650> power<00:03:43.859> that's

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
if you cancel life supports power that's

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.190 
if you cancel life supports power that's
a<00:03:44.730> good<00:03:44.880> idea<00:03:45.000> John<00:03:45.329> let's<00:03:45.510> try<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.790> I

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
a good idea John let's try that and I

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.449 
a good idea John let's try that and I
think<00:03:49.200> what's<00:03:49.380> going<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.829> happen<00:03:50.069> here<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.340> it

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
think what's going to happen here is it

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.449 
think what's going to happen here is it
just<00:03:50.609> won't<00:03:50.850> replenish<00:03:51.299> um<00:03:52.109> we<00:03:53.010> use<00:03:53.190> up<00:03:53.370> a

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
just won't replenish um we use up a

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.220 
just won't replenish um we use up a
slight<00:03:53.670> amount<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.420> air<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.900> air<00:03:55.109> will

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
slight amount of the air so the air will

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.590 
slight amount of the air so the air will
drain<00:03:55.620> slowly<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.519> temperature<00:03:57.329> will<00:03:57.420> rise<00:03:57.540> a

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
drain slowly and temperature will rise a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.240 
drain slowly and temperature will rise a
bit<00:03:57.720> actually<00:03:57.930> because<00:03:58.500> we<00:03:58.650> generate<00:03:59.100> heat

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
bit actually because we generate heat

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.400 
bit actually because we generate heat
bobo<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.209> generate<00:04:00.569> you<00:04:00.810> know<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.139> won't<00:04:01.230> go

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
bobo and generate you know it won't go

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.349 
bobo and generate you know it won't go
over<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:02.190> point<00:04:02.400> where<00:04:02.489> we<00:04:02.579> get<00:04:03.060> hurt<00:04:03.209> or

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
over the point where we get hurt or

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.930 
over the point where we get hurt or
anything<00:04:03.389> yeah<00:04:04.139> but<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.650> i<00:04:04.799> were<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:05.280> then<00:04:05.430> so

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
anything yeah but if i were to then so

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.190 
anything yeah but if i were to then so
you<00:04:06.030> can<00:04:06.120> see<00:04:06.209> ya<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.660> it's<00:04:06.810> starting<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.079> drop

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
you can see ya so it's starting to drop

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.830 
you can see ya so it's starting to drop
yeah<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.639> it's<00:04:08.880> not<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.269> much<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.420> actually

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
yeah so it's not that much of actually

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.720 
yeah so it's not that much of actually
losing<00:04:10.139> it<00:04:10.230> but<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.739> especially<00:04:11.280> if<00:04:11.579> then<00:04:11.700> a

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
losing it but it is especially if then a

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.240 
losing it but it is especially if then a
room<00:04:11.940> gets<00:04:12.120> damaged<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.079> loses<00:04:13.590> oxygen<00:04:13.799> if

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
room gets damaged and loses oxygen if

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.920 
room gets damaged and loses oxygen if
you<00:04:14.579> don't<00:04:14.760> have<00:04:14.880> power<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.269> life<00:04:15.540> support

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
you don't have power to life support

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.270 
you don't have power to life support
you're<00:04:16.320> not<00:04:16.440> going<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.620> be<00:04:16.680> able<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.889> raise

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
you're not going to be able to raise

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.430 
you're not going to be able to raise
that<00:04:17.310> back<00:04:17.639> up<00:04:17.789> yeah<00:04:18.539> as<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> hull<00:04:18.989> breach<00:04:19.019> then

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
that back up yeah as a hull breach then

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.960 
that back up yeah as a hull breach then
you're<00:04:19.590> screwed<00:04:20.130> if<00:04:20.400> there's<00:04:20.549> no<00:04:20.639> power<00:04:20.789> going

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
you're screwed if there's no power going

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.839 
you're screwed if there's no power going
into<00:04:21.530> put<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.620> oxygen<00:04:22.710> back<00:04:23.039> in<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.370> think

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
into put the oxygen back in I think

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.430 
into put the oxygen back in I think
that's<00:04:24.090> pretty<00:04:24.390> much<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.930> get<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.320> other

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
that's pretty much it I get the other

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.290 
that's pretty much it I get the other
systems<00:04:25.950> at<00:04:26.159> as<00:04:26.310> you'd<00:04:26.460> expect<00:04:26.669> so<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.180> you

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
systems at as you'd expect so if you

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.580 
systems at as you'd expect so if you
take<00:04:27.539> away<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.780> power<00:04:27.990> from<00:04:28.050> trans

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
take away the power from trans

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.800 
take away the power from trans
rumi<00:04:28.920> won't<00:04:29.070> be<00:04:29.130> able<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.340> recharge<00:04:29.880> as<00:04:30.510> fast

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
rumi won't be able to recharge as fast

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.810 
rumi won't be able to recharge as fast
you<00:04:31.320> take<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.620> away<00:04:31.710> from<00:04:31.890> piloting<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.790> ship

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
you take it away from piloting the ship

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.300 
you take it away from piloting the ship
will<00:04:33.180> have<00:04:33.420> a<00:04:33.450> lower<00:04:33.810> acceleration<00:04:34.500> if<00:04:35.190> you

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
will have a lower acceleration if you

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.550 
will have a lower acceleration if you
take<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.520> away<00:04:35.670> from<00:04:35.820> engineering<00:04:36.690> than<00:04:37.050> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
take it away from engineering than the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.910 
take it away from engineering than the
engineering<00:04:37.950> can't<00:04:38.160> repair<00:04:38.520> things<00:04:38.760> as<00:04:39.030> fast

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
engineering can't repair things as fast

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.840 
engineering can't repair things as fast
why<00:04:40.920> would<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.070> take<00:04:41.310> power<00:04:41.490> away<00:04:41.520> from<00:04:41.670> the

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
why would you take power away from the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.400 
why would you take power away from the
reactor<00:04:42.060> James<00:04:42.390> you<00:04:43.380> can't<00:04:45.140> that<00:04:46.140> would<00:04:46.230> be<00:04:46.380> a

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
reactor James you can't that would be a

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.960 
reactor James you can't that would be a
bit<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.770> bad<00:04:46.950> scenario<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:48.120> get<00:04:48.270> in<00:04:48.860> okay

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
bit of a bad scenario to get in okay

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.200 
bit of a bad scenario to get in okay
wonderful<00:04:51.800> that<00:04:52.800> was<00:04:52.920> exciting<00:04:53.070> infant<00:04:53.700> your
