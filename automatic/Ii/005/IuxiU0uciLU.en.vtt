00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940 
need to take a break then take a break
but<00:03:02.640> my<00:03:03.239> personal<00:03:03.570> opinion<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:04.110> don't<00:03:04.709> take<00:03:04.920> a

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
but my personal opinion is don't take a

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.860 
but my personal opinion is don't take a
break<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.489> randomly<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.299> were<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.600> set

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
break just randomly if you were on a set

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.390 
break just randomly if you were on a set
routine<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.410> I'm<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:07.860> days<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:08.130> one<00:03:08.310> day

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
routine like I'm on for days on one day

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.910 
routine like I'm on for days on one day
off<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:09.120> there's<00:03:09.299> no<00:03:09.450> reason<00:03:09.810> for<00:03:09.840> me<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.140> take

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
off so there's no reason for me to take

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.710 
off so there's no reason for me to take
a<00:03:10.950> break<00:03:11.220> because<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.940> my<00:03:12.090> regiment<00:03:12.630> that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.000 
a break because that is my regiment that
is<00:03:12.840> what<00:03:12.959> I'm<00:03:13.049> sticking<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.829> because

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
is what I'm sticking to and just because

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.580 
is what I'm sticking to and just because
I'm<00:03:14.100> sore<00:03:14.340> doesn't<00:03:15.000> mean<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.209> I'm<00:03:15.299> gonna
