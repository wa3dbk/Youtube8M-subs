from<00:01:33.240> where<00:01:33.570> choppers<00:01:33.960> from<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:35.369> biggest

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
from where choppers from and the biggest

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
from where choppers from and the biggest
surprise<00:01:35.820> though<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> return<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
surprise though is the return of the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.440 
surprise though is the return of the
kungfu<00:01:37.710> dugong<00:01:38.549> who<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> character<00:01:39.240> who

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
kungfu dugong who was a character who

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810 
kungfu dugong who was a character who
wasn't<00:01:39.720> even<00:01:39.869> seen<00:01:40.140> since<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> alabasta<00:01:41.610> arc

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
wasn't even seen since the alabasta arc

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940 
wasn't even seen since the alabasta arc
and<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.930> good<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.320> him<00:01:43.470> again<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and it's just good to see him again and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
and it's just good to see him again and
he's<00:01:44.130> clearly<00:01:44.399> gotten<00:01:44.670> stronger<00:01:45.060> he<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> use

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
he's clearly gotten stronger he can use

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.929

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
episode comes to a close but like I said

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.430 
episode comes to a close but like I said
this<00:02:51.970> was<00:02:52.150> not<00:02:52.299> bad<00:02:52.599> I<00:02:52.840> can<00:02:52.989> understand<00:02:53.349> why

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
this was not bad I can understand why

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.569 
this was not bad I can understand why
people<00:02:53.739> aren't<00:02:53.829> going<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.010> like<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.340> because

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
people aren't going to like this because

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.490 
people aren't going to like this because
apparently<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.959> beginning<00:02:56.079> of<00:02:56.380> a

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
apparently this is the beginning of a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.900 
apparently this is the beginning of a
filler<00:02:56.739> arc<00:02:57.010> but<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.430> know<00:02:57.519> what<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.700> don't

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
filler arc but you know what I don't

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.860 
filler arc but you know what I don't
really<00:02:58.000> have<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.239> problem<00:02:58.480> with<00:02:58.690> filler

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
really have a problem with filler

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.660 
really have a problem with filler
because<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.290> don't<00:02:59.440> watch<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.739> manga<00:03:00.040> at<00:03:00.190> all<00:03:00.400> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
because I don't watch the manga at all I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.640 
because I don't watch the manga at all I
just<00:03:01.090> saw<00:03:01.269> this<00:03:01.450> as<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.720> pretty<00:03:02.170> entertaining

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
just saw this as a pretty entertaining

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.280 
just saw this as a pretty entertaining
and<00:03:02.890> funny<00:03:03.069> episode<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.299> actually<00:03:04.930> thought

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
and funny episode and I actually thought

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.530 
and funny episode and I actually thought
a<00:03:05.500> lot<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.920> animation<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.910> art<00:03:07.090> work<00:03:07.329> was

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
a lot of the animation and art work was

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.910 
a lot of the animation and art work was
better<00:03:07.780> than<00:03:07.959> some<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.349> stuff<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.709> saw

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
better than some of the stuff that I saw

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.500 
better than some of the stuff that I saw
in<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.130> punk<00:03:09.370> hazard<00:03:09.579> arc<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.269> seemed<00:03:10.420> a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
in the punk hazard arc it just seemed a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.660 
in the punk hazard arc it just seemed a
little<00:03:10.630> more<00:03:10.870> clean<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.280> big<00:03:12.430> action

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
little more clean and the big action

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.080 
little more clean and the big action
scene<00:03:13.060> where<00:03:13.390> Luffy<00:03:14.079> law<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.280> chopper<00:03:15.880> are

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
scene where Luffy law and chopper are

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.610 
scene where Luffy law and chopper are
actually<00:03:16.480> fighting<00:03:16.690> against<00:03:17.170> all<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
actually fighting against all of the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.229 
actually fighting against all of the
different<00:03:17.920> animals<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.579> actually<00:03:18.910> really

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
different animals is actually really

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.610 
different animals is actually really
well<00:03:19.480> done<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.750> pretty<00:03:20.109> awesome<00:03:20.500> i

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
well done and pretty awesome i

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.840 
well done and pretty awesome i
especially<00:03:20.859> liked<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.160> scene<00:03:21.430> where<00:03:21.609> luffy

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
especially liked the scene where luffy

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.879 
especially liked the scene where luffy
was<00:03:22.000> fighting<00:03:22.329> against<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.720> giant<00:03:22.900> octopus<00:03:23.530> so

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
was fighting against a giant octopus so

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.140 
was fighting against a giant octopus so
even<00:03:24.100> though<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.220> is<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.489> filler<00:03:24.730> episode<00:03:25.120> I

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
even though this is a filler episode I

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.610 
even though this is a filler episode I
think<00:03:25.420> one<00:03:25.600> piece<00:03:25.780> fans<00:03:25.989> are<00:03:26.170> really<00:03:26.260> going<00:03:26.530> to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
think one piece fans are really going to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.199 
think one piece fans are really going to
enjoy<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:27.069> one<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.400> maybe<00:03:27.519> even<00:03:27.730> action

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
enjoy this one and maybe even action

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.059 
enjoy this one and maybe even action

didn't expect to see anything like that
in<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.239> filler<00:03:46.560> Naruto<00:03:47.560> could<00:03:47.799> really<00:03:48.310> learn<00:03:48.489> a

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
in a filler Naruto could really learn a

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.640 
in a filler Naruto could really learn a
lesson<00:03:48.970> from<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.420> filler<00:03:49.600> in<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:49.989> piece<00:03:50.230> but

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
lesson from the filler in one piece but

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.030 
lesson from the filler in one piece but
there<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.609> is<00:03:51.670> pretty<00:03:52.359> decent<00:03:52.569> episode<00:03:53.040> you

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
with this one if I had one it's maybe

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.170 
with this one if I had one it's maybe
that<00:03:57.130> they<00:03:57.250> didn't<00:03:57.519> need<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.700> focus<00:03:57.880> too<00:03:58.150> much

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
