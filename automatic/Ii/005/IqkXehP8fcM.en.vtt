00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.570
 Wonderland Airport serves 363 judges 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.570
 20 airlines fly here 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.250
 in front of us 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.679
 exact replica of the hamburg pulse of a stash 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.730
 on a scale of 1 kwasnew family 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.800
 its area is 125 square meters 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.499
 this is the most 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.499
 miniature rework 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.080
 the idea of ​​the project belongs to the director 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.080
 brown 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.560
 and also negatively that to us in our 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.330
 miniature wonderland needs your 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.970
 own airports became clear 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.680
 already at an early stage of its creation 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.930
 honestly i say myself when church with 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.170
 deceased waters big fan 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.170
 real work near my 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560
 at home six years ago I started what's called 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.489
 study the topic to figure out what 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.980
 there are opportunities 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.969
 planning took about two years 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.810
 four years on 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.670
 creation involved 40 people 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.360
 miniature country staff 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.909
 miracles 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.600
 I changed it in many ways 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.979
 the cost of a toy you will not name three with 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.480
 half million euros 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.910
 made 50 thousand pieces built 75 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.700
 buildings as well as 90 aircraft each 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.080
 the item is made by hand for aircraft 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.810
 had to develop 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.120
 special mechanical 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.190
 design 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.670
 under this article in principle these 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.210
 airplanes are technically driven 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.350
 how are the cars that drive here 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.409
 tells class Pikul 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.770
 they have an electric motor 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.020
 fixed front axle feed 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.230
 carried by battery 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.110
 everything is controlled via computer air 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.180
 models are lifted using special 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.100
 liquidated rods for pharmacies 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.430
 tenders with candy 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 car driver and home r 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 not an easy task how to force airplanes 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.649
 take off and land so that it 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.950
 looked really agile 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.929
 mechanics and no scams plus 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.229
 appropriate noise 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.239
 accompanied by speakers and by 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.239
 each model has its own 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.739
 everything is controlled through the computer sometimes bye 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.589
 there are still lining which 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.609
 have to eliminate right on take-off 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.899
 field 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.889
 our airport operates free of charge 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.779
 10 hours a day sometimes a situation arises 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.459
 which during the creation of this 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.309
 thumbnail we did not think 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.579
 for example the tanker is approaching on the left 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.879
 fire engine on the right between them like 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 time to fly the plane 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.339
 when the board is carried out with 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:51.719
 using specially written 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.789
 computer programs every day 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.319
 and complements and optimize 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.479
 the airport is only part of a big wonderland 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.170
 the area of ​​which is 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.529
 thousand 200 square meters 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.209
 eight different landscapes 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.459
 total length of rail 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.339
 ways of 13 thousand meters is the largest 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.339
 miniature railway in the world 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.199
 everything is controlled from the control room 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.059
 in which you can meet predicted 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.259
 Brown's twin brother is already familiar to us 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.809
 director brauny step over teams 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.479
 although the Hamburg report is not quite 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.899
 fits into our biography 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:31.989
 I want to change the image of the country 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.399
 create exactly its copy was true we 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.829
 in Hamburg, many visitors immediately 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.159
 know our airport turned out a monument 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.329
 our hometown is Oksana, but because 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.569
 there is a liter 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.530
 yes replaces the level of 2 mb 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.220
 Hamburg miniature country 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.380
 miracles is considered one of the most popular 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.750
 tourist attractions 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.069
 Northern Germany every year there are 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.069
 over one million people 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.419
 We found a typo already Rostov men children 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.309
 shine appears in the eyes for example when 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.599
 they see fire trucks and police cars with 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.710
 special signal 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.249
 or when the night starts here 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.599
 night in this hamburg 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.239
 airports last just 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.539
 three minutes comes four times 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.359
 per hour just about this corners of wonderland 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.159
 used from 40 thousand LEDs 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.639
 takeoffs and landings 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.020
 do not stop day and night 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.490
 how can you not dream of traveling to others 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.729
