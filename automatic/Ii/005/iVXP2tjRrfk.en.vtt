00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.960
 that listen here you are here 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.500
 manipulations about 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.300
 did you can you explain to me what 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.760
 here after all the project was happening and what 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.380
 what is happening here and what is it here 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.180
 she answered them that now I will tell you so 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.970
 what am I checking this way 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.370
 the quality of honey there are have quality then 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.820
 eat if it is ripe if honey bee 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.840
 made not from sugar which can 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.480
 some beekeepers sin and feed 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.040
 their people and the bees made honey from 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.860
 pollen and nectar 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.080
 then honey after ten after 20 after 30 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.530
 after 40 minutes will leave in 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.230
 stay honey right now i see 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.080
 let you down that is, that's how it will lie 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.230
 lying on toilet paper but if honey 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.900
 substandard if the bees fed 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.680
 sugar after a few minutes 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.350
 around a drop of honey on toilet paper 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.770
 will begin to form wet 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.860
 to and rainbow spot here is a sign 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.130
 that honey is substandard and so could honey 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.810
 buy is not a principle but simply do not need 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.580
 better to buy quality 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:34.510
 so she told him and left here I 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:40.300
 I did the same at home but I did 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.900
 honey I do not know who bought it from 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.570
 apiary he was than brow and done that is 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.660
 I'm sure though manufacturers like 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.300
 sometimes you know yourself is not so sure 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.350
 This drop I have just before 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.300
 you made a drop that already 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.610
 worth 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:06.760
 20 minutes can be up to 20 minutes that is 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:11.200
 as if it should not spread 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.310
 spread and naturally around copy 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.640
 there is some kind of hint here 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.280
 on the stain but this stain has a thickness not 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.900
 more 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.740
 well this 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.639
 now take a closer look millimeter can 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.259
 be half 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.039
 no more then honey is honey 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.430
 he has 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.400
 moisture and this is lava around the perimeter a little 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.000
 a little bit should appear but it is not 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.330
 should go about that drop around 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.660
 should be so learn how to drop 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.400
 the water and around begin to diverge then 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.080
 big big big bigger and bigger 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.750
 it becomes more like it is not 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.770
 must be dead must remain 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.169
 honey and honey around light drop blunt 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.900
 gray drop 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.430
 as if the moisture should not appear here 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.320
 such a simple way to check 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.350
 qualities told me 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.020
 I have bought copper here literally 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.789
 a week ago check everything fits 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.889
 no drops no future purchase 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.560
 I will buy the world this year too 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.080
 check to try and maybe even 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.620
 agree to some reason why he 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.770
 gave me a sample 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.520
 honey is really about or raw that is 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.560
 immature 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:40.080
 or the one that got received in 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.970
 as a result of feeding the bees sugar 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.060
 Basically everything I wanted today 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.310
 tell all that I wanted to take off 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.770
