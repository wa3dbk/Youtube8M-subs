00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
on my part I'm not really sure how long

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.750 
on my part I'm not really sure how long
they'd<00:00:49.559> know<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.070> storage<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:52.610> know<00:00:53.610> it's

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
they'd know is in storage I know it's

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
they'd know is in storage I know it's
been<00:00:53.969> at<00:00:54.059> least<00:00:54.120> 10<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.600> 15<00:00:54.960> years<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.070> is

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
been at least 10 or 15 years but this is

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.840 
been at least 10 or 15 years but this is
the<00:00:56.399> saber<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.949> random<00:00:59.609> hard

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the saber as you can see I random hard

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.029 
the saber as you can see I random hard
tires<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.629> only<00:01:00.719> doing<00:01:00.930> 20<00:01:01.350> 30<00:01:01.620> miles<00:01:01.859> an

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
tires I was only doing 20 30 miles an

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
tires I was only doing 20 30 miles an
hour<00:01:02.129> around<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> neighborhood<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.989> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
hour around the neighborhood but that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.580 
hour around the neighborhood but that
right<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.650> why<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.519> run<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
right there is why you do not run the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
right there is why you do not run the
tires<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.130> store<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.030> 15

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
tires that you store them with for 15

tires that you store them with for 15
years<00:01:09.689> no<00:01:10.049> matter<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.470> pretty<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.979> look

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
years no matter how pretty they look

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.910 
years no matter how pretty they look
when<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> pull<00:01:11.670> them<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.939> storage

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
when you pull them out of storage

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.020 
when you pull them out of storage
there's<00:01:13.920> some<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.310> bad<00:01:14.610> ones

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.420

believe<00:01:48.179> long<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.869> I've<00:01:49.050> got<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.560> far

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
believe long as I've got it this far

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.779 
believe long as I've got it this far
apart<00:01:51.140> it's<00:01:52.140> been<00:01:52.319> apart<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:53.280> 15

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
apart it's been apart for 15

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.580 
apart it's been apart for 15
years<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.770> think<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> part<00:01:57.530> probably<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
years I think it was a part probably a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.740 
years I think it was a part probably a
part<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.610> three<00:01:59.850> years<00:02:00.030> before<00:02:00.569> we

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
part of two or three years before we

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.590 
part of two or three years before we
even<00:02:00.869> put<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.350> storage<00:02:02.209> but<00:02:03.209> maybe<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
even put it in storage but maybe this

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.690 
even put it in storage but maybe this
thing's<00:02:03.810> been<00:02:03.990> sitting<00:02:04.049> about<00:02:04.440> 18<00:02:04.830> 19<00:02:05.069> years<00:02:05.459> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
thing's been sitting about 18 19 years I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.949 
thing's been sitting about 18 19 years I
don't<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.289> I'm<00:02:07.289> just<00:02:07.350> guessing<00:02:08.959> guessing

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
don't know I'm just guessing guessing

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.009
