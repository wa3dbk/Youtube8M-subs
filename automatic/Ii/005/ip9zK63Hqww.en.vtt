00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.920
 yes, when I first saw it here 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.359
 in this unlocks in the video or sees it 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.220
 first of all his was already there but 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.960
 Today we take the time with us 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.010
 join him a little longer 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 the camera to sit 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.369
 and there is already on the boxing ring there 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 I'm fine and we have enough 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.939
 here is the samsung galaxy s 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.920
 6 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.899
 the samsung galaxy s 6 and the htc evo 9 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.180
 black black flags is celebrating with me 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.540
 it's the simple white pearl so far 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 the whole gold &amp; silver mostly gold 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.260
 and silver gold and silver yes me 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.120
 avoid with the galaxy s 6 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.980
 and that's how the packaging actually looks 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.210
 Triggers in the shop can get that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.199
 is nevertheless times all depends on which 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.579
 it acts and on the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.620
 back it is now on the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.750
 media gained so there he stood else will 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.399
 a lot of it on me but now 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.559
 are limited to the essentials 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.010
 is quite good makes a uniform 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.449
 design 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.430
 I grab it once with her on 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.229
 the old and the packaging in general 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.119
 are so hard that we are there 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.080
 not really annoying me there was one 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600
 bit here on the table we put 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.270
 say we always leave the table like this 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.670
 continues 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.840
 mainz is also good to us 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.840
 you have the precedence 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:42.520
 thanks it slips it has slipped mainz 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.570
 Rounded corners 1 not easy 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.850
 I'm already blue so I think it is 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.390
 not that's fun that's called black 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 sabbath little dangerous he finished 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 take out first 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.090
 but it's funnier was you perfect 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.240
 yes, on it I first looks like 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.360
 a pearl a pearl but it is blue 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.760
 it is yes you have an effect on everyone 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.319
 case that is close Schongau but how 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.349
 As always, you know all the details 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.140
 we also clarify smartphones in one 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.830
 detailed test delivers what else here 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.350
 ten years in this way is a packaging 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.150
 dons again guides and one 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.280
 short instructions and a vip card and 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.269
 other information and a regional 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.450
 local guides and shows the rapid 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.920
 months even in detailed black 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.340
 White 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.850
 too bad we have something else in it 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.130
 USB cable yes I can keep up with okay me 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.889
 also have a charger that yours 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.989
 Charging plug with 2 amps output partie 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.459
 keep up 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.200
 ok war charge that you have to mention 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.680
 is the so always goes from one and a half 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:13.060
 hours of coaching and 1 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:17.920
 I have good that is the pilot for 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.970
 the sim card and sd card sd card 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.120
 Unfortunately, there's no more 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.680
 and here by the new headset of 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.500
 samsung 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.050
 that is 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.430
 that's a bit of a man you are 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.360
 rumbled it looks a bit like 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.560
 inspired by apple that extra 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.110
 Above all, one has towers here that 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.670
 you still have that ear on you can 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.140
 not such a plastic tree adidas clock 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.810
 scratch the apple 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.010
 that's exactly what it actually was 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.600
 Did not like it so if you do not 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.570
 so in the ear headphones stands 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.470
 then they are not Apple's 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.560
 have been good 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.560
 no matter if this from the first test exactly 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.989
 and if you have the HTC hero entirely 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.370
 inconspicuous a box and you are allowed 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:12.590
 The jewelers of the gadget like the live 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:17.480
 it just like that we have here quite 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.910
 normal a usb cable a normal 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.620
 mind you a normal a normal one 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.270
 charging cable so no almost a pity 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.520
 usually takes about two hours to 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.960
 charge headphones 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.340
 they are always pretty good 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.340
 because she is not rubbery so 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.740
 everything unimportant that it is important 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:42.950
 My cat would be happy for it 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:45.350
 this chaos as in the original a little one 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.410
 explanation how to use this one 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:54.919
 beautiful in color instructions that too 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:56.540
 seldom so no choice 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.180
 But it does not look so nice in the beginning 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:05.810
 and of course why should you like me 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.010
 the htc itself being on the back 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.690
 I would not necessarily think now 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.150
 is gold silver has it really in 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.550
 so a silver alu touch but yes the 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.930
 frame the household brass bronze 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.970
 gold wants ware but it is felt 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.000
 eating easier than a galaxy but it 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.510
 gets bigger which is also massa and also 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.340
 longer 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.229
 you could once put against each other 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.260
 even very small ones can not do that 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:34.070
 all times next to each other 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:38.240
 yes they are htc now in the new samsung 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.490
 galaxy s 6 and s6 over still all 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.720
 next to each other and interesting if you are 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.480
 maybe to overlay and 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.170
 to watch how thin or thick they are 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.170
 to claim 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.400
 of course that's crazy yes 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.580
 as new is definitely bigger 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.880
 but then everything else in the 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:03.200
 individual tests the relative and it is 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.760
 clear that also extremely chosen what to 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.260
 do you see so the next tests 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:14.860
 will be the 9 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:14.860
 the s6 and the s6 6,6 and in the process 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:24.380
 maybe not forgotten but until 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.270

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.830
