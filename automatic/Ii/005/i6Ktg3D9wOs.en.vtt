00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
right pocket as well as the clip is so

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.060 
right pocket as well as the clip is so
strong<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.430> knife<00:01:39.619> that<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> makes<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
strong on this knife that it makes it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.440 
strong on this knife that it makes it
really<00:01:41.189> difficult<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> your

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
because of the strength of the clip and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.599 
a real quick short video just for him
and<00:03:16.660> I'm<00:03:17.660> going<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:17.959> leave<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.190> for<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.489> while

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
and I'm going to leave it on for a while

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.900 
and I'm going to leave it on for a while
so<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.030> he<00:03:20.209> can<00:03:20.390> get<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:22.040> advantage<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.790> it

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
so that he can get the advantage of it

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.500 
so that he can get the advantage of it
and<00:03:22.940> once<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.600> see<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:23.870> he's<00:03:25.090> seen<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.209> video

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
and once I see that he's seen the video

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.259 
and once I see that he's seen the video
and<00:03:30.130> commented<00:03:31.130> on<00:03:31.250> order<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:31.609> sent<00:03:32.120> me<00:03:32.150> a

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.180 
and commented on order and sent me a
message<00:03:32.630> on<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.989> then<00:03:33.260> I'll<00:03:33.709> probably<00:03:33.890> just<00:03:34.070> go

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
message on it then I'll probably just go

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.490
