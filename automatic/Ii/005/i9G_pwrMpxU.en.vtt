like<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.700> Australia<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:43.350> was

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
like this in Australia and that was

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
like this in Australia and that was
around<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.920> time<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.520> before<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.850> moved<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180

around the time just before I moved to
the<00:00:45.270> US<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.219> we<00:00:47.219> thought<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.610> due<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> do

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the US so we thought it was due to do

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.260 
the US so we thought it was due to do
another<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.489> we<00:00:50.489> put<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> together<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
another one and we put it together and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.049 
another one and we put it together and
here<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.899> Tasmania<00:00:52.530> right<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.789> next

here we are in Tasmania right the next

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.600 
here we are in Tasmania right the next
question<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:55.440> drives<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.039> life<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
question is what drives you in life and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279 
question is what drives you in life and
what<00:00:56.760> you're<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.360> become<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> best

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
what you're so you to become of the best

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.130 
what you're so you to become of the best
drivers<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.680> today<00:01:00.710> I'm<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.809> self<00:01:03.809> driven

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
drivers of today I'm a self driven
person<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.519> would<00:01:05.640> probably<00:01:05.790> be

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
person I think that would probably be

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
person I think that would probably be
the<00:01:06.090> best<00:01:06.330> way<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> describe<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.560> it's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the best way to describe it it's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.960 
the best way to describe it it's
difficult<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.310> where<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> inspiration

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
difficult to know where the inspiration

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.100 
difficult to know where the inspiration
and<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.830> continual<00:01:10.830> motivation<00:01:11.430> comes<00:01:11.610> from

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
and that continual motivation comes from

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
and that continual motivation comes from
there's<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.439> internal<00:01:14.040> fire<00:01:14.430> drive<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
there's just an internal fire drive that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
there's just an internal fire drive that
always<00:01:15.780> inspires<00:01:16.680> me<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> improve<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.520> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
always inspires me to improve and to to

an<00:04:35.750> important<00:04:36.470> crossroads<00:04:36.680> in<00:04:37.070> my<00:04:37.100> life<00:04:37.160> was

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
an important crossroads in my life was

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.080 
an important crossroads in my life was
the<00:04:38.570> time<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:39.080> moved<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.620> US<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.280> that

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.780 

really<00:04:44.090> keep<00:04:44.570> rereading<00:04:45.470> my<00:04:46.190> career<00:04:46.580> I'd

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
really keep rereading my career I'd

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.580 
really keep rereading my career I'd
reached<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.330> certain<00:04:47.510> level<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:48.020> Australia<00:04:48.560> and

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
reached a certain level in Australia and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.110 
reached a certain level in Australia and
and<00:04:50.320> really<00:04:51.320> didn't<00:04:52.070> know<00:04:52.250> how<00:04:52.610> else<00:04:52.640> to<00:04:52.880> push

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.670 
and really didn't know how else to push
forward<00:04:53.419> other<00:04:53.690> than<00:04:53.900> making<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.320> big<00:04:54.500> move

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680
