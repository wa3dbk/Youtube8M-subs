00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.070
 authenticity 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.600
 we have two cottages we 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.950
 have gites or if we have the chance 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.160
 to have a pool that is covered 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.010
 which we have an additional attraction for 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.479

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.490
 no calais is still a 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.930
 very varied landscape I think here we get 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.430
 located in the heart of boulonnais where it is 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.720
 a region that is quite hilly you 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.110
 do not have very far the plains of 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 flanders you have the artois who to our 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.040
 landscape is good I also think about 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.860
 the avesnois who are on the other 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.020
 side people say to themselves but what is 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.790
 that we will see well in the avesnois and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.729
 it's a beautiful region 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.490
 firstly the grove the apple trees 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.550

 4 ears of corn 4 ears of corn with 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.160
 tables d'hôtes for others who 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.289
 ask 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.090
 it was my grandparents' farm 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.020
 a beautiful little farm of the avesnois to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.840
 square courtyard 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.810
 we arranged it so 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.520
 they are good but the building 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.360
 remain authentic me the main 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.670
 interest of this cottage and she welcomes 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.200
 as well welcome people too 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.290
 that the players look good with a 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.120
 soothing sweet refined decoration and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.250
 the geographical situation also we are 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.290
 still practically in the field is 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.030
 very close to the big cities so the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.700
 largest city nearest 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.770
 we will see lille we are after a 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.480
 half an hour from near lille we are 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.160
 not far from valenciennes 10 minutes from 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.930
 Valenciennes and we are also at 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.610
 near saint-amand-the-waters which has 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.430
 a spa treatment of big cities 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.910
 radiates by their heritage such as 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.600
 Lille arras grand place of the arras 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.380
 ports calais dunkirk and boulogne it's 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.950
 still there is enough to spend a lot of 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.030
 day to visit the whole region 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.670
 now we also have the louvre-lens 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.230
 new museum coming in but you 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.690
 also have 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.400
 a fictional school that lives on the run 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.769
 you have musical that is not very far 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.330

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.920
 the museum matisse you have everything that 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.140
 is sure life but you have the pool 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.510
 but that's what museums are 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.830
 also some vestiges such as 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.940
 mines and terrines and the famous ones 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.940
 northern black mountains 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.319
 in fact our region is rich in 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.500
 many things we have a beautiful 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.020

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.030

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.690
 welcoming 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.520
 in fact that's what often stays when 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.470
 people leave others the tourist 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.390

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.650
 region and people's sympathy that 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.650
