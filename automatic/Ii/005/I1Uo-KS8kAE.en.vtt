hi<00:00:00.240> guys<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.510> is<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.900> speed<00:00:01.260> test<00:00:01.469> comparing

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hi guys this is a speed test comparing

33.6 seconds now what should be the

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.140 
33.6 seconds now what should be the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
fastest is the SSD connected via

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:26.770 
fastest is the SSD connected via
thunderbolt<00:03:13.290> first<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.469> all<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.739> right<00:03:14.920> test

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.390 

32.1<00:03:27.780> seconds<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.590> write<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.860> three<00:03:29.220> click

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
32.1 seconds to write a three click

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.800 
32.1 seconds to write a three click
above<00:03:29.580> I'll<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.150> now<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.050> retest<00:03:33.530> as<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:36.660> can

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
above I'll and now the retest as you can

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.900 
above I'll and now the retest as you can
see<00:03:36.990> that's<00:03:37.170> much<00:03:37.590> faster<00:03:38.160> than<00:03:38.280> any<00:03:38.550> of<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
see that's much faster than any of the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.130 
see that's much faster than any of the
previous<00:03:39.090> tests<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:45.210> was<00:03:45.330> fourteen

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
previous tests and that was fourteen

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.400 
previous tests and that was fourteen
point<00:03:46.590> four<00:03:46.890> seconds<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.900> these<00:03:49.140> are<00:03:49.320> the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
point four seconds so these are the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.290 
point four seconds so these are the
final<00:03:49.770> results<00:03:50.250> for<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.520> three<00:03:50.790> gigabyte

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
final results for the three gigabyte

just<00:04:51.570> took<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.870> results<00:04:52.020> for<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.740> file<00:04:53.100> copy

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
just took the results for the file copy

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.270 
just took the results for the file copy
test<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:54.169> divided<00:04:55.169> that<00:04:55.290> by<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.560> size<00:04:55.950> of<00:04:56.190> the
