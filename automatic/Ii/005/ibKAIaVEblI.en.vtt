00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.700
Hello Simon.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.292
Hello.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.680
Today is the 2nd day of the Rennes Tattoo Convention.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.220
Did it go well yesterday for you?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.420
A lot of work I guess.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.980
Yes, I was very busy.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.317
it was a great day.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.200
You've traveled from far away with Seb to come here.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.700
Yes.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.980
From Perpignan.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.200
We're used to it now. It's tiring but we stay focused.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.600
We don't get wasted at night:

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.960
We take a rest so we'll be fresh as a daisy for our customers the next day.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.660
Your tattoos are mainly in graphic style.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.000
And a little bit of dots.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.380
Dots style is more like something I'll add in my work but won't be the whole thing.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920
I'm not part of the tattoo artists that only do dots.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.720
Where does your inspiration come from?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.900
I look around on the web;

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.340
But not tattoo artists. I don't want to be inspired by them. It's not my thing.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.900
I prefer to look at the work of other artists like painters or illustrators.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.713
Then stuff comes to my mind;

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.940
And from that I start creating. And I try to bring original thoughts.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.380
Your shop; where you work with Seb InkMe is actually kind of special;

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.720
HIS shop.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.520
We work together but it's still his place.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.560
I like the collective.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.640
And it's a place that you share more or less with other tattooers?

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.780
Like Sadhu?

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.700
Well;

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.360
Sadhu has his own shop just next door to us. We share the same patio; downtown Perpignan

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.720
Our shops are really close to each other.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.860
So we each have our own styles.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.240
But we kind of work all together.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.400
Some clients go to the "Old Serb Tattoo Club" then come to see us;

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.180
Because they like what we do; and the other way around.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.880
So there's a real collective thing going on; and it's awesome.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.800
And because we all have very different styles; nobody is "stealing" the others' customers. It's great.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.880
Today, when we look at your creations;

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.540
Where would you say you are?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.180
Fully in research mode.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.360
It would be very presumptuous to say that in 4 years I've already found "my" style.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.120
I am still deeply researching my own style

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.300
I feed myself from what I see around me.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.744
And we'll see.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.220
At this moment do you have a particular tatto project?

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.680
That you'd really like to do?

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.360
Yes, I've made a drawing for a full back.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.840
It's 3 skulls merging into each other;

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.900
With two big...

00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:03.951
Geometrical shapes in movement.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.020
I'd really like to ink this drawing on someone.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.700
it's particular because it's a big project; very graphic.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.240
it's a real investment.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.620
For the client; physically and financially.

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:21.817
But I'll wait. I'm not in a hurry.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.760
Things will come along.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.300
You're currently doing graphic things;

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.520
You've been doing that from the start?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.940
Not at all.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.060
When I started I only did... Black things.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.320
Dots and a little bit of grey, but really dark.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.760
I think I confined myself too much to that.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.140
I'd only do that and didn't progress much at that time.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.420
So when I first got at InkMe;

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.160
I discovered many new perspectives.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.220
I've met different people and tattooers;

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.740
Really talented ones that opened my eyes.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.980
So I was able to catch up my lack of work.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.780
Now I try to work with colors.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.840
I love to ink it and put it in my drawings whereas I'd never use it before.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.820
Simon, I hope we'll get the chance to come see you soon.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.560
And meet the rest of the InkMe tattoo team.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.900
With great pleasure.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.100
Certainly.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.980
And we wish you a great 2nd day at the Rennes Tattoo Convention.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.340
Thanks

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.320
Energy, pleasure and happiness.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.480
We've got plenty of energy, so it'll go well.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.933
Awesome.

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:41.548
Thanks again and see you soon!

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:42.466
Thanks.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.140
