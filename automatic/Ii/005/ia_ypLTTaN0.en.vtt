Titan now I think it's most likely the
do<00:01:18.530> ice<00:01:18.710> tiny<00:01:19.069> cuz<00:01:19.399> but<00:01:19.880> we're<00:01:20.090> seeing<00:01:20.390> links

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
do ice tiny cuz but we're seeing links

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.510 
do ice tiny cuz but we're seeing links
you<00:01:21.020> know<00:01:21.170> wobbling<00:01:21.740> this<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.190> yeah<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:25.250> as<00:01:25.369> we

you know wobbling this so yeah so as we
can<00:01:25.640> see<00:01:25.790> closely<00:01:26.090> links<00:01:26.750> right<00:01:26.930> there<00:01:26.960> still

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
can see closely links right there still

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:41.899 
can see closely links right there still
wobbling<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:32.590> let's<00:01:33.590> you'll<00:01:33.770> be<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.040> winner

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
same rotation well I guess then our

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.539 
same rotation well I guess then our
winner<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:04.170> do<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.200> stay<00:03:05.650> looks<00:03:05.950> like<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.250> ice

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
winner is do I stay looks like that ice

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.600 
winner is do I stay looks like that ice
froze<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.450> fire<00:03:07.739> because<00:03:08.739> those<00:03:09.010> scores<00:03:09.430> now

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
froze the fire because those scores now

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:25.080 
froze the fire because those scores now
two<00:03:09.670> zero<00:03:10.329> zero<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.110> now<00:03:11.320> Round<00:03:11.620> three<00:03:24.090> fire

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090
