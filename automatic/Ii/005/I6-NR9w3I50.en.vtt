00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.570
 my name is niklas here knows me 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.609
 also as donna and become one 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.710
 some important before settings in the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.920
 make a menu before we actually 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.019
 We will continue to play 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.480
 with the basics to the micron macro 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.349
 and at the end of Tier1 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.110
 we will be our very first 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.170
 tears image learn the goal of this image 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.899
 it is with one and a half basis 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.600
 to start a very early attack and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.969
 the opponent early in the game too 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.379
 overpower 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.820
 but before we do we will 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.620
 now the important building units and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.710
 skills network 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.809
 that are relevant to tier 1 for us 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 At the beginning of a game we start with 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.579
 a main building and the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.769
 Work units at Berg means that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.310
 Main building the cherry and the workers 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.920
 one in hot droning the bother 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.130
 grants the player two free supplies 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 points continue to be here directly one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.820
 special feature about the protoss terraner 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.610
 Visible a hetz brings in namely 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.409
 regular intervals small larvae 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.829
 out 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.049
 Here one speaks also of spawning 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.960
 All larvae can be used on these larvae 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.329
 currently produce differently than at 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.220
 animals and at protoss need the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.409
 Pretty much a few production buildings 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.340
 at several units at the same time 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.009
 to produce 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.049
 they need more larvae 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.680
 At the beginning, the player is only the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.820
 Worker one has to dispose of the drones 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.840
 these are with resources, then 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.000
 minerals and wasps gas and can this 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.950
 others 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.130
 furthermore, the drone can be building 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.380
 build a drone transforms 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.599
 The building means that is 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.890
 The drone is completed 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.879
 just get away from the larvae with others 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.980
 unit types can be produced 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:24.090
 we need more technology first 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.700
 Incidentally, building day building can only be done 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.840
 So on the bread beat in English 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.069
 war the zerg be established war 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.780
 spreads around a hate around 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.610
 another feature of the war is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.099
 it is that the majority of ours 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.959
 units moves faster as long as he does 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.590
 is on the war next to the 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.890
 henry has the zerg player another 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.269
 possibility to get additional supply 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.730
 unlock points 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.650
 here is the supply generator 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.099
 zerg the overlord are also overlords 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.440
 a home and arise from a location where 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.659
 but can not fly to 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.489
 attack 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.659
 Wood gives the player eight free 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.209
 supply points 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.489
 drones can start without 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.190
 Another simple minerals from the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.200
 collecting minerals errors before we 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.980
 However, the second resource namely 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.099
 we need the westin gas 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.120
 first a building on a wasp gas 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.909
 collect 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.250
 this is called the zerg ex 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.840
 tractor we have an ex tractor 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.269
 on one the team gasquet she built 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.159
 can our start there there 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.489
 play together what the first building 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.680
 the zerg is the sporting pool we have 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.810
 the sporting pool completed can 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.750
 We now invite you also to our 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.450
 use around the first attacking one 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.360
 unit namely the very sound too 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.780
 In addition, the switch produces 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.590
 sporting pool the production of queens 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.660
 Free queens are the only zerg 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.660
 units not from a single store 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:11.519
 arise queens can in fact be 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.769
 directly in the hedge reproduce queens 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.769
 have three skills 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.840
 the most important of which we are about 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.340
 will only take care of it once 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.479
 the lava discovered we use this 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.050
 ability to rush so sport this 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.180
 henry additional charge we can 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.220
 our production capacity beside the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.289
 So hatch set it up 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.280
 also by using queens 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:44.639
 increase to say that the queen 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.979
 This energy has regenerated over energy 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.780
 about time alone and the 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.639
 We can just do it for the energy 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.960
 skills so also the stock in jack 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.960
 the queen go out 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.070
 the first poor unit of the Zerg are the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.849
 Pests infants are special 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.110
 cheap very small and very mobile 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.970
 they can only be in two packs 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.500
 to produce 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.660
 But you only need one location 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.610
 that means emerging from one situation 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.199
 Two blade Beijing have one 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.669
 melee attack and can 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.160
 strictly comply with beans 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.820
 attacking them trumps properly 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.470
 when you produce them in mass 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.660
 daily can become even more mobile if 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.660
 one upgrade namely the so-called 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.380
 speed upgrade 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.420
 sporting cool suburb in the course of 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.720
 play while sounding through more 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.710
 upgrades even stronger and are also in the 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.050
 late gameplay especially applied 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.970
 the mobility of cl bell sets one 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.130
 constant and very heavy 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.320
 controllable danger for the opponent 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.440
 after putting a sporting pool on the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.750
 field has brought more 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.190
 technologies unlocked 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.070
 also the next building namely the 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.410
 roadshow you have a word of done 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.410
 so it turns out the store the 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:11.660
 next ami without producing for me 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:14.000
 rogers are more expensive than the sword 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.620
 they withstand me and do more 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.240
 damage 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.680
 they have a detachment attack 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.330
 but he can only enter without people 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.880
 But they are not that fast 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.730
 how to define ticks last 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:32.860
 still a concept namely the natural 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:35.720
 Experts as expansion or expansion 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.820
 we call each other resources 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.980
 that we come up with a new one 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.690
 app for sure 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.720
 the natural expansion refers to this 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.190
 our very first explosion this one 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.470
 is in contrast to later 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:53.140
 resource deposits close to the first one 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.140
 base and relatively easy to defend
