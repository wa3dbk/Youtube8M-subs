howdy<00:00:14.450> this<00:00:15.450> time<00:00:15.750> i'm<00:00:15.960> reviewing<00:00:16.350> scalpel

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
howdy this time i'm reviewing scalpel

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.410 
howdy this time i'm reviewing scalpel
and<00:00:17.690> ejector<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.460> got<00:00:20.460> these<00:00:20.670> since<00:00:21.029> they're

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and ejector I got these since they're

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.390 
and ejector I got these since they're
the<00:00:21.450> closest<00:00:22.050> things<00:00:22.320> were<00:00:22.560> getting<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.189> real

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the closest things were getting to real

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.940

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
gear robots in revenge of the Fallen and

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.909 
gear robots in revenge of the Fallen and
I<00:00:26.939> kind<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.300> liked<00:00:27.509> those<00:00:27.810> figures<00:00:28.290> so<00:00:28.650> I

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
I kind of liked those figures so I

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.800 
I kind of liked those figures so I
thought<00:00:29.849> I'd<00:00:29.970> give<00:00:30.239> these<00:00:30.540> guys<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.899> try<00:00:32.810> both

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
thought I'd give these guys a try both

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.110 
thought I'd give these guys a try both

features the top section can slide up
and<00:01:25.229> down<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> real<00:01:27.390> thing<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:29.540> that's

and down like the real thing and that's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.459 
and down like the real thing and that's
about<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.409> mode<00:01:33.469> the

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
about it for this mode the

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.219 
about it for this mode the
transformation<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.820> involved<00:01:36.719> for<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
transformation is really involved for a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
transformation is really involved for a
scout<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.149> rather<00:01:39.149> frustrating<00:01:40.110> -<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.509> have

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
scout and rather frustrating - you have

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.630 
scout and rather frustrating - you have
to<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.930> particularly<00:01:43.380> careful<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> legs

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
to be particularly careful with the legs

00:01:44.640 --> 00:03:13.790 
to be particularly careful with the legs
so<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.600> pop<00:01:45.930> off

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.880 

the<00:03:14.310> robot<00:03:14.820> mode<00:03:15.030> model<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.960> movie-accurate

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the robot mode model is movie-accurate

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.430 
the robot mode model is movie-accurate
but<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.760> colors<00:03:18.120> aren't<00:03:18.390> since<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
but the colors aren't since it was a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.970 
but the colors aren't since it was a
different<00:03:19.920> microscope<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.640> begin<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.150> I

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
different microscope to begin with I

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.380 
different microscope to begin with I
like<00:03:22.980> how<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.250> purple<00:03:23.730> adds<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.120> little<00:03:24.270> more

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
like how the purple adds a little more

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.260 
like how the purple adds a little more
evilness<00:03:24.930> though<00:03:25.320> as<00:03:26.280> if<00:03:26.460> this<00:03:26.640> wasn't<00:03:26.910> creepy

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
evilness though as if this wasn't creepy

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.670 
evilness though as if this wasn't creepy
looking<00:03:27.690> enough<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:29.180> word<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.300> advice<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:31.380> may

looking enough a word of advice you may

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680 
looking enough a word of advice you may
want<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.130> trim<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.490> antenna<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.540> it's

want to trim the antenna so that it's

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.080 
want to trim the antenna so that it's
