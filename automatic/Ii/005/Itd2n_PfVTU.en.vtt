course is one of those key things and it
goes<00:03:03.780> way<00:03:04.320> beyond<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:05.100> removing<00:03:05.700> those<00:03:06.090> food

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
goes way beyond just removing those food

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.090 
goes way beyond just removing those food
particles<00:03:06.780> from<00:03:06.810> between<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.290> teeth<00:03:07.470> yes

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
flossing is imperative the teeth have a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.199 
flossing is imperative the teeth have a
lot<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.140> surface<00:03:10.380> area<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.890> lot<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.130> hard<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.670> get

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
lot of surface area a lot of hard to get

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.940 
lot of surface area a lot of hard to get
places<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.930> food<00:03:13.110> gets<00:03:13.320> trapped<00:03:13.530> all<00:03:13.739> over

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
places and food gets trapped all over

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.170 
places and food gets trapped all over
and<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.519> really<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:14.820> all<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.970> food

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
and you have to really get all the food

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.550 
and you have to really get all the food
out<00:03:15.360> because<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.810> food<00:03:16.019> accumulates

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
out because the food accumulates

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.470 
out because the food accumulates
bacteria<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.549> bacteria<00:03:17.580> cause<00:03:18.209> bad

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
bacteria and the bacteria cause bad

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.690 
bacteria and the bacteria cause bad
breath<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.959> decay<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.830> flossing<00:03:20.400> actually

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
breath and decay so flossing actually

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.039 
breath and decay so flossing actually
gets<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:20.970> between<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.269> teeth<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.690> gets<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
gets in between the teeth and gets the

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.020 
gets in between the teeth and gets the
food<00:03:22.230> particles<00:03:22.739> out<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.580> also<00:03:23.730> gets

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
food particles out and it also gets

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.940 
food particles out and it also gets
underneath<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.660> gums<00:03:24.870> as<00:03:25.110> there's<00:03:25.680> different

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
underneath the gums as there's different

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.710 
underneath the gums as there's different
types<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.280> floss<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:27.120> use<00:03:27.540> what's

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
best for you this wax floss people with

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.090 
best for you this wax floss people with
very<00:03:30.030> tight<00:03:30.330> contacts<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.620> back<00:03:31.950> of

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
very tight contacts so in the back of

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.650 
very tight contacts so in the back of
your<00:03:32.160> mouth<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.459> posterior<00:03:32.850> some<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.570> those

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
your mouth the posterior some of those

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.240 
your mouth the posterior some of those
molars<00:03:34.049> are<00:03:34.200> really<00:03:34.410> tight<00:03:34.650> together<00:03:34.860> it's

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
molars are really tight together it's

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.009 
molars are really tight together it's
hard<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.489> get<00:03:35.640> regular<00:03:35.790> floss<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.450> there<00:03:36.600> so

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
hard to get regular floss in there so

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.840 
hard to get regular floss in there so
that<00:03:37.620> person<00:03:38.010> should<00:03:38.130> use<00:03:38.220> waxed<00:03:38.640> floss

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
that person should use waxed floss

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.100 
that person should use waxed floss
because<00:03:38.970> wax<00:03:39.329> actually<00:03:39.690> gets<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:39.989> there

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
because wax actually gets in there

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.870 
because wax actually gets in there
easier<00:03:40.380> slips<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.829> there<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.519> easier<00:03:41.760> to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
easier slips in there and it's easier to

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.090 
easier slips in there and it's easier to
get<00:03:41.970> through<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:43.380> again<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.769> should<00:03:43.799> try

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
get through so again you should try

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.350
