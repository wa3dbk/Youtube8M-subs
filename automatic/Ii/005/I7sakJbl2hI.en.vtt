00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.299
 where people here is simon and i explain 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.140
 today why play with your 16 3 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.570
 with front handle 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.490
 this question came under our esl video 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.410
 and chose not a good youtube channel 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.460
 if I'm on our community so you guys 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.710
 so alex would have us 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.199
 asked why em using 16 frontex 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.970
 this comment has seven thumbs up 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.750
 that means it should be at least seven 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.030
 people know 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.000
 I appreciate even more valuable to 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.120
 replied balz goes basta I explain 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.339
 But now why exactly why freeplay 87 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.720
 i had written why a time too 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.360
 it will not reduce any time recall 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.159
 which gives you less recall in 16 hand 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.739
 but quite no that's 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.339
 exaggerated 0.1 to the left 03 after 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.949
 right 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.799
 which means I'm just a plot one the 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.239
 I have created program protic yes 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.010
 we stop the n16 if you forgive 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.140
 Continuous fire makes you the first 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.760
 four shots in different colors like that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.400
 one sees it left in 16 3 without 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.830
 all up and right in 16 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.240
 3 with handle here you can especially on 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.890
 first shot pretty much see what 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.450
 stop the accuracy of the weapon down 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 screwed the ball is spread 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.290
 much bigger you see the circle 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.520
 the green on the right is larger 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.830
 we are already in our touch with 32 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.170
 16 3 said that the grip on the weapon 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.750
 not really great but ours 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.810
 subscribers seamonkey 01 I know there too 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.460
 help and answered promptly because he 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.290
 material plays and that the recall 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.480
 then the front handle increases 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.070
 dating is not so good on long distances 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.450
 but there are in that almost it 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.680
 never, yes, and the heavy run increased 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.700
 the rebound upwards 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.350
 but at the same time, too 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.670
 Accuracy increases, that means balls 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.350
 more exactly where to go 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.080
 so now she says you're gonna do that 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.870
 grab this 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.210
 recoil recovers you mean was 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.290
 it is more important but wrong 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.250
 and that increases the accuracy and 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.720
 grasping reduces that again 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.150
 bit but the revival increases the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.650
 more than the funeral reduces that 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.660
 grab hold again to relax 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.890
 because he already has a small recoil 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.720
 to the left and right still has to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.730
 due if you again the table 1 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.800
 So you see on the right picture 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.560
 The left is only the right one with lever 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.000
 is seized with and would would you see 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.430
 the left in contrast to the very first 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.810
 is already the green point really clear 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.180
 is the shot long exactly where yes 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.680
 also looks at the first shot at 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.820
 right picture you see that's that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.410
 Altogether a bit in the middle 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.880
 is clarified ie the handle 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.600
 reduce your conclusions 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.310
 left and right 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 you see that the green dot 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.490
 little bigger than on the left 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.930
 bild the power has the handle that the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.730
 inaccuracy on remove but the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.980
 green dot right is still smaller 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.540
 as without Countess terry farrell together 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.580
 I hope that now reasonably 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.260
 understandably that has the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.670
 explain why you're in 16 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.380
 use handle and terrible 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.070
 Thank you for always and ever 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.070
