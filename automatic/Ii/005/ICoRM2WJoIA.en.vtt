want to get some better glass
we<00:03:39.760> don't<00:03:39.970> need<00:03:40.120> glasses<00:03:40.510> we<00:03:40.930> have<00:03:41.230> a

advantage<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:57.100> high<00:03:57.250> speed<00:03:57.310> auto<00:03:57.790> test

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
advantage on the high speed auto test

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.259 
advantage on the high speed auto test
that<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.530> Ford<00:03:59.769> Focus<00:04:00.040> will<00:04:00.400> be<00:04:00.489> fastest<00:04:01.090> when

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
that the Ford Focus will be fastest when

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.270 
that the Ford Focus will be fastest when
it<00:04:01.360> comes<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.780> lapping<00:04:02.320> this<00:04:02.470> angle<00:04:02.950> tear<00:04:03.100> a

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
it comes to lapping this angle tear a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.699 
it comes to lapping this angle tear a
circuit<00:04:04.170> okay<00:04:05.170> one<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.739> one<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:08.140> angle<00:04:08.560> see

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
circuit okay one that one the angle see

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.009 
circuit okay one that one the angle see
track<00:04:09.070> rewards<00:04:09.700> are<00:04:09.850> balanced<00:04:10.299> chassis<00:04:10.420> as

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
track rewards are balanced chassis as

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.800 
track rewards are balanced chassis as
much<00:04:11.290> as<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.500> powerful<00:04:11.860> engine<00:04:12.370> so<00:04:13.090> this<00:04:13.360> will

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
much as a powerful engine so this will

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.789 
much as a powerful engine so this will
be<00:04:13.930> close<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:15.040> penalty<00:04:15.430> loser<00:04:15.730> goes<00:04:16.390> first

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.220 

boys<00:04:20.799> let's<00:04:21.190> see<00:04:21.370> what<00:04:21.579> she<00:04:21.730> does

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:54.860 

understand<00:04:26.390> into<00:04:27.710> turn<00:04:51.620> one<00:04:52.620> minute<00:04:53.870> twenty

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
understand into turn one minute twenty

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.660 
understand into turn one minute twenty
two<00:04:55.350> point<00:04:55.740> nine<00:04:56.190> seconds<00:04:57.000> sounds<00:04:57.570> good<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.900> me

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
two point nine seconds sounds good to me

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:13.330 
two point nine seconds sounds good to me
so<00:04:59.670> can<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.300> Evo<00:05:00.750> beat<00:05:01.050> it

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.730 

I<00:05:13.600> think<00:05:14.600> it's<00:05:14.750> better<00:05:14.960> off<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.260> corner<00:05:15.590> of

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
I think it's better off the corner of

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:24.030 
I think it's better off the corner of
yours<00:05:15.950> is<00:05:16.070> rather<00:05:16.280> dear

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:35.250 

minute<00:05:26.760> 21.9<00:05:27.760> for<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.210> second<00:05:34.050> now<00:05:35.050> of<00:05:35.110> course

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
minute 21.9 for the second now of course

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.290 
minute 21.9 for the second now of course
the<00:05:35.680> real<00:05:35.890> reason<00:05:36.280> I<00:05:36.370> grabbed<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.790> four<00:05:37.030> would

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
the real reason I grabbed the four would

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.480 
the real reason I grabbed the four would
cos<00:05:37.510> you<00:05:37.780> said<00:05:38.230> it<00:05:38.530> was<00:05:38.740> probably<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.280> best

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
cos you said it was probably the best

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.280 
cos you said it was probably the best
hot<00:05:39.820> hatch<00:05:40.000> in<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.270> world<00:05:40.420> if<00:05:40.540> not<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.840> best

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
hot hatch in the world if not the best

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.780 
hot hatch in the world if not the best
so<00:05:42.010> what<00:05:42.130> went<00:05:42.250> wrong

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
so what went wrong

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.000 
so what went wrong
yeah<00:05:43.150> I<00:05:43.210> stand<00:05:43.630> by<00:05:43.780> that<00:05:43.810> on<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.440> road<00:05:44.620> as<00:05:44.890> an

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
yeah I stand by that on the road as an

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.280 
yeah I stand by that on the road as an
everyday<00:05:45.520> all<00:05:45.850> rounding<00:05:46.330> it's<00:05:46.480> a<00:05:46.600> great<00:05:46.960> job

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
everyday all rounding it's a great job

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.980 
everyday all rounding it's a great job
but<00:05:47.770> on<00:05:47.920> the<00:05:48.010> track<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.550> Evo<00:05:48.850> is<00:05:49.090> a<00:05:49.150> better

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
but on the track the Evo is a better

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.800 
but on the track the Evo is a better
much<00:05:50.710> better<00:05:50.740> car<00:05:51.220> what<00:05:52.120> car<00:05:52.360> would<00:05:52.510> you<00:05:52.690> have

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
much better car what car would you have
