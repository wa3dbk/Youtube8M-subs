00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.870
 that we are evaluating the possibility of 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.269
 this service 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.990
 a little informally it was 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.990
 your 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.660
 randazo we have part approval 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.640
 of the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.160
 so that we look libertarian in the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.840
 Decision making 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.400
 wants to do it has the will of 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 doing so would accompany this decision 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.860
 acting with a lot of responsibility 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.489
 auditions on the tenth day that 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.489
 correspond 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.120
 minimal infrastructure to boot and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.410
 try I think it would be very important 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.410
 be a headquarters 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.180
 what we could show 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.960
 because so many years with this 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.960
 well the service 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.090
 Of course there will be a period 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.900
 of test where there is an unknown 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.900
 how it would work 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.860
 expectation for being an area 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.640
 stop traveling by car the car had its 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 version 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.900
 Buenos Aires, well, let's tell you that it's going to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.670
 have a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.460
 a trial period 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.050
 where that mystery is going to be due to 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.130
 subtracting us we encourage 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.579
 to make this decision 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.579
 I repeat 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.799
 I reiterate, let's say the will of the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.210
 minister or not of the line also of 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.210
 accompanying was this crisis 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.630
 the manager of the fragrance 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.630
 the Angel 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 just as art 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.890
 30 years ago 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.540
 or a circuit 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.650
 from pillar to cable we have done everything 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.450
 We talked to customers 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.810
 because it moves through the parking lot 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.810
 legs 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.020
 collectives of also right 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.020
 has a double 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.650
 I do not know for us it's a reality 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.650
 right accompany a very long 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.310
 she sees need it 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.420
 let's put everything to be able 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.180
 but worse so that I am different 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.180
 and leave a message 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.849
 we are gonna get 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.769
 possibility that the June deadline 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.749
 also included 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.520
 running to apple orchards already with the 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:17.980
 rest of laminates 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.490
 we are on that path and in the works 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.490
 we were doing 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.880
 and when we tell him 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.700
 we think that before operatives for all 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.140
 completed the course 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.140
 for the rest of the line
