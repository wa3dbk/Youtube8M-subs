he blasts it high he's just gone from
power<00:01:25.240> instead<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:25.750> accuracy<00:01:26.079> and<00:01:26.409> it's<00:01:26.619> not

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
power instead of accuracy and it's not

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.370 
power instead of accuracy and it's not
working<00:01:27.280> he<00:01:27.789> places<00:01:28.149> it<00:01:28.329> on<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.689> spot<00:01:28.899> steps

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.789 
working he places it on the spot steps
back<00:01:29.759> pauses<00:01:30.759> looks<00:01:31.299> fairly<00:01:31.630> relaxed<00:01:32.170> but

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
back pauses looks fairly relaxed but

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:40.300 
back pauses looks fairly relaxed but
it's<00:01:32.979> not<00:01:33.219> must<00:01:33.880> be<00:01:34.090> beating<00:01:34.450> like<00:01:34.569> crazy

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310
