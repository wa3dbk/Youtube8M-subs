00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.640 

inside<00:01:03.720> this<00:01:04.720> design<00:01:05.170> is<00:01:05.199> three<00:01:06.070> spaces<00:01:06.370> white

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
inside this design is three spaces white

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.780 
inside this design is three spaces white
unlike<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.770> other<00:01:08.890> design<00:01:09.250> i<00:01:09.280> just<00:01:09.610> said

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
unlike the other design i just said

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.990 
unlike the other design i just said
showed<00:01:10.240> which<00:01:10.479> was<00:01:10.660> four<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.700> scroll<00:01:12.940> up

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
showed which was four got to scroll up

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.650 
showed which was four got to scroll up
again<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:14.640> yet<00:01:15.640> another<00:01:15.880> time<00:01:16.180> i'll<00:01:16.360> be<00:01:16.390> using

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
again and yet another time i'll be using

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.630 
again and yet another time i'll be using
the<00:01:16.930> third<00:01:17.170> eyeballs<00:01:17.740> on<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:19.150> edges<00:01:19.479> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the third eyeballs on the edges the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.260 
the third eyeballs on the edges the
platform<00:01:25.560> right<00:01:26.560> now<00:01:26.890> i'm<00:01:27.250> going<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.119> go<00:01:28.240> back

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
platform right now i'm going to go back

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.080 
platform right now i'm going to go back
to<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:29.440> air<00:01:30.009> on<00:01:30.190> i<00:01:30.369> used<00:01:30.640> on<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.970> other

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
to the air on i used on the other

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.150 
to the air on i used on the other
station<00:01:31.900> which<00:01:32.080> was<00:01:32.110> sk<00:01:32.890> h<00:01:33.149> shr<00:01:34.149> 91<00:01:35.160> scroll

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
station which was sk h shr 91 scroll

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.859 
station which was sk h shr 91 scroll
down<00:01:36.369> until<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.790> come<00:01:37.090> across<00:01:37.270> station

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
down until you come across station

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.950 
down until you come across station
platform<00:01:38.440> will<00:01:38.710> be<00:01:38.800> using<00:01:39.009> this<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.720> put

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
platform will be using this just to put

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.840 
platform will be using this just to put
them<00:01:41.080> on<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.710> station<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.340> make<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.670> look<00:01:42.789> more

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
them on the station to make it look more

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.160 
them on the station to make it look more
realistic<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:46.360> it's<00:01:46.570> going<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.869> be<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> little

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
realistic as it's going to be a little

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.350 
realistic as it's going to be a little
bit<00:01:47.289> more<00:01:47.530> difficult<00:01:47.740> i'm<00:01:48.670> going<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.910> use<00:01:49.119> the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
bit more difficult i'm going to use the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.980 
bit more difficult i'm going to use the
scenery<00:01:50.229> items<00:01:50.710> menu<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.369> use<00:01:52.360> gadgets
