over the right side we have the sim slot
moving<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
moving to the back you can see that it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990 
moving to the back you can see that it
is<00:01:48.720> covered<00:01:49.110> by<00:01:49.259> glass<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.640> corning

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
is covered by glass this is corning

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
is covered by glass this is corning
gorilla<00:01:51.090> glass<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> back<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.320> well<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.619> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
it's a pretty laggy you i but otherwise

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.309 
it's a pretty laggy you i but otherwise
features<00:02:45.180> are<00:02:45.299> good<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.659> is<00:02:45.689> no<00:02:45.870> app<00:02:46.019> list
