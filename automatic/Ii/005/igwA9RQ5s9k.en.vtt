00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.510 

I<00:03:25.810> think<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.710> week<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:26.920> reach<00:03:27.280> advantage

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
I think that week that reach advantage

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.470 
I think that week that reach advantage
is<00:03:27.910> starting<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.210> take<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.390> store<00:03:28.750> now

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.100 

to<00:03:33.870> book<00:03:34.050> Clint's<00:03:34.470> work

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.230 

you<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:37.800> I'm<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.190> world<00:03:38.370> now<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.610> think<00:03:38.880> once

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
you have I'm the world now I think once

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.660 
you have I'm the world now I think once
it's<00:03:39.420> getting<00:03:39.600> too<00:03:39.690> abruptly<00:03:40.020> much<00:03:40.230> Steve

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
it's getting too abruptly much Steve

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.860 
it's getting too abruptly much Steve
yeah<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.700> think<00:03:41.850> she's<00:03:42.150> near<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.420> right<00:03:42.570> choice

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
yeah I think she's near the right choice

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.440 
yeah I think she's near the right choice
I<00:03:43.140> think<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.740> cause<00:03:44.040> they<00:03:44.340> was<00:03:44.880> gettin<00:03:45.240> over

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
I think I cause they was gettin over

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.020 
I think I cause they was gettin over
hand<00:03:45.630> over<00:03:45.930> with<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.070> with<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.670> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
hand over with it with it that the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.360 
hand over with it with it that the
punches<00:03:48.540> which<00:03:49.140> has<00:03:49.380> got<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.650> pool<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:50.070> good

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
punches which has got a pool a good

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.170 
punches which has got a pool a good
reach<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:51.360> top<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.410> vandor<00:03:52.950> well<00:03:53.090> run<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
reach on top of vandor well run the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.080 
reach on top of vandor well run the
world's<00:03:54.420> gone<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:55.530> some<00:03:55.710> good<00:03:55.860> defense<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:57.030> I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
world's gone but some good defense but I

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.540 
world's gone but some good defense but I
think<00:03:57.360> she<00:03:57.480> needs<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.750> close<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.170> gap<00:03:58.550> being

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
think she needs to close the gap being

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.170 
think she needs to close the gap being
