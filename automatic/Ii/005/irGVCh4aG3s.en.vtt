00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.510
 and as a last modal system we are going to 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.310
 work on the wind system because 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.960
 I say the last system because he created it 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.540
 we are eliminating it from the systems 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.769
 manners is an agreed that if I can not 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.019
 use 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.480
 within the concept of momentary modes 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.789
 but it is very complicated to build a 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.869
 system I think it has more than one 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 I agreed, I can for example establish a 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.410
 semi-diminished chord that all my 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.329
 song be a semi-diminished chord u 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.009
 eight bars in a semi-chord 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.980
 diminished and there if I can touch as 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.719
 system but a system of one 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.700
 movement any movement in the what 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.039
 I think it makes any other chord goes 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.590
 to be resolutive base is going to feel that 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.239
 the semi-diminished chord was a chord 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.150
 cadences to solve in another chord 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.120
 therefore my systems are going to 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.790
 leave in five the Ionian is much more 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.000
 comfortable to work it as a tonal system and 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.899
 he does not think we have a system for 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.420
 develop and again thinking about the 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.829
 tonal system concept us 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.110
 we also have a lower tonal system 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.280
 which is where we are deriving the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.970
 mode 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.090
 wind I start putting the field 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.560
 harmonic of 2 the minor seventh 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.570
 if minor seventh with fifth diminished 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.370
 seventh largest 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:29.540
 re minor seventh minor seventh 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.120
 seventh largest and seventh sun as it came 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.140
 saying we could play tonally 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.490
 in the minor using these same chords 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.050
 but not only these same chords 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.820
 because we had to borrow the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.420
 dominant of the harmonic minor scale 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.150
 to be able to play tonally with the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.320
 stabilities and instabilities and the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.570
 well-defined dominance if you want to use 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.270
 only these chords are we talking about 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.900
 of the wind system is a very 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.290
 different to play tonally in the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.360
 minor tonality and playing modally 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.020
 in the wind system that what we're going to 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.140
 develop now 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.910
 we repeat 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.830
 this of the elimination of the three 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.170
 tones we do not have chords in my 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.130
 diminished nor dominant chord because 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.560
 we repeated those two chords they stole us 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.030
 the center to the minor and they led us to 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.900
 greater 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.910
 then what was the characteristic note 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.640
 in 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.070
 the lico lico was the fa note again 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.010
 the chords containing fa will be 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.640
 cadence then we have the chord 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.920
 of the minor is tonic 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.470
 the C major has no fa therefore it is 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.900
 no cadence 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.870
 the king has faith in cadence 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.409
 the child does not have the fa grade so 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.280
 so much is not cadence the fa if you have the 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:01.730
 note therefore it is cadence and the sun 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.549
 greater than three notes does not have the sun 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.739
 greater than four notes and the sun are 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.630
 dominant if they have the fa note in this 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.620
 case is absent therefore it is 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.620
 no cadence 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.250
 and formulated this we would be left 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.870
 first grade seventh minor 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.630
 third degree flat 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.700
 seventh major that is a chord not 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.450
 cadence 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.019
 fourth grade seventh minor as a chord 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.170
 cadence to fifth grade seventh minor 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.300
 as a chord not cadence 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.330
 6th grade flat 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.800
 seventh highest as cadence chord and 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.190
 seventh grade flat major as a chord not 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.620
 cadence 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.620
 this progression could be 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.530
 working all the cadence the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.760
 cadence the credential could be left 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.760
 as follows 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.420
 tonic 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.010
 the youngest seventh 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.269
 cadence 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.269
 we work with the minor re ' 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.500
 1 cadence to the sun 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.500
 cadence 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.070
 and this would sound like this 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.430
 or 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.689
 or 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.170
 and we feel that we are playing in the 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.010
 minor although we're not going through those 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:04.900
 two dominant chords to solve 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.520
 to solve the minor's own 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.030
 tonal system but we're 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.720
 allowing this simple system of 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.770
 six chords lead us in a way 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.340
 much more 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.310
 simple if you want to remember the 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.669
 minor is usually when we 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.409
 we are working on pop songs not 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.870
 we are working on tonal systems 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.009
 with all the alternatives of the 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.530
 tonal system we are simply 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.419
 taking four chords of a scale 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.610
 bigger and we're working it as a cycle 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.080
 that is more much more typical of 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.470
 modal systems that systems 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.470
 tonal
