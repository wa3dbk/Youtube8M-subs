and you're going to want to be able to
do<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.969> it's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
do that so if you can do that it's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.810 
do that so if you can do that it's
pretty<00:00:49.050> good<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.910> remember<00:00:50.910> that's<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.989> I

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
pretty good so remember that's it I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.740 
pretty good so remember that's it I
think<00:00:53.820> most<00:00:54.420> people<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:56.629> if<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
think most people can do that but if you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.319 
think most people can do that but if you
can't<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.289> want<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.680> practice<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.550> once

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
can't you want to practice that and once

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.990 
can't you want to practice that and once
you<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:01.489> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> next<00:01:02.730> step

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you get that then going to the next step

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.539 
you get that then going to the next step
next<00:01:03.300> step<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> learn<00:01:03.949> trying<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> was

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
next step I learn trying to do it was

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.570 
next step I learn trying to do it was
going<00:01:06.000> down<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.340> leaning

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
going down here and then just leaning

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.130 
going down here and then just leaning
back<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.600> bit<00:01:11.270> okay<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.689> lean

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
back like this a little bit okay so lean

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.390 
back like this a little bit okay so lean
back<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:13.950> bit<00:01:14.189> um<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.400> like

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
back like that a little bit um so like

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
back like that a little bit um so like
that<00:01:19.970> keep<00:01:20.970> being<00:01:21.180> able<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.659> go

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that keep being able to do that go

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
that keep being able to do that go
farther<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> further<00:01:22.950> back<00:01:23.220> eventually

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
farther the further back eventually

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.910 
farther the further back eventually
you'll<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.270> able<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> go<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.560> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you'll be able to go like that you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.850 
you'll be able to go like that you
should<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.360> paddling<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> ground<00:01:27.869> here

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
should be paddling with the ground here

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.380 
should be paddling with the ground here
to<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.759> then<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> pop<00:01:33.150> up
