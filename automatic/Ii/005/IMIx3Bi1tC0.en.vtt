00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.690 

so<00:00:09.429> here<00:00:09.849> is<00:00:10.089> your<00:00:10.540> classic<00:00:11.440> dropper<00:00:12.429> rig

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
so here is your classic dropper rig

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.220 
so here is your classic dropper rig
which<00:00:13.089> has<00:00:13.299> kind<00:00:13.599> of<00:00:13.629> been<00:00:13.719> replaced<00:00:14.110> with

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
which has kind of been replaced with

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.830 
which has kind of been replaced with
some<00:00:14.440> of<00:00:14.499> these<00:00:14.589> newer<00:00:14.799> ones<00:00:15.039> and<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:16.330> I<00:00:16.630> send

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
some of these newer ones and as I send

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.390 
some of these newer ones and as I send
the<00:00:16.930> article<00:00:17.080> I'm<00:00:17.349> not<00:00:17.529> sure<00:00:17.710> it<00:00:17.830> should<00:00:18.039> be<00:00:18.189> I

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
the article I'm not sure it should be I

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.890 
the article I'm not sure it should be I
think<00:00:18.789> the<00:00:18.880> newer<00:00:19.090> ones<00:00:19.300> have<00:00:19.390> their<00:00:19.660> place

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
think the newer ones have their place

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.599 
think the newer ones have their place
but<00:00:19.929> i<00:00:20.199> think<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.650> dropper<00:00:21.070> Rick's<00:00:21.250> still<00:00:21.460> has

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
but i think the dropper Rick's still has

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.179 
but i think the dropper Rick's still has
some<00:00:21.789> big<00:00:21.939> advantages<00:00:22.710> you've<00:00:23.710> got<00:00:23.859> a<00:00:23.890> really

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
some big advantages you've got a really

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.810 
some big advantages you've got a really
heavy<00:00:24.519> point<00:00:25.390> fly<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:27.039> at<00:00:27.160> least<00:00:27.250> this<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.640> my

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
heavy point fly and at least this is my

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.839 
heavy point fly and at least this is my
version<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.390> classic<00:00:28.509> dropping<00:00:29.170> ring<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
version of the classic dropping ring and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.880 
version of the classic dropping ring and
then<00:00:31.779> that's<00:00:32.050> going<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.320> carry<00:00:32.530> everything

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
then that's going to carry everything

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.270 
then that's going to carry everything
down<00:00:33.250> so<00:00:33.550> heavy<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.180> good<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:35.440> here<00:00:35.500> we<00:00:36.130> have

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
down so heavy is good up here we have

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.160 
down so heavy is good up here we have
some<00:00:36.490> kind<00:00:36.700> of<00:00:36.730> a<00:00:36.850> stop<00:00:37.120> or<00:00:37.300> not<00:00:37.330> which<00:00:37.900> could

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
some kind of a stop or not which could

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.020 
some kind of a stop or not which could
be<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.440> you<00:00:39.130> know<00:00:39.250> if<00:00:39.370> you're<00:00:39.490> tied<00:00:39.640> on<00:00:39.760> your<00:00:39.880> tip

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
be a you know if you're tied on your tip

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.280 
be a you know if you're tied on your tip
it<00:00:40.180> pretty<00:00:40.360> close<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.990> could<00:00:41.140> be<00:00:41.200> your

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
it pretty close that could be your

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.170 
it pretty close that could be your
typical<00:00:41.500> or<00:00:41.980> it<00:00:42.070> could<00:00:42.250> be<00:00:42.280> just<00:00:42.550> a<00:00:42.700> stop<00:00:43.000> or

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
typical or it could be just a stop or

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.560 
typical or it could be just a stop or
not<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.540> know<00:00:43.740> figure<00:00:44.740> 8<00:00:44.920> type<00:00:45.160> of<00:00:45.310> not<00:00:45.570> above

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
not you know figure 8 type of not above

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.420 
not you know figure 8 type of not above
that<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:47.110> little<00:00:47.560> bit<00:00:47.620> of<00:00:47.740> Tippett<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.220> used

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
that a little bit of Tippett and I used

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.860 
that a little bit of Tippett and I used
heavy<00:00:48.610> tip<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:48.970> here<00:00:49.150> so<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.420> could<00:00:49.570> see

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
heavy tip it here so you could see

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.990 
heavy tip it here so you could see
everything<00:00:50.140> obviously<00:00:50.490> this<00:00:51.490> is<00:00:51.700> heavier

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
everything obviously this is heavier

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.040 
everything obviously this is heavier
than<00:00:52.060> you<00:00:52.270> would<00:00:52.360> normally<00:00:52.390> use<00:00:52.720> this

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
than you would normally use this

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.950 
than you would normally use this
probably<00:00:53.500> 2x<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:54.730> you're<00:00:54.820> probably<00:00:54.910> using<00:00:55.330> 4x

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
probably 2x and you're probably using 4x

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.280 
probably 2x and you're probably using 4x
a<00:00:56.140> 3x<00:00:56.530> but<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.420> I<00:00:58.570> usually<00:00:58.840> use<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.990> lighter

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
a 3x but and I usually use a lighter

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.070 
a 3x but and I usually use a lighter
Tippett<00:00:59.710> for<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.820> dropper<00:01:01.270> fly<00:01:01.450> but<00:01:01.720> this<00:01:01.900> is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
Tippett for the dropper fly but this is

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.130 
Tippett for the dropper fly but this is
you<00:01:02.590> know<00:01:02.710> as<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:03.820> fish<00:01:04.089> this<00:01:04.330> fly<00:01:04.570> over<00:01:04.869> this

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
you know as I fish this fly over this

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.130 
you know as I fish this fly over this
system<00:01:05.740> over<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:05.920> years<00:01:06.219> I've<00:01:07.210> brought<00:01:07.539> the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
system over the years I've brought the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.800 
system over the years I've brought the
dropper<00:01:08.500> fly<00:01:08.679> down<00:01:08.890> closer<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.429> the<00:01:10.090> point<00:01:10.600> fly

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
dropper fly down closer to the point fly

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.450 
dropper fly down closer to the point fly
so<00:01:11.140> that<00:01:11.259> it's<00:01:11.380> down<00:01:11.649> in<00:01:11.859> the<00:01:11.950> zone<00:01:11.979> down

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
so that it's down in the zone down

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.609 
so that it's down in the zone down
within<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.789> foot<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.149> bottom<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:13.689> I've

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
within a foot of the bottom and I've

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.950 
within a foot of the bottom and I've
shortened<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.759> Tippett<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.539> dropper

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
shortened this Tippett to the dropper

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.050 
shortened this Tippett to the dropper
fly<00:01:17.140> more<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.530> more<00:01:17.710> that's<00:01:18.039> that's<00:01:18.820> about

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
fly more and more that's that's about

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.489 
fly more and more that's that's about
typical<00:01:19.479> for<00:01:19.600> me<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:19.810> that's<00:01:19.869> not<00:01:20.109> very<00:01:20.229> long

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
typical for me and that's not very long

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.590 
typical for me and that's not very long
that's<00:01:20.859> probably<00:01:21.070> five<00:01:21.609> inches<00:01:21.969> maybe<00:01:22.329> not

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
that's probably five inches maybe not

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.020 
that's probably five inches maybe not
even<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:22.869> I'm<00:01:23.200> not<00:01:23.380> sure<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.700> course<00:01:24.729> you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
even that I'm not sure and of course you

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.859 
even that I'm not sure and of course you
can<00:01:25.179> attach<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.689> dropper<00:01:26.049> fly<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.450> know<00:01:28.600> with

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
can attach the dropper fly you know with

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.660 
can attach the dropper fly you know with
the<00:01:28.899> mono<00:01:29.259> loop<00:01:29.530> nut<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.009> it's<00:01:30.159> real<00:01:30.340> free<00:01:30.579> to

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
the mono loop nut so it's real free to

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.279 
the mono loop nut so it's real free to
move<00:01:30.819> I<00:01:31.119> don't<00:01:31.539> bother<00:01:31.719> with<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:31.990> with<00:01:32.259> a

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
move I don't bother with that with a

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.889 
move I don't bother with that with a
point<00:01:32.590> fly<00:01:32.829> maybe<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.219> should<00:01:33.460> but<00:01:33.609> I<00:01:33.670> don't<00:01:33.899> and

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
point fly maybe I should but I don't and

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.419 
point fly maybe I should but I don't and
I<00:01:35.049> use<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.229> little<00:01:35.560> lighter<00:01:35.740> Tippett<00:01:36.130> here<00:01:36.340> in

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
I use a little lighter Tippett here in

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.980 
I use a little lighter Tippett here in
case<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:36.729> dropper<00:01:37.060> fly<00:01:37.240> hooks<00:01:37.420> up<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.840> can

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
case the dropper fly hooks up I can

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.539 
case the dropper fly hooks up I can
break<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.350> off<00:01:38.439> without<00:01:38.679> losing<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.280> point

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
break it off without losing the point

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.830 
break it off without losing the point
fly<00:01:39.729> as<00:01:39.909> well<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.759> point<00:01:42.999> flight<00:01:43.299> bounces

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
fly as well the point flight bounces

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.010 
fly as well the point flight bounces
along<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.229> bottom<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.710> as<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.219> does<00:01:45.429> every

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
along the bottom and as it does every

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.270 
along the bottom and as it does every
time<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.139> touches<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.439> bottom<00:01:47.679> this<00:01:48.069> little

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
time it touches the bottom this little
