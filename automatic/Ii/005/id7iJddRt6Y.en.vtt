00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.310
 sing 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.029
 now we are here at the stand of 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.690
 Qualcomm this company that can 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.690
 manufacture 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.210
 microprocessors and also license 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.860
 technologies for microprocessors that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.210
 have grown a lot lately because 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.520
 because precisely your product that one 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.520
 of them is the snapdragon is 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.370
 present in many devices that today 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.230
 They sold by the millions each year 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.960
 tablets of your brand which with battaglia 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 a 70 phone that has some 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.199
 features all all in the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.900
 process are dragon with different 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.430
 characteristics core speeds 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.640
 etcetera but good here is a sample 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.730
 interesting it's about the motorola of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.790
 king of the hd that we already do a lot 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.250
 and we met of course and at 10 point 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.129
 com has a qualcomm processor this is 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.780
 one occupies another totally Chinese phone 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.600
 that is even in Chinese another 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 motorola which in this case is the model x 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 of 785 you have to remember change the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.090
 names of country models in country 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.370
 but good the common denominator is the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.510
 processor tablets since it helps your 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.890
 is for funds here is another tablet 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.320
 which is a transformation surely 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.630
 after each opponent top 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.760
 with the screen that is touch and this is 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.040
 pure keyboard this is a bell 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.330
 then there is a phone with windows 8 of 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.460
 the first ones that we are seeing with this 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.050
 operative in this case this is a 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.830
 htc phone manufacturer the htc with this 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.570
 that is windows 8 but all insist 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.540
 the cloud share as common denominator 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.020
 that this snapdragon processor here there 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 more phones and others etc in the same 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.100
 bx show 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.160
 proven also strangers of 20 years 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.869
 yes but with windows 8 but good 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.450
 samsung galaxy s three hills and using 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.620
 How many teachers have you sold this 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.940
 club to supply galaxy the droid 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.220
 dna another phone also with 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.170
 Android that you have to remember that 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.450
 this is the equivalent to the process of a 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.330
 computer does not always know the fast and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.030
 works optimally these 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.920
 movements in the content of the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.989
 because they are quite fast and do not 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.440
 there are these waiting times here we have 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.090
 the sony xperia z is the phone too 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.920
 of super recent release with a 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.950
 pretty big screen like it uses 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.060
 snapdragon of qualcomm and finally here 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.519
 the optimum 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.560
 of him and where also all of these 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.800
 products use them in technology 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.810
 interesting as well as companies 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.660
 upload or after download in this case qualcomm 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.350
 it is right now in the sight of all not 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.390
 have with them because obviously 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.130
 mobile revolutions and we all want 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.040
 have a very powerful phone with 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.990
 us and for example intel what moment 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.270
 it was marc is still of course the 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.970
 leader in use microprocessors 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.070
 general in the mobile part have not yet 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.020
 started or have not fought for 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.120
 example to qualcomm and there are some 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.970
 phones with intel inside but good the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.780
 90% have 4000 sites, we'll see what happens 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.780
 a little bit later 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.290
 in 1920 to then present in Mexico 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.490
 dragon 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.490
 and will understand it instantly 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.220
 it's funny how fast is how fast 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.570
 they processed and it 's between windows 8 they fell 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.570
 they lent them to do more 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.190
 it is very big what 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.650
 and we do a little bit long 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.650
 great but good in tastes are broken 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.650
 processors
