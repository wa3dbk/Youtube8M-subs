something<00:03:24.120> I'm<00:03:24.390> gonna<00:03:24.480> use<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.170> hopefully

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
something I'm gonna use so hopefully

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.949 
something I'm gonna use so hopefully
I'll<00:03:25.769> get<00:03:25.980> over<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.310> pretty<00:03:26.430> quick<00:03:27.000> now<00:03:27.720> right

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
I'll get over it pretty quick now right

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.300 
I'll get over it pretty quick now right
up<00:03:27.989> here<00:03:28.230> at<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.380> top<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.739> keyboard<00:03:29.160> we

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
up here at the top of the keyboard we

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.280 
up here at the top of the keyboard we
have<00:03:29.340> our<00:03:29.610> speakers<00:03:30.150> which<00:03:30.390> are<00:03:30.630> actually

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
have our speakers which are actually

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.470 
have our speakers which are actually
incredibly<00:03:31.829> loud<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.790> whole<00:03:33.030> lot<00:03:33.269> better

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
incredibly loud and a whole lot better

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.900 
incredibly loud and a whole lot better
than<00:03:33.870> my<00:03:34.200> MacBook<00:03:34.739> Air<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.280> I'm<00:03:35.519> really<00:03:35.790> really

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
than my MacBook Air so I'm really really

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.090 
than my MacBook Air so I'm really really
pleased<00:03:36.420> with<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.780> speakers<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.440> this

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
pleased with the speakers on this

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.430 
pleased with the speakers on this
macbook<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.120> here<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.510> can<00:03:39.660> see<00:03:39.870> we<00:03:40.079> have<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
macbook so here you can see we have the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.470 
macbook so here you can see we have the
edge<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.920> edge<00:03:41.070> keyboard<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.000> Apple<00:03:42.390> has

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
edge to edge keyboard and Apple has

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.479 
edge to edge keyboard and Apple has
actually<00:03:42.810> changed<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:43.290> scissor<00:03:43.680> key<00:03:43.890> mechanism

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
actually changed a scissor key mechanism

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.130 
actually changed a scissor key mechanism
that<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.730> used<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.030> use<00:03:45.209> on<00:03:45.359> all<00:03:45.390> its<00:03:45.660> Mac<00:03:45.840> books

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
that it used to use on all its Mac books

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.039 
that it used to use on all its Mac books
to<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> butterfly<00:03:47.549> key<00:03:47.850> mechanism<00:03:48.570> now<00:03:48.840> this

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
to a butterfly key mechanism now this

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.840 
to a butterfly key mechanism now this
gives<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.500> more<00:03:49.650> stable<00:03:49.950> key<00:03:50.370> press<00:03:50.640> no

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
gives it a more stable key press no

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.090 
gives it a more stable key press no
matter<00:03:51.060> where<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.630> press<00:03:51.989> on<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.260> key<00:03:52.829> and

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
matter where you press on the key and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.520 
matter where you press on the key and
the<00:03:53.640> key<00:03:53.790> travel<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.239> obviously<00:03:54.720> pretty<00:03:55.079> short

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
the key travel is obviously pretty short

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.069 
the key travel is obviously pretty short
given<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.920> thinness<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.820> device<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:57.570> it

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
given the thinness of the device but it

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.590 
given the thinness of the device but it
still<00:03:58.290> gives<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.709> nice<00:03:58.980> typing<00:03:59.760> experience<00:03:59.880> and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
still gives a nice typing experience and

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.030 
still gives a nice typing experience and
really<00:04:00.840> at<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.049> point<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.530> have<00:04:01.799> no

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
really at this point I have no

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.490 
really at this point I have no
complaints<00:04:02.700> now<00:04:03.660> we<00:04:03.720> also<00:04:03.900> have<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:04.109> brand<00:04:04.410> new

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
complaints now we also have a brand new

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.930 
complaints now we also have a brand new
trackpad<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.250> under<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.640> hood<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.880> that

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
trackpad and under the hood of that

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.819 
trackpad and under the hood of that
trackpad<00:04:06.510> we<00:04:06.690> have<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> tactic<00:04:07.260> engine<00:04:07.650> and

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
trackpad we have a tactic engine and

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.979 
trackpad we have a tactic engine and
force<00:04:08.100> sensors<00:04:08.579> now<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.269> taptic<00:04:09.600> engine<00:04:09.750> is

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
force sensors now that taptic engine is

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.150 
force sensors now that taptic engine is
going<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.230> give<00:04:10.350> us<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.590> sense<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
going to give us a sense that the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.890 
going to give us a sense that the
trackpad<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.760> clicking<00:04:12.269> when<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:12.510> press<00:04:12.750> it

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
trackpad is clicking when we press it

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.780 
trackpad is clicking when we press it
when<00:04:13.049> in<00:04:13.170> actuality<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.980> not<00:04:14.160> moving<00:04:14.400> at<00:04:14.609> all

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
when in actuality it's not moving at all

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.310 
when in actuality it's not moving at all
so<00:04:15.030> that's<00:04:15.180> kind<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.570> trippy<00:04:15.870> once<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.109> first

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
so that's kind of trippy once you first

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.110 
so that's kind of trippy once you first
start<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.650> use<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.519> force<00:04:17.729> sensors

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
start to use it and the force sensors

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.460 
start to use it and the force sensors
are<00:04:18.239> gonna<00:04:18.390> give<00:04:18.570> us<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.690> ability<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.169> use<00:04:19.440> a

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
are gonna give us the ability to use a

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.920 
are gonna give us the ability to use a
new<00:04:19.829> gesture<00:04:20.160> called<00:04:20.579> force<00:04:20.910> touch<00:04:21.329> which

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
new gesture called force touch which

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.450 
new gesture called force touch which
basically<00:04:22.229> allows<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.740> press<00:04:22.979> deeper

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
basically allows you to press deeper

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.130 
basically allows you to press deeper
into<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.789> trackpad<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.510> get<00:04:24.659> different

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
into the trackpad to get different

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.200 
into the trackpad to get different
actions<00:04:25.560> within<00:04:25.770> apps<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:26.760> can<00:04:26.909> see<00:04:27.030> right

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
actions within apps so you can see right

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.500 
actions within apps so you can see right
here

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
here

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.300 
here
if<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.720> do<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.900> force<00:04:28.260> touch<00:04:28.440> on<00:04:28.680> Safari<00:04:29.100> it's

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
if I do a force touch on Safari it's

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.190 
if I do a force touch on Safari it's
gonna<00:04:29.430> show<00:04:29.640> me<00:04:29.790> all<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:30.150> open<00:04:30.540> windows<00:04:30.960> in

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
gonna show me all the open windows in

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.350 
gonna show me all the open windows in
Safari<00:04:31.710> if<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.160> do<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.400> same<00:04:32.550> thing<00:04:32.790> for<00:04:32.910> finder

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
Safari if I do the same thing for finder

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.700 
Safari if I do the same thing for finder
of<00:04:33.540> course<00:04:33.930> you're<00:04:34.020> gonna<00:04:34.110> show<00:04:34.320> me<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.590> all

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
of course you're gonna show me that all

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.530 
of course you're gonna show me that all
the<00:04:34.890> windows<00:04:35.220> that<00:04:35.340> are<00:04:35.400> open<00:04:35.490> for<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.000> finder

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
the windows that are open for a finder

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.750 
the windows that are open for a finder
so<00:04:37.170> there's<00:04:37.350> also<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.680> whole<00:04:38.130> lot<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.460> different

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
so there's also a whole lot of different

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.980 
so there's also a whole lot of different
things<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:38.970> can<00:04:39.090> do<00:04:39.300> with<00:04:39.450> force<00:04:39.750> touch

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
things you can do with force touch

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.590 
things you can do with force touch
within<00:04:40.290> specific<00:04:41.130> applications<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:42.330> can<00:04:42.420> see

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
within specific applications you can see

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.000 
within specific applications you can see
right<00:04:42.780> here<00:04:42.840> if<00:04:43.140> I<00:04:43.230> force<00:04:43.500> click<00:04:43.710> on<00:04:43.890> the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
right here if I force click on the

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.200 
right here if I force click on the
folder<00:04:44.370> right<00:04:44.550> here<00:04:44.790> then<00:04:44.940> it's<00:04:45.060> going<00:04:45.150> to

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
folder right here then it's going to

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.730 
folder right here then it's going to
give<00:04:45.420> me<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.660> ability<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:46.050> rename<00:04:46.680> that

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
give me the ability to rename that

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.950 
give me the ability to rename that
folder<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.120> just<00:04:48.270> kind<00:04:48.420> of<00:04:48.450> depends<00:04:48.780> on

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
folder so it just kind of depends on

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.260
