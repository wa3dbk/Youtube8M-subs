00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.320
 hello and welcome to tech 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.779
 fenty 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.670
 Today I show you how annoying tim 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.849
 your lounge would be worthless 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.529
 I think everyone knows this problem 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.349
 my job is a new app and zack is 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.679
 the old one now I want one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.570
 delete this icon eg ccleaner i can 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.199
 do not just press on it and on 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.780
 crutches 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.160
 because then this app will be automatic 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.640
 uninstalled that we want, of course 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.640
 Not 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.800
 there is a great thing for it 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.350
 this program therefore calls itself loud 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.040
 Late manager that could be free 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.350
 download 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.059
 you will find the link in the description 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.720
 It is only a demoversion though 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.579
 completely it is sufficient 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.129
 For example we simply choose cc klima 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.610
 and click on remove and confirm 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.650
 who just stays on, press it 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.600
 Now we reopen launch pad and we 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:16.729
 will see 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:18.350
 the ccleaner is no longer there and you 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.450
 will see that the longed but 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.860
 still located on our market 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.490
 because we have not uninstalled 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.490
 Here is the proof 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.380
 next we want one 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.300
 ordinary for example installed 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.160
 a bigger program and the files 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.930
 land will automatically be back in the lounge 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.050
 Of course , this also goes completely again 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.660
 Simply with our launch pad manager 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.620
 just hit it and we can 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.910
 again select the individual files 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.250
 and then remove it again 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.470
 press or we can also go right in 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.920
 Click on the whole folder and then again 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.660
 delete and then press confirm 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.230
 it opens again launch pad and her 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.940
 will see our folder is gone me 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.990
 Hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.990
