00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.280
 Did you know that you are a third of your life 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.990
 beats him spending in bed 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.450
 therefore you need a good bed one 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.130
 good mattress and fine pillow and of course 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.800
 a small bedroom must be discovered 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.130
 sleep because yes and rested people counts 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.130
 for two 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.219
 so malloc starts with the right mattress 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.059
 the label and adapts to you 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.379
 body 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.899
 is very important when choosing 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.640
 example of my games and the way 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.949
 of sleeping with the stone in front 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.960
 you always sleep on your stomach and then you have to 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.500
 you sleep harder if you are on your side 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.899
 to sleep 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.149
 if you sleep a bridge then how you 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.490
 get support and then it anyway 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.729
 is resilient and that is perfect for you 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.439
 fits but remains important 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.110
 right thinking was with the right mattress 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:25.450
 in the right be choose a beautiful 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.610
 wide paneling as behind me 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.619
 and debts these in the color of the mitten 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.780
 this way isee ring 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.920
 picture ebook or your alarm clock or is it 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.200
 light but you can also for example 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.330
 beautiful home accessories there or lost or and 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.069
 a photo frame 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.690
 and after a while you get it 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.810
 just the way and change are the 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.810
 Moon 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.360
 you may want to opt for normal 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.100
 bedside table so as he also left of 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.600
 the bed exist but we can too 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.490
 looking go to creative 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.650
 solutions such as placing one 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.140
 ladder against because you can have a light there 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.320
 on clamp on corner to the draw 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.000
 on your quiche it is one of hanging up and 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.070
 Another alternative would be because 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.790
 hook to the wall to attach a 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.790
 jewelry or 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.460
 this bedroom we opted for 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.900
 a luxury hotel atmosphere to create that 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.790
 we did that through the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.710
 do not use many pillows alone 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.420
 lots of pillows too much 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.940
 think of the two for example 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.250
 gives a nice voluminous effect and 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.530
 a nice free to finish it 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.300
 and after those hotels more super nice 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.000
 of course to make you have to be alone 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.980
 make sure you keep it a bit quieter and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.140
 I mean actually quieter in the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.320
 meaning of the use of color so choose 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.330
 a sort of hue and I will make it 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.420
 took her or further and in for example 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.300
 accent color keeps me calm and things like that 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.080
 you can still sleep well in your beautiful 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.080
 hotels fries
