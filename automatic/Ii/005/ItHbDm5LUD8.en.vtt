00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
to scrape off the top so it will give it

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.690

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
so far um like for example the wind just

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.879 
so far um like for example the wind just
like<00:04:31.650> dry

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889

rounding<00:04:32.069> out<00:04:32.159> the<00:04:32.490> characters<00:04:32.939> dialogue<00:04:33.180> so

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
rounding out the characters dialogue so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.230

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
you can't really hear it at all and even

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.909 
you can't really hear it at all and even
if<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.449> do<00:04:36.569> hear<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.840> will<00:04:37.050> be<00:04:37.169> distracting<00:04:37.800> by

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
if you do hear it will be distracting by

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.929
