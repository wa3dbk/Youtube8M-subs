00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.950
 hi everyone today I'm 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.900
 am saying that it would be nice of you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.450
 show the drinks that I'm going 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.799
 do this year for halloween 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.690
 so for a start we will do some 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.600
 ice cubes you will need sweets in 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.020
 to form the earthworm olives 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.240
 radish a knife is also a tray to 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 ice cubes so we'll start all of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.949
 following with our little round radishes I 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.199
 I'll take a simple knife 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.059
 choose a radish and we'll start 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.770
 peel it but I do not want them 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.450
 soft toys and completely I do not want 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.760
 how radish is all white I want 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.469
 that there are still men in red because 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 that I explain a little bit 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.420
 my radish will represent an eye that I 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 will then put in an ice cube so 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.809
 to make it more realistic and more 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.340
 halloween 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.530
 it's better if there are places 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.719
 in red that will represent the meaning 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.170
 that can be seen in the eyes 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.460
 so that's why I'm doing things like 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.710
 small stripes small stripes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.300
 surely radish trying to do 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.909
 something pretty thin at the level of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.549
 the end of the radish and of course I do 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.549
 that all around all the way radi man 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.780
 once we're done, we'll come 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.880
 dig a little bit of them radi 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.170
 so me since I'm not very very 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.659
 hard and I prefer to go slowly 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.310
 start by making a small hole and then 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.170
 I enlarge it is little by little 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.820
 better than making a hole too big soon 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.310
 the departure and after we can more 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.229
 use it so here I was living 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.840
 little by little and when my hole me 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.330
 agree I stop 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.280
 not in fact it's going to be used to put the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.619
 small olive understand that our olives 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.270
 we choose one and we come 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.610
 just slip it into their said 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.350
 in the hole should be done so 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.580
 will represent an eye I took some 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.929
 green olives because that's what 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.280
 I had at home but I think it 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.840
 makes it better with black olives 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.630
 this is what my child looks like 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.670
 eye to the end it remains only to 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.380
 do the same with other radishes 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.959
 you do as much write off as you 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.870
 want some ice cubes so I stitched 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.760
 this idea of ​​radish eye on a photo 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.200
 that I saw from terrestrial pine I you the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.970
 would also put in info bar under the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.640
 video if you want to see 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.920
 so here I am what I did I 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.260
 is five hours in all I'm going after 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.480
 come and put them in my ice bin 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.489
 so I put an eye by compartment 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.459
 it does not matter if some are a 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.290
 little bit big then I'll take 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.480
 my sweets in the shape of earthworms 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.750
 which looks a little like that I 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.970
 bought them at gifi and I will come 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.980
 put them in my ice bucket I 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.410
 will also make ice cubes with 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.079
 glasses inside so does it for 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.540
 start I put a well-set glass at 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.489
 bottom that will not go over and then 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.209
 I put a second in each 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.040
 compartment 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.660
 and this time I do it willingly 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.549
 to overtake for them to come out a little 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.380
 little demand ice and it's more 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.609
 Funny but you do not have to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.040
 can put back as if you 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.239
 do you want to do what you want 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.160
 so then it only remains 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.299
 fill it all with water and we're going 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.859
 put it in the freezer during 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.019
 a few hours so that its shape the 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.120
 ice cubes ended so for the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.750
 ice creams we'll think about the drinks you 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.930
 will need lemon straw 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.960
 glass with a spoon and a knife 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.410
 small containers of a Jules verne 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.930
 I found a juice kiwis apples 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.900
 sugar and salt a little bit of 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.210
 red syrup lemonade so I have 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.040
 taken grenadine and possibly 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.350
 for adults to use with 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.350
 moderation an alcohol if you want but 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.790
 it's really not mandatory so for 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.020
 start I'll take my knife and 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.010
 my lemon and I'm just going 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.140
 cut the lemon in half and then I go 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.840
 use my half lemon to put a 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.930
 little bit of lemon juice on the ledge 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.570
 of Montvert I will then put a 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.570
 little bit of salt in the bottom of rise 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.690
 well it will serve for me icing 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.900
 so then I plunge my glass into the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.000
 salt also there is a little bit of juice 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.490
 lemon on my glass of salt 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.660
 will adhere to gold dresses so here is a 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.020
 little what it gives to a 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.430
 fairly neutral icing to these whites 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.350
 then I will do for the second 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.270
 towards a second kind of icing so 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.120
 it's going to be the same principle but this 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.510
 this time with sugar and with syrup 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.910
 red syrup grenadine syrup 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.030
 so I dive first - green in the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.910
 syrup always just their edge and just 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.070
 after I plunge it into the sugar for 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.020
 to cover my siro with sugar 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.270
 gives a fairly similar icing to the 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.820
 first but slightly colored in red 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.770
 we go then to the drink I 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.130
 recovers the syrup that I used to 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.810
 the icing just before to not spoil 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.370
 but I will add a little bit 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.420
 because I like it when it's good 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.230
 so sweet then I'll add some 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.240
 the lemonade 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.370
 as I had a bottle of 2 liters 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.710
 really very heavy and not easy to 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.900
 use I put my lemonade in a 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.910
 bowl of water hour to be able then 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.510
 pour it more delicately into my 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.270
 glass so my lemonade and in my bold 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.940
 other then I pour it into a 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.130
 spoon that is leaning against the 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.990
 flange various why do all this 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.790
 simply to have two phases 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.070
 in my glass I do not want the 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.780
 lemonade mixes syrup I want 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.340
 really have layers a layer 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.230
 red and a transparent layer 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.780
 that's why I put my nimes at 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.310
 NAHD 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.080
 man very gently in my glass 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.180
 like that she will really settle down at 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.580
 top of the syrup and not mix 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.130
 so I deliberately did not speed up 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.139
 this video sequence for you 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.630
 can see exactly how 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.480
 speed I'm going and to see that it's 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.790
 still pretty delicate but other than that 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.669
 if we have a little bit of patience 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.010
 is really very easy so that's it 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.570
 I continue to pour my lemonade until 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.889
 what I fill my glass and that's it 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.060
 so then what that gives I am 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.290
 sorry the focus was not 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.730
 done on the green but I think we 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.400
 can still see both 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.020
 red and transparent phases then I 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.700
 will go to the second glass I 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.990
 start with alcohol so me 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.240
 I took what I had at home 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.530
 rum but you do not even have to 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.730
 put alcohol as I wanted said 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.910
 it's really like you want 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.130
 can just put some juice so me 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.570
 it's apple kiwifruit and I find the 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.800
 really great green color 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.810
 interesting for halloween 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.610
 so that's what it gives you can 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.139
 add small straw for example 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.210
 so I inverted the colors I 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.870
 put the green magpie in the red green and 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.570
 Conversely 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.030
 Then we will get our ice cubes 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.010
 are now frozen so I take 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.150
 an eye that looks a little like that 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.680
 I find the result really 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.690
 interesting in ice cube because I 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.600
 think it's like a small effect 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.490
 magnifying glass that makes it even better I find 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.340
 so I choose to put the eyes in 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.970
 the juice open because the juice is not 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.890
 super transparent but like the eyes 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.600
 will float we will still see them at 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.240
 the surface so I find the result 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.560
 pretty cool and the earthworms this 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.810
 I will put them in the green 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.960
 red because like lemonade and 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.400
 transparent even if the ice cube falls 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.500
 bottom of the glass we're still going well 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.820
 to be able to see our glasses of earth and then 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.090
 anyway we will see them well 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:26.720
 once we have finished our glass so 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.550
 here I put two ice cubes by glass and 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.100
 So that's what it gives 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.840
 really something very easy and 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.070
 quick enough to do it's just for 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.020
 have a funny little thing for 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.810
 halloween it's mostly the ice cubes that 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.160
 are nice enough so here I do not know 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.650
 what you think about it but I think 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.680
 it's pretty funny then of course we can 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.300
 mix lemonade and syrup this will
