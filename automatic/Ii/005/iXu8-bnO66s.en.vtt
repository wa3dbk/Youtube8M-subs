00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.550
 a flower for no flower seemed a little 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:09.910
 cheesy so I wanted to give it a star 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.360
 another star 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:18.270
 thanks to you task and achieve 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.270
 a star is good to that watermelon 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.060
 you were speechless 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.290
 well you left me speechless 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.450
 federico you just made me a gift 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.050
 beautiful and the cutest of all this is 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.050
 that will last forever 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.890
 with my love for you now if you believe me 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.550
 I love you as you are with more or less 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.550
 brightness 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.280
 I do not want us to ever forget this 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.190
 moment 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.770
 because whatever happens that star 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.550
 she has always shone for us 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.550
 I'm not sure 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.970
 [Music] 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.900
 let's spend the certificate of both 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.900
 look at the generic 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:21.359
 [Music] 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.200
 I can tell you, you will take my 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.240
 butterflies ok are stars pericos are 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.830
 butterfly mind I felt good I feel 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.470
 different 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.870
 but it is a very good feeling 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.190
 I was that kind of presumptuous guy who 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.159
 he arrives around the world without caring 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.100
 really nobody 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.960
 until suddenly a life comes to my life 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.909
 star 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.909
 and it destabilizes all my universe 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.510
 First 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.260
 all colors become more 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.940
 intense understandings 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.940
 it's like discovering the world back 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.470
 but now together 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.110
 and that's where they come 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.320
 Who 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.120
 the butterflies in the belly and always 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.860
 I heard that they appeared when 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 you were very much in love 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.050
 but I never thought it was going to happen to me 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:28.929
 well you did not spend only 20 minutes 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.929
