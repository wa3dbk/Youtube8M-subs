in 2008 we started walking and looking

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.689 
in 2008 we started walking and looking
for<00:00:31.330> a<00:00:31.359> new<00:00:31.599> path<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.949> we<00:00:33.070> want<00:00:33.309> to<00:00:33.430> do<00:00:33.519> is

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
for a new path what we want to do is

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.790 
for a new path what we want to do is
connect<00:00:34.059> different<00:00:34.420> Rock<00:00:34.809> sections<00:00:35.350> just

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
connect different Rock sections just

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.310 
connect different Rock sections just
connecting<00:00:36.700> down<00:00:36.880> this<00:00:37.149> Ridge<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:38.110> most

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
connecting down this Ridge the most

technical<00:00:38.860> path<00:00:39.190> we<00:00:39.460> could<00:00:39.640> find<00:00:39.940> at<00:00:40.180> us

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
technical path we could find at us

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:41.880 
technical path we could find at us
the<00:00:40.780> way<00:00:40.960> we<00:00:41.110> picked<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.440> out<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:41.710> then<00:00:41.800> we

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
the way we picked it out and then we

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.580 
the way we picked it out and then we
flagged<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.820> went<00:00:43.180> back<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.719> started

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
flagged it and went back and started

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.529 
flagged it and went back and started

a more technical trail it's just a lot
more<00:00:54.219> fun<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:56.020> why<00:00:56.199> we<00:00:56.350> did<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:59.370> all<00:01:00.370> we<00:01:00.520> had

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
more fun that's why we did it all we had

nothing but opportunity we could put the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.200 
nothing but opportunity we could put the
trail<00:01:07.000> wherever<00:01:07.390> we<00:01:07.450> wanted<00:01:07.780> this<00:01:08.650> trail<00:01:09.210> we

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
trail wherever we wanted this trail we

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.280 
trail wherever we wanted this trail we
weren't<00:01:10.420> really<00:01:10.600> thinking<00:01:10.900> with<00:01:11.260> a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
weren't really thinking with a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.570 
destination mine the goal of this trail
was<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.659> have<00:01:13.810> fun<00:01:14.049> along<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.320> way<00:01:14.439> we<00:01:15.369> looked

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
was to have fun along the way we looked

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.850 
was to have fun along the way we looked
for<00:01:15.700> every<00:01:15.880> boulder<00:01:16.450> or<00:01:16.600> every<00:01:16.930> Rock<00:01:17.170> anything

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
for every boulder or every Rock anything

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.859 
for every boulder or every Rock anything
that<00:01:18.009> would<00:01:18.100> just<00:01:18.310> be<00:01:18.430> fun<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:19.180> roll<00:01:19.330> over<00:01:19.360> and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
just natural rock that's why you

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.389 
just natural rock that's why you
wouldn't<00:01:44.909> go<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:46.040> just<00:01:47.040> had<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> good
