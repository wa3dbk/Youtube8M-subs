00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
pattern um and I did them pretty pretty

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.670 
pattern um and I did them pretty pretty
small<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.399> actually<00:00:35.899> did<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.410> part

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
small and I actually did like a part

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.720 
small and I actually did like a part
here<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> then<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.000> twisted<00:00:39.750> these<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.410> way

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
here and then I twisted these this way

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
here and then I twisted these this way
twisted<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.300> way<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> then<00:00:42.960> twisted

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
twisted these this way and then twisted

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.529 
twisted these this way and then twisted
the<00:00:43.559> back<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.520> which<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> little<00:00:45.390> bit

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the back down on which is a little bit

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.790 
the back down on which is a little bit
different<00:00:45.840> from<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> normally<00:00:46.200> do

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
different from what I normally do

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.470 
different from what I normally do
because<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.250> normally<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.820> twist<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> front

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
because I normally will twist the front

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.930 
because I normally will twist the front
all<00:00:48.719> down<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.739> my<00:00:49.860> hair<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.190> lot<00:00:50.399> longer<00:00:50.610> now

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
all down but my hair is a lot longer now

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
all down but my hair is a lot longer now
so<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.660> sticks<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.079> my<00:00:52.110> face<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
so it just like sticks in my face and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.920 
so it just like sticks in my face and
then<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.789> push<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> side<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
then I have to push them to the side and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
then I have to push them to the side and
then<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.320> messed<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> said<00:00:57.030> let<00:00:57.149> me

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
then they get messed up so I said let me

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.510 
then they get messed up so I said let me
try<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.600> let<00:00:57.960> me<00:00:58.050> try<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.289> method<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.859> them

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
try that let me try that method of them

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
try that let me try that method of them
setting<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> now<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.930> only<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> could<00:01:01.410> tell<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
setting it now the only I could tell you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.290 
setting it now the only I could tell you
about<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> curly<00:01:02.219> putting<00:01:02.520> today<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.149> my

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
about the curly putting today with my

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240 
about the curly putting today with my
care<00:01:03.780> because<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.100> have

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
care because as you can see I have

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.899 
care because as you can see I have
pretty<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.850> curl<00:01:06.210> definition<00:01:06.619> is<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:08.130> this

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pretty good curl definition is on this

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.690 
pretty good curl definition is on this
side<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:10.590> could<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.130> been<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> way

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
side it could have just been the way

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.149 
side it could have just been the way
that<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.909> loosened<00:01:12.720> them<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:13.979> like

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that I loosened them but it's like

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.880 
that I loosened them but it's like
really<00:01:14.689> kind<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.869> hard<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:18.619> not<00:01:19.619> as

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
really kind of like hard and not as

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
really kind of like hard and not as
moisture<00:01:20.369> eyes<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:20.970> twists<00:01:21.450> were<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
moisture eyes as my twists were when I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590 
moisture eyes as my twists were when I
did<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> big<00:01:22.500> twist<00:01:22.799> um<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.270> site<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
did the big twist um but this site is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.890 
did the big twist um but this site is
not<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.990> bad<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.950> mainly<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> ends<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
not so bad and it's mainly the ends so I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.749 
not so bad and it's mainly the ends so I
think<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.890> could<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> way<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
think it could just be the way that I

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.080 
think it could just be the way that I
loosened<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.570> hair<00:01:30.900> um<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:32.909> not

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
loosened the hair um you know so I'm not

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.370 
loosened the hair um you know so I'm not
really<00:01:33.150> sure<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.780> attribute<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
really sure if I can attribute that to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.870 
really sure if I can attribute that to
the<00:01:34.590> curly<00:01:34.770> pudding<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.189> let<00:01:35.369> me<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
