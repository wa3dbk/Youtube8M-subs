okay what's this cheerful blinking el
bote<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.210> Christmas<00:00:03.540> lights<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.840> course

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
bote of the Christmas lights of course

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.180 
bote of the Christmas lights of course
led-based

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
led-based

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.860 
led-based
and<00:00:05.819> just<00:00:06.000> like<00:00:06.120> house<00:00:06.330> lighting<00:00:06.690> which<00:00:06.839> is

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
and just like house lighting which is

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.820 
and just like house lighting which is
now<00:00:07.080> transitioning<00:00:07.740> into<00:00:08.250> these<00:00:08.970> abilities

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
now transitioning into these abilities

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.440 
now transitioning into these abilities
you<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:10.860> see<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> lot<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.759> innovation<00:00:11.940> actually

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
you can see a lot of innovation actually

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.879 
you can see a lot of innovation actually
happening<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.349> these<00:00:13.469> lights

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
happening in these lights

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.310 
happening in these lights
they're<00:00:14.160> also<00:00:14.280> computer-controlled<00:00:15.320> and

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
they're also computer-controlled and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.450 
they're also computer-controlled and
more<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.590> course<00:00:16.710> remarkable<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.430> was

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
more of course remarkable it was

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.429 
more of course remarkable it was
basically<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> disposable<00:00:18.869> price<00:00:19.170> this

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
basically at a disposable price this

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.150 
basically at a disposable price this
whole<00:00:19.619> line<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.220> 90<00:00:20.939> LEDs<00:00:21.710> sent<00:00:22.710> me<00:00:22.769> back<00:00:22.920> haul

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
whole line of 90 LEDs sent me back haul

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.939 
whole line of 90 LEDs sent me back haul
of<00:00:23.340> 15<00:00:23.760> dollars<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:25.859> good

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
of 15 dollars so it's a really good

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.920 
of 15 dollars so it's a really good
study<00:00:26.099> actually<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.880> industrial<00:00:27.840> engineering

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
study actually in industrial engineering

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.500 
study actually in industrial engineering
of<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:29.160> low<00:00:29.340> end<00:00:29.519> products<00:00:30.060> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of really low end products that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.759 
of really low end products that
obviously<00:00:31.109> still<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> fair<00:00:31.619> bit<00:00:31.710> of

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
obviously still have a fair bit of

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.860 
obviously still have a fair bit of
sophistication<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.700> let's<00:00:33.420> take<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> look<00:00:33.750> at

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
sophistication so let's take a look at

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
sophistication so let's take a look at
how<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.260> achieve<00:00:34.290> such<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.860> low<00:00:35.040> price<00:00:35.309> not

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
how they achieve such a low price not

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
how they achieve such a low price not
surprisingly<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.230> box<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.620> have

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
surprisingly it's a little box you have

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.270 
surprisingly it's a little box you have
plugged<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.280> an<00:00:38.790> electric<00:00:39.239> outlet<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
plugged into an electric outlet that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
plugged into an electric outlet that
undoubtedly<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.410> microprocessor<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
undoubtedly has the microprocessor and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.830 
undoubtedly has the microprocessor and
various<00:00:43.860> controls<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:45.660> one

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
various controls you just have one

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
various controls you just have one
exposed<00:00:46.230> button<00:00:46.590> which<00:00:46.739> affects<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.399> light

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
exposed button which affects the light

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.319 
exposed button which affects the light
patterns<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> LEDs<00:00:49.260> reduced<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.329> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
patterns that the LEDs reduced so you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.130 
patterns that the LEDs reduced so you
can<00:00:51.420> see<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.690> there's<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:52.020> pattern

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
can see that there's some pattern

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
can see that there's some pattern
structurally<00:00:52.920> sophisticated<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.820> actually

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
structurally sophisticated it's actually

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.400 
structurally sophisticated it's actually
modulating<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.379> light<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> LEDs<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
modulating the the light of the LEDs and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.689 
modulating the the light of the LEDs and
so<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.620> gleiser<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.039> more<00:00:59.190> than<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.520> simply

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so the gleiser is more than just simply

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
so the gleiser is more than just simply
an<00:00:59.820> awful<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.329> control<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> three

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
an awful on control for the three

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.429 
an awful on control for the three
strings

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
strings

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
strings
okay<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:05.000> remove<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> back<00:01:06.390> cover<00:01:06.420> from

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
okay so just remove the back cover from

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
okay so just remove the back cover from
the<00:01:06.990> control<00:01:07.350> box<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the control box and you can see the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429 
the control box and you can see the
leads<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> various<00:01:10.049> LEDs

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
leads that go into the various LEDs

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
leads that go into the various LEDs
raised<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.060> course<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> very

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
raised and of course one of the very

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
raised and of course one of the very
first<00:01:12.869> economies<00:01:13.530> looks<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
first economies looks like they have a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.570 
first economies looks like they have a
friction<00:01:15.360> fit<00:01:15.540> pin<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.250> there's<00:01:17.430> no

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
friction fit pin and if there's no

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
friction fit pin and if there's no
positive<00:01:18.030> retention<00:01:18.509> latch<00:01:18.659> shell<00:01:19.170> around

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
positive retention latch shell around

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.830 
positive retention latch shell around
the<00:01:19.710> pin<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.130> use<00:01:20.549> some<00:01:20.759> hot<00:01:20.970> glue<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.450> secure

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the pin they use some hot glue to secure

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.340 
the pin they use some hot glue to secure
in<00:01:22.110> place

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
in place

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
in place
nope<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.460> actually<00:01:23.700> CSA<00:01:24.000> approved<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
nope it's actually CSA approved so it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.940 
nope it's actually CSA approved so it
certainly<00:01:24.840> meets<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> military

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
certainly meets all the military

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.120 
certainly meets all the military
requirements<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.439> shelfs<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.890> course

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
requirements so and the shelfs of course

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.100 
requirements so and the shelfs of course
has<00:01:29.310> been<00:01:29.490> ultrasonically<00:01:30.299> welded<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.990> i'll

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
has been ultrasonically welded so i'll

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.960 
has been ultrasonically welded so i'll
have<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> open<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
have to do that kind of open to you that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.730 
have to do that kind of open to you that
to<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.299> further<00:01:34.220> well<00:01:35.220> okay<00:01:35.520> obviously<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
to see further well okay obviously the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
to see further well okay obviously the
protective<00:01:37.740> enclosures<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.310> removed<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
protective enclosures and removed and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
protective enclosures and removed and
it's<00:01:39.810> even<00:01:40.079> simpler<00:01:40.380> than<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.650> thought<00:01:40.950> my

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
it's even simpler than I thought my

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
it's even simpler than I thought my
single<00:01:42.060> sided<00:01:42.270> circuit<00:01:42.630> board<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.590> build

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
single sided circuit board and the build

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
single sided circuit board and the build
board<00:01:44.340> material<00:01:44.700> called<00:01:44.909> phenolic<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
board material called phenolic to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.770 
board material called phenolic to
basically<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> pressed<00:01:46.619> paper<00:01:47.270> with<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> foil<00:01:48.630> on

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
basically a pressed paper with a foil on

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.800 
basically a pressed paper with a foil on
it<00:01:48.810> versus<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.439> fiberglass<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.850> absolutely

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
it versus a fiberglass so I absolutely

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.910 
it versus a fiberglass so I absolutely
pissed<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.530> circuit<00:01:53.100> board<00:01:53.250> materials<00:01:54.920> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
pissed of circuit board materials and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.870 
pissed of circuit board materials and
here's<00:01:56.100> an<00:01:56.250> interesting<00:01:56.280> construction

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
here's an interesting construction

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.469 
here's an interesting construction
detail<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.909> controller<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.360> of

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
detail this little controller I see of

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.060 
detail this little controller I see of
course<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> circuit<00:02:01.710> board<00:02:01.829> its

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
course is this on a circuit board its

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
course is this on a circuit board its
own<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.869> then<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.049> course<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.439> has<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.619> be

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
own and then of course it has to be

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.499 
own and then of course it has to be
soldered<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.280> board<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> might

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
soldered to the board now you might

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.850 
soldered to the board now you might
think<00:02:06.540> there's<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> connector<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.229> both<00:02:07.439> boards

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
think there's a connector on both boards

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.680 
think there's a connector on both boards
but<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.459> course<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.239> kind<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.450> class<00:02:09.660> of

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
but of course in this kind of class of

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.260 
but of course in this kind of class of
product<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.400> two<00:02:11.550> boards<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.120> could

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
product it's just two boards it could

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.340 
product it's just two boards it could
have<00:02:12.360> slot<00:02:12.660> in

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
have slot in

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.220 
have slot in
main<00:02:13.920> board<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.300> word<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.540> slides

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
main board and this word just slides

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650 
main board and this word just slides
through<00:02:16.560> slightly<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.060> they<00:02:18.210> just<00:02:18.390> rely

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
through slightly and then they just rely

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
through slightly and then they just rely
on<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.960> add<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> solder<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.010> think<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
on the add all the solder I think to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.550 
on the add all the solder I think to
make<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.240> connection<00:02:21.720> no<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.140> very<00:02:22.380> weak

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
make the connection no this is very weak

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.900 
make the connection no this is very weak
this<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.830> actually<00:02:23.220> what<00:02:23.370> deaf<00:02:23.550> would

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
this is actually what deaf would

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.080 
this is actually what deaf would
fracture<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.810> very<00:02:25.080> poor<00:02:25.230> service<00:02:25.590> life

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
fracture and a very poor service life

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.010 
fracture and a very poor service life
