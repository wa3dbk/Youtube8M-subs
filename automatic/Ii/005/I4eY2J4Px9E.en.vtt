any<00:00:40.800> type<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.160> paper<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> best<00:00:42.390> result

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
any type of paper but the best result

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.470

would<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:42.989> using<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.559> car<00:00:43.829> stop<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:45.090> I'm<00:00:45.210> using

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
would be using a car stop what I'm using

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
would be using a car stop what I'm using
is<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.989> typical<00:00:46.320> color<00:00:46.710> printing<00:00:47.250> paper

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
is the typical color printing paper

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
is the typical color printing paper
starting<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.690> need<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.020> perfect<00:00:49.289> square

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
starting off you need a perfect square

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.979 
starting off you need a perfect square
so<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.250> fold<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.910> side<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> paper<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so I fold one side of the paper to the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.290 
so I fold one side of the paper to the
opposite<00:00:52.469> side<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> corner<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.640> remove

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
opposite side of the corner and remove

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.350 
opposite side of the corner and remove
the<00:00:54.539> excess<00:00:54.960> paper<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:56.610> made<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> second

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the excess paper you made the second

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.910 
the excess paper you made the second
flow<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.780> create<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> center<00:00:58.680> x<00:00:59.039> crease<00:01:00.920> once

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
flow to create a center x crease once

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
flow to create a center x crease once
you<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> crease<00:01:02.640> take<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> scissor<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you have the crease take a scissor and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750 
you have the crease take a scissor and
start<00:01:04.080> cutting<00:01:04.379> following<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> crease<00:01:05.489> line

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
start cutting following the crease line

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.359 
start cutting following the crease line
to<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> center<00:01:06.510> leave<00:01:07.020> about<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.409> inch<00:01:08.010> away

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
