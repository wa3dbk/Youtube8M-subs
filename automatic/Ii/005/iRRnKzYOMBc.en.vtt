00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.270 
level
the<00:00:11.820> first<00:00:12.090> one<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.540> back<00:00:12.870> inside<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the first one is back inside the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.580 
the first one is back inside the
spaceport<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.420> I'll<00:00:15.480> go<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.839> very<00:00:16.260> south

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
spaceport so I'll go with the very south

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.760 
spaceport so I'll go with the very south
in<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> docking<00:00:17.340> bay<00:00:17.520> de<00:00:17.910> 61<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.380> elevator

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
in the docking bay de 61 this elevator

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500 
in the docking bay de 61 this elevator
is<00:00:19.800> not<00:00:19.890> even<00:00:20.130> really<00:00:20.400> marked<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> map<00:00:21.060> so

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
is not even really marked on the map so

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.750 
is not even really marked on the map so
it<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.869> kinda<00:00:22.080> hard<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.289> find<00:00:22.670> take<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
it can be kinda hard to find take the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.730 
it can be kinda hard to find take the
elevator<00:00:24.000> down<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.480> then<00:00:25.140> follow<00:00:25.590> this

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
elevator down and then follow this

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.859 
elevator down and then follow this
pathway<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> around<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.630> kind

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
pathway up and around and you can kind

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.950 
pathway up and around and you can kind
of<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.230> off<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> distance<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.960> just

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
of see it off in the distance and just

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.700 
of see it off in the distance and just
dreams<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.579> you'll<00:00:32.579> find<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> first<00:00:33.710> data

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
dreams and you'll find the first data

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:50.150 
dreams and you'll find the first data

caste<00:00:53.789> spaceport<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> follow<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
caste spaceport I kind of follow the the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.139 
caste spaceport I kind of follow the the
path<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.840> map<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> left<00:00:58.739> and

path on the map to the left and

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.979 
path on the map to the left and
eventually<00:01:00.149> you'll<00:01:00.270> come<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.629> kind<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
eventually you'll come to kind of a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
eventually you'll come to kind of a
hidden<00:01:01.260> pathway<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> follow<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
hidden pathway and you follow that a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.539 
hidden pathway and you follow that a
little<00:01:03.090> bit<00:01:03.210> further<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.920> you'll<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
little bit further and you'll get this

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:33.250 
little bit further and you'll get this
plus<00:01:06.060> two<00:01:06.390> presents<00:01:07.140> data<00:01:07.590> cron

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
the next two data cards can be picked up

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.180 
the next two data cards can be picked up
from<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.900> wall<00:01:37.140> speeder<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.860> after<00:01:38.070> you've

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
from the wall speeder so after you've

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.290

this<00:01:52.590> planet<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.040> possible<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.930> just<00:01:54.930> follow

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
this planet is possible and just follow

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
this planet is possible and just follow
the<00:01:55.530> river<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.520> hug<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> right<00:01:57.149> wall

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the river and just hug the right wall

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.600 
the river and just hug the right wall
when<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> very<00:01:59.250> end<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.520> the
