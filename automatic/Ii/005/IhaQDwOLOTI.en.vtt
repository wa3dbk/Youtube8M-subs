00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 no no 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.500
 and the ritz in minecraft 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.480
 and one more Friday I have a curiosity 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.270
 very curious and today we talk a good 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.580
 little bit about the cauldrons first 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.260
 what I 'm going to tell you is that a cauldron 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.219
 Can fill up to three bottles 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.649
 I have three bottles here and it is filled 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.380
 everything that is the cauldron with a simple 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.120
 bucket 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.630
 of water it may be advisable to have 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.630
 near 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.240
 a place two by two with water 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.410
 infinite 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.460
 the krafft eo is the next they get 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.559
 A) Yes 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.480
 and he fucks the bastard sun from our pot 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.159
 and good what is really the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.650
 curiosity is that they can be filled 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.770
 when it's raining even when in 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.840
 the desert that we baby and in another biome 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.970
 that here is a language intersection 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.149
 here explains the prairies and here is the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.960
 desert can be reached so we're going to 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:23.470
 put the command all the down folk and 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.470
 hands will be 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.530
 I have these boilers 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:34.479
 as you can see here it is not raining 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.479
 and as you can see here you are seeing 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.790
 if we accelerate our a little bit 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.920
 the desert has won that's why I think 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.049
 As you can see, it's not that much is owed and I'm going 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.049
 to do 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.640
 one thing that nobody would do for that one 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.670
 it's stuffed I'm going to break it to know 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.670
 if that desert is place and desert 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.740
 and nothing like you have seen takes quite 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.320
 it's been about a minute and a half with 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.630
 you have seen accelerated then it 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.140
 will make you pass quickly but here in front 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.660
 the computer minute and a half two one like 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.430
 You see it takes a long time and I hope that I have 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.180
 liked 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.180
 until now 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.880
 only 80,000 million likes can 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.310
 save the king from the s 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.220

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.140
 you can tweet a photo by killing a 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.290
 zombie with a sword using the hashtag 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.500
