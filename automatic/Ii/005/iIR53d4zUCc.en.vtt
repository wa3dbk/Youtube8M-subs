spectra<00:00:02.010> three<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.120> suspended<00:00:04.050> work<00:00:06.170> that

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
spectra three is a suspended work that

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.270 
spectra three is a suspended work that
moves<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:07.950> has<00:00:08.099> colored<00:00:08.669> fluorescent<00:00:09.540> tubes

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
moves that has colored fluorescent tubes

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.509 
moves that has colored fluorescent tubes
and<00:00:11.280> as<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.179> tubes<00:00:12.480> move<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.349> relationship<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and as the tubes move in relationship to

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.300 
and as the tubes move in relationship to
each<00:00:14.549> other<00:00:15.859> different<00:00:16.859> sort<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.070> color

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
each other different sort of color

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.839 
each other different sort of color
mixers<00:00:17.730> happen<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.050> space<00:00:19.460> well<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.670> one

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
mixers happen in the space well this one

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.640 
mixers happen in the space well this one
was<00:00:21.439> specific<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.550> electronic<00:00:24.060> image<00:00:24.650> so

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
was specific to the electronic image so

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.060 
was specific to the electronic image so
it's<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> deconstructed<00:00:26.759> version<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
it's like a deconstructed version of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.690 
it's like a deconstructed version of
electronic<00:00:29.070> images<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.779> created

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
electronic images which are all created

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
electronic images which are all created
through<00:00:32.700> red<00:00:32.879> green<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.270> blue<00:00:33.450> color<00:00:34.050> mixing

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
through red green and blue color mixing

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.369 
through red green and blue color mixing
so<00:00:34.920> RGB<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.180> that's<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.600> that's<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> data

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
so RGB and that's a that's the data

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.360 
so RGB and that's a that's the data
projectors<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.370> LCD<00:00:39.360> screens<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.370> computer

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
projectors and LCD screens and computer

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.540 
projectors and LCD screens and computer
screens<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.449> took<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.550> starting

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
screens so I took that as a starting

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
screens so I took that as a starting
point<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.899> had<00:00:46.800> red<00:00:47.070> green<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.489> blue<00:00:47.989> lights

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
point and had red green and blue lights

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.880 
point and had red green and blue lights
in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.070> work<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:51.379> combined<00:00:52.379> together<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
in the work that combined together to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
in the work that combined together to
create<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.460> white<00:00:53.730> light<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> near<00:00:54.719> white

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
create a white light or a near white

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.189 
create a white light or a near white
light<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.859> room<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.420> then<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.750> used

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
light in the room and then I used

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.360 
light in the room and then I used
various<00:00:59.190> apertures<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.510> viewing<00:01:01.019> points<00:01:01.410> with

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
various apertures to viewing points with

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.289 
various apertures to viewing points with
various<00:01:03.090> options<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.840> let<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> light<00:01:04.290> through

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
various options to let the light through

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.840 
various options to let the light through
and<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.080> white<00:01:07.259> light<00:01:07.580> comes<00:01:08.580> through

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and as the white light comes through

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.230 
and as the white light comes through
these<00:01:08.970> holes<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.720> separates<00:01:10.350> again<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
these holes it separates again and the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.249 
these holes it separates again and the
holes<00:01:12.479> relate<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:15.509> know<00:01:15.540> photography

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
holes relate to you know photography

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.880 
holes relate to you know photography
with<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> lens<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> aperture<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
with the lens and the aperture and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.609 
with the lens and the aperture and
projected<00:01:19.890> media<00:01:20.720> it's<00:01:21.720> an<00:01:22.020> experimental

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
projected media it's an experimental

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.429 
projected media it's an experimental
practice<00:01:23.460> insofar<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.119> they're<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.689> set

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
practice insofar as they're kind of set

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.359 
practice insofar as they're kind of set
up<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.390> investigate<00:01:27.390> certain<00:01:28.369> physical

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
up to investigate certain physical

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.539 
up to investigate certain physical
phenomenon<00:01:30.060> whether<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.479> light<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:30.750> sound

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
phenomenon whether it's light or sound

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.060 
phenomenon whether it's light or sound
and<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.970> guess<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.600> artwork<00:01:34.200> itself<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.979> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and I guess the artwork itself kind of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.819 
and I guess the artwork itself kind of
sets<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.490> these<00:01:35.960> force<00:01:36.960> fields<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.649> they

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
sets up these force fields that they

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.450 
sets up these force fields that they
play<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.799> they're<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.189> really

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
play in and you know they're not really

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.179 
play in and you know they're not really
end<00:01:41.880> points<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.619> history

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
end points I think it's all the history

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.950 
end points I think it's all the history
of<00:01:44.280> Technology<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.909> kind<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.390> important

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
of Technology is kind of as important

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200 
of Technology is kind of as important
and<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.409> also<00:01:46.710> quick<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.399> fast<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.969> it's<00:01:48.119> a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and it's also quick and fast like it's a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690 
and it's also quick and fast like it's a
very<00:01:48.360> small<00:01:48.719> period<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.140> time<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.610> know

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
very small period of time it's you know

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.899 
very small period of time it's you know
history<00:01:51.360> goes<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.820> ramping<00:01:53.820> up

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
history goes and it and it's ramping up

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.940 
history goes and it and it's ramping up
and<00:01:54.119> becoming<00:01:54.479> more<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and becoming more and more like the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
and becoming more and more like the
changeover<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.640> technology<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.329> there's

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
changeover in technology like there's

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.760 
changeover in technology like there's
never<00:01:57.659> us<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.049> an<00:01:58.140> end<00:01:58.259> point<00:01:58.469> you're<00:01:58.649> always

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
never us at an end point you're always

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
never us at an end point you're always
learning<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.340> new<00:01:59.520> thing<00:01:59.789> new<00:02:00.000> products<00:02:00.539> coming

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
learning a new thing new products coming

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.770 
learning a new thing new products coming
out<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.200> think<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:03.149> whole<00:02:03.360> history<00:02:03.539> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
out I think know that whole history is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.149 
out I think know that whole history is
important<00:02:04.289> to<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.530> where<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.799> come<00:02:05.130> from

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
important to see where it's come from

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.460 
important to see where it's come from
and<00:02:05.820> then<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.719> where<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
and then you know where it's going and

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.990 
and then you know where it's going and
you<00:02:10.470> know<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.710> right<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.130> things<00:02:11.400> changing

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you know the right of things changing

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.140 
you know the right of things changing
and<00:02:12.180> becoming<00:02:12.450> obsolete<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:14.040> interesting<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and becoming obsolete is interesting to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.090 
and becoming obsolete is interesting to
me<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:15.450> what<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.660> kind<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.380> using

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
me and that's what I kind of like using

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.220 
me and that's what I kind of like using
all<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.090> technologies<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.840> well<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.080> new

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
all the technologies as well as new

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.910 
all the technologies as well as new
technologies

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.980
