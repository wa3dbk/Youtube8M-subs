00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:03.820 

here's<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.220> better<00:00:02.429> version<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.210> propane

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:03.830 
here's a better version of the propane

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.720 
here's a better version of the propane
cylinder<00:00:05.629> steam<00:00:06.629> whistle<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.740> we're<00:00:08.429> working

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
cylinder steam whistle and we're working

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.129 
cylinder steam whistle and we're working
with<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.030> air<00:00:09.269> again<00:00:09.599> from<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.019> air

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
with the air again from the air

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:24.420 
with the air again from the air
compressor<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.550> let's<00:00:11.820> hear<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.240> thing<00:00:12.509> now

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.400 

that's<00:00:25.430> about<00:00:25.640> 20<00:00:25.970> psi<00:00:26.240> let's<00:00:27.050> give<00:00:27.290> it<00:00:27.320> a

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
that's about 20 psi let's give it a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:57.380 
that's about 20 psi let's give it a
little<00:00:27.730> boost<00:00:28.730> up

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.330 

this<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.570> made<00:00:58.780> from<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.140> standard<00:00:59.860> propane

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
this is made from a standard propane

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.040 
this is made from a standard propane
cylinder<00:01:00.940> like<00:01:01.090> for<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.330> torch<00:01:01.660> it's<00:01:01.870> about

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
cylinder like for a torch it's about

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.400 
cylinder like for a torch it's about
three<00:01:02.350> inch<00:01:02.970> diameter<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:05.170> I've<00:01:05.290> done

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
three inch diameter what I've done

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.050 
three inch diameter what I've done
instead<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.830> using<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.190> wooden<00:01:06.490> languid

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
instead of using the wooden languid

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.650 
instead of using the wooden languid
plate<00:01:07.920> I'm<00:01:08.920> saying<00:01:09.160> that<00:01:09.250> right<00:01:09.509> that's<00:01:10.509> the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
plate I'm saying that right that's the

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.880 
plate I'm saying that right that's the
bottom<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.200> one<00:01:11.380> cylinder<00:01:11.860> this<00:01:12.640> whole

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
bottom of one cylinder this whole

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.430 
bottom of one cylinder this whole
cylinder<00:01:14.890> here<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.520> I<00:01:15.790> drill<00:01:16.060> out<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.210> top<00:01:16.600> to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
cylinder here and I drill out the top to

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.700 
cylinder here and I drill out the top to
allow<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:17.860> airflow<00:01:18.490> or<00:01:18.610> steam<00:01:19.450> flow<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.590> you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
allow that airflow or steam flow and you

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.370 
allow that airflow or steam flow and you
just<00:01:21.090> carve<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.180> little<00:01:22.270> slit<00:01:22.720> at<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.960> very<00:01:23.229> end

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
just carve a little slit at the very end

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.680 
just carve a little slit at the very end
of<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.530> cylinder<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.030> whole<00:01:25.180> base<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.509> the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
of the cylinder so the whole base of the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.410 
of the cylinder so the whole base of the
cylinder<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.830> languid<00:01:27.220> plate<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:28.240> then

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
cylinder is the languid plate and then

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.650 
cylinder is the languid plate and then
other<00:01:28.690> cylinders<00:01:29.380> use<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:30.149> create<00:01:31.149> a<00:01:31.240> cut<00:01:31.479> up

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
other cylinders use to create a cut up

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.740 
other cylinders use to create a cut up
in<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.440> mouth<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.700> just<00:01:33.880> kind<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.119> clamped

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
in the mouth and I just kind of clamped

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.070 
in the mouth and I just kind of clamped
it<00:01:34.840> on<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.410> end<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.780> allows<00:01:37.780> me<00:01:37.960> to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
it on to the end and that allows me to

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.840 
it on to the end and that allows me to
adjust<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.500> cut<00:01:38.740> up<00:01:38.890> pretty<00:01:39.040> easily<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
adjust the cut up pretty easily and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.950 
adjust the cut up pretty easily and
works<00:01:42.850> out<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.270> lot<00:01:43.330> better<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.729> anyway<00:01:46.720> now

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
works out a lot better so anyway now

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.080 
works out a lot better so anyway now
what<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.590> need<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.950> do<00:01:48.100> is<00:01:48.250> try<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.580> wider<00:01:50.760> body<00:01:51.760> I

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
what I need to do is try a wider body I

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.440 
what I need to do is try a wider body I
guess<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:53.290> here's<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.650> four-inch<00:01:54.450> propane

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
guess so here's a four-inch propane

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.899 
guess so here's a four-inch propane
cylinder<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.770> have<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.310> couple<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.670> these<00:01:57.729> that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
cylinder I have a couple of these that

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.460 
cylinder I have a couple of these that
are<00:01:57.970> empty<00:01:58.150> somebody<00:01:58.570> I'll<00:01:58.659> try<00:01:58.900> something

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
are empty somebody I'll try something

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.310 
are empty somebody I'll try something
new<00:01:59.560> with<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.860> hat<00:02:00.040> anyway<00:02:01.080> talk<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.229> you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
new with the hat anyway talk to you

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.470 
new with the hat anyway talk to you
later
