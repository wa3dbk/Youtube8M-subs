00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
how he does but he's definitely unless

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.660

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
boy there's less damage in Dillon

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.410 
boy there's less damage in Dillon
spraying<00:03:37.010> than<00:03:37.190> there<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.430> at<00:03:37.730> testing<00:03:38.060> us<00:03:38.150> but

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
spraying than there is at testing us but

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.449 
spraying than there is at testing us but
he<00:03:38.569> still<00:03:38.780> has<00:03:38.930> deficits<00:03:39.620> he's<00:03:39.800> not<00:03:40.010> walking

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
he still has deficits he's not walking

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.100 
he still has deficits he's not walking
toppy<00:03:42.730> close<00:03:43.730> but<00:03:44.209> not<00:03:44.330> quite<00:03:44.540> there<00:03:44.810> yet

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
toppy close but not quite there yet

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.380 
toppy close but not quite there yet
developmentally<00:03:46.010> he's<00:03:46.250> probably<00:03:47.000> about<00:03:47.330> a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
developmentally he's probably about a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.030 
developmentally he's probably about a
year<00:03:47.510> 18<00:03:47.959> months<00:03:48.170> behind

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040

year 18 months behind
so<00:03:49.310> we're<00:03:49.730> really<00:03:49.849> hoping<00:03:50.090> meant<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.680> it

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
so we're really hoping meant that and it

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.729 
so we're really hoping meant that and it
gives<00:03:51.890> him<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.160> little<00:03:52.190> bit<00:03:52.519> boost<00:03:53.379> I'd<00:03:54.379> like<00:03:54.620> to

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
gives him a little bit boost I'd like to

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.780 
gives him a little bit boost I'd like to
hear<00:03:54.890> mom<00:03:55.420> there<00:03:56.420> once<00:03:58.360> but<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.660> know
