some<00:00:43.400> muscles

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.819 

let's<00:00:53.310> put<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.670> chicken<00:00:54.360> liver<00:00:54.720> in<00:00:54.870> there

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.330 

everything<00:01:13.660> seems<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.050> be<00:01:14.140> working<00:01:14.310> well<00:01:15.310> I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
everything seems to be working well I

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.330 
everything seems to be working well I
guess<00:01:16.410> we'll<00:01:17.410> see<00:01:17.440> how<00:01:17.590> long<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:17.950> takes<00:01:18.130> where

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
guess we'll see how long it takes where

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.570 
guess we'll see how long it takes where
to<00:01:18.640> boil<00:01:19.270> since<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.870> put<00:01:20.110> send<00:01:20.800> my<00:01:20.890> hot<00:01:21.100> water<00:01:21.310> in

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
to boil since I put send my hot water in

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.430 
to boil since I put send my hot water in
there

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.450 

if<00:01:31.440> you<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.650> what's<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.010> middle<00:01:32.190> there

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
if you know what's in the middle there

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.730 
if you know what's in the middle there
is<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.700> barbecue<00:01:33.210> grill<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.050> not<00:01:34.230> using<00:01:34.440> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
is a barbecue grill but I'm not using it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.470 
is a barbecue grill but I'm not using it
right<00:01:34.980> now<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.610> guess<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.600> turn<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:38.480> just

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
right now I guess I can turn it on just

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.360 
right now I guess I can turn it on just
make<00:01:39.630> sure<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.410> glass<00:01:40.980> lid

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
make sure you don't have the glass lid

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.840 
make sure you don't have the glass lid
on<00:01:41.750> when<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.200> grill

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
on when you use the grill

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.200 
on when you use the grill
so<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.750> put<00:01:45.930> some<00:01:46.050> shrimp<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> grill

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.430 

yes<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.570> let's<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:51.960> how<00:01:52.080> long<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.260> takes

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
yes and let's see how long that takes

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:42.059 
yes and let's see how long that takes
for<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.490> ready

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.729 

yeah<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.790> seems<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.180> cooking<00:02:43.540> right<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
yeah it seems to be cooking right the

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.949 
yeah it seems to be cooking right the
muscle<00:02:45.129> seems<00:02:45.459> like<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:47.019> much<00:02:47.200> already

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.140 

so<00:02:52.560> anyway<00:02:52.920> everything<00:02:53.640> seems<00:02:53.909> to<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.060> working

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
so anyway everything seems to be working

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.880 
so anyway everything seems to be working
