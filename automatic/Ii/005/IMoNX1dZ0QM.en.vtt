it<00:02:31.049> up<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.680> did<00:02:31.859> I<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.579> I<00:02:32.609> guess<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> producer

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it up so did I what I guess the producer

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.990 
it up so did I what I guess the producer
so<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.750> was<00:02:33.989> good<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.349> also<00:02:34.590> dominant<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.910> we

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so I was good and also dominant so we

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
