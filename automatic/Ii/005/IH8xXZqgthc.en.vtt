00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.339
 players are uninhibited so there is everything 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.839
 to fear from this christian team

 actually he was Julian right 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.210
 tastet but it is the Bayonnais who 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.380
 show the most dangerous in this 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 start of match here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 three-quarter with that shaven kick 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 a balloon that will escape the last 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.700
 defender montois and scott spelling 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980

 the first try of this team of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.469
 Bayonne rowing very good footwork 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.090
 Benjamin Boyet 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.399
 the lack of hardness success and the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.070
 vista here from scott spedding bayonne 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.989
 then leads 5 to 0 after a penalty of 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.760
 on both sides the match started on 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.530

 superb pass for marvin o'connor who 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 accelerates before serving outdoors 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.840
 mania ahotaeiloa for the second try 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.969
 of this Bayonnaise team 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.460
 nice movement of the line of three 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.140
 quarters that prepared by the forwards we have 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.899
 saw the speed we saw the talent of joe 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.880
 rokocoko here that of marvin o'connor and 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.679
 then there the conclusion the realism of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 manu ahotaeiloa second try 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.490
 transformed by Benjamin Boyer and this 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.630
 Bayonne team leading 15 to 3 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.759
 yet opposite mont-de-marsan 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 do not abdicate far from it as often 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.060
 the players of mont-de-marsan are going all 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 give in this meeting here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.069
 liebenberg crossed the line but this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.319
 balloon was obviously not flattened 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.329
 referee will appeal to the video is 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.429
 decided after multiple viewing of 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.250
 not validate this test mont-de-marsan 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.979
 then stay 12 lengths and go back to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.119
 Cloakroom led 18-6 difficult baptism 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.829
 fire for scott murray 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.329
 the montan coach passed from player to 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.979
 coast in less than a week 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.719
 back from the locker room everything will go 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.670
 very quickly in the wake here of manu 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.560
 ahotaeiloa mike phillips will serve 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.509
 perfectly guillaume bernad who him to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.000
 manage to resist the last tackle 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.189
 to go behind the third line 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.500
 test in favor of rowing bayonnais this 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.840
 then synonymous with an offensive bonus 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.030
 test that will be validated thanks to the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.859
 video the veneer unfortunately useless 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.130
 of antoine vignau tuquet does not prevent 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:18.510
 Bernad to flatten 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.250
 57th minute of play matt we find this 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.079
 montois team at the initiative antoine 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.000
 vignau-tuquet well supported by his 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.470
 partners will be stopped to a few 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.060
 centimeters of the line and that's the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.829
 half-melee benatar hayette who in 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.930
 strength in power will succeed too 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.209
 to flatten behind the line the first 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.680
 try this montois team 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.780
 an essay that at that time deprives 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.459
 bayonne the offensive bonus so it takes 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.380
 return to the onslaught of the opposing line 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.940
 that's what mcphillips understood here he 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.169
 is taken back a few inches from the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.660
 line but his partners especially 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.940
 support sweat the number 19 marc 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.050
 baget just came into play there 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.090
 propelled into the night by his 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.230
 partners this is a new test for 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.300
 this Bayonnaise team 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.190
 david roumieu here left hanging and 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.840
 alain afflelou president bayonnais do not 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.460
 are not relieved yet because this 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.810
 Bayonnaise team goal ensure the 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.220
 superb show tumbled in the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.170
 last minute mike phillips who 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 offers a Hassan hassan test balloon 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.040
 that he will resist the last charge 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.050
 of the Ghent defense to go him 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.840
 also ended his run in the goal 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.940
 5th montois and so it is for rowing 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.710
 bayonais after this very good job of 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.260
 mike phillips and then this very beautiful 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.060
 conclusion also from sam guerbert 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.890
 39.13 is the final score 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.030
 mont-de-marsan did not deserve but 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.800
 bow with honors 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.110
 bayonne who had never scored more 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.760
 of one try per game we scored 5 this 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.870
