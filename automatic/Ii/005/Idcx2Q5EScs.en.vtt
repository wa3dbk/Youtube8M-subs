00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
place but why don't make it easy on

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.380 
place but why don't make it easy on
yourself<00:00:30.869> right<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.250> ways<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
yourself right one of the ways that I

yourself right one of the ways that I
like<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> paying<00:00:34.710> attention<00:00:34.829> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
like to do this is paying attention to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
like to do this is paying attention to
the<00:00:35.309> periods<00:00:35.730> when<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> moon<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.480> void<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the periods when the moon is void of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.080 
the periods when the moon is void of
course<00:00:37.320> which<00:00:37.890> means<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.610> making<00:00:38.850> any

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
course which means it's not making any

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
course which means it's not making any
aspects<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.200> any<00:00:40.350> other<00:00:40.559> planets<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> there

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
is an app that I really like it's called

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.400 
is an app that I really like it's called
I<00:00:43.920> Luna<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.180> expensive<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
I Luna it's not very expensive and I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.260

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
actually got to help beta test it the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.790 
actually got to help beta test it the
Delta<00:00:48.539> developers<00:00:49.050> help<00:00:49.260> asked<00:00:49.440> me<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> help
