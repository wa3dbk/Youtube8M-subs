00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.539
 Reason 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.800
 there are target size in which animals are tormented so calls the 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.430
 Animal welfare organization four paws now also banned wildlife for the 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.290
 never shut up 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.650
 on the other hand, at the Circus Alberti, it is quite different from the one in Oberndorf am 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.230
 Neckar guesting Detlef d that the latter have heard such a very soft 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.980
 Shut up but we do 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.439
 Here is a brown bear one of the main attractions 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.670
 but it is kept according to the guidelines it seems to be 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.140
 Feels comfortable the world is apparently still in order and that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.270
 good reason to go 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.989
 I was all in school every four days 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.909
 Often this was the only way to make friends the only animals I had the animals at home 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.200
 were 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.360
 Not necessarily friends are the lady from the veterinary office and the lord of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.879
 Ordnungsamt who just as kicked the circus paid a visit 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.590
 Circus pari Frank knows what was going on the Coba all the animals through 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.060
 whether the animals are kept appropriate to the species if the GGG are big enough 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.750
 or if the deal is out and the enclosure is big Dell here he is better 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.930
 but big meadows 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.160
 and he was pleased about also found no defects because no 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.200
 Defects there 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.600
 Percent agreed as always we never actually got in the way because we got the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.430
 Keep animals as they have to 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.790
 and Juve today to Kohl's Alberti quite a lot 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.170
 m40 animals would be there 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.070
 Kansas Camels say we have Friesian Stallions we have around 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.890
 North American horses neighing the smallest promotes so the world-anti- 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.299
 Michel mini ponies we have no monkey family that are the red face 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.030
 Macaques and one of the BayVGH mean that they breed themselves a bit 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.830
 otherwise they live in the colder regions and yes, what they did that too 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.830
 Audience 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.989
 and what is Wolfgang Frank actually doing at Circus Alberti? 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.399
 I'm for a whole bus I realize that already 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.289
 i've been making my dad since i was two years old the scent i did 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.459
 play along and makes that very much like 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.700
 the audience also likes to be good and happy for daily performances 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 McLaren has a lot of fun with the performances 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.300
 as one of the few counterparts Circus Alberti from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.650
 a long tradition since 1812 look good 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.080
 whole generations of girls through Europe a circus at which the performers 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.080
 are still heart and soul in the matter 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.009
 even the music is live and not from the band 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.089
 until Sunday the circus Alberti is still in Oberndorf on the Neckar on the fairground 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.989
