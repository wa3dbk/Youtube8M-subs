00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that code to go off for the check engine

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.370 
that code to go off for the check engine
light<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.300> ended<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.599> being<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.960> emissions

light that ended up being in emissions
code<00:00:32.000> as<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.360> pulling<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.050> part<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
code as I was pulling this part I

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.180 
code as I was pulling this part I
noticed<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> arrow<00:00:36.000> oil<00:00:36.239> separator<00:00:37.160> had<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
noticed the arrow oil separator had a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.510 
noticed the arrow oil separator had a
little<00:00:38.850> bit<00:00:38.969> too<00:00:39.180> much<00:00:39.390> oil<00:00:40.070> going<00:00:41.070> through<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
little bit too much oil going through it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.920 
little bit too much oil going through it
was<00:00:42.510> allowing<00:00:43.079> too<00:00:43.230> much<00:00:43.379> oil<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:45.690> pump

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
was allowing too much oil to pump

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.619 
was allowing too much oil to pump
through<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.270> went<00:00:48.270> ahead<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.450> pulled

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
through it so I went ahead and pulled

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.569 
through it so I went ahead and pulled
that<00:00:48.780> off

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
that off

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.860 
that off
here's<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> old<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.300> dug<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> out<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
here's the old one I just dug it out of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.330 
here's the old one I just dug it out of
garbage<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:54.059> was<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.329> pretty<00:00:54.480> bad<00:00:54.600> shape<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.379> I

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
garbage it was in pretty bad shape and I

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
garbage it was in pretty bad shape and I
believe<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.149> caught<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:57.780> before<00:00:58.260> it

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
believe that I caught it right before it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.279 
believe that I caught it right before it
went<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.570> you've<00:01:00.719> seen<00:01:00.960> any<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
went out and if you've seen any of the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.920 
went out and if you've seen any of the
other<00:01:01.410> videos<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.980> YouTube<00:01:02.850> when<00:01:03.840> these

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
other videos on YouTube when these

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.200 
other videos on YouTube when these
things<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.860> Boxster<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:05.939> start

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
things go out a Boxster will start

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.750 
things go out a Boxster will start
smoking<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.960> crazy<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.310> looks<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.610> you

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
smoking like crazy it looks like you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.039 
smoking like crazy it looks like you
blew<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.970> ring<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.900> bad

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
blew a ring and this one was in bad

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.190 
blew a ring and this one was in bad
shape<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> car<00:01:13.860> has<00:01:14.010> 50,000<00:01:14.670> miles<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
shape and the car has 50,000 miles on it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
shape and the car has 50,000 miles on it
it's<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.350> time<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> replace<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:19.820> next<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
it's about time to replace it next to it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.520 
it's about time to replace it next to it
I<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.509> new<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:24.229> should<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.350> good

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
I have the new one and should be good

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.429 
I have the new one and should be good
for<00:01:25.710> another<00:01:26.060> I'd<00:01:27.060> hope<00:01:27.390> 50,000<00:01:28.259> but

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
for another I'd hope 50,000 but

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
for another I'd hope 50,000 but
realistically<00:01:29.100> maybe<00:01:29.430> twenty<00:01:29.850> thirty

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
realistically maybe twenty thirty

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.690 
realistically maybe twenty thirty
thousand<00:01:30.740> still<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.220> while<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> got

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
thousand still all in all while you got

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
thousand still all in all while you got
the<00:01:32.729> car<00:01:33.000> part<00:01:33.710> if<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:34.860> doing<00:01:35.189> anything

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the car part if you're doing anything

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.609 
the car part if you're doing anything
like<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> bad<00:01:36.509> idea<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
like this it's not a bad idea if you

other pieces for the top as well but
they've<00:01:56.520> even<00:01:56.700> improved<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> design<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:58.200> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
they've even improved the design this is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.260 
they've even improved the design this is
actually<00:01:58.590> original<00:01:58.740> Porsche<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.119> can

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
actually original Porsche but you can

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.459 
actually original Porsche but you can
tell<00:02:00.420> where<00:02:00.540> they've<00:02:00.659> upgraded<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.140> design

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
tell where they've upgraded the design

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.359 
tell where they've upgraded the design
it's<00:02:02.430> larger<00:02:03.590> oring<00:02:04.590> compared<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> old

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it's larger oring compared to the old

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.290 
it's larger oring compared to the old
one<00:02:05.520> smaller<00:02:06.030> one<00:02:07.759> but<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:08.879> gonna<00:02:08.970> get<00:02:09.149> back

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
one smaller one but I'm gonna get back

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.999 
one smaller one but I'm gonna get back
into<00:02:09.479> putting<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.530> thing<00:02:10.679> back<00:02:10.739> together

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
into putting this thing back together

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.559 
into putting this thing back together
and<00:02:11.250> I'll<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.489> another<00:02:11.520> video<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.090> it
