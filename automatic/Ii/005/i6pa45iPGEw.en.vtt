00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.989
 we wrote 6 addict 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.129
 food 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.350
 I will search now 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.890
 We find street musicians 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:32.680
 so you go to creative magic in elche 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.680
 m 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 in the 80s, what was really there was 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.580
 rock and roll had fon that there was disco 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840
 and nothing then worked and now by 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.270
 we are trying to do the same thing 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.620
 people need an outlet and I think that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.190
 the music is tremendous speak for 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.190
 feeling better 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.090
 we did something good together if that 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.520
 and what happened happened fast music 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.020
 already reached a technological level 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.400
 that is showing wander everything to 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.930
 through music and fashion what 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.980
 happened 20 years ago what happens is 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.840
 what do we want to do with a sound 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.250
 simple first single that we're going to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.120
 make you call life cheating 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.010
 doctor 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.739
 is a simple that represents what is 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.690
 life in general and many many things 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.540
 which people do not like to talk about 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.190
 nor look straight ahead just because 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.080
 they are unexpected things in life that's why 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.080
 same is called life cheats 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:45.490
 I feel that life is very cruel it seems 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.490
 being a wild animal is all in 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:53.030
 abundance and you know it sometimes I feel 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:57.050
 that I lack the air that I hope that 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.800
 one day is not necessary if the waves 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.260
 never give you a shot 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.260
 I feel that I lack the light 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.670
 it drives me crazy 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.670
