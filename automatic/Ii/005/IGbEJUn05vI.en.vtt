00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.830
 the root of here went to conduct 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:18.869
 hence what is where it starts not 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.000
 depart we expose the coaxiality of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.279
 forearm in relation to him goes 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 no farther wrist 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:32.239
 and on the weakest part on your finger 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:42.960
 here are two options the outside 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:49.500
 from here here we are going to prune here 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:54.920
 there is a first moment this is work on how 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.650
 conduct but the first is a protective action 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.239
 possible hike passage here 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.239
 where is the job 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:16.610
 further possible care is drawing then 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.610
 there is itself holding then 1. 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.710
 self-defense from being hit by a knife from below 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.430
 performed from the starting position 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.369
 base stand meet an attacking hand 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.410
 the enemy from the bottom up with the rotation 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.580
 forearm at the point of contact and howling 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.350
 knife territory 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:24.739
 up and outward further with work on 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.430
 brush or with knocking out weapons 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:33.739
 dynamics 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.180
 sharp attacking action time here how 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.600
 way 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.850
 cop and here immediately a little bit to yourself 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.850
 here under all the work here 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.830
 wireless 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.020
 that is the difference
