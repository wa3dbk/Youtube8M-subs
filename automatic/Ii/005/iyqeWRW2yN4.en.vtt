00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
am not kidding there were times where I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.210 
am not kidding there were times where I
had<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:53.840> stop<00:00:54.079> playing<00:00:54.260> just<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:54.800> my<00:00:54.920> head<00:00:55.070> was

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
had to stop playing just so my head was

stop spinning who on earth in the
programming<00:00:57.530> team<00:00:57.710> ever<00:00:58.100> thought<00:00:58.370> that

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
programming team ever thought that

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.130 
programming team ever thought that
making<00:00:58.760> such<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:58.940> distracting<00:00:59.630> background

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
making such a distracting background

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.990 
making such a distracting background
would<00:01:00.350> be<00:01:00.380> a<00:01:00.500> good<00:01:00.739> idea<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.700> levels

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
would be a good idea the levels

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.729 
would be a good idea the levels
themselves<00:01:02.120> normally<00:01:02.780> consist<00:01:03.200> of<00:01:03.320> thrusting

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
themselves normally consist of thrusting

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
trying not to throw up from the worlds

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.379 
trying not to throw up from the worlds
constantly<00:01:09.439> moving<00:01:09.649> background<00:01:10.310> okay<00:01:10.909> maybe

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:11.389 
constantly moving background okay maybe

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:13.389 
constantly moving background okay maybe
the<00:01:11.600> last<00:01:11.749> one<00:01:11.899> wasn't<00:01:12.409> planned<00:01:12.649> but<00:01:12.979> more<00:01:13.310> of

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
the last one wasn't planned but more of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.520 
the last one wasn't planned but more of
a<00:01:13.459> side<00:01:13.700> effect<00:01:13.729> of<00:01:14.179> the<00:01:14.299> insane<00:01:14.749> level<00:01:15.200> design

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
a side effect of the insane level design

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.020 
a side effect of the insane level design
other<00:01:15.950> than<00:01:16.219> the<00:01:16.310> background<00:01:16.490> that'll<00:01:16.909> make

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
other than the background that'll make

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.489 
other than the background that'll make
you<00:01:17.149> sick<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.780> main<00:01:18.020> problem<00:01:18.350> with<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:18.499 
you sick the main problem with the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:20.379 
you sick the main problem with the
levels<00:01:18.799> is<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:18.979> they<00:01:19.219> lasted<00:01:19.670> too<00:01:19.850> long<00:01:20.090> to

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:20.389 
levels is that they lasted too long to

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:22.120 
levels is that they lasted too long to
be<00:01:20.539> enjoyable<00:01:21.079> it<00:01:21.439> wouldn't<00:01:21.709> be<00:01:21.770> as<00:01:21.889> bad<00:01:22.069> if

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
be enjoyable it wouldn't be as bad if

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.679 
be enjoyable it wouldn't be as bad if
they<00:01:22.369> only<00:01:22.490> lasted<00:01:22.969> two<00:01:22.999> to<00:01:23.179> three<00:01:23.389> minutes

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
they only lasted two to three minutes

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.899 
they only lasted two to three minutes
but<00:01:24.139> five<00:01:24.409> minutes<00:01:24.770> or<00:01:24.920> more<00:01:25.159> it<00:01:25.490> got<00:01:25.700> really

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
but five minutes or more it got really

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.029 
but five minutes or more it got really
boring<00:01:26.299> really<00:01:26.810> fast<00:01:27.079> now<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.619> controls

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
boring really fast now the controls

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.620 
boring really fast now the controls
worked<00:01:28.249> okay<00:01:28.700> there<00:01:29.179> will<00:01:29.299> be<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:29.539> occasional

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
worked okay there will be the occasional

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.870 
worked okay there will be the occasional
mystery<00:01:30.439> to<00:01:30.499> my<00:01:30.709> hand<00:01:30.950> movements<00:01:31.459> but<00:01:31.639> for<00:01:31.789> the

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
really care now even though the game was

really care now even though the game was
really<00:01:54.349> hard<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.709> sit<00:01:54.889> through<00:01:55.069> with<00:01:55.549> its

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
really hard to sit through with its

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.819 
really hard to sit through with its
rotating<00:01:56.179> world<00:01:56.359> background<00:01:56.899> design<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.499> was

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
rotating world background design I was

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.109 
rotating world background design I was
determined<00:01:58.189> to<00:01:58.429> get<00:01:58.579> through<00:01:58.759> this<00:01:58.880> game

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
determined to get through this game

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.849 
determined to get through this game
hoping<00:01:59.779> there<00:01:59.929> was<00:02:00.020> something<00:02:00.319> good<00:02:00.469> towards

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
hoping there was something good towards

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.679 
hoping there was something good towards
the<00:02:00.979> end<00:02:01.130> until<00:02:01.789> I<00:02:01.819> screwed<00:02:02.239> up<00:02:02.389> too<00:02:02.569> many

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
the end until I screwed up too many

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.599 
the end until I screwed up too many
times<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:03.499> gave<00:02:03.709> me<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.889> game<00:02:04.130> over<00:02:04.340> on

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
times and it gave me a game over on

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.729 
times and it gave me a game over on
world<00:02:04.880> 2<00:02:05.119> -<00:02:05.389> now<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:05.899> have<00:02:06.139> no<00:02:06.289> problem<00:02:06.679> with

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
world 2 - now I have no problem with

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:08.080 
world 2 - now I have no problem with
that<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.219> I<00:02:07.369> figured<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.849> I<00:02:07.939> would<00:02:07.999> just

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
that and I figured that I would just

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.059 
that and I figured that I would just
restart<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:08.720> level<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.259> mean<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.770> kids

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
restart that level I mean this is a kids

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.380 
restart that level I mean this is a kids
