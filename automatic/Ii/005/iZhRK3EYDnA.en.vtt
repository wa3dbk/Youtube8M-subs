00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
like each other it seems like maybe

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.900 
like each other it seems like maybe
Dwight<00:05:21.320> may<00:05:21.530> may<00:05:21.860> try<00:05:22.100> some<00:05:22.310> kind<00:05:22.490> of<00:05:22.520> mutiny

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
maybe he's in the same kind of situation

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.510 
maybe he's in the same kind of situation
that<00:05:24.950> Rick<00:05:25.340> is<00:05:25.370> where<00:05:26.000> negan<00:05:26.990> just<00:05:27.169> kind<00:05:27.380> of

took<00:05:28.520> over<00:05:28.700> his<00:05:29.000> group<00:05:29.300> maybe<00:05:29.570> so<00:05:30.290> maybe<00:05:30.320> we'll

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
took over his group maybe so maybe we'll

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.780

see a little bit about that in the

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.070 
see a little bit about that in the
future<00:05:31.940> but<00:05:32.210> it<00:05:32.330> seems<00:05:32.510> like<00:05:32.570> Dwight<00:05:32.870> doesn't
