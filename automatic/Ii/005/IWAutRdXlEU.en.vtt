and<00:00:00.120> there's<00:00:00.630> truth<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:00.960> that<00:00:01.230> because<00:00:01.439> as

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
and there's truth to that because as

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.500 
and there's truth to that because as
they<00:00:01.920> say<00:00:02.129> in<00:00:02.280> business<00:00:02.669> there<00:00:02.879> are<00:00:02.970> sales<00:00:03.210> and

they say in business there are sales and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.510 
they say in business there are sales and
then<00:00:03.600> there's<00:00:03.750> everything<00:00:03.990> else<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:05.069> sale<00:00:05.490> is

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
then there's everything else the sale is

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.550 
then there's everything else the sale is
very<00:00:06.089> very<00:00:06.299> important<00:00:06.779> if<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.049> can<00:00:07.290> get<00:00:07.529> that

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
very very important if you can get that

very very important if you can get that
sale<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.340> can<00:00:08.519> get<00:00:08.670> something<00:00:08.910> profitable

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
sale you can get something profitable

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.879 
sale you can get something profitable
yet<00:00:09.630> it's<00:00:09.780> not<00:00:09.960> profitable<00:00:10.230> now<00:00:10.620> because

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
yet it's not profitable now because

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.919 
yet it's not profitable now because
you're<00:00:11.010> paying<00:00:11.340> Gambino<00:00:12.300> type<00:00:12.540> interest

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
you're paying Gambino type interest

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.070 
you're paying Gambino type interest
rates<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.920> change<00:00:14.420> but<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> sale<00:00:15.839> will

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
rates that can change but the sale will

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.439

still be there and I remember was we had

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.260 
still be there and I remember was we had
a<00:00:19.039> somebody<00:00:20.039> who<00:00:20.310> my<00:00:20.640> grandfather<00:00:21.150> had

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
brought in to help us he had work he was

brought in to help us he had work he was
a<00:00:24.240> controller<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:24.689> coca-cola<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.590> would

a controller for coca-cola and I would

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.609 
a controller for coca-cola and I would
assume<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.130> way<00:00:26.400> before<00:00:26.460> Excel<00:00:27.410> today<00:00:28.410> he

assume this is way before Excel today he

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
assume this is way before Excel today he
was<00:00:29.279> probably<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.640> his<00:00:29.699> 20s<00:00:30.150> today<00:00:30.359> I'm<00:00:30.480> going

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
was probably in his 20s today I'm going

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.590 
was probably in his 20s today I'm going
to<00:00:30.960> guess<00:00:31.080> he's<00:00:31.260> 90<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> he<00:00:32.700> could<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.120> handle

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
to guess he's 90 and he could not handle

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270 
to guess he's 90 and he could not handle
the<00:00:33.840> fact<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.530> were<00:00:34.680> paying<00:00:34.920> these<00:00:35.070> type

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the fact that we were paying these type

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.680 
the fact that we were paying these type
of<00:00:35.309> interest<00:00:35.760> rates<00:00:35.940> he<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.300> couldn't

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of interest rates he just couldn't

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.810 
of interest rates he just couldn't
handle<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.290> every<00:00:38.040> once<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> while<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
handle it and every once in a while the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.400 
handle it and every once in a while the
head<00:00:38.969> factor<00:00:39.420> would<00:00:39.510> come<00:00:39.719> downstairs<00:00:40.200> he<00:00:40.320> was

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
head factor would come downstairs he was

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.720 
head factor would come downstairs he was
about<00:00:40.530> an<00:00:40.649> 80<00:00:40.860> year<00:00:41.010> old<00:00:41.160> man<00:00:41.219> he<00:00:41.489> would<00:00:41.579> just

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
about an 80 year old man he would just

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.900 
about an 80 year old man he would just
sit<00:00:41.940> down<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.180> start<00:00:43.520> talking<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.610> his

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
past and giving us ideas and of course

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
past and giving us ideas and of course
the<00:00:47.399> best<00:00:47.579> idea<00:00:48.059> would<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.300> been<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.629> run

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the best idea would have been to run

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.680 
the best idea would have been to run
like<00:00:49.020> hell<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.469> him<00:00:49.670> but<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.270> he<00:00:51.420> would<00:00:51.570> just

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
sit down to give us ideas and he would

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619 
sit down to give us ideas and he would
just<00:00:53.129> go<00:00:53.340> back<00:00:53.610> at<00:00:53.820> history<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.390> just

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
just go back at history and just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.299 
just go back at history and just
reminisce<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.410> day<00:00:55.590> he<00:00:55.770> SAT<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
reminisce and one day he SAT there and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.290 
reminisce and one day he SAT there and
he<00:00:56.399> said<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> know<00:00:58.460> when<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> steel

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
he said you know when I was in the steel

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.740 
he said you know when I was in the steel
business<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.910> controller<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
business and this this controller of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
business and this this controller of
ours<00:01:03.960> looked<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:04.949> him<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.129> said<00:01:05.309> hilly<00:01:05.580> you're

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
ours looked at him and said hilly you're

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.580 
ours looked at him and said hilly you're
still<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> steel<00:01:06.960> business<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:10.200> was

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
still in the steel business that was

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.550 
still in the steel business that was
that<00:01:11.100> was<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that was what was going on that was the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
that was what was going on that was the
atmosphere<00:01:14.270> that<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.080> knew<00:01:16.290> we

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
atmosphere that was going on we knew we

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.320 
atmosphere that was going on we knew we
were<00:01:16.530> being<00:01:16.860> taken<00:01:17.310> advantage<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.119> knew

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
were being taken advantage of we knew

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.850 
were being taken advantage of we knew
that<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.840> again<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.290> come<00:01:19.500> back<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that but again you come back to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.969 
that but again you come back to
programmatically<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
programmatically so that's that's the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.539 
programmatically so that's that's the
formula<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.119> lets<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:26.130> they're

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
formula right that lets them so they're

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
formula right that lets them so they're
able<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.880> build<00:01:27.060> high<00:01:27.270> volume<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.930> high

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
able to build high volume with high

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:51.120 
able to build high volume with high
Pender<00:01:28.590> volume<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:33.170> okay

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.800 

and<00:01:52.130> does<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.310> come<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.030> is<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.390> come<00:01:53.659> in

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
and does that come so is that come in

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.410 
and does that come so is that come in
terms<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> foot<00:01:54.500> having<00:01:55.040> this<00:01:55.420> smaller

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
terms of the foot having this smaller

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.969 
terms of the foot having this smaller
formulary<00:01:57.020> la<00:01:57.229> seem<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.530> have<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.680> thinner

use<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.840> do<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:26.989> think<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.830> think<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.100> can

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
use so do you think you think you can

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.979 
use so do you think you think you can
get<00:02:28.310> better<00:02:28.489> terms<00:02:28.910> here<00:02:29.209> then<00:02:29.840> you're

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
get better terms here then you're

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.600 
get better terms here then you're
getting<00:02:30.230> from<00:02:30.470> buying<00:02:30.890> them<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.280> market

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
getting from buying them on the market

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:41.170 
getting from buying them on the market
or<00:02:39.310> right<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.340> think<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.760> think<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.030> advantage

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
or right I think I think the advantage

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.430 
or right I think I think the advantage
to<00:02:41.980> two<00:02:42.980> twin<00:02:43.220> met<00:02:43.400> here<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.230> now<00:02:45.230> they

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
to two twin met here is that now they

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.229 
to two twin met here is that now they
can<00:02:45.590> get<00:02:45.680> terms<00:02:45.980> from<00:02:46.160> their<00:02:46.370> supplier<00:02:46.820> they

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
can get terms from their supplier they

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.640 
can get terms from their supplier they
can<00:02:47.390> negotiate<00:02:47.810> those<00:02:47.989> terms<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.380> get<00:02:48.500> some

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
can negotiate those terms and get some

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.870 
can negotiate those terms and get some
credit<00:02:48.829> so<00:02:49.130> they're<00:02:49.250> not<00:02:49.340> having<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.640> put<00:02:49.790> all

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
credit so they're not having to put all

credit so they're not having to put all
the<00:02:49.970> money<00:02:50.000> up<00:02:50.329> right<00:02:50.510> at<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.690> beginning<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
the money up right at the beginning and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.990 
the money up right at the beginning and
they<00:02:51.709> get<00:02:51.860> some<00:02:52.010> power<00:02:52.160> with<00:02:52.459> those<00:02:52.610> vendors

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000

that they can control the usage for that
particular<00:03:12.140> product<00:03:12.680> they<00:03:12.769> might<00:03:12.950> say<00:03:13.100> that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
particular product they might say that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.979 
particular product they might say that
you<00:03:13.340> know<00:03:13.400> something<00:03:13.730> will<00:03:13.970> give<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.390> PPD

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
you know something will give you a PPD

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.069 
you know something will give you a PPD
on<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.380> product<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.280> customer<00:03:17.079> so

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
on that product for that customer so

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.780 
on that product for that customer so
that<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:18.890> something<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.430> started

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
that that is something that we started

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.270 
that that is something that we started
doing<00:03:19.910> fairly<00:03:20.299> later<00:03:20.950> into<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.040> game<00:03:22.250> but

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
doing fairly later into the game but

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.110 
doing fairly later into the game but
it's<00:03:22.609> something<00:03:22.760> we<00:03:22.970> started<00:03:23.329> doing<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.840> and

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
it's something we started doing and and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.880 
it's something we started doing and and
again<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.299> concept<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.079> very<00:03:27.380> good<00:03:27.440> concept

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
again the concept is a very good concept

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.470 
again the concept is a very good concept
somebody<00:03:28.160> did<00:03:28.370> bring<00:03:28.579> up<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:28.910> forget<00:03:29.359> who

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
somebody did bring up and I forget who

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.990 
somebody did bring up and I forget who
it<00:03:29.600> was<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> very<00:03:30.260> good<00:03:30.440> question<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.980> now<00:03:31.970> that

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
it was a very good question is now that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.580 
it was a very good question is now that
you<00:03:32.239> know<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.600> PPD<00:03:33.049> is<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> model<00:03:33.560> that

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
you know that the PPD is a model that

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.699 
you know that the PPD is a model that
works<00:03:33.859> why<00:03:34.579> isn't<00:03:34.820> everybody<00:03:35.000> doing<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.709> and

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
works why isn't everybody doing it and

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.610 
works why isn't everybody doing it and
especially<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.910> big<00:03:38.720> players<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.230> answer<00:03:39.590> is

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
especially the big players the answer is

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.300 
especially the big players the answer is
is<00:03:39.920> because<00:03:40.070> they<00:03:40.910> can't<00:03:41.269> all<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:42.310> advantages

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
is because they can't all the advantages

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.720 
is because they can't all the advantages
or<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.610> we<00:03:43.909> are<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.330> PPD<00:03:45.319> evolved<00:03:45.980> company

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
or the we are a PPD evolved company

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.250 
or the we are a PPD evolved company
meaning<00:03:47.730> we're<00:03:48.150> going<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.660> formulary

type of brand in each type of product
that<00:03:56.970> lowers<00:03:57.450> our<00:03:57.630> costs<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:59.160> lowers<00:03:59.520> our

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
that lowers our costs that lowers our

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.960 
that lowers our costs that lowers our
inventory<00:04:00.330> costs<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:01.320> gives<00:04:01.680> us<00:04:01.970> less

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
inventory costs that gives us less

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.640 
inventory costs that gives us less
billing<00:04:03.480> people<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.020> have<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.320> deal<00:04:04.500> with

billing people that we have to deal with

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.740 
billing people that we have to deal with
because<00:04:04.830> it's<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.190> simple<00:04:05.550> three<00:04:06.390> dollars<00:04:06.630> and

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
because it's a simple three dollars and

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.060 
because it's a simple three dollars and
twenty-five<00:04:06.990> cents<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.380> day<00:04:07.470> times<00:04:07.620> 30<00:04:07.890> days

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
twenty-five cents a day times 30 days

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.160 
twenty-five cents a day times 30 days
and<00:04:08.220> whatnot<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.210> changes<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.720> bunch<00:04:09.990> of

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
and whatnot so it changes a bunch of

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.410 
and whatnot so it changes a bunch of
things<00:04:10.410> but<00:04:10.620> if<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:11.130> company<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.850> is<00:04:12.000> already

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
doing this the standard cost plus model

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.170 
doing this the standard cost plus model

staff<00:07:48.219> they<00:07:49.060> become<00:07:49.389> dependent<00:07:49.900> on<00:07:49.960> these

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:50.139 
staff they become dependent on these

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:52.740 
staff they become dependent on these
cells<00:07:50.580> so<00:07:51.580> it's<00:07:51.699> a<00:07:51.759> very<00:07:51.789> they've<00:07:52.330> taken<00:07:52.539> a

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750 
cells so it's a very they've taken a

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.779 
cells so it's a very they've taken a
business<00:07:53.289> that<00:07:53.409> maybe<00:07:53.770> we<00:07:54.310> would<00:07:54.490> look<00:07:54.580> at<00:07:54.729> and

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:54.789 
business that maybe we would look at and

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:56.579 
business that maybe we would look at and
say<00:07:54.969> it's<00:07:55.060> not<00:07:55.210> that<00:07:55.449> interesting<00:07:55.599> and<00:07:56.529> I

00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:56.589 
say it's not that interesting and I

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:57.929 
say it's not that interesting and I
think<00:07:56.800> they<00:07:56.889> made<00:07:57.069> it<00:07:57.189> into<00:07:57.339> a<00:07:57.400> business<00:07:57.580> that

00:07:57.929 --> 00:07:57.939 
think they made it into a business that

00:07:57.939 --> 00:07:59.760 
think they made it into a business that
is<00:07:58.180> pretty<00:07:58.449> interesting<00:07:58.719> and<00:07:59.050> it<00:07:59.500> is<00:07:59.589> pretty

00:07:59.760 --> 00:07:59.770 
is pretty interesting and it is pretty

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.249 
is pretty interesting and it is pretty
defensible<00:08:00.430> by<00:08:01.270> being<00:08:01.479> clever<00:08:01.750> about<00:08:01.960> their

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:02.259 
defensible by being clever about their

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:05.219 
defensible by being clever about their
business<00:08:02.919> model<00:08:03.400> so<00:08:03.699> I<00:08:03.969> again<00:08:04.839> I<00:08:04.870> think<00:08:05.080> that's

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:05.229 
business model so I again I think that's

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:09.360 
business model so I again I think that's
is<00:08:06.009> it<00:08:06.189> serendipity<00:08:07.949> you<00:08:08.949> know<00:08:09.039> we'll<00:08:09.190> have<00:08:09.279> to

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.370 
is it serendipity you know we'll have to

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.750 
is it serendipity you know we'll have to
ask<00:08:09.580> ourselves<00:08:09.759> but<00:08:10.270> you<00:08:10.659> know
