00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.160
 in the tom and i'm still from 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.990
 the pc games hardware and welcome you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.880
 today in our test lab and today 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.429
 There's a little unboxing of something 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 brand new and indeed the liver lv 12 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.960
 CPU cooler Usually we know the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.550
 he brand of power supplies but this time 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.189
 They also have a cooler segment 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.630
 expanded and I'll show you something 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.769
 we have everything in the pack here 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.670
 first find the pack yourself 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.320
 black-orange maybe for dortmund 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.780
 fans quite nice bayern fans will be 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.610
 about another coloring friend 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.920
 The thing is compatible with a 2 1 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.950
 three counters so the whole gaming amd 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.469
 sockeln down to socket 939 and at inter 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.300
 it goes down to socket 775 and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 continue to hold brackets for 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.030
 the high end socket 2011 left the whole 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 now makes on pulling this one 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.250
 what a pretty simple construction 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.920
 Cool and cool is the fan 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.320
 cooler we are already pre-assembled 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.059
 have the black edition here now 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.159
 This complete cooler is just like you 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.869
 looks in black also painted the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.869
 inside of the cooling fins that looks 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.340
 actually quite cool when we're there 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.200
 look down on the base of the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 cooler then we have the here 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.880
 copper heatpipes which then in the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.030
 fan insert and the heat-up 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 Derived is a 120 mm fan 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.900
 that is a second few such 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.250
 that means you can also cling 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020
 mount a second fan again 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.189
 if you want that 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.570
 I will take it off for a moment then I show 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.000
 you have a special feature in this 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.619
 winter and here in the back there is one 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 rotary switch has the three positions 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 bringing the different maximum 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.220
 speed of the fan can specify 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.909
 this goes up to 2200 rpm 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.380
 1800 to 2500 down depending on how much 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.909
 Cooling performance you want or how 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 quiet your system should be 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.820
 So we can do it in advance 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.070
 choose how fast the fan is maximum 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.360
 we turn for our test 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.180
 By the way, the highest settings 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.780
 chosen and the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.950
 to find out the maximum cooling power 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.080
 he evaluates the volume he finds then 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.130
 Also a test of this video 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.250
 That's what we've got 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.780
 material to install it relative 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.610
 clear is a backplate the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.590
 suitable for both inter and d 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.650
 This is the old mechanism 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.350
 for the cpu cooler then then we have 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.380
 screw some more and also lies 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.180
 another small wrench 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.770
 here with the screws would be 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.310
 That's it 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.989
 even an instruction gs sufficient 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.390
 educated 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.010
 multilingual relatively short 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.430
 but has all the important ones 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.950
 Information if the chinese 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.770
 can also and otherwise it was 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.010
 actually pack in here, too 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.920
 sometimes a small spacer 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.200
 yes, there are also things to the way completely 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.209
 in white as another alternative 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.370
 maybe for the zsc phantom or something 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.410
 a relatively interesting alternative 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.209
 only thing here in the design of the optical 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.250
 It's a pity that is 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.750
 they finally hold the mechanisms in place 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.130
 the same color are painted too 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.989
 the cool that has our little one 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.290
 small break a visual though 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.750
 otherwise the thing is the optics and 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.650
 the value feels good and 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.900
 has succeeded very well 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.820
 the exact results of the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.410
 cooling capacities cds the corresponding 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.739
 Articles 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.280
 the result is good and we'll see each other 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.280
 next time
