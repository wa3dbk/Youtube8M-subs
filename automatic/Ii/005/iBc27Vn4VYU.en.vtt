00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.910 
anything or you could just do control
for<00:02:41.790> separate<00:02:42.750> ones<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.110> anyways<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.860> you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
for separate ones but anyways so you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.490 
for separate ones but anyways so you
take<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.160> ones<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.819> want<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.329> then<00:02:48.500> you

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
take the ones that you want and then you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.050 
take the ones that you want and then you
just<00:02:49.739> drag<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:51.239> do<00:02:51.390> control<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:53.060> then

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
just drag it you do control a and then

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.340 
just drag it you do control a and then
you<00:02:54.209> drag<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.570> into<00:02:55.549> their<00:02:56.549> folder<00:02:57.060> then<00:02:58.019> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
you drag it into their folder then it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.479 
you drag it into their folder then it
should<00:02:58.650> load<00:02:58.920> all<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.459> them<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:05.010> works<00:03:05.340> for

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
should load all of them this works for

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.220 
should load all of them this works for
XP<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.390> Vista<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.640> as<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:09.299> can<00:03:09.450> see<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.959> ones

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
XP and Vista and as you can see the ones

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.900 
XP and Vista and as you can see the ones
I<00:03:10.730> don't<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:11.819> see<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.420> but<00:03:13.730> here<00:03:14.730> wait

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
I don't really see this but here wait

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.479 
I don't really see this but here wait
the<00:03:17.910> ones<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:19.350> lock<00:03:19.739> thing<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
the ones with that lock thing on the

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.410 
the ones with that lock thing on the
side<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:21.000> means<00:03:21.630> they<00:03:21.840> can't<00:03:22.109> become<00:03:22.530> trick

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
side that means they can't become trick

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.970 
side that means they can't become trick
compatible<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:26.450> dsi<00:03:27.450> for<00:03:28.170> torque<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
compatible with the dsi for torque it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.680 
compatible with the dsi for torque it
needs<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.549> AP<00:03:30.329> files<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:33.000> locked<00:03:33.359> it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
needs a AP files and if it's locked it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.729 
needs a AP files and if it's locked it
can't<00:03:34.019> become<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.730> dsi<00:03:36.540> usually<00:03:37.019> converts<00:03:37.500> it

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
can't become the dsi usually converts it

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.720 
can't become the dsi usually converts it
if<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.220> not<00:03:38.519> locked<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:40.260> AP<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.370> play<00:03:41.549> it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
if it's not locked to a AP to play it

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.840 
if it's not locked to a AP to play it
and<00:03:43.730> um

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
and um

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.790 
and um
if<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.540> has<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.690> lock<00:03:46.930> on<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.350> just<00:03:47.500> can't

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
if it has a lock on it you just can't

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.340 
if it has a lock on it you just can't
you<00:03:47.980> have<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.250> find<00:03:48.460> different<00:03:48.610> songs<00:03:49.350> you

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
you have to find different songs you

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.470 
you have to find different songs you
could<00:03:50.530> look<00:03:50.710> around<00:03:50.830> YouTube<00:03:51.430> for<00:03:51.700> like<00:03:51.880> hacks

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
could look around YouTube for like hacks

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.070 
could look around YouTube for like hacks
of<00:03:52.810> how<00:03:52.990> to<00:03:53.050> turn<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.590> lock<00:03:53.830> thing<00:03:54.390> into<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.600> pee

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
of how to turn the lock thing into a pee

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.410 
of how to turn the lock thing into a pee
but<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.590> don't<00:03:57.520> feel<00:03:57.760> like<00:03:57.880> doing<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.270> right

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
ones that aren't locked you could do

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.380 
ones that aren't locked you could do
those<00:04:05.980> but<00:04:06.720> that's<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.990> for<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:08.440> oh<00:04:08.850> sorry<00:04:09.850> duh

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
did but like all these are locks so they

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.110 
did but like all these are locks so they
can<00:04:53.680> have<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.890> convert<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.340> into<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.550> piece<00:04:55.090> of

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
can have to convert it into a piece of

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.090 
can have to convert it into a piece of
luck<00:04:55.450> to<00:04:55.540> you<00:04:55.570> try<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:55.870> play<00:04:56.110> it<00:04:56.170> it<00:04:56.860> says

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
luck to you try to play it it says

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.030 
luck to you try to play it it says
cannot<00:04:57.520> play<00:04:57.820> I'll<00:04:58.420> play<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:59.410> one<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.770> can

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
cannot play I'll play the one that can

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.360 
cannot play I'll play the one that can
be<00:05:00.070> played<00:05:00.490> um

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.800 

I'll<00:05:07.370> play

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.840 

and<00:05:14.380> then<00:05:14.560> you<00:05:14.710> could<00:05:14.919> like<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.190> change<00:05:15.400> the

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
and then you could like to change the

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.500 
and then you could like to change the
top<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:17.350> what<00:05:17.500> everyone<00:05:17.950> it's<00:05:18.280> really<00:05:18.460> cool

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.750 

Mario<00:05:22.510> coins<00:05:26.130> there's<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.190> whole<00:05:27.340> bunch<00:05:27.520> from

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
Mario coins there's a whole bunch from

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.940 
Mario coins there's a whole bunch from
there<00:05:27.910> you<00:05:27.970> can<00:05:28.030> do<00:05:28.210> um<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:29.440> then<00:05:29.650> you<00:05:29.770> go<00:05:29.919> into

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
there you can do um and then you go into

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.879 
there you can do um and then you go into
this<00:05:30.340> and<00:05:30.730> then<00:05:30.910> you<00:05:30.940> can<00:05:31.180> change<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.720> pitch

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.740 

we<00:05:35.889> go<00:05:36.100> up<00:05:36.310> at<00:05:36.520> 2-2<00:05:36.700> pitch<00:05:37.060> higher<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.630> go

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
we go up at 2-2 pitch higher to go

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.659 
we go up at 2-2 pitch higher to go
forward<00:05:38.200> or<00:05:38.380> backwards<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:39.040> makes<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.490> catch

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
forward or backwards it makes the catch

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:46.770 
forward or backwards it makes the catch
up<00:05:39.820> I'm<00:05:40.000> about<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.110> culture<00:05:41.380> stick<00:05:41.680> speed<00:05:45.780> and

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
up I'm about the culture stick speed and

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.420 
up I'm about the culture stick speed and
