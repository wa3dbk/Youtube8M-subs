the final wasting stage and adding the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.940 
the final wasting stage and adding the
spiciness<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.990> know<00:02:27.140> just<00:02:27.590> set<00:02:27.770> up

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
spiciness to it so you know just set up

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:41.130 
spiciness to it so you know just set up
and<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.830> carry<00:02:31.130> on<00:02:32.350> making<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.950> wedges<00:02:34.370> so

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.170 

it's<00:02:42.140> at<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.440> top<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.890> oven<00:02:43.040> at<00:02:43.400> 220

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
it's at the top of the oven at 220

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.670 
it's at the top of the oven at 220
degrees<00:02:44.510> Celsius<00:02:44.840> I'm<00:02:45.740> pretty<00:02:46.280> awesome<00:02:46.400> water

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
degrees Celsius I'm pretty awesome water

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.070 
degrees Celsius I'm pretty awesome water
and<00:02:48.680> support<00:02:49.550> over<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.510> they're<00:02:50.690> covering

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
and support over so they're covering

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.310 
and support over so they're covering
that<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.770> water's<00:02:52.130> coming<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.610> potatoes

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320

some thought about it at some rows me

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.909 
some thought about it at some rows me
which<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.740> definitely<00:04:24.160> going<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.449> give<00:04:25.449> it<00:04:25.600> a

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
which is definitely going to give it a

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.620 
which is definitely going to give it a
bit<00:04:26.919> more<00:04:27.330> flavor<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.400> didn't<00:04:30.970> lose<00:04:31.120> me<00:04:31.389> and

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
bit more flavor so I didn't lose me and

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.409 
bit more flavor so I didn't lose me and
then<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:32.919> how<00:04:33.130> easy<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:34.150> create

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
then that is how easy it is to create

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.200 
then that is how easy it is to create
the<00:04:34.570> sauce<00:04:34.840> now<00:04:35.590> all<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.070> have<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.370> do<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.940> wait
