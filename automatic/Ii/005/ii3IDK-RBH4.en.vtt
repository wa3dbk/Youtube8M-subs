00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
makes it one and i guess that's not the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.799 
makes it one and i guess that's not the
important<00:00:36.510> thing

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
important thing

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.180 
important thing
well<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> most<00:00:37.320> important<00:00:37.829> thing<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
well the most important thing is that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.430 
well the most important thing is that
the<00:00:39.000> love<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.450> having<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.719> follow-up<00:00:40.020> i

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the love this is having a follow-up i

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.990 
the love this is having a follow-up i
guess<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> most<00:00:41.610> critical<00:00:44.000> statement

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
guess that's the most critical statement

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000 
guess that's the most critical statement
is<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> loveless<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.469> album<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
is that the loveless that album is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.090 
is that the loveless that album is
finally<00:00:47.250> making<00:00:47.730> its<00:00:48.000> way<00:00:48.239> out<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:49.320> evolve

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
finally making its way out to evolve

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
finally making its way out to evolve
