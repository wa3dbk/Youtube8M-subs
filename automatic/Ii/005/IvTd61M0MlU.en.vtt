00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
about the Acer Aspire switched in the

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.919 
about the Acer Aspire switched in the
ultra<00:00:09.519> lightweight<00:00:09.700> two<00:00:10.120> and<00:00:10.269> one<00:00:10.389> a<00:00:10.419> laptop

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:10.929 
ultra lightweight two and one a laptop

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.449 
ultra lightweight two and one a laptop
that<00:00:11.259> can<00:00:11.379> easily<00:00:11.650> switch<00:00:11.860> between<00:00:12.039> four

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
that can easily switch between four

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.720 
that can easily switch between four
positions<00:00:13.030> so<00:00:13.659> it's<00:00:13.839> a<00:00:14.019> two-in-one<00:00:14.950> to<00:00:15.549> really

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
positions so it's a two-in-one to really

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
positions so it's a two-in-one to really
more<00:00:15.879> before<00:00:16.209> in<00:00:16.299> one<00:00:17.820> an<00:00:18.820> Acer<00:00:19.150> we<00:00:19.480> know<00:00:19.600> that

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
more before in one an Acer we know that

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.270 
more before in one an Acer we know that
work<00:00:19.900> is<00:00:20.050> rarely<00:00:20.320> limited<00:00:20.740> to<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:20.920> office

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.880 
work is rarely limited to the office
that's<00:00:22.120> why<00:00:22.390> we<00:00:22.630> built<00:00:22.870> the<00:00:23.020> aspire<00:00:23.410> switched

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
that's why we built the aspire switched

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.550 
that's why we built the aspire switched
