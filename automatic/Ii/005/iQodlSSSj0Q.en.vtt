00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and what's great about it is that we had

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.010 
and what's great about it is that we had
no<00:01:28.829> training<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.329> saw<00:01:30.689> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
no training for it so what you saw is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.620 
no training for it so what you saw is
what<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.500> did<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.430> follow<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.909> fell<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.390> we

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
what we did if we follow we fell if we

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.780 
what we did if we follow we fell if we
were<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.960> bit<00:01:34.170> claustrophobic<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:35.009> were<00:01:35.130> closer

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
were a bit claustrophobic we were closer

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.810 
were a bit claustrophobic we were closer
phobic<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.650> that's<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.369> why<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> think

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
phobic and that's and that's why I think

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
phobic and that's and that's why I think
you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.810> relate<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> these<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.619> characters

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you can relate to these two characters

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.609 
you can relate to these two characters
actually<00:01:41.790> pulling<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.930> off<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.380> they

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
actually pulling this off because they

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.050 
actually pulling this off because they

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
verge like three inches away literally

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.479 
verge like three inches away literally
from<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.079> edge<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.469> 30-story<00:03:10.769> building<00:03:11.010> so

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
from the edge of a 30-story building so

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.899 
from the edge of a 30-story building so
I<00:03:11.700> just<00:03:12.269> kind<00:03:12.419> of<00:03:12.450> wanted<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.719> see<00:03:13.639> what<00:03:14.639> would

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
I just kind of wanted to see what would

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.189 
I just kind of wanted to see what would
it<00:03:14.970> look<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.180> what<00:03:15.900> he<00:03:15.959> was<00:03:16.019> actually

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.199 
it look like what he was actually

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.300 
it look like what he was actually
looking<00:03:16.440> at<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.799> what<00:03:16.889> he<00:03:16.949> was<00:03:17.040> dealing<00:03:17.129> with

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
looking at and what he was dealing with

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.219 
looking at and what he was dealing with
and<00:03:17.609> in<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.849> space<00:03:18.090> was<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.419> confined<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.139> I

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
and in the space was so confined and I

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.920 
and in the space was so confined and I
think<00:03:19.409> as<00:03:19.500> an<00:03:19.620> actor<00:03:19.889> to<00:03:20.040> be<00:03:20.069> so<00:03:20.310> constrained

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
think as an actor to be so constrained

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.119 
think as an actor to be so constrained
physically<00:03:21.930> yeah<00:03:22.199> you<00:03:22.379> have<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.620> come<00:03:22.949> up<00:03:22.979> with

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
physically yeah you have to come up with

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.949 
physically yeah you have to come up with
them<00:03:23.549> other<00:03:23.940> ways<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.389> like<00:03:24.569> delivering

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
them other ways of like delivering

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.899 
them other ways of like delivering
performance<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:26.040> thought<00:03:26.639> that<00:03:26.790> was

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
performance and I thought that was

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.580 
performance and I thought that was
really<00:03:27.030> tricky<00:03:27.299> for<00:03:27.419> him<00:03:27.659> it<00:03:27.989> was<00:03:28.139> so

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
really tricky for him it was so

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.069 
really tricky for him it was so
incredibly<00:03:29.040> well<00:03:29.129> done<00:03:29.280> yeah<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.599> way<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:30.750> out

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
incredibly well done yeah the way we out

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.199 
incredibly well done yeah the way we out
captured<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.159> was<00:03:32.340> pretty<00:03:32.579> cool<00:03:32.760> yeah<00:03:33.150> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
captured it was pretty cool yeah I

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.460 
captured it was pretty cool yeah I
thought<00:03:33.479> we<00:03:33.569> did<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> really<00:03:33.900> good<00:03:34.049> job<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.319> kind

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
thought we did a really good job of kind

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.869 
thought we did a really good job of kind
of<00:03:34.590> making<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:35.040> practical<00:03:35.189> and<00:03:35.579> making<00:03:35.790> it

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
of making it practical and making it

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.920 
of making it practical and making it
believable<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.449> this<00:03:36.629> guy<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.810> actually

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
believable that this guy is actually

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.259 
believable that this guy is actually
really<00:03:37.229> there<00:03:37.500> because<00:03:37.829> we<00:03:37.979> really<00:03:38.759> did<00:03:39.000> put

really there because we really did put

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.759 
really there because we really did put
