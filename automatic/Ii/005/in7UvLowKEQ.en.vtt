this build again huck has been pulling
this<00:02:49.220> build<00:02:49.489> off<00:02:49.730> against<00:02:50.209> fold<00:02:50.510> I've<00:02:50.780> seen<00:02:51.080> it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
this build off against fold I've seen it

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.930 
this build off against fold I've seen it
all<00:02:51.350> over<00:02:51.680> read<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> wanted<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.670> watch

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
all over read it and I wanted to watch

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.460 
all over read it and I wanted to watch
it<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:53.330> Nate<00:02:53.510> I've<00:02:53.690> been<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.020> busy<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.440> haven't

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
it but Nate I've been so busy I haven't

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.440 
it but Nate I've been so busy I haven't
even<00:02:54.800> been<00:02:55.010> at<00:02:55.130> home<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.640> couldn't<00:02:55.970> watch<00:02:56.239> it

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
even been at home so I couldn't watch it

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.440 
even been at home so I couldn't watch it
yet<00:02:56.690> but<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.470> idea<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.130> either<00:02:58.970> Terran

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
yet but the idea is that either Terran

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.300 
yet but the idea is that either Terran
loses<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.870> lot<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.170> income<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.040> will<00:03:01.190> be

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
loses a lot of income and it will be

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.040 
loses a lot of income and it will be

probably a mother ship or out on the map

overcharge and how are you going to kill
a<00:03:12.799> nexus<00:03:13.250> my<00:03:13.459> eyes<00:03:13.640> don't<00:03:13.940> want<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.150> believe

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
a nexus my eyes don't want to believe

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.229 
a nexus my eyes don't want to believe
what<00:03:14.510> they<00:03:14.660> see<00:03:14.720> Kevin<00:03:15.290> oh<00:03:15.410> hey<00:03:16.370> I'm<00:03:16.970> getting

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
what they see Kevin oh hey I'm getting

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.120 
what they see Kevin oh hey I'm getting
so<00:03:17.360> excited<00:03:17.690> as<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:17.989> little<00:03:18.290> schoolgirl<00:03:18.709> this

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
so excited as a little schoolgirl this

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.030 
so excited as a little schoolgirl this
is<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.390> madness<00:03:20.959> he's<00:03:21.140> got<00:03:21.320> a<00:03:21.350> nexus<00:03:21.860> in

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
is this is madness he's got a nexus in

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.030 
is this is madness he's got a nexus in
his<00:03:22.160> base<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.640> mean<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.660> obvious<00:03:24.500> threat<00:03:24.709> here

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
his base I mean the obvious threat here

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.830 
his base I mean the obvious threat here
is<00:03:25.130> photon<00:03:25.580> overcharge<00:03:25.670> right<00:03:26.390> we<00:03:26.600> know<00:03:26.750> he

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
is photon overcharge right we know he

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.410 
is photon overcharge right we know he
can<00:03:26.989> focus<00:03:27.140> on<00:03:27.440> SUVs<00:03:27.890> with<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.400> he<00:03:29.090> could<00:03:29.269> build

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
can focus on SUVs with it he could build

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.509 
can focus on SUVs with it he could build
a<00:03:29.570> probe<00:03:29.900> look<00:03:30.350> three<00:03:30.590> gateways<00:03:30.799> he<00:03:31.190> can<00:03:31.340> build

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
a probe look three gateways he can build

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.130 
a probe look three gateways he can build
a<00:03:31.670> probe<00:03:31.910> out<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.269> Nexus<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.810> throw<00:03:33.110> a

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
a probe out of the Nexus to throw a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.620 
a probe out of the Nexus to throw a
pylon<00:03:33.650> for<00:03:33.709> reinforcements<00:03:34.610> this<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.209> crazy

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
pylon for reinforcements this is crazy

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.509 
pylon for reinforcements this is crazy
but<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:36.200> think<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.530> most<00:03:36.680> important<00:03:37.160> thing<00:03:37.310> was

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
but I think the most important thing was

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.280 
but I think the most important thing was
for<00:03:37.820> Hawk<00:03:38.150> like<00:03:38.360> he's<00:03:38.540> kind<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.840> banking<00:03:39.200> on

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
for Hawk like he's kind of banking on

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.630 
for Hawk like he's kind of banking on
the<00:03:39.410> other<00:03:39.530> probe<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:39.950> stay<00:03:40.130> alive<00:03:40.459> I<00:03:40.610> think

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
the other probe to stay alive I think

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.300 
the other probe to stay alive I think
that<00:03:40.970> probe<00:03:41.269> falling<00:03:41.900> definitely<00:03:42.709> slows<00:03:43.040> him

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
that probe falling definitely slows him

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.759 
that probe falling definitely slows him
down<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.549> little<00:03:43.760> bit<00:03:44.299> Nate<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:45.170> nexus<00:03:45.620> is

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
down a little bit Nate and this nexus is

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.380 
down a little bit Nate and this nexus is
taking<00:03:46.040> some<00:03:46.160> serious<00:03:46.370> damage<00:03:46.730> soon<00:03:47.239> there

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
taking some serious damage soon there

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.270 
taking some serious damage soon there
will<00:03:47.510> be<00:03:47.540> six<00:03:47.959> Marines<00:03:48.350> working<00:03:48.860> on<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.160> there

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
will be six Marines working on it there

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.890 
will be six Marines working on it there
are<00:03:49.370> four<00:03:49.579> five<00:03:49.760> suvs<00:03:50.180> working<00:03:50.570> under<00:03:50.750> this

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
are four five suvs working under this

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.960 
are four five suvs working under this
row<00:03:51.079> I<00:03:51.350> actually<00:03:51.769> think<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.070> IV<00:03:52.370> Lowe<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:52.760> far

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
row I actually think that IV Lowe so far

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.699 
row I actually think that IV Lowe so far
is<00:03:53.090> doing<00:03:53.329> everything<00:03:53.630> right<00:03:53.780> in<00:03:54.170> dealing

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
is doing everything right in dealing

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.210 
is doing everything right in dealing
with<00:03:54.739> this

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
with this

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.580 
with this
yeah<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.820> Nexus<00:03:56.239> will<00:03:56.630> complete<00:03:57.170> but<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.350> gong

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
yeah the Nexus will complete but a gong

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.410 
yeah the Nexus will complete but a gong
key<00:03:57.799> cancels<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.430> very<00:03:58.730> last<00:03:59.060> second

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
key cancels it at the very last second

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.970 
key cancels it at the very last second
the<00:03:59.510> mothership<00:03:59.870> core<00:04:00.049> was<00:04:00.230> pretty<00:04:00.500> close<00:04:00.739> but

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
the mothership core was pretty close but

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.500 
the mothership core was pretty close but
you<00:04:01.070> know<00:04:01.190> it's<00:04:01.579> still<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.820> four<00:04:02.150> gateway

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
you know it's still a four gateway

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.080 
you know it's still a four gateway
follow-up<00:04:02.959> Avila<00:04:03.560> has<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:04.100> mean<00:04:04.430> I'd<00:04:04.700> say<00:04:04.940> all

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
follow-up Avila has I mean I'd say all

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.850 
follow-up Avila has I mean I'd say all
the<00:04:05.180> pieces<00:04:05.420> necessary<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:06.260> defend<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.650> four

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
the pieces necessary to defend a four

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.560 
the pieces necessary to defend a four
gate<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.280> have<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.579> bunker<00:04:08.000> at<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.209> front<00:04:08.510> of

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
gate you have a bunker at the front of

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.060 
gate you have a bunker at the front of
your<00:04:08.660> ramp<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.049> you've<00:04:09.440> got<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.680> good<00:04:09.890> number

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
your ramp and you've got a good number

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.289 
your ramp and you've got a good number
of<00:04:10.190> Marines<00:04:10.459> but<00:04:10.579> he's<00:04:10.730> moving<00:04:10.940> out<00:04:11.030> onto<00:04:11.209> the

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
of Marines but he's moving out onto the

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.180 
of Marines but he's moving out onto the
map<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.690> here's<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.500> important<00:04:12.860> thing<00:04:12.980> for<00:04:13.010> a

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
map and here's the important thing for a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.860 
map and here's the important thing for a
below<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.730> engineering<00:04:14.329> Bay<00:04:14.480> is<00:04:14.630> still

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
below that engineering Bay is still

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.930 
below that engineering Bay is still
there<00:04:15.049> which<00:04:15.169> me<00:04:15.320> what<00:04:15.650> what<00:04:16.549> he's<00:04:16.639> pulling

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
there which me what what he's pulling

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.590 
there which me what what he's pulling
his<00:04:17.060> SCV

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
his SCV

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.070 
his SCV
he's<00:04:17.720> just<00:04:17.960> uh<00:04:18.200> yeah<00:04:18.950> oh<00:04:19.430> my<00:04:19.730> god<00:04:20.030> what<00:04:20.360> no<00:04:20.840> this

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
he's just uh yeah oh my god what no this

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.750 
he's just uh yeah oh my god what no this
is<00:04:21.200> like<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.380> absolute<00:04:21.950> worst<00:04:22.310> thing<00:04:22.460> they

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
is like the absolute worst thing they

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.550 
is like the absolute worst thing they
could<00:04:22.910> ever<00:04:22.940> do<00:04:23.480> against<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> four<00:04:24.140> gate<00:04:24.320> and

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
could ever do against a four gate and

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.890 
could ever do against a four gate and
Huck<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:24.860> probably<00:04:25.130> going<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.610> sculpt<00:04:26.000> what<00:04:26.480> he

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
Huck is probably going to sculpt what he

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.470 
Huck is probably going to sculpt what he
sees<00:04:27.170> one<00:04:27.620> SUV<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.490> he<00:04:28.790> sees<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.180> Marine

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
sees one SUV and he sees the Marine

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.940 
sees one SUV and he sees the Marine
where<00:04:29.660> this<00:04:29.750> probe<00:04:30.170> is<00:04:30.320> gonna<00:04:30.530> head<00:04:30.650> into<00:04:30.800> the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
where this probe is gonna head into the

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.880 
where this probe is gonna head into the
main<00:04:31.100> base<00:04:31.280> will<00:04:31.790> there<00:04:31.940> be<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.380> Marine<00:04:33.380> sniping

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
main base will there be a Marine sniping

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.630 
main base will there be a Marine sniping
it<00:04:34.010> nope

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
it nope

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.260 
it nope
so<00:04:34.970> right<00:04:35.270> now<00:04:35.480> Hawk<00:04:35.870> is<00:04:36.200> going<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.100> see<00:04:37.400> oh<00:04:37.700> you

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
so right now Hawk is going to see oh you

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.270 
so right now Hawk is going to see oh you
don't<00:04:38.600> have<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.870> whole<00:04:39.110> lot<00:04:39.140> of<00:04:39.290> SUVs<00:04:39.830> do<00:04:40.130> you

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
don't have a whole lot of SUVs do you

two<00:04:50.120> force<00:04:50.390> fields<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.900> he'll<00:04:51.200> be<00:04:51.320> more<00:04:51.680> than

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
two force fields and he'll be more than

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.040 
two force fields and he'll be more than
fine<00:04:52.310> first<00:04:52.700> force<00:04:52.940> field<00:04:53.150> lands<00:04:53.360> at<00:04:53.780> Villa

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
fine first force field lands at Villa

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.520 
fine first force field lands at Villa
this<00:04:54.350> is<00:04:54.500> not<00:04:54.680> going<00:04:54.920> to<00:04:55.040> work<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.520> mean<00:04:56.030> he

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
this is not going to work I mean he

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.010 
this is not going to work I mean he
defended<00:04:57.530> really<00:04:57.860> well<00:04:58.070> at<00:04:58.250> first<00:04:58.280> but<00:04:59.020> he

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
defended really well at first but he

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.050 
defended really well at first but he
knows<00:05:00.260> his<00:05:00.470> opponent<00:05:00.950> is<00:05:01.040> on<00:05:01.160> one<00:05:01.430> base<00:05:01.730> he

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
knows his opponent is on one base he

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.720 
knows his opponent is on one base he
built<00:05:02.780> extra<00:05:03.200> gates<00:05:03.440> now<00:05:04.010> he's<00:05:04.250> going<00:05:04.430> back

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
built extra gates now he's going back

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.690 
built extra gates now he's going back
home<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:06.500> don't<00:05:06.860> know<00:05:07.100> how<00:05:07.280> I<00:05:07.310> feel<00:05:07.640> about

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
home I I don't know how I feel about

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.430

what<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.120> just<00:05:08.390> wanna<00:05:08.570> believe<00:05:08.870> what<00:05:08.900> I've<00:05:09.170> seen

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
what I just wanna believe what I've seen

what I just wanna believe what I've seen
Kevin<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:10.040> I<00:05:10.070> mean<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.550> think<00:05:10.610> in<00:05:10.820> retrospect

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
Kevin this I mean I think in retrospect

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.730 
Kevin this I mean I think in retrospect
we<00:05:11.570> can<00:05:11.720> say<00:05:11.870> that<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.110> was<00:05:12.200> a<00:05:12.230> bad<00:05:12.380> idea

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
we can say that it was a bad idea

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.620 
we can say that it was a bad idea
I<00:05:12.890> yeah<00:05:13.580> oh<00:05:14.560> so<00:05:15.560> far<00:05:15.860> as<00:05:16.130> I<00:05:16.340> I<00:05:17.000> normally<00:05:17.570> don't

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
I yeah oh so far as I I normally don't

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.850 
I yeah oh so far as I I normally don't
like<00:05:17.750> to<00:05:17.810> call<00:05:18.080> players<00:05:18.320> out<00:05:18.470> but<00:05:18.620> I'm<00:05:18.710> like

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
like to call players out but I'm like

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.170 
like to call players out but I'm like
this<00:05:19.010> is<00:05:19.130> just<00:05:19.280> one<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.580> situations<00:05:20.030> where

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
this is just one of the situations where

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.420 
this is just one of the situations where
I<00:05:20.390> my<00:05:20.810> eyes<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.020> don't<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.800> can't<00:05:22.130> believe<00:05:22.340> what

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
I my eyes I don't I can't believe what

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.720 
I my eyes I don't I can't believe what
I'm<00:05:22.520> seeing<00:05:22.550> I<00:05:23.770> think<00:05:24.770> that<00:05:24.920> maybe<00:05:25.100> I<00:05:25.250> villages

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
I'm seeing I think that maybe I villages

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.950 
I'm seeing I think that maybe I villages
thought<00:05:25.940> that<00:05:26.090> this<00:05:26.180> was<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.420> very<00:05:26.690> big

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
thought that this was a very big

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.510 
thought that this was a very big
investment<00:05:27.140> for<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.770> Protoss<00:05:28.190> but<00:05:28.340> in<00:05:28.460> the

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
investment for the Protoss but in the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.640 
investment for the Protoss but in the
end<00:05:28.640> of<00:05:28.730> the<00:05:28.820> day<00:05:28.970> this<00:05:29.600> just<00:05:29.930> like<00:05:30.140> delay<00:05:30.470> they

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
end of the day this just like delay they

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.320 
end of the day this just like delay they
stack<00:05:30.890> a<00:05:30.920> bit<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.400> it<00:05:31.490> was<00:05:31.610> 100<00:05:31.970> mineral

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
stack a bit and it was 100 mineral

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.690 
stack a bit and it was 100 mineral
investment<00:05:32.780> maybe<00:05:33.350> 150<00:05:34.010> including<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.490> probe

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
investment maybe 150 including the probe

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.600 
investment maybe 150 including the probe
yeah<00:05:35.120> I<00:05:35.660> mean<00:05:36.200> I<00:05:36.410> guess<00:05:36.980> he<00:05:37.010> just<00:05:37.190> thought<00:05:37.490> like

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
yeah I mean I guess he just thought like

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.860 
yeah I mean I guess he just thought like
hey<00:05:37.760> I<00:05:37.790> have<00:05:37.940> way<00:05:38.180> more<00:05:38.210> rings<00:05:38.600> that<00:05:38.780> I

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
hey I have way more rings that I

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.720 
hey I have way more rings that I
normally<00:05:39.290> have<00:05:39.530> maybe<00:05:39.860> my<00:05:40.070> opponent<00:05:40.460> is<00:05:40.550> still

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
normally have maybe my opponent is still

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.000 
normally have maybe my opponent is still
on<00:05:40.940> one<00:05:41.480> gate<00:05:41.750> is<00:05:41.900> now<00:05:42.110> good<00:05:42.350> trying<00:05:42.650> to<00:05:42.710> try<00:05:42.950> to

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
on one gate is now good trying to try to

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.160 
on one gate is now good trying to try to
expand<00:05:43.550> but<00:05:44.060> it's<00:05:44.240> marine<00:05:45.370> it's<00:05:46.370> going<00:05:46.910> to

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
expand but it's marine it's going to

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.840 
expand but it's marine it's going to
fall<00:05:48.170> as<00:05:48.350> well<00:05:48.530> scouting<00:05:48.980> this<00:05:49.070> fight<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:49.550> he

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
fall as well scouting this fight and he

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.190 
fall as well scouting this fight and he
doesn't<00:05:50.000> have<00:05:50.150> bonk<00:05:50.390> on<00:05:50.450> top<00:05:50.630> was<00:05:50.750> arrested

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
doesn't have bonk on top was arrested

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.620 
doesn't have bonk on top was arrested
normally<00:05:51.500> he<00:05:51.590> should<00:05:51.770> be<00:05:51.920> more<00:05:52.130> than<00:05:52.250> fine

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
normally he should be more than fine

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.180 
normally he should be more than fine
yeah<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:53.660> mean<00:05:54.290> Hawk<00:05:54.530> doesn't<00:05:54.680> have<00:05:54.890> to<00:05:54.980> commit

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190

after<00:06:24.289> you<00:06:24.679> know<00:06:24.799> I<00:06:24.830> feel<00:06:25.369> like<00:06:25.429> the<00:06:25.939> only<00:06:26.149> way

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
after you know I feel like the only way

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:27.759 
after you know I feel like the only way
to<00:06:26.509> really<00:06:26.779> describe<00:06:26.959> what<00:06:27.379> happened<00:06:27.679> there

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:27.769 
to really describe what happened there

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:29.259 
to really describe what happened there
is<00:06:27.799> the<00:06:28.009> best<00:06:28.189> way<00:06:28.369> is<00:06:28.610> what<00:06:28.789> you<00:06:28.879> wait<00:06:29.119> that

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:29.269

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:34.579 
Nexus put them really ahead but you know

for a regular one gate expand whether
it's<00:06:38.719> in<00:06:38.899> your<00:06:39.139> base<00:06:39.349> or<00:06:39.559> your<00:06:39.649> opponent's

it's in your base or your opponent's
base<00:06:40.279> you<00:06:40.849> still<00:06:41.119> usually<00:06:41.360> have<00:06:41.659> a<00:06:41.689> couple

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:41.749

Gateway<00:06:42.289> follow-up<00:06:42.829> to<00:06:42.979> that<00:06:43.129> and<00:06:43.309> it<00:06:43.399> just<00:06:43.610> so

Gateway follow-up to that and it just so

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.489 
Gateway follow-up to that and it just so
happened<00:06:44.179> that<00:06:44.239> even<00:06:44.929> though<00:06:44.989> he<00:06:45.079> cancelled

the<00:06:45.529> Nexus<00:06:45.889> his<00:06:46.309> follow-up<00:06:46.789> was<00:06:47.089> still<00:06:47.329> there

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
the Nexus his follow-up was still there

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.329 
the Nexus his follow-up was still there
of<00:06:47.629> extra<00:06:47.959> gates<00:06:48.169> so<00:06:48.499> the<00:06:48.889> counter-attack

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:49.339 
of extra gates so the counter-attack

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.009 
of extra gates so the counter-attack
didn't<00:06:49.819> really<00:06:50.119> work<00:06:50.299> when<00:06:50.539> you<00:06:50.599> try<00:06:50.749> to<00:06:50.779> push

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:51.019 
didn't really work when you try to push

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:52.719 
didn't really work when you try to push
up<00:06:51.049> the<00:06:51.199> main<00:06:51.439> base<00:06:51.619> ramp<00:06:51.919> I<00:06:52.159> mean<00:06:52.489> there's<00:06:52.669> a

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
up the main base ramp I mean there's a

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.939 
up the main base ramp I mean there's a
century<00:06:53.119> right<00:06:53.389> I<00:06:53.599> think<00:06:54.229> if<00:06:54.319> Hawk<00:06:54.499> had<00:06:54.739> maybe

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:54.949 
century right I think if Hawk had maybe

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.159 
century right I think if Hawk had maybe
built<00:06:55.249> the<00:06:55.339> Nexus<00:06:55.729> in<00:06:55.849> a<00:06:55.939> Veloz<00:06:56.239> base<00:06:56.479> and<00:06:56.719> then

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
built the Nexus in a Veloz base and then

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.899 
built the Nexus in a Veloz base and then
tried<00:06:57.529> to<00:06:57.559> expand<00:06:58.129> before<00:06:58.309> building<00:06:58.789> those

00:06:58.899 --> 00:06:58.909 
tried to expand before building those

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:00.790 
tried to expand before building those
gateways<00:06:59.119> maybe<00:06:59.569> Avalos<00:06:59.989> SCV<00:07:00.409> pull<00:07:00.619> does<00:07:00.769> a

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
gateways maybe Avalos SCV pull does a

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.899 
gateways maybe Avalos SCV pull does a
lot<00:07:01.009> more<00:07:01.189> there's<00:07:01.399> still<00:07:01.550> folks<00:07:01.759> and

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:01.909 
lot more there's still folks and

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.019 
lot more there's still folks and
overcharge<00:07:02.329> at<00:07:02.479> that<00:07:02.599> natural<00:07:03.079> but<00:07:03.589> like<00:07:04.279> you

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:05.029 
overcharge at that natural but like you

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.309 
overcharge at that natural but like you
you<00:07:05.209> if<00:07:05.329> you<00:07:05.449> have<00:07:05.599> the<00:07:05.749> engineering<00:07:06.139> bay

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319
