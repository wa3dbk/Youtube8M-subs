00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
at these characters in these ways and I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.300 
at these characters in these ways and I
think<00:02:50.900> brings<00:02:51.260> something<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.739> collector

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
think brings something to the collector

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.339 
think brings something to the collector
that<00:02:53.030> not<00:02:53.450> only<00:02:53.569> speaks<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.200> their
