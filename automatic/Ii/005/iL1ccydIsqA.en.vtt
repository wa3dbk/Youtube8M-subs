come home from work all you want to do

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.810 
come home from work all you want to do
is<00:01:43.929> play<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.200> game<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:45.160> don't<00:01:45.340> want<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:45.550> much<00:01:45.700> of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
is play a game you don't want so much of

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.430 
is play a game you don't want so much of
a<00:01:45.850> challenge<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.899> want<00:01:47.050> to<00:01:47.140> be<00:01:47.229> able<00:01:47.320> to

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.109 
enjoy it and I think that tailspin is
one<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.830> those<00:01:50.920> perfect<00:01:51.280> games<00:01:51.759> that<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.000> can

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
one of those perfect games that you can

Disney Capcom games are usually some of
the<00:02:04.689> easier<00:02:05.049> games<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.470> beat<00:02:05.619> on<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.860> system

quickly<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.260> probably<00:02:14.530> one<00:02:14.980> sitting<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:15.910> it

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
quickly and probably one sitting but it

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.820 
quickly and probably one sitting but it
wasn't<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.390> case<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.959> actually<00:02:23.140> start<00:02:23.590> off

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
wasn't the case you actually start off

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.309 
wasn't the case you actually start off
quite<00:02:24.340> weak<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.390> aim<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.750> game<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:26.170> to

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
quite weak and the aim of the game is to

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.140 
quite weak and the aim of the game is to
power<00:02:26.560> up<00:02:26.739> your<00:02:26.770> playing<00:02:27.130> as<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.489> go<00:02:27.910> through

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
the levels at the end of every single

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.130 
the levels at the end of every single
level<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.819> have<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> opportunity<00:02:31.599> to<00:02:31.900> buy<00:02:32.110> a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
level you have the opportunity to buy a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.370 
level you have the opportunity to buy a
powerup<00:02:32.620> whether<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.610> be<00:02:33.790> an<00:02:34.510> extra<00:02:34.840> heart<00:02:35.050> for

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380

your<00:02:35.440> playing<00:02:35.709> whether<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.489> be<00:02:36.640> an<00:02:37.540> extra

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
your playing whether it be an extra

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.740 
your playing whether it be an extra
spread<00:02:38.319> bullet<00:02:38.650> or<00:02:39.030> something<00:02:40.030> like<00:02:40.269> an<00:02:40.480> extra

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
spread bullet or something like an extra

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:50.850 
spread bullet or something like an extra
life<00:02:40.900> or<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> continue<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:50.440> heard<00:02:50.769> people

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
life or a continue I have heard people

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.800 
life or a continue I have heard people
say<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.610> control<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.330> game<00:02:52.390> is

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
say that the control in this game is

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.020 
say that the control in this game is
quite<00:02:52.989> off<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.680> think<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.400> reason<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.819> because

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
quite off I think the reason is because

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.360 
quite off I think the reason is because
you<00:02:55.330> can<00:02:55.510> go<00:02:55.630> backwards<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.200> forwards<00:02:56.680> by

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
you can go backwards and forwards by

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.460 
you can go backwards and forwards by
pressing<00:02:57.819> one<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.330> buttons<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:59.230> playing

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
pressing one of the buttons the playing

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.259 
pressing one of the buttons the playing
will<00:02:59.680> move<00:02:59.860> back<00:03:00.130> on<00:03:00.280> itself<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.819> go<00:03:00.940> upside

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
will move back on itself and go upside

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.270 
will move back on itself and go upside
down<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.810> actually<00:03:02.380> quite<00:03:02.709> enjoyed<00:03:02.769> this

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
down I actually quite enjoyed this

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.890 
down I actually quite enjoyed this
crunch<00:03:03.549> roll<00:03:03.700> mechanism<00:03:04.209> because<00:03:04.780> it's

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
crunch roll mechanism because it's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.539 
crunch roll mechanism because it's
something<00:03:05.140> different<00:03:05.470> not<00:03:06.070> something<00:03:06.459> that

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
something different not something that

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.720 
something different not something that
you<00:03:06.640> get<00:03:06.760> very<00:03:06.820> often<00:03:07.920> especially<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.549> this

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
you get very often especially like this

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.430 
you get very often especially like this
control<00:03:10.090> mechanism<00:03:10.630> when<00:03:10.989> you're<00:03:11.140> scaling

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
control mechanism when you're scaling

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.130 
control mechanism when you're scaling
upwards<00:03:12.220> are<00:03:12.609> going<00:03:13.359> downwards<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.109> the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
upwards are going downwards in the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.319 
upwards are going downwards in the
