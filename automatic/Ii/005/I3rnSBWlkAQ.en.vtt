 heart it was a revelation 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.830

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.680

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.760
 bat one respects oneself but it is not 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.340
 easy it is very difficult because 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.130
 they are also convinced of a 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.469
 lure 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.770
 position that I am to what they have 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.380
 the impression that I handle united who have 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.030
 tried to explain to me and so these 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.810

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.009
 with also religious values 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.990
 Muslims but that our mayor and the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.179
 Quebecers were eating food 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.610
 at home the slab is my 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.990
 history or 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.170

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.540
 spring if the time we want them 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.220
 sugar shack for me long live the culture 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.930
 Quebecois did not live a culture 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.360
 foreign or can I put my 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.610
 finger on it I live I bathe in this 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.320
 culture there I think I sometimes 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.670
 just not involved in some 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.560
 activities or game just do not do 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.660
 some things and I feel good 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.220
 in what I do I find my 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.840
 freedom in there when I can not say 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.150
 that it would remain me the meetings years 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.569
 boys and girls 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.430
 it's for these for with the same 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.170
 and freedoms at all at all 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.180
 face of them that they see themselves in a 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.010
 certain frame but they can not 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:21.019
 to go out they can not go from 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:23.239

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.340
 sfere shelter when I speak is one of 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.859

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.199
 malteries hello against the ace monaco 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.060

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:34.129
 years now yes it's an influence

 marry will dance in quotation marks but 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.540
 I think that the heart can never 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.919
 French- by another human being 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.569
 it is rather to the eyes that we 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.980
 leads to Islam ie it is to 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.769
 through her that I knew Islam 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.409
 it's more about the real reason my 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.510
 husband my children are not muslims 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.180
 but on the other hand I would say that it is 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.379
 still pass in his great respect 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.079
 awaits me so we have it's one year 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:01.489
 after my mother really there is a 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:04.870
 extraordinary woman enormously patient 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.780
 very nice super generous 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.640
 we are very sneer years from the side to my 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.209
 mother then we really love in a joy 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.150
 to live 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.769
 enormously yes we celebrate christmas no 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.600
 only with microphone by man with a 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.949
 extended family the only thing we 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.470
 leave 7 passes and who does not want the 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.360
 mass we do not want too much exchange of 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.600
 case 12 which I think the only 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.979
 activity in quotation marks in which one 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.630
 does not commit where and when we do not participate 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.160
 not that we drink but the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.680
 cultural references are more 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.139
 Quebec but Quebec in general is 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.850
 recognized for a lot of his action 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.580
 community to take care of 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.580
 vulnerable those with mental disabilities 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.750
 people who have a lower income me 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.039
 I think the awesome I think that's it 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.010
 is part of Quebec values ​​and 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.240
 it's very very close to my values 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.350
 muslim i think he's really a 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.350
 merger between the two 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 and 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.370
 jag war 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.930
 I think others can see that 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.330
 like a labeling a way of 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.870
 identify with your religion 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:23.680
 I want to do like the trust of 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:28.340
 the elegant beauty really is 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:32.560
 to be focus as the story tells me well 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.560
 before other things
