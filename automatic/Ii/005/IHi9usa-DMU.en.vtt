00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.879
 at night because this year is to be a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.779
 device for those who like to use it only 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.400
 the basic 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.170
 the design of this notebook shows a 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.330
 texture in the lid typical of some 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.250
 manufacturer's products are brands 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.500
 elegant but the whole body of plastic 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.810
 goes one aspect of fragility 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.619
 all in all it weighs two and a hundred pounds 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810
 grams 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.430
 after a while holding it starts 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.949
 to get a bit uncomfortable until 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.939
 even with the backpack 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.590
 the notebook that 1 511 c-98 n gives this 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.149
 an input device for the user 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.579
 who likes only the basics 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.570
 it uses a dual core intel 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.700
 of 2016 only memory 2gb ram and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.520
 we have 250 gigawatts in storage 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.920
 enter the operating system is the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.760
 windows 8.1 and integrated video card 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.469
 is intel hd graphics browsing this 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.390
 notebook is good as long as we do not have 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.789
 many programs installed and running 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 simultaneously because it can lock and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.750
 be very slow at times 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.219
 the keyboard is very comfortable it is possible 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.329
 enter for several hours without any 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.010
 problem 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.210
 the touchpad is accurate and 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 windows navigation 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.470
 when we use two fingers at the same time 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.710
 that the mouse buttons do not have 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.229
 your space delimited until the spyeye hd 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.150
 if one reflects a bit but the pictures 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.700
 presented are very comfortable 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 view the 15 inches are well 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.600
 space for video content and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.280
 films do not have any type of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.020
 choking or traces 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.909
 the speakers are located 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.470
 underneath the unit which can be a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.810
 problem for the production of some games 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.350
 which is muffled if you are not in a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.350
 flat surface 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.630
 removing this problem is not acceptable 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.820
 this is a clothing business from 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.910
 leather she is a two-time champion with 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.830
 only 640 by 480 pixels 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.600
 then it will only do the basics not 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.880
 expect a great view in the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.890
 video calls on the connections can be 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.560
 have three usb ports where one 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.310
 of them is 3.0 we also have a connection 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.200
 hdmi 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.870
 the input for network cable and a reader 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.940
 of the sd card the curious of the device he 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.160
 do not have a cd drive but have a 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.440
 merely illustrative port for this 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.030
 the only problem of connections is the fact 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.400
 that they are completely behind the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.010
 but it is practical not to have the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.690
 cables bothering the sides bothers 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.670
 have to lower the cover every time 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.560
 connected something behind it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.080
 the battery of three thousand two hundred and twenty 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.860
 military holds up to five hours 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.020
 of common use 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.250
 if you still have any questions let 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.020
 in the comments 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.459
 Do not forget to write on the channel and 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.030
 follow social networks
