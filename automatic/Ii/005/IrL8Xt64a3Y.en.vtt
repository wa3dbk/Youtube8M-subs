00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.299
 wall any wall with direction of it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.320
 does not stop running and stays on the ground 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.590
 looking at the floor in my camera 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.580
 it seems that my friend we there only 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 leaned against the wall 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.840

 running 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.409
 if you just lean against the wall and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.150
 I ran and did not look at the ground you die of 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.600
 same way and there is something else 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.759
 pond will have waist up and if it is 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.159
 from the waist down you die of the same 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.649
 It 's a bug in the inner wall. 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:50.540

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.479
 I just think there is no escape but 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.000
 It's just that I want to see it think fast. 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.319

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.170
