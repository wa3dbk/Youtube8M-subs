 reunion too I know what happened 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 past and I have what we would like 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 that it happens more we know more what 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.829

 did not know but it touches me 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 deeply 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.170
 this is true it touches me because 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.969
 we have children and we are small 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.379
 little one is sympathetic to the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.969
 family so that's the least 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.949
 to be there with a little flower a 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.869
 little thought to accompany the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.670
 family at that time that what we 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.229
 want to think oh there were missing 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.290

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.720
 to stop this plague 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 some express very 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.650
 direct we are trying to prevent that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.689
