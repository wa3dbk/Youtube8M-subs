00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.219
 of August 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.100
 is a commendable attitude and can expect to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.679
 people can expect for example the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.629
 right there on that channel in the 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.789

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.940

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.250
 Okay, I just wanted to say, come on, let's go. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.420
 explain this business says it was in 2005 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.579
 of poetry and marcel fields is explained in 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 a video with the fanatical as I go 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.000
 leave the registration link 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.619
 but I wanted to leave some with the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.369
 my words 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.790
 You have people there, we use a motorcycle x motorcycle x 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.240
 2013 2014 and 2015 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.430
 motogp 2013 2014 you can not 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:29.490
 compare with moto x 2013 and 2014 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 the great galaxy of 123 no matter 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.079
 you can not compare with her want 5 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.759
 s6 and so on 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.899
 you can not you get the dream is that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.579
 wait z4 and compare with the dream spy 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.439
 in four it does not 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.159
 so you went 2 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.509
 he is above 5 out of 6 he is a 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:59.070
 generation later but is a generation of top 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:06.750
 Let's be clear one day maybe asus. 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:09.030
 launch the symphony 5 version 2d phone 62 or 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.790
 any other smartphone that is 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.210
 in this category but the two symphony 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.600
 it is being done now is not 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.560
 the symphony 5 version 2 and was excellent 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.430
 so this smartphone here it is the top 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.620
 understood he is here the 56 are here 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.440
 that's what I wanted to try to do well 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.720
 of course if you had any questions yet 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.830
 Maybe Marcel's video might 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.430
 complementary 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.140
 if not ok we're clear if any friend 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.450
 If I have any questions, pass this. 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.190
 video for him to accelerate to from it 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.520
 explained lets him think everyone is 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.250
 equal 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.920
 but that's what I needed to explore 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.470
 Before you say anything, you 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.080
 know I have experience with the 156 and 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.330
 now really iphone two ne 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.480
 we are understood as saying that they 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:08.900
 I was sent 10 550m helium the top with 4 gb 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:12.020
 of ram 32gb storage 2.3 ghz one 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.750
 3 megapixel rear camera 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.150
 the 5 megapixel front camera that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.360
 with wide-angle lens and had already 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.230
 made a video in blue a goal screens 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.020
 5 inches and full HD resolution 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.780
 nor a monster the texture here metalized 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.740
 It's really cool, you feel a robustness. 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.230
 both of us 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.670
 he is not light I felt he was not 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.300
 light but it's theft that's what I can 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.120
 speak 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.190
 I'm very curious that you know how it is here. 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.590
 there are buttons on the day to day buttons 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.570
 Bring them on day to day 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.550
 I will not keep repeating myself too much that already 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.090
 had made a video before in mogi blue 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.610
 is front-facing as rear already 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.870
 I saw that we have a topic in the 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.090
 market wants to know with ali environments 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.640
 closed room is closed. 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.190
 How does this camera go? 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.630
 to behave I'd rather talk on the river 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.240
 I do not know if it was the time when I 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.890
 I chose that'm not crazy about al 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.470
 rifi these things more 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.780
 I want to try to get all these 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.460
 believe that journalists 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.150
 so I realized they got color 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.600
 black silver golden 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.570
 and if I get the red one has other 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.850
 weeds that are sold in your 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.789
 out because I know that nothing will bring 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.490
 I very much hope that she's so she 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.930
 I'll try it , I really will not 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.509
 I'll promise but I'll try too hard. 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.370
 get all I know if you guys 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.470
 have seen an image and I can 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.500
 make a cool picture and maybe you 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.150
 get to the point of deciding between golden 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.310
 a black red silver and saw the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.080
 polygonal and all these head and crazy 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.430
 what they did is this, I will not stay 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.350
 repeating a lot as I already said it already 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.169
 has made video thank have 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.169
 hitherto been tea
