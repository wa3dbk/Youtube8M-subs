00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.040
 color of your career you have done so many 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.740

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.070

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.900
 fifa 2005 and have many skills in 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.940
 the video game that feels to be a 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.860
 video game character not since childhood 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.840

 happy with my friends and playing and 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.700
 now being here in the selection is something 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.770
 something very exciting and happy there for 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.030
 true that already the chepo speaks to you and you 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.030
 you say ah is that you choose the 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.769
 that's how it works if you talk to me but nothing else 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.080
 ask me about the wound that brought 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.390
 in the eyebrows but nothing else is going to see 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.910
 how was it still fine but nothing else 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.280
 Everybody gets mad at the other I want 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.049
 tell me an anecdote quickie you 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.120
 they have done they have been very successful 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.860
 personal or sometime there was some 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.410
 coach in your life who told them you know 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.930
 that bullet is very thin you're not going to 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.730
 move or not do not go and central or here 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.430
 if they applied it they will not kiss it is that 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.349
 of forward does not like to be 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.799
 applied to you when it happened to you I think that 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.799
 you already had 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:51.380
 about 12 years now I'm going to look at the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.260
 cell with about 12 years this 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.420
 something I had was very thin for 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.490
 to play 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.910
 also in the position 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.530
 I was forward front fish that 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.270
 when containment and everything was a 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.630
 change sports multimedia friends 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.070
 an important person that has good 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.040
 changed the form of football here in 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.900
 monterrey for his forward tactics 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.290
 that Mr. aldo de nigris 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.230
 regardless of whether a man 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.870
 handsome and what good is bringing here the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.599
 papers for everything paid is fine a 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.909
 Caribbean this 86 gives us an interview 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.280
 because the man is leaving us with the 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.379
 Mexican team to play and its first 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.569
 game against martinique how do you feel 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.700
 with these roads inside but 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.730
 happy to meet you guys 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.709
 as tequila friends the bill all the 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.069
 Caribbean and to get the travel expenses of the 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.069
 selection 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.980
 where Mayor Lumbre brings 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.739
 run of the bunny the little glasses of free 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.230
 your own story I say has won 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.319
 championships here in monterrey and I think 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.540
 that you are one of the 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.099
 the forwards of your style 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.650
 fort who in Mexico because 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.499
 I usually say then we had to not 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.439
 I'm sucking because the interviews 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:15.499
 for example, the little padilla then 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:18.109
 I was going to come to nothing but maybe 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:20.870
 you are tall that you are strong this one you have 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.530
 a way of defining that you are only 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.789
 has seen perhaps filiberto fulgencio 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.470
 but look, a lot of people do not know that 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.699
 Sometimes you are a forward who 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.919
 sacrifice because you're from post and 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.810
 you are always supporting the other teams 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.430
 I choose chivas said maybe not 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.660
 you got 23 watts but supports this 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.539
 too much in the plays so that 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.430
 come out the goals that sometimes people 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.610
 not see it and for gansito if padilla 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.620
 it looks normal but if everything counts 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.990
 what to do to a forward style that 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.849
 Here in Mexico there is almost not the 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.889
 sacrifice I do not think it's 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.379
 for what I did not for the physical is 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.899
 different all that but I have improved 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:01.689
 a lot in the technical and in the rest because 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:04.360
 I get myself not to work every workout 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.879
 to improve it is important and now a 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.490
 thing to the people who are watching us 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:12.429
 see that many people today that what 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.559
 better is this special means is very 

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:15.999
 good vibes very cool indeed now 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.860
 we just lent two thousand pesos to 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:20.050
 everyone and we have already paid what 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.449
 that gives the store's turn after 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.669
 the rocking chairs nothing but not that the truth 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.800
 well obviously a very luchona family 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:32.069
 I say appreciation to your family price to your 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.069
 mom, your people, your brother 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.789
 motto not only to my compadre poncho but 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.949
 it's good that you keep doing your story 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.050
 still what you lack carnal everything 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.490
 what you need is very young built 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.490
 a castle buy a dragon 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:51.689
 I would do it but it 's a question 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.689
 I wish I had a footballer 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.560
 I'm never not one of those who can 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.900
 play and play effort and I do not leave it 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.880
 that he what is the truth that is something 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.160
 natural so much the day we wanted to play is 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.990
 more I came tired of workouts and 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.270
 let's share by country I'm going to 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.840
 find out if I have to play sometimes 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.230
 I put to play the race that arrives friends 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.210
 We ask relatives for what but 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.650
 really like the truth and that is what 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.300
 God want to follow other things 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.400
 obviously they avoided paying you the 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.360
 fine that they will put me because the sener 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.250
 at half past eight for me to go 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.640
 return of I bring the suit to negotiate 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.640
 borrowed 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.560
 multimedia people sports 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.030
 thanks to the sport people we follow the 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.030
 Manriquez said, although they did not want it
