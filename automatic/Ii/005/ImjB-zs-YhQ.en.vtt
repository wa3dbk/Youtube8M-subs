 personal talk joana beauty let's the greater 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.359
 cover for you today from motherboards 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.450
 of the gigabyte where we were in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.830
 their conference in which it was 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.570
 presented a small record one 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.160
 overclock on motherboard and my brothers and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.379
 I gave up in the memories 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 the guys just put 4.5 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.119
 giga-hertz runs in memory of a coke 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.910
 never achieved the world record for 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.250
 alive for us was who was there saw 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.130
 I live a business so let's check the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.969
 farc now you 're sure already 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.219
 they saw our channel z 97s you did not see 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.350
 you still saw the 97 that provoked 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.030
 Overclocking strength but that's how it is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.320
 practically the same plate with some 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.969
 differences that we are going to enter into 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 details when you get our hands on the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 and you saw a box on the channel in 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.980
 several videos of her 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.239
 so it's a super plate and it was with this 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.360
 where they broke a record 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 jimmy overclock in memory than the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.260
 People have a machine mounted with it. 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.899
 you can see it from her build and the bank 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.420
 day with Andrew is crazy to get on 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.189
 suitcase does not fit Santista carrying dead 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 already the configuration you are seeing 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.560
 this machine and guy is running with e 7 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.470
 He left to turn luck to you here 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.549
 master also another amazing thing in 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.200
 soon will have a test box in our 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.439
 memory channel 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.560
 are 16 gb of memory 3 thousand megahertz 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.630
 agency that betrays him of each type 4 times 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.400
 43 thousand megawatts with these memories nor 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.670
 arrived brazil is already in the machine 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.490
 here it is hdz it is not being digital 4 thera 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.490
