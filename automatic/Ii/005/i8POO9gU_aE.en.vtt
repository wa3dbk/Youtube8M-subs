trying to cover all our bases and plan

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.280 
trying to cover all our bases and plan
for<00:00:53.089> anything<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.750> everything<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.079> can

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
for anything and everything that can

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.259
