00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello to all guys well found by 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.080
 francesco siciliani to a new one 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.730
 review by iphoneitalia.com after 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.849
 a few months of using my iphone 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.130
 before the video for the review later 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.170
 seven months let's say six intense months of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.970
 use and a month in short for 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.730
 prepare all the final considerations 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 that will come out in a week I want 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.180
 show you the review of one 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 housing that I just chose to 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.429
 use on my device or the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 original apple case in version 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.040
 red in leather 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.160
 let's see it well and discover the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.160
 details 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.950
 let's start from the material like 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.930
 you can see this case is leather 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.390
 real leather so let's talk about a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.180
 very resistant material anyway 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.970
 durable over time even with passing 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.739
 months will not suffer serious damage or 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.780
 however it won't hurt you much 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.640
 when it will even wear out 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.530
 however it will not be a case let's say 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.880
 ugly because the skin doesn't have anyway 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 a bad effect such as the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 silicone when it goes to consume then 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.210
 certainly the cost more respect 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.009
 to the silicone version and already 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.600
 justified by the type of material 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.940
 then obviously used depends on 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.100
 tastes also the quality of the case is 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.350
 very interesting because the housing 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.810
 covers all the device leaving 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.310
 however space at the bottom what 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.460
 that instead for the relative models 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.720
 the iPhone 5 s was not possible in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.190
 this case we then have the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 possibility to use without problems 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.210
 adapters or at least jacks for 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.649
 headphones a little bigger than 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.830
 those of the official apple earphones 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.869
 the buttons are covered by the case 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.220
 except of course the switch for the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.830
 silent to vibration 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.110
 this means the buttons will be 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.600
 more protected from shocks or 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 however from scratches etcetera 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.670
 being however made of aluminum 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.470
 as the device then protected though 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.420
 however easy to use because 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.970
 however even if the cover makes them 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.830
 slightly harder to the touch are 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.869
 however easy to press and therefore not 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.049
 we will have problems using ours 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.299
 Device hundred percent 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.850
 let's go on talking about the back 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.739
 of our custody in addition to having 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.720
 the exclusive feature apple logo 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.730
 obviously that can only have the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.459
 apple cases the space for the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.950
 camera is well cropped and of course 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.440
 it is lined on the inside to be the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.269
 best performing even when 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.049
 we talk about flash cameras in fact not 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.880
 there are shadows 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.829
 the flash is not squashed and del 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.480
 free from any kind of impediment 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.730
 so we will still have a yield 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.709
 one hundred percent photo as if 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.120
 we didn't have a case we know 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.400
 well some problems that can be 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.160
 have with the cases when they go to 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.650
 cover the camera area 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.360
 incorrectly then really realized 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.540
 well in all its parts 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.250
 obviously the feeling to the touch is a lot 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.080
 nice because the material first 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.630
 quality and in any case the forms are 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.250
 study very well and fit together 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.900
 perfectly with those of the iphone 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.850
 obviously the custody was 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.930
 made specifically for this 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.030
 new iphone model 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.310
 there is also a version for iphone 6 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.200
 the 4.7-inch one the normal one 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.300
 so not iphone 6 plus and of course 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.540
 we have a housing available 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.280
 original then made ad hoc for 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.110
 the device is designed together with the 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.820
 device 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.190
 let's look inside the inside of 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.140
 this cover made of microfiber 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.450
 this means our iphone 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.610
 will not suffer any kind of scratch or 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.720
 damage during his stay 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.460
 in the case 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.230
 this will allow us to always be 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.030
 sure unlike many others 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.310
 cases instead of in the long run 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.550
 they could still scratch or 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.800
 ruin the iphone somehow 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.420
 back instead we will be safe 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.950
 we tried a case for some 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.230
 day without any problem we must 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.290
 also removed and replaced several times 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.570
 to see also its resistance to 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.860
 deformation in short, then we have 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.650
 also considering that the inclusion of 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.480
 phone is very simple 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.700
 not really in a couple of seconds 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.190
 are problems is once inserted 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.870
 we will have all the protection available 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.090
 from the official custody of course 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.709
 the whole device will be protected between 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.620
 in the lower part than as we have 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.480
 already said it is free because it will allow us 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.760
 to make the best use of all 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200
 adapters also eg adapter 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.210
 lightning that thicker than the cable 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.750
 however, any third-party accessory 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.460
 part 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.380
 this is obviously the difference from the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.180
 previous cases for the models of 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.120
 iphone 5s 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.040
 however, let's see how the 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.990
 device becomes slightly more 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.100
 often that the flash is going down now 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.440
 to show you that it is not coming 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.970
 absolutely crushed or dented 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.490
 from the housing then all made 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.220
 perfectly I said the thickness is a bit 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.200
 bigger now we also try the keys 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.940
 you see that they really go out of their way 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.980
 very simple and fast 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.600
 the thickness a little higher than 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.320
 that of the iPhone obviously is not 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.529
 the weight is too bulky anyway 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.229
 of custody 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.359
 given the type of material does not become 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.759
 too excessive of course if you have 

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:11.279
 purchased anyway an iphone 6 plus one 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.259
 bigger case obviously already was 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.749
 to keep in mind because 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.729
 obviously every case increases the lo 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.919
 thickness and size of the device 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.959
 however a good compromise with 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.399
 so we can still carry this case 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:24.959
 use the classic pocket of the 

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:26.939
 jacket for example without any 

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:29.999
 problem because the profile remains 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.439
 pretty thin you guys i will 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.269
 I remember that I am of this case 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.069
 some variants available now 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:37.289
 we have in addition to the variant for iphone 6 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.659
 iphone 6 plus also the variants of 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:43.229
 so we have black and red colors 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.709
 midnight blue, chestnut and pink 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.579
 face powder 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:50.099
 the price is 49 euros for the version 

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:52.829
 for iphone 6 plus is 45 euros for the 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.749
 version for iphone 6 good for this 

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:55.889
 video for this review we have 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:57.629
 over 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.489
 I thank you for watching this 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.919
 video for all other information 

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:03.899
 on the housing I invite you to read the 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.939
 our article on iphoneitalia.com e 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:07.649
 anyway go to the apple site where 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.169
 you can also purchase the case 

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:12.089
 if you are interested then see you 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.209
 to the next video soon and good 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:14.209
 day
