no one told us anything even the guards

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
no one told us anything even the guards
knew<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:17.189> on

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
knew what was going on

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270

we<00:01:18.270> made<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:18.689> slipspace<00:01:19.320> jumping<00:01:19.979> here

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
we made some slipspace jumping here

anywhere<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.259> didn't<00:01:31.679> matter<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.340> knew

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
something happened I don't know that I

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.840 
something happened I don't know that I
think<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.619> Cubbies<00:02:03.920> made<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> break<00:02:04.430> for<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.700> or

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
think the Cubbies made a break for it or

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.210 
think the Cubbies made a break for it or
something<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:06.200> all<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.440> chaos<00:02:06.649> I<00:02:07.009> guess

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
something and in all the chaos I guess

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.600 
something and in all the chaos I guess
that's<00:02:08.149> what<00:02:08.330> got<00:02:08.690> out<00:02:09.069> how<00:02:10.069> these<00:02:10.220> let<00:02:10.429> some

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
that's what got out how these let some

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.820 
that's what got out how these let some
of<00:02:10.729> us<00:02:10.850> have<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.390> which<00:02:11.630> might<00:02:12.110> surprise<00:02:12.500> you

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
of us have to which might surprise you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.190 
of us have to which might surprise you
but<00:02:13.130> by<00:02:13.819> then<00:02:14.030> we'd<00:02:14.239> all<00:02:14.450> been<00:02:14.720> through<00:02:15.080> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
but by then we'd all been through the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.610 
but by then we'd all been through the
same<00:02:15.380> stuff<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:17.060> same<00:02:17.239> fate<00:02:17.600> on<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.959> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
same stuff the same fate on this and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.310 
same stuff the same fate on this and
you've<00:02:19.340> been<00:02:19.550> hiding<00:02:19.819> ever<00:02:20.270> since<00:02:20.360> okay<00:02:21.290> I

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
you've been hiding ever since okay I

think<00:02:21.590> maybe<00:02:22.519> too<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:23.750> lose<00:02:23.930> track<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.260> time

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
think maybe too you lose track of time

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.270 
think maybe too you lose track of time
real<00:02:24.769> fast<00:02:25.190> around<00:02:25.370> here<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:26.360> bet<00:02:27.040> we<00:02:28.040> got<00:02:28.160> to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
real fast around here I bet we got to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.090 
real fast around here I bet we got to
get<00:02:28.370> off<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.640> ship<00:02:28.700> soon<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.720> know<00:02:30.100> what's
