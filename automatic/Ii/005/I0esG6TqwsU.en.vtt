00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
example of the same technique this is a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.850 
example of the same technique this is a
simple<00:00:45.030> red<00:00:45.239> grosgrain<00:00:45.780> ribbon<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.410> I've

simple red grosgrain ribbon and I've

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.930 
simple red grosgrain ribbon and I've
used<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.430> tiny<00:00:48.320> Daisy<00:00:49.320> stitch<00:00:49.829> spaced<00:00:50.700> along

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
used a tiny Daisy stitch spaced along

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
used a tiny Daisy stitch spaced along
the<00:00:51.270> edges<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> ribbon<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.770> only<00:00:53.010> have

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the edges of the ribbon so not only have

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
the edges of the ribbon so not only have
I<00:00:53.250> attached<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> ribbon<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> shirt<00:00:54.570> but

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
I attached the ribbon to the shirt but

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.569 
I attached the ribbon to the shirt but
I've<00:00:54.960> also<00:00:55.110> made<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> look<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:55.860> I'd<00:00:56.129> used<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
I've also made it look as if I'd used a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.470 
I've also made it look as if I'd used a
more<00:00:56.789> expensive<00:00:57.149> Pico<00:00:57.780> edged<00:00:57.989> ribbon<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:59.480> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
more expensive Pico edged ribbon I like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
more expensive Pico edged ribbon I like
to<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:00.780> decorative<00:01:01.260> stitches<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
to use decorative stitches when a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.939 
to use decorative stitches when a
pattern<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> project<00:01:03.870> calls<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.680> edge

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
pattern or a project calls for edge

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.760 
pattern or a project calls for edge
stitching<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.729> well<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.930> sample<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.590> have

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
stitching as well in this sample I have

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
stitching as well in this sample I have
used<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.549> buttonhole<00:01:09.030> stitch<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.080> you'll

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
used a buttonhole stitch but you'll

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
used a buttonhole stitch but you'll
you'll<00:01:10.830> notice<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.549> flipped<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you'll notice that I have flipped it so

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
you'll notice that I have flipped it so
it's<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.920> reverse<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> usual

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it's the reverse of the usual

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
it's the reverse of the usual
orientation<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.020> put<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> body<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> stitch

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
orientation I put the body of the stitch

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.390 
orientation I put the body of the stitch
on<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.330> project<00:01:18.840> itself<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> I've<00:01:19.920> let<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
on the project itself and I've let the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.850 
on the project itself and I've let the
legs<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> stitch<00:01:21.330> lap<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> edges

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
legs of the stitch lap over the edges

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.670 
legs of the stitch lap over the edges
this<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> great<00:01:23.970> way<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.680> incorporate

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
this is a great way to incorporate

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.550 
this is a great way to incorporate
something<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.970> bit<00:01:27.150> more<00:01:27.390> flashy<00:01:27.930> when

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
something a little bit more flashy when

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.679 
something a little bit more flashy when
you're<00:01:28.680> doing<00:01:28.950> edge<00:01:29.130> stitching<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you're doing edge stitching and of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.390 
you're doing edge stitching and of
course<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.229> also<00:01:31.409> use<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:31.950> decorative

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
course you can also use your decorative

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.880 
course you can also use your decorative
stitches<00:01:32.850> anytime<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.229> pattern<00:01:34.710> or

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
stitches anytime that a pattern or

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.399 
stitches anytime that a pattern or
project<00:01:35.430> calls<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.000> top<00:01:36.299> stitching<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.290> in

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
project calls for top stitching so in

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.950 
project calls for top stitching so in
this<00:01:37.560> case<00:01:37.860> maybe<00:01:38.520> along<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> collar<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> cuff

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
this case maybe along a collar or a cuff

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.219 
this case maybe along a collar or a cuff
I<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.829> told<00:01:41.130> Edie<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:42.090> top<00:01:42.600> stitch<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.049> quarter

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

I was told Edie to top stitch a quarter
of<00:01:43.409> an<00:01:43.470> inch<00:01:43.560> from<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> edge<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.070> instead

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of an inch from the edge and instead

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.670 
of an inch from the edge and instead

use for construction actually is at its

use for construction actually is at its
best<00:01:55.320> when<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.920> don't<00:01:56.250> see<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.600> a

sample<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.290> where<00:01:58.439> I've<00:01:58.560> used<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
sample here where I've used a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
sample here where I've used a
contrasting<00:01:59.340> thread<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.780> see

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
contrasting thread so that you can see

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.080 
contrasting thread so that you can see
the<00:02:01.110> stitch<00:02:01.380> construction<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> look

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the stitch construction but if you look

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880 
the stitch construction but if you look
at<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> other<00:02:03.509> side<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.020> my<00:02:04.140> patch<00:02:04.350> pocket

at the other side of my patch pocket

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.160 
at the other side of my patch pocket
where<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> thread<00:02:05.700> matches<00:02:06.180> you'll<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.930> how

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
where the thread matches you'll see how

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.979 
where the thread matches you'll see how
it<00:02:07.320> fades<00:02:07.590> into<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.190> fabric<00:02:08.610> itself<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.780> that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
it fades into the fabric itself so that

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.780 
it fades into the fabric itself so that
the<00:02:10.080> attachment<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> pocket<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.430> almost

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
see that I've stitched the bar tack

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.930 
see that I've stitched the bar tack
across<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.080> seam<00:03:16.350> just<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.310> simple<00:03:17.670> button

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
across the seam just the simple button

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.570 
across the seam just the simple button
sewing<00:03:18.150> stitch<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.290> reinforces<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:20.430> and

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
sewing stitch and that reinforces it and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.580 
sewing stitch and that reinforces it and
helps<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.239> take<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.420> stress<00:03:21.840> off<00:03:22.110> those<00:03:22.320> seam

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
helps to take the stress off those seam

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.830 
helps to take the stress off those seam
stitches<00:03:23.160> but<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.000> course<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.270> don't<00:03:24.450> have<00:03:24.660> to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
stitches but of course you don't have to

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.040 
stitches but of course you don't have to
stop<00:03:25.110> with<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> simple<00:03:26.040> bar<00:03:26.430> tack<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:27.050> this

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
stop with the simple bar tack in this

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.010 
stop with the simple bar tack in this
example<00:03:28.470> instead<00:03:29.310> I've<00:03:29.730> used<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.390> satin

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
example instead I've used a satin

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.770 
example instead I've used a satin

built<00:03:33.959> into<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.410> machine<00:03:34.770> but<00:03:35.250> I've<00:03:35.370> used<00:03:35.700> it

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
built into the machine but I've used it

that's<00:04:21.930> one<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.710> my<00:04:22.830> very<00:04:23.220> favorites<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.120> love

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
that's one of my very favorites I love

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.050 
that's one of my very favorites I love
to<00:04:25.140> use<00:04:25.440> hook<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.950> loop<00:04:26.070> fasteners<00:04:26.789> and

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
to use hook and loop fasteners and

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.580 
to use hook and loop fasteners and
I think<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.419> all<00:04:27.570> do<00:04:28.080> they're<00:04:28.410> very

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
I think we all do they're very

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.800 
I think we all do they're very
functional<00:04:29.220> but<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.760> me<00:04:29.940> they<00:04:30.090> always<00:04:30.360> look<00:04:30.690> a

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
functional but to me they always look a

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.900 
functional but to me they always look a
little<00:04:31.080> clunky<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:32.160> instead<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.580> simply

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
little clunky so instead of simply

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.879 
little clunky so instead of simply
applying<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.750> fastener<00:04:34.290> with<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> straight

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
applying the fastener with a straight

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.460 
applying the fastener with a straight
stitch<00:04:35.070> as<00:04:35.490> what<00:04:35.669> we<00:04:36.120> traditionally<00:04:36.330> do<00:04:37.050> I've

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
stitch as what we traditionally do I've

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.159 
stitch as what we traditionally do I've
added<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.610> decorative<00:04:39.000> stitch<00:04:39.360> around<00:04:39.930> the

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
added a decorative stitch around the

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.830 
added a decorative stitch around the
edge<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.830> then<00:04:41.610> gone<00:04:41.850> around<00:04:42.150> with<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.450> third

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
edge and then gone around with a third

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.379 
edge and then gone around with a third
pass<00:04:43.169> of<00:04:43.440> stitches<00:04:43.919> just<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.520> satin<00:04:44.880> zigzag

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
pass of stitches just a satin zigzag

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.900 
pass of stitches just a satin zigzag
that<00:04:45.840> actually<00:04:46.230> overcast<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:47.190> edge<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.760> the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
that actually overcast the edge of the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.450 
that actually overcast the edge of the
fastener<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:48.660> also<00:04:49.260> incorporates<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.100> base

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
fastener and also incorporates the base

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.970 
fastener and also incorporates the base
of<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.880> stitches<00:04:51.389> this<00:04:52.260> gives<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.800> little

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
of the stitches this gives it a little

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.800 
of the stitches this gives it a little
bit<00:04:53.070> more<00:04:53.310> pizzazz<00:04:53.760> keeps<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.510> from<00:04:54.660> looking

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
bit more pizzazz keeps it from looking

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.290 
bit more pizzazz keeps it from looking
so<00:04:55.139> clunky<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.800> if<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.370> want<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.790> you<00:04:57.030> can<00:04:57.180> do

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
so clunky and if you want to you can do

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.700 
so clunky and if you want to you can do
the<00:04:57.419> same<00:04:57.690> technique<00:04:57.960> without<00:04:58.560> the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
the same technique without the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.010 
the same technique without the
decorative<00:04:59.040> stitch<00:04:59.430> just<00:05:00.150> use<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.540> zig<00:05:00.750> zag

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
decorative stitch just use the zig zag

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.980 
decorative stitch just use the zig zag
satin<00:05:01.560> over<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.010> edges<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.690> hope<00:05:03.690> this<00:05:03.840> will

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
satin over the edges I hope this will

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.750 
satin over the edges I hope this will
