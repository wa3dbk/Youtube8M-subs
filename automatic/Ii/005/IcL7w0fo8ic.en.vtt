into<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> bait<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.670> sorry<00:01:59.909> into<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> hair

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
into the bait or sorry into the hair

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.960 
into the bait or sorry into the hair
pull<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> tight<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.610 

I<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:04.660> these<00:02:04.780> nice<00:02:04.990> little<00:02:05.230> yellow<00:02:05.410> ones

I like these nice little yellow ones
gives<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.010> flicker<00:02:06.250> color<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.000> that's<00:02:07.060> that

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
gives it a flicker color so that's that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.710 
gives it a flicker color so that's that
bit<00:02:07.450> finished<00:02:07.830> then<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:09.430> need<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.790> gain<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.330> bit

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
bit finished then you need to gain a bit

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.890 
bit finished then you need to gain a bit
of<00:02:10.899> silicon<00:02:11.740> tubing<00:02:12.330> trim<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.420> bit<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.750> off

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
of silicon tubing trim a bit of that off

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.160 
of silicon tubing trim a bit of that off
just<00:02:14.580> get<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> nice<00:02:15.730> straight<00:02:16.060> bit<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:18.010> that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
just get a nice straight bit like that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.110 
just get a nice straight bit like that
then<00:02:20.170> pop<00:02:20.380> silicon<00:02:20.890> tubing<00:02:21.280> onto<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.790> baiting

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
then pop silicon tubing onto the baiting

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.030 
then pop silicon tubing onto the baiting
needle<00:02:22.150> now<00:02:23.020> all<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.290> silicon<00:02:23.680> tubing<00:02:23.950> is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
needle now all this silicon tubing is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.190 
needle now all this silicon tubing is
going<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.550> hold<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.660> hair<00:02:25.900> types

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
going to do is hold the the hair types

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.970 
going to do is hold the the hair types
of<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.410> shank<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.070> can't<00:02:27.310> tangle<00:02:28.980> so

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
of the shank so that it can't tangle so

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.200 
of the shank so that it can't tangle so
put<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.280> onto<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.550> bait<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.730> needle<00:02:31.090> like

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
put that onto the bait you needle like

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:39.090 
put that onto the bait you needle like
so<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:33.910> your<00:02:34.030> supple<00:02:34.420> section<00:02:38.100> transfer

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
so and get your supple section transfer

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.610 
so and get your supple section transfer
it<00:02:39.480> transfer<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> tubing<00:02:40.990> onto<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.320> supple

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
it transfer the tubing onto the supple

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.880 
it transfer the tubing onto the supple
section<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:45.370> that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
section like that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.440 
section like that
take<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:48.040> down<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.520> link<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> board's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
take that down the link to the board's

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.000 
take that down the link to the board's
debate<00:02:51.150> okay<00:02:52.380> now<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.440> need<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.740> get<00:02:53.890> your

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
debate okay now you need to get your

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.850 
debate okay now you need to get your
hook<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.600> poke<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.780> point<00:02:56.050> through<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
hook and poke the point through the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.180 
hook and poke the point through the
tubing<00:02:57.810> try<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.380> Nick<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> tubing<00:03:00.070> why

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
tubing try not to Nick the tubing why

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.000 
tubing try not to Nick the tubing why
are<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.370> doing<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:01.360> does<00:03:01.570> happen<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.200> try

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
are you doing it it does happen but try

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.180 
are you doing it it does happen but try
not<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:04.170> slide<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.470> up<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.769> shank<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.130> the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
not to slide that up the shank of the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.940 
not to slide that up the shank of the
hook<00:03:09.370> like<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.080> now's<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.290> time<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.530> measure

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
hook like so now's the time to measure

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.330 
hook like so now's the time to measure
the<00:03:12.160> length<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.489> your<00:03:12.580> hair<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:14.160> don't<00:03:15.160> like

the length of your hair I don't like
them<00:03:15.550> too<00:03:15.820> tight<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.280> little<00:03:18.519> bit<00:03:18.640> of

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
them too tight in a little bit of

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.870 
them too tight in a little bit of
movement<00:03:18.850> there<00:03:19.320> about<00:03:20.320> there's<00:03:20.530> perfect<00:03:21.100> now

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
movement there about there's perfect now

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.610 
movement there about there's perfect now
whip<00:03:22.120> up<00:03:24.269> simple<00:03:25.269> knotless<00:03:25.600> knot<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.820> one<00:03:28.750> two

whip up simple knotless knot so one two
three<00:03:30.150> four<00:03:31.150> five<00:03:31.930> six<00:03:32.820> seven<00:03:33.820> eight<00:03:34.440> turns

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
three four five six seven eight turns

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.670 
three four five six seven eight turns
moisten<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.959> take<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.500> back<00:03:38.650> through<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.040> eye

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
moisten it take it back through the eye

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.780 
moisten it take it back through the eye
always<00:03:41.680> goes<00:03:42.040> through<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.400> front<00:03:42.549> like<00:03:42.910> so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
always goes through the front like so

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:54.110 
always goes through the front like so
okay<00:03:45.790> now<00:03:46.209> tighten<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.720> down<00:03:48.450> like<00:03:49.450> that

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.520 

I<00:03:54.180> then<00:03:54.900> trim<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.530> supple<00:03:55.920> section<00:04:00.349> like<00:04:01.349> that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
I then trim the supple section like that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.229 
I then trim the supple section like that
you've<00:04:01.769> got<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:01.980> tiny<00:04:02.220> little<00:04:02.370> short<00:04:02.760> section

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
you've got a tiny little short section

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.390 
you've got a tiny little short section
there<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.349> that's<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.590> supple<00:04:05.010> section

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
there so that's the supple section

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.009 
there so that's the supple section
nearly<00:04:05.849> finished<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.510> will<00:04:06.659> be<00:04:06.750> looking

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
nearly finished it will be looking

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.140 
nearly finished it will be looking
rather<00:04:07.290> short<00:04:07.739> at<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.980> moment<00:04:08.340> what<00:04:08.909> you<00:04:08.940> need

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
rather short at the moment what you need

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.720 
rather short at the moment what you need
to<00:04:09.269> do<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.690> just<00:04:09.840> blah<00:04:10.110> bliss<00:04:10.409> using<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.459> flame

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
to do is just blah bliss using a flame

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.880 
to do is just blah bliss using a flame
like<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.900> that'll<00:04:13.110> blob<00:04:13.319> down<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.769> the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
like that and that'll blob down to the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.340 
like that and that'll blob down to the
eye<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:15.150> go<00:04:15.299> nice<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.599> tight

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
eye and go nice and tight

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.990 
eye and go nice and tight
basically<00:04:16.889> that'll<00:04:17.190> stop<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.639> supple

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
basically that'll stop the supple

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.819 
basically that'll stop the supple
section<00:04:18.329> from<00:04:18.479> pulling<00:04:18.870> back<00:04:19.049> through<00:04:19.260> so

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
section from pulling back through so

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.990 
section from pulling back through so
what<00:04:19.949> i'm<00:04:20.040> doing<00:04:20.190> here<00:04:20.340> is<00:04:20.549> i'm<00:04:20.699> using

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
what i'm doing here is i'm using

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.300 
what i'm doing here is i'm using
fluorocarbon<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:21.989> main<00:04:22.199> boom<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.740> then<00:04:23.280> a

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
fluorocarbon as the main boom and then a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.909 
fluorocarbon as the main boom and then a
nice<00:04:23.580> soft<00:04:24.090> supple<00:04:24.570> hair<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.440> now<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.650> need<00:04:25.830> to

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
nice soft supple hair so now you need to

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.700 
nice soft supple hair so now you need to
do<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.160> fluorocarbon<00:04:26.580> section<00:04:27.150> i<00:04:27.530> use<00:04:28.530> nice

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
do the fluorocarbon section i use nice

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.120 
do the fluorocarbon section i use nice
stiff<00:04:29.190> IQ<00:04:29.880> -<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:31.110> my<00:04:31.320> opinion<00:04:31.440> arts<00:04:31.919> use<00:04:32.100> a

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
stiff IQ - in my opinion arts use a

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.879 
stiff IQ - in my opinion arts use a
stiffer<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.669> better<00:04:33.289> take<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.320> section<00:04:34.800> of

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
stiffer the better take a section of

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.150 
stiffer the better take a section of
that<00:04:34.979> off<00:04:38.630> then<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.750> gain<00:04:39.990> your<00:04:40.380> supple

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
that off then you gain your supple

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.420 
that off then you gain your supple
section<00:04:41.669> and<00:04:42.350> basically<00:04:43.350> need<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:43.949> poke<00:04:44.250> that

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
section and basically need to poke that

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.460 
section and basically need to poke that
through<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:44.850> eye<00:04:44.880> just<00:04:45.270> make<00:04:46.050> yourself<00:04:46.350> a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
through the eye just make yourself a

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.379 
through the eye just make yourself a
little<00:04:46.710> gap<00:04:46.919> from<00:04:47.160> where<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.340> blob<00:04:47.669> is<00:04:47.850> so

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
little gap from where that blob is so

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:56.460 
little gap from where that blob is so
you<00:04:48.479> need<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.720> get<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.960> through

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.090 

okay<00:04:57.220> so<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:59.110> go<00:04:59.230> through<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.680> eye<00:04:59.710> with<00:05:00.010> the

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
okay so you go through the eye with the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.550 
okay so you go through the eye with the
fluorocarbon<00:05:00.610> like<00:05:01.480> so<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:02.140> goes<00:05:02.290> out<00:05:02.440> the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
fluorocarbon like so that goes out the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.770 
fluorocarbon like so that goes out the
back

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
back

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.970 
back
take<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:04.930> down<00:05:05.170> I'm<00:05:05.320> not<00:05:05.470> sure<00:05:05.680> what<00:05:05.890> this

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
take that down I'm not sure what this

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.710 
take that down I'm not sure what this
not<00:05:06.250> schooled<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.760> think<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.030> might<00:05:07.240> be<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.450> Dom

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
not schooled I think it might be a Dom

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.830 
not schooled I think it might be a Dom
off<00:05:08.280> anyway<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:09.340> take<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.640> long<00:05:09.940> long<00:05:10.540> tagger

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
off anyway you take a long long tagger

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.750 
off anyway you take a long long tagger
fluorocarbon<00:05:11.350> I<00:05:12.420> pinched<00:05:13.420> it<00:05:14.580> against<00:05:15.580> the

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
fluorocarbon I pinched it against the

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.720 
fluorocarbon I pinched it against the
shank<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.150> hook<00:05:16.300> like<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:17.460> form<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.580> little

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
shank of the hook like so form a little

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.270 
shank of the hook like so form a little
loop<00:05:19.030> like<00:05:19.330> that<00:05:19.740> whilst<00:05:20.740> holding<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.190> all

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
loop like that whilst holding it all

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.720 
loop like that whilst holding it all
nice<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.490> tight<00:05:21.880> then<00:05:22.600> whip<00:05:22.930> around<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:25.710> supple

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
nice and tight then whip around a supple

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:41.640 
nice and tight then whip around a supple
not<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:29.680> one<00:05:32.940> two<00:05:35.460> three<00:05:40.140> then<00:05:41.140> moisten<00:05:41.380> it

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
not so one two three then moisten it

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.900 
not so one two three then moisten it
down<00:05:43.230> and<00:05:44.230> you<00:05:44.350> take<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:44.740> tag<00:05:45.070> back<00:05:45.460> through

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
down and you take that tag back through

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
down and you take that tag back through
that<00:05:46.360> loop<00:05:46.630> that<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:46.900> created<00:05:47.260> originally<00:05:47.890> I

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
that loop that you created originally I

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.600 
that loop that you created originally I
pull<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.080> tag<00:05:50.290> in<00:05:50.440> down<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:51.280> I'll<00:05:51.370> hold<00:05:51.520> it

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
pull that tag in down and I'll hold it

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.430 
pull that tag in down and I'll hold it
with<00:05:51.760> my<00:05:51.850> teeth

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
with my teeth

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.630 
with my teeth
just<00:05:53.440> easier<00:05:53.890> to<00:05:54.010> tie<00:05:54.220> in<00:05:56.040> bed<00:05:57.040> it<00:05:57.190> down<00:05:57.370> like

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
just easier to tie in bed it down like

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.840 
just easier to tie in bed it down like
that<00:05:58.680> then<00:05:59.680> while<00:05:59.860> holding<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.340> hook<00:06:00.520> point

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
that then while holding the hook point

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.120 
that then while holding the hook point
you<00:06:01.000> got<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.180> pull<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:02.320> hook<00:06:02.470> point<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:02.950> bed

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
you got to pull the hook point to bed

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.920 
you got to pull the hook point to bed
the<00:06:03.250> knockdown<00:06:03.460> as<00:06:03.790> well<00:06:03.970> not<00:06:04.480> the<00:06:04.570> hook<00:06:04.690> point

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
the knockdown as well not the hook point

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.700 
the knockdown as well not the hook point
the<00:06:05.080> actual<00:06:05.200> hook<00:06:05.470> Bend<00:06:05.710> even<00:06:07.500> that<00:06:08.500> just

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
the actual hook Bend even that just

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:22.519 
the actual hook Bend even that just
tightens<00:06:09.070> everything<00:06:09.370> down<00:06:09.550> nicely

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:22.529 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:27.049 

okay<00:06:23.519> so<00:06:25.219> the<00:06:26.219> point<00:06:26.399> chips<00:06:26.609> gone<00:06:26.789> into<00:06:26.969> the

00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:27.059 
okay so the point chips gone into the

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:28.819 
okay so the point chips gone into the
bait<00:06:27.239> there<00:06:27.479> and<00:06:27.929> then<00:06:28.019> you<00:06:28.109> need<00:06:28.259> to<00:06:28.409> trim<00:06:28.679> the

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:28.829 
bait there and then you need to trim the

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:35.359 
bait there and then you need to trim the
tag<00:06:29.039> in<00:06:29.249> the<00:06:29.729> fluorocarbon<00:06:34.009> so<00:06:35.009> it's<00:06:35.189> a<00:06:35.219> bit

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:35.369 
tag in the fluorocarbon so it's a bit

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.849 
tag in the fluorocarbon so it's a bit
fiddly<00:06:35.609> not<00:06:35.939> cold<00:06:36.389> ends<00:06:36.629> so<00:06:37.349> trim<00:06:37.559> the<00:06:37.679> tag

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:37.859 
fiddly not cold ends so trim the tag

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:40.999 
fiddly not cold ends so trim the tag
into<00:06:38.129> the<00:06:38.219> fluorocarbon<00:06:39.559> that<00:06:40.559> leaves<00:06:40.799> it

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
into the fluorocarbon that leaves it

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.219 
into the fluorocarbon that leaves it
like<00:06:41.669> that<00:06:42.889> then<00:06:43.889> just<00:06:44.099> to<00:06:44.249> keep<00:06:44.279> the<00:06:44.639> gape

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
like that then just to keep the gape

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.989 
like that then just to keep the gape
rather<00:06:46.229> than<00:06:46.439> closing<00:06:46.889> the<00:06:46.949> gate<00:06:47.159> right<00:06:47.789> up

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:47.999 
rather than closing the gate right up

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:49.609 
rather than closing the gate right up
like<00:06:48.239> that<00:06:48.419> I<00:06:48.629> like<00:06:48.839> to<00:06:48.959> put<00:06:49.109> another<00:06:49.319> bit<00:06:49.589> of

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:49.619 
like that I like to put another bit of

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.759 
like that I like to put another bit of
tubing<00:06:50.099> on<00:06:50.279> the<00:06:50.339> fluorocarbon<00:06:51.239> so<00:06:51.869> trim<00:06:52.649> the

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:52.769 
tubing on the fluorocarbon so trim the

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:55.069 
tubing on the fluorocarbon so trim the
length<00:06:52.949> of<00:06:53.159> the<00:06:53.279> rig<00:06:53.429> that<00:06:53.459> you<00:06:53.669> want<00:06:54.079> alright

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:55.079 
length of the rig that you want alright

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.709 
length of the rig that you want alright
so<00:06:55.409> take<00:06:56.249> a<00:06:56.309> slightly<00:06:56.699> larger<00:06:56.999> section<00:06:57.629> of

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:57.719 
so take a slightly larger section of

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:00.499 
so take a slightly larger section of
silicon<00:06:58.169> tubing<00:06:58.739> not<00:06:59.369> sure<00:06:59.609> what<00:06:59.879> sizes<00:07:00.119> they

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
silicon tubing not sure what sizes they

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:04.219 
silicon tubing not sure what sizes they
are<00:07:00.539> think<00:07:01.109> it's<00:07:01.229> not<00:07:01.409> 0.75<00:07:02.249> this<00:07:02.519> one<00:07:03.229> trim

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
are think it's not 0.75 this one trim

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:10.639 
are think it's not 0.75 this one trim
that<00:07:04.379> off<00:07:07.099> like<00:07:08.099> that<00:07:08.839> place<00:07:09.839> the<00:07:10.019> tubing<00:07:10.379> onto

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:10.649 
that off like that place the tubing onto

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.649 
that off like that place the tubing onto
the<00:07:10.739> fluorocarbon<00:07:11.279> slide<00:07:12.149> it<00:07:12.329> all<00:07:12.479> the<00:07:12.509> way

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659 
the fluorocarbon slide it all the way

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:16.759 
the fluorocarbon slide it all the way
down<00:07:13.019> towards<00:07:13.829> the<00:07:14.129> hook<00:07:14.689> and<00:07:15.689> then<00:07:16.349> this<00:07:16.619> is

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:16.769 
down towards the hook and then this is

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:20.479 
down towards the hook and then this is
actually<00:07:16.889> a<00:07:17.129> tricky<00:07:17.489> bit<00:07:17.699> but<00:07:19.069> I'm<00:07:20.069> moisten

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:20.489 
actually a tricky bit but I'm moisten

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:22.219 
actually a tricky bit but I'm moisten
the<00:07:20.579> hook<00:07:20.729> I<00:07:20.939> just<00:07:21.689> to<00:07:21.779> try<00:07:21.959> and<00:07:22.079> get<00:07:22.169> the

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229 
the hook I just to try and get the

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.399 
the hook I just to try and get the
tubing<00:07:22.559> over<00:07:22.649> easy<00:07:22.979> easier<00:07:23.969> and<00:07:24.839> then<00:07:25.229> the

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:25.409 
tubing over easy easier and then the

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:30.259 
tubing over easy easier and then the
tubing<00:07:25.859> will<00:07:26.039> eventually<00:07:28.879> with<00:07:29.879> a<00:07:29.999> bit<00:07:30.149> of

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:30.269 
tubing will eventually with a bit of

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:33.769 
tubing will eventually with a bit of
love<00:07:30.509> and<00:07:30.899> care<00:07:31.519> the<00:07:32.519> tubing<00:07:32.939> will<00:07:33.059> go<00:07:33.209> over

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:33.779 
love and care the tubing will go over

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:35.419 
love and care the tubing will go over
the<00:07:33.869> eye<00:07:33.899> just<00:07:34.559> to<00:07:34.619> the<00:07:34.799> top<00:07:35.069> of<00:07:35.309> the

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:35.429 
the eye just to the top of the

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:38.529 
the eye just to the top of the
fluorocarbon<00:07:36.119> knot<00:07:36.559> and<00:07:37.559> then<00:07:37.739> you<00:07:37.860> have<00:07:37.979> it

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:38.539 
fluorocarbon knot and then you have it

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:41.269 
fluorocarbon knot and then you have it
lovely<00:07:39.539> lovely<00:07:39.719> little<00:07:40.379> fluorocarbon<00:07:40.829> rig

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:41.279 
lovely lovely little fluorocarbon rig

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:44.389 
lovely lovely little fluorocarbon rig
this<00:07:41.819> caught<00:07:42.149> me<00:07:42.649> where<00:07:43.649> it<00:07:43.739> got<00:07:43.889> me<00:07:43.979> forty

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:44.399
