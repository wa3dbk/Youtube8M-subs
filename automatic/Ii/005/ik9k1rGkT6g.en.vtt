little bit of the filling boat out at

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.940 
little bit of the filling boat out at
the<00:01:56.890> end<00:01:57.070> of<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.280> tooth<00:01:57.490> which<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:57.909> fine<00:01:58.180> fine

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the end of the tooth which is fine fine

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.859 
the end of the tooth which is fine fine
but<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.610> can<00:02:00.820> cause<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.270> little<00:02:01.630> bit<00:02:01.750> of

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
but that can cause you a little bit of

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.529 
but that can cause you a little bit of
the<00:02:01.930> tenderness<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.610> have<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.880> not<00:02:04.030> guess<00:02:04.360> is

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
the tenderness if I have to not guess is

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.810 
the tenderness if I have to not guess is
this<00:02:04.659> gonna<00:02:04.899> bother<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.289> afterwards<00:02:05.770> no<00:02:06.280> like

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
my guess is no or very little but no if

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:33.550 
my guess is no or very little but no if
it<00:02:13.180> does<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.510> need

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:54.349 

I<00:02:33.620> could<00:02:34.370> feel<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.790> engaged<00:02:35.120> that

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.430
