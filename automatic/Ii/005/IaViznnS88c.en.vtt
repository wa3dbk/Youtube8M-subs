more<00:01:05.489> than<00:01:05.640> four<00:01:05.820> calls<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.900> do

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
more than four calls so when they do

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.050 
more than four calls so when they do
utilize<00:01:07.560> maybe<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.189> six<00:01:08.430> cause<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.880> would

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
utilize maybe like six cause this would

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.750 
utilize maybe like six cause this would
be<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.600> processor<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.400> also<00:01:11.610> very

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
it's really cheap no also another reason

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.910 
it's really cheap no also another reason
I<00:04:06.480> went<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:06.780> this<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.350> obviously<00:04:07.620> good<00:04:07.800> it's

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
I went for this it's obviously good it's

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.120 
I went for this it's obviously good it's
a<00:04:07.980> small<00:04:08.220> board<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:09.950> consoles<00:04:10.950> are

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
a small board and consoles are

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.220 
a small board and consoles are
relatively<00:04:11.520> small<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.210> thought<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.720> know<00:04:12.840> I

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
relatively small so I thought you know I

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.750 
relatively small so I thought you know I
could<00:04:13.590> go<00:04:13.710> for<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> small<00:04:14.130> case<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.640> can

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
could go for a small case and you can

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.370 
could go for a small case and you can
put<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.120> your<00:04:15.150> living<00:04:15.480> room<00:04:15.600> or<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.140> and

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
card we went with should be able to

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.920 
card we went with should be able to
handle<00:04:20.250> 1080p<00:04:21.020> quite<00:04:22.020> easily<00:04:23.540> now<00:04:24.540> for<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.750> PS

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
handle 1080p quite easily now for the PS

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.140

you were gone for a course

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.010 
you were gone for a course
c<00:04:26.270> XM<00:04:26.660> for<00:04:27.020> 30<00:04:27.380> or<00:04:27.710> six<00:04:28.699> for<00:04:28.910> 30m<00:04:29.360> there's<00:04:29.870> some

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
c XM for 30 or six for 30m there's some

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.420 
c XM for 30 or six for 30m there's some
modular<00:04:30.440> power<00:04:30.560> supply<00:04:30.710> which<00:04:31.070> are<00:04:31.220> really

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
modular power supply which are really

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.189 
modular power supply which are really
good<00:04:31.699> for<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.910> case<00:04:32.120> because<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.020> case

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
good for the case because the case

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.529 
good for the case because the case
doesn't<00:04:33.740> have<00:04:34.100> very<00:04:34.610> good<00:04:34.759> cable<00:04:35.120> management

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
doesn't have very good cable management

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.620 
doesn't have very good cable management
so<00:04:36.229> my<00:04:37.190> chiller<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.729> was<00:04:37.850> flight<00:04:38.120> will<00:04:38.389> help

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
so my chiller that was flight will help

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.770 
so my chiller that was flight will help
let's<00:04:39.259> say<00:04:39.380> it's<00:04:39.530> very<00:04:39.680> cheap<00:04:39.919> at<00:04:40.100> 37<00:04:40.580> pounds

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
let's say it's very cheap at 37 pounds

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.270 
let's say it's very cheap at 37 pounds
reliable<00:04:41.780> 80<00:04:42.020> plus<00:04:42.320> bronze<00:04:42.350> certified<00:04:43.039> so<00:04:43.220> we

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
reliable 80 plus bronze certified so we

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.010 
reliable 80 plus bronze certified so we
should<00:04:43.460> save<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.180> some<00:04:44.360> power<00:04:44.570> on<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.840> bill

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
should save you some power on the bill

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.159 
should save you some power on the bill
and<00:04:45.610> yeah<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.699> should<00:04:46.820> generally<00:04:47.389> great<00:04:47.660> psu

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
and yeah it should generally great psu

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.080 
pence we got 11 pound 94 pensive and
puts<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.350> but<00:05:09.350> honestly<00:05:09.710> that's<00:05:09.919> worth<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.460> we

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
puts it but honestly that's worth it we

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.300 
puts it but honestly that's worth it we
could<00:05:11.300> have<00:05:11.389> went<00:05:11.510> with<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.870> semi<00:05:12.169> 717<00:05:12.830> saved<00:05:13.100> us

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
could have went with a semi 717 saved us

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.120 
could have went with a semi 717 saved us
15<00:05:14.060> pounds<00:05:14.389> or<00:05:14.570> so<00:05:14.720> but<00:05:14.900> i<00:05:14.930> think<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.260> semi<00:05:15.470> 790

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
15 pounds or so but i think the semi 790

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.779 
15 pounds or so but i think the semi 790
is<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:17.300> lot<00:05:17.750> better<00:05:17.900> for<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.199> money<00:05:18.430> now<00:05:19.430> as<00:05:19.729> you

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
is a lot better for the money now as you

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.230 
is a lot better for the money now as you
