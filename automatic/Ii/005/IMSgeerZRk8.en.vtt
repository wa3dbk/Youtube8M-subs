00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 Berlin 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.640
 handball games with the foxes I would be 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.289
 comes left and thus only 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.710
 a kind and already has one now 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.420
 to use a few men 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 the year very successful and we have 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.469
 in the summer the german championship with 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.280
 who won a youth 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.680
 then it went for me then 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.649
 the national team direction hungary 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 then we had the youth troops there 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.649
 we have become third 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.800
 what have the bronze medal achieved? 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.809
 So also very successful and now has 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.840
 the new season already started and we 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.090
 so far, all games won 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.300
 summer holidays go 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.300
 I had 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.690
 when you see what you are in hungary 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.520
 reached both defend 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.520
 okay, there would have been more 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.110
 of course, the semi-final but conceivable 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:33.580
 it is scarce and a finale then it is 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.560
 always hop or tropp visit well though 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.670
 bronze of his episode says then 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.670
 bronzemedaille on witnesses 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.530
 they now have a lot of points games 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.210
 after with the A-youth that for that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.330
 another national team training course 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.650
 Now next week and next 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.600
 The year will be over again today 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.180
 continue to play and then maybe 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.470
 again until the championship sometime 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.979
 yes we have one again 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.540
 Coach change behind us and new 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.770
 Formed team there must be us now 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.229
 first import and then we have 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.959
 next year in summer again in 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.650
 Austria the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.840
 youth european championship person 19 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.430
 the jump because he is around 19 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.459
 in the men, on the one hand, a madman 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.560
 physical difference this simply 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.430
 all and the bigger team continues 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.290
 heavier than me and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.400
 the game speed is too 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.709
 much higher than you have to first 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.750
 move to find a bit of position 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.120
 how do you do that is what you do for both 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.290
 premiums or so today for example 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.920
 I stop training with the first 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.230
 team 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.049
 that is always so different after 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.219
 the reset also fits with the school time 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.500
 and one because the time has with the 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:57.049
 first tournament assignment to me me 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.170
 actually only an actual game, too 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.159
 second team depending on when I am 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.959
 for example, one at the first 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.299
 injured then you are always like that 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.859
 afternoon yes so you do not train 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.870
 three hours in a row 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.810
 that would be too much you either train 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.579
 with your own or with the first one 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.169
 is depending on how the 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.629
 Training control is the first one 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.599
 games or not 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:26.810
 goal national team how long does it take 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:29.239
 It always has to return to Bonn 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.280
 year rhythm in which one in such a 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.930
 Team is and then look like 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.690
 next year, if you are the pros 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.240
 trained with it tastes 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.760
 that maybe you get the idea 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.350
 then that landscape draws attention 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.620
 works maybe a few years too 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.620
 the momentum 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.530
 can you see from how many players is 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.660
 I already made that year 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.820
 not made one last year yet 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.840
 I think I believe I play games too 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.840
 a few bundesliga games 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.090
 I do not always have that many shots 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.680
 but the shots behind most of the time 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.240
 quite well 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.560
 So next year he is still playing 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.560
 firmly at first team the piece 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.600
 Then we start 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.200
 that is, christ is his first 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.960
 professional income so the number of drinks is 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.950
 do not stay the same or less often 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.720
 less than us the trainings and 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.640
 now go through higher 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.350
 you definitely have to learn a lot more 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.240
 I now re- enforced then too 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:41.910
 prevail to fight hard every minute 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.370
 sees the daily routine get up 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.200
 Breakfast in training then mostly in 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.150
 which region or over 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.440
 Talking man training again 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.280
 dinner then a meetings 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:00.780
 again give four days now 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.710
 handball your money loses you 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.520
 must of course also learn something 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.630
 you also have to copy something 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.480
 can make it live but in time 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.940
 where you live at all the pros then we 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.360
 nor that my last year so 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.650
 make my abi in April and already 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.650
 pretty much what you learn now 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.640
 that must be the problem if you have the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.020
 all the time on the way with the 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.840
 national team that one more 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.240
 must do in your free time 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.280
 there you have to 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.560
 have good time management, it is 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.810
 sometimes not so easy 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.030
 I get through but not not now 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.169
 bad the notes but can too 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.480
 not so great his age are okay well 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.330
 then first a bit free and then 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.330
 I probably wanted to study and 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:55.490
 look in which direction somehow 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:57.800
 Engineering or what is technical 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.850
 Definitely here in Berlin the Ybbs 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.590
 enough possibilities 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.780
 watch the warrior until the 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:08.690
 mathematician that we are very good here 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.880
 cooperation partner with the universities and we 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.750
 help us sometimes that one 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.229
 Timetable 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.690
 That's how the X Treme Elementary School thinks 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.880
 I already that you can do it 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.770
 So I will definitely take off 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.169
 because you have to prove gay 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.340
 have to be back country and the 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.620
 I do not have any more and then I will 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:32.630
 looking for your own apartment and much more 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.580
 normal student so all people each 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.960
 measure was from pauli japanese are since 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.310
 much more away 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.419
 until then have a look 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.419
 to answer videos
