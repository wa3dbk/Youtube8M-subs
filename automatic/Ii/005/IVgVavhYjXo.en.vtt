00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
stuff so I was pretty cool um I'm not

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.700 
stuff so I was pretty cool um I'm not
sure<00:00:39.270> if<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.690> best<00:00:39.930> fit<00:00:40.140> because<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
sure if it's the best fit because of the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
sure if it's the best fit because of the
49ers<00:00:41.370> would<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> best<00:00:41.910> fit<00:00:42.090> either<00:00:42.239> that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
49ers would be the best fit either that

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.389 
49ers would be the best fit either that
would<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> dominant<00:00:42.899> team<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> same

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
would be a dominant team but at the same

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.340 
would be a dominant team but at the same
time<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.730> guess<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.390> you're<00:00:45.570> playing<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.989> NFC

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
time I guess if you're playing that NFC

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.799 
time I guess if you're playing that NFC
you<00:00:46.710> gotta<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.070> against<00:00:47.340> Eli<00:00:47.730> Manning<00:00:48.180> drew

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you gotta go against Eli Manning drew

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.930 
you gotta go against Eli Manning drew
Brees<00:00:49.140> Matthew<00:00:49.649> Stafford<00:00:50.219> Aaron<00:00:50.550> Rodgers

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
Brees Matthew Stafford Aaron Rodgers

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
Brees Matthew Stafford Aaron Rodgers
Michael<00:00:51.329> Vick<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> list<00:00:52.079> goes<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.500> on

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
Michael Vick and the list goes on and on

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
Michael Vick and the list goes on and on
with<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> great<00:00:53.250> quarterbacks<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.969> NFC

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
with a great quarterbacks in NFC

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
with a great quarterbacks in NFC
obviously<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.440> AFC<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> gotta<00:00:56.129> deal<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.399> Tom

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
obviously an AFC you gotta deal with Tom

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.849 
obviously an AFC you gotta deal with Tom
Brady<00:00:57.079> Philip<00:00:58.079> Rivers<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.710> stuff

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
Brady Philip Rivers and all that stuff

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.010 
Brady Philip Rivers and all that stuff
but<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.219> mean<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.969> seems<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> AFC's<00:01:00.780> more

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
but I mean it seems like the AFC's more

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.740 
but I mean it seems like the AFC's more
open<00:01:01.379> than<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> NFC<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.609> plus<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.539> what

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
open than the NFC so plus you know what

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.630 
open than the NFC so plus you know what
Peyton<00:01:04.470> Manning's<00:01:04.739> had<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> lot<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> experience

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
Peyton Manning's had a lot of experience

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.060 
Peyton Manning's had a lot of experience
in<00:01:05.729> AFC<00:01:06.030> he's<00:01:06.450> already<00:01:06.689> knows<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
in AFC he's already knows it like the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.380 
in AFC he's already knows it like the
back<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.369> his<00:01:08.520> hand<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.030> that'll<00:01:09.299> be

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
back of his hand so that'll be

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
back of his hand so that'll be
interesting<00:01:09.510> now<00:01:10.260> obviously<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
interesting now obviously I think that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.789 
interesting now obviously I think that
the<00:01:12.150> Denver<00:01:12.510> Broncos<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> playoff

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the Denver Broncos will not be a playoff

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.280 
the Denver Broncos will not be a playoff
team<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.400> there's<00:01:14.580> nothing<00:01:14.900> nothing<00:01:15.900> really

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
team but there's nothing nothing really

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.480 
team but there's nothing nothing really
that<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.770> say<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> can't<00:01:17.220> really<00:01:17.340> look

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that you can say you can't really look

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.830 
that you can say you can't really look
at<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> team<00:01:17.850> say<00:01:18.030> they're<00:01:18.240> super<00:01:18.450> bowl<00:01:18.630> team

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
at the team say they're super bowl team

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.390 
at the team say they're super bowl team
like<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> could<00:01:19.350> lash<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> Eagles

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
like you could lash it with the Eagles

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.010 
like you could lash it with the Eagles
and<00:01:20.880> even<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> Eagles<00:01:21.659> when<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> said

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and even with the Eagles when you said

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
and even with the Eagles when you said
they<00:01:22.110> were<00:01:22.229> super<00:01:22.500> bowl<00:01:22.680> team<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.490> didn't

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
they were super bowl team they didn't

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
they were super bowl team they didn't
really<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:24.030> anywhere<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.659> um<00:01:24.900> it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
really get anywhere so um it's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.080 
really get anywhere so um it's
interesting<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.400> think<00:01:26.460> you've<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> hard<00:01:26.909> time

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
interesting I think you've a hard time

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.730 
interesting I think you've a hard time
predicting<00:01:27.570> football<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.439> easy<00:01:28.530> as

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
predicting football it's not as easy as

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
predicting football it's not as easy as
