00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.439 
gallows we're going to go down maxxis
aside<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.099> here's<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.090> part<00:00:27.359> this

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
aside and here's the first part this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.720 
aside and here's the first part this
little<00:00:27.689> canister<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> building

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
little canister this is in the building

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.609 
little canister this is in the building
I<00:00:30.359> think<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> building<00:00:31.380> that's

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
I think this is the building that's

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.740 
I think this is the building that's
across<00:00:31.920> from<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.219> general<00:00:32.520> store<00:00:32.730> beside<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
across from the general store beside the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.130 
across from the general store beside the
jail<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:35.329> yeah<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> looks<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:36.780> maybe<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
jail and yeah it looks like maybe a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.299 
jail and yeah it looks like maybe a
light<00:00:37.350> bulb<00:00:37.590> or<00:00:37.770> something<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.250> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
light bulb or something like that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.610 
light bulb or something like that
anyways<00:00:38.850> also<00:00:39.840> some<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> parts<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.110 
sorry we're above the jail say on that
in<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.350> that's<00:00:52.350> footage<00:00:52.829> right<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.219> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
in that that's footage right there so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840 
in that that's footage right there so
we're<00:00:54.210> gonna<00:00:54.329> put<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.850> gallows

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
we're gonna put it on the the gallows

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.810 
we're gonna put it on the the gallows
now<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:58.140> component<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.859> believe<00:00:59.190> only<00:00:59.460> goes

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
now that component I believe only goes

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.960 
now that component I believe only goes
on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:03.439> gallows<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.100> other<00:01:05.280> one

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
on the gallows but there are other one

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.940 
on the gallows but there are other one
or<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.210> other<00:01:06.420> components<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.770> put

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
or two other components that if you put

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.500 
or two other components that if you put
it<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> gallows<00:01:08.400> therefore<00:01:09.299> you're

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it on the gallows therefore you're

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
it on the gallows therefore you're
locked<00:01:09.780> into<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> mac<00:01:10.439> society<00:01:10.950> easter<00:01:11.189> egg

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
locked into the mac society easter egg

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
locked into the mac society easter egg
you<00:01:11.790> can't<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.180> Richthofen<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.470> need

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you can't do Richthofen because you need

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.460 
you can't do Richthofen because you need
that<00:01:13.710> part<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.659> guillotine<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.259> well

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
access the barn going underneath from

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.200 
access the barn going underneath from
the<00:01:27.570> bank<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.560> first<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> coil<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.939> wire

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the bank the first is the coil of wire

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
the bank the first is the coil of wire
in<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:31.140> coil<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.710> wire<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.250> required<00:01:32.850> for

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
in this coil of wire is required for

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899 
in this coil of wire is required for
both<00:01:33.540> devices<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.400> Max's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
both devices because we do get Max's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.660 
both devices because we do get Max's
saying<00:01:36.900> something<00:01:37.350> okay<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.310> we're<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
saying something okay so we're going to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.160 
saying something okay so we're going to
place<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.630> parts<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:41.369> gallows<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
place the the parts at the gallows and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.139 
place the the parts at the gallows and
listen<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.439> Maxis<00:01:43.860> has<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.159> stay<00:01:44.340> here

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.210 

huh<00:01:50.149> I<00:01:50.540> guess<00:01:51.110> I'll<00:01:51.290> know<00:01:51.470> what<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.920> when

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
huh I guess I'll know what it is when

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.170 
huh I guess I'll know what it is when
it's<00:01:52.340> done<00:01:53.860> two<00:01:54.860> more<00:01:55.189> components<00:01:55.640> I'll<00:01:56.060> be

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
it's done two more components I'll be

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.660 
it's done two more components I'll be
quiet<00:01:56.530> ensure<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.740> they<00:01:57.890> are<00:01:57.920> not<00:01:58.159> used<00:01:58.460> to

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
quiet ensure that they are not used to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.490 
quiet ensure that they are not used to
further<00:01:58.880> references<00:01:59.780> are<00:02:00.020> his<00:02:00.200> clothes<00:02:02.500> okay

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
further references are his clothes okay

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.020 
further references are his clothes okay
so<00:02:03.560> he<00:02:03.979> doesn't<00:02:04.159> actually<00:02:04.399> mention<00:02:04.789> it<00:02:04.880> there

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
so he doesn't actually mention it there

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.460 
so he doesn't actually mention it there
I<00:02:05.060> think<00:02:05.149> maybe<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.600> was<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.899> third<00:02:06.110> part

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
I think maybe it was the third part

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.859 
I think maybe it was the third part
where<00:02:06.649> maxis<00:02:07.070> mentions<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.789> you<00:02:08.450> can't<00:02:08.720> go

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
where maxis mentions that you can't go
