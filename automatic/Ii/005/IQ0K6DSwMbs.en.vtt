00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.320
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.850
 sch'tis hardware and software reviews in 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.740
 I'll show you how to do that in this video 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.560
 thermalright silver arrow extreme 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.110
 cpu-cool fist comes in this 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.529
 case a 11 55 clock inter system to 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.509
 commitment 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.730
 Of course, this cpu will fit cooler too 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.520
 on older systems as well as on the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.489
 new intel svc blues with the socket lga 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.660
 11 50 before it starts with the 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.460
 We'll have a look at the installation 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.680
 which accessories are ever needed 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.870
 We have a lot to see in this case 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.300
 The fans cling for up to three 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.070
 fan also to see that y 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.110
 cable for the power supply of the fans 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.540
 then we are down here in the area too 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.850
 see in the thermal grease as well as in the 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.770
 3 stream in the short version one 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 mounting plate and a mounting frame 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.910
 we also have to see it below 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.170
 edges screw the backplate and 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.180
 of course the matching screws for 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.590
 the backplate in this case in the three 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.140
 agree the long version as well 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.420
 First of all, washers need to be 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.149
 Now we are preparing the backplate 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.159
 we need m3 stream in the long 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.020
 version as well as washers 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.400
 four pieces together the little ones 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.540
 By including this case in the scope of delivery 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400
 are included 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.290
 As you can see I have been here before 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.729
 three of the four screws prepared 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.500
 that you can accelerate something 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.360
 Now I have this one screw here 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.840
 and now the backplate will be from the top 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.120
 just put on it now afterwards 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.430
 this screw through the washer 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.440
 Fixed this washer will then 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.020
 in chrome just from the top 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.390
 set and pressed down underneath 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.490
 and that's how the backplate looks like 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.190
 1 4 screws prepared for all 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.140
 common intel now systems so that I 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.360
 corresponding mainboards on the display 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.310
 it can be important to position it 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.900
 all four screws are positioned like this 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.790
 that will be synonymous for that 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.790
 appropriate system fit 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.070
 Now here since 11 55 clock system have 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.250
 I have to screw in the backplate 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.740
 align so that they are in the middle 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.209
 for all other common systems like 13 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.970
 66 and 775 then become this 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.950
 Holes used now after all 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 four screws in the backplate right 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.639
 I can now have that positioned 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.300
 take appropriate mainboard and 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.680
 Carefully put it on top of it like that 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.490
 that all four screws in the way 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.240
 be done through the mainboard 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.950
 then the four will be 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.990
 members edges used stream 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.300
 These countries have screwed on one 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.980
 side a plastic washer and 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.570
 This plastic washer must always 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.370
 in the direction of maine co2 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.140
 the edges are then screwed to the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.030
 previously installed screws on the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.770
 away crosses to solid and thus it becomes clear 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.690
 that this turn screw then the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.220
 I hold backplate in place 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.230
 do this over cross me again 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.700
 So start at the bottom right and the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.770
 next to me on the top left 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.510
 and that's how you see it all by heart 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.220
 all four walls screw properly 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.050
 arrested and fixed 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.570
 next i have this montage here 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.400
 this one has many fold in and bochum 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.020
 but here it quickly becomes clear which 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.090
 because now they are identical with those in the 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.900
 world and therefore are suitable for this 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.280
 Mounting frame on the pre-installed 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.810
 fixing screws 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.790
 basically, this first time 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.430
 hung up and group oriented and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.050
 then fixed by further m3 screws 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.910
 in this case again the m3 current 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.650
 in the short version 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.210
 and that's how it all looks by heart 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.800
 all four screws tightened correctly 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.380
 have and therefore is also this montage 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.570
 frame correctly fixed and locked 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.890
 according to the installation instructions it is 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.760
 now one time the thermal paste 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.400
 apply 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.060
 since but as always relatively 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.190
 time consuming I will from it 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.810
 refrain that show here once briefly 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.750
 to respond to it one could 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.120
 Apply blob in the center of the cpu 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.320
 then on the pressure the ebook 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.910
 to leave windows or man 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.860
 denies the complete top of the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.930
 cpu, therefore, also a good one 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.310
 to ensure heat transfer 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.590
 then I can do that now 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.020
 cpu-cooler ever roughly position 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.180
 the cpu-cooler has one like below 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.160
 protective cover and this one should 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.750
 basically would remove this 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.400
 on it small would heat up in a 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.540
 Stenden thus would be the cooling power 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400
 equals zero 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.560
 So, after I have this protective cover 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.690
 I've just put that away 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.840
 club up and rude him once before 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.820
 out to fix the cooler will be here 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.709
 The mounting plate uses this 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.769
 mounting plate has top and bottom 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.400
 as well as the mounting frame 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.800
 supply options and in this 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.000
 fall, the short three come again 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.540
 screws for use 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.350
 the mounting plate does not matter from above 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.040
 from the bottom centered on the cpu-cooler 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.260
 positioned so that the 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.970
 research opportunities 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.830
 that means that loppet in the 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.750
 frame as well as in the mounting plate 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.790
 must match 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.470
 and that's how it all looks by heart 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.630
 tightened at the screw 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.700
 Here it is recommended a longer 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.410
 to use the screwdriver 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.820
 as simple as possible 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.430
 Last but not least, the 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.590
 Supplied fan installed in 140 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.120
 Millimeter bequeathed that does not happen 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.340
 in the classic way 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.480
 but screwed through this 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.340
 fan cling 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.680
 these have a bridge in the middle 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.440
 and one nose each on the left and right 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.270
 As always, every fan has a prescription 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.370
 holes in these cases, too 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.280
 needed that means following me 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.500
 add such a fan clip 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.890
 a nose of it 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.020
 through this hole on the other side 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.520
 the same of course again and 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.440
 so do I with the second 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.740
 fan bracket if I need pro 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.170
 fan-two such fan clip of 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.700
 prepared ventilators including fans cling 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.310
 is then installed as follows 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.160
 On the one side there will be a fan 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.080
 brace so positioned that in 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.450
 the fan bracket slot of the 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.960
 Heat sink will fit the same 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.370
 of course also for the other side 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.040
 Of course, repeated assumptions are made 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.810
 that this fan bracket is not before 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.800
 as has been the case for example 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.080
 I was the case 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.840
 Among other things, this could be for the one 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.280
 or other user is something tricky 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.860
 but absolutely feasible 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.160
 the same thing is repeated with the 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.660
 second included fan and after 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.310
 is already the installation of 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.960
 fan finished 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.340
 well and there we are almost on 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.170
 now we have to finish 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.030
 Of course, both fans with 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.850
 supply the power over it 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.460
 the supplied cable y means 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.180
 Both cables will be connected to this Psion cable 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.100
 affiliated 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.200
 the one end of this type i lon 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.390
 cable comes directly to the power supply 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.120
 another turn comes directly 1 mainboard 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.540
 for controlling or regulating the 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.890
 fan speeds well that should be it 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.080
 I would of course have been 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.490
 happy if you are the whole endangered and 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.289
 if you just express that 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.419
 would bring it with a 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.180
 licon of the video or also by that 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.309
 Subscribe in a channel and yes if 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.589
 you have further questions or suggestions 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:51.809
 ideas did write me that just as 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:53.849
 Comment or as a personal message 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.960
 and then I thank you for this 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.939
 place for watching 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.360
 yes and see you next time and 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.360
 bye
