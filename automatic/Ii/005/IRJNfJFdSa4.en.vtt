00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
be in there tighter or if you wanted to
mount<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> inverted<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.560> can

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
mount it inverted you know you can

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530

really<00:01:14.100> tighten<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.240> hard

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
really tighten it up so it's very hard

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.280 
really tighten it up so it's very hard
to<00:01:15.570> pull<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:17.150> you<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.180> push<00:01:18.630> right

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
to pull out but you just push right

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.730 
to pull out but you just push right
there<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> sheet<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.750> comes<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.290> it's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
there on the sheet and it comes out it's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.710 
there on the sheet and it comes out it's
very<00:01:22.830> nice<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> only<00:01:23.580> thing<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
very nice the only thing that I have a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.010 
very nice the only thing that I have a
complaint<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.490> makes<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.180> little

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
complaint on is that it makes a little

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
complaint on is that it makes a little
bit<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.320> noise<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.710> can't<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.220> very<00:01:29.430> quiet

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
bit of noise you can't do it very quiet

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.340 
bit of noise you can't do it very quiet
let's<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:33.210> hard<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.869> hard<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
let's see it's hard it's hard to get the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
let's see it's hard it's hard to get the
knife<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.650> quietly<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
knife out quietly out of there so if you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
knife out quietly out of there so if you
need<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> stealth<00:01:36.930> application<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.400> may<00:01:38.640> need

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
need a stealth application you may need

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.289 
need a stealth application you may need
to<00:01:38.939> mod<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.180> somehow<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:40.820> do<00:01:41.820> something<00:01:42.060> else

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
to mod it somehow or do something else

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.149 
to mod it somehow or do something else
so<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.810> lose<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.259> all<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> way<00:01:43.680> down<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
so if we lose this all the way down to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.420 
so if we lose this all the way down to
the<00:01:44.250> very<00:01:44.340> bottom<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:45.659> try<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:47.220> could

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the very bottom and try it out we could

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.840 
the very bottom and try it out we could
see<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.600> makes<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.930> difference<00:01:49.850> there's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
see if that makes a difference there's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.330 
see if that makes a difference there's
there's<00:01:51.119> still<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> clicking<00:01:51.960> noise<00:01:52.340> either

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there's still that clicking noise either

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.950 
there's still that clicking noise either
any<00:01:53.640> way<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.799> but<00:01:55.799> other<00:01:56.549> than<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
any way you do it but other than that

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.530 
any way you do it but other than that
