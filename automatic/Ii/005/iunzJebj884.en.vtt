00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.090
 you have to give everyone welcome to a 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.280
 new tutorial and this time we will see 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.029
 how to have an unlock pattern of 3 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.400
 x 3 as is normal 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 or 6 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.810
 x 6 how will you be seeing the images and 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.300
 good is as simple as being a user 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.710
 root and have the exposÃ© framework and good 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.270
 for this we have to download a 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.640
 module that are in the 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.710
 framework repository see where 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.809
 export set in download we are looking for what 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 what I wrote here is what we selected 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.760
 we leave in download and I have it so 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.030
 I'm not going to give him that much so we come 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.200
 over here and we give it in module since what 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.230
 we have installed will appear 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.000
 here we activate it in this way and the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.500
 changes will be used good to start 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.720
 serve until we restart the terminal 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.579
 is that we give you a restart with a 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.260
 restart software is enough you do not need a 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.090
 restart with boot complete fine since 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.310
 we have it here restarted would suffice 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.110
 go to the settings and some adjustments later 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.640
 good security this also depends on 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.199
 the customization of your android the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.210
 It is pure android adjustment 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.590
 screen lock security and here 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.659
 We have the different options for 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.159
 example here is the mouse 3 x 3 the 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.069
 normal of all life 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.009
 the 4x4 pattern that already good this comes 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:20.920
 being part of the application also 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.780
 we have a 5 x 5 pattern that is more 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.200
 complicated even it's a bit difficult 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.359
 to use and finally good to everyone 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.929
 they wanted to see or the most exaggerated I think 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.280
 is the 6 x 6 that is already a little more me 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.840
 I would say it's the limit because one more already 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.479
 it would be difficult to hoist what we can 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.280
 put four that we want in this case 1 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.180
 so good more will be late 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 to put it 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.590
 Aisha we blocked the terminal and the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.510
 unblock it we'll see what's good here 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.790
 is the pattern we can put everything and 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.950
 well let's see that we are not going to 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.360
 unlock only if we put the right one 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.180
 and well, this would be the application 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.370
 of today 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.990
 comment if it has been useful for you to comment 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.120
 they want other kinds of applications like 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.130
 this or any doubt they have and another 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.420
 it looks like the tutorial so well I hope 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.140
 you liked it and see you in the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.140
 next tutorial
