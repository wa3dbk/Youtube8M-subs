00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.350
 Welcome side to the picture today, let's go. 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.910
 talk about a very important illness 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.139
 What is AIDS? 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.720
 Personal hygiene is caused by the virus 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.560
 this virus also has a capsule 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.550
 protein which is called the capsid 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.759
 genetic material which in this case is n 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:33.020
 ha and also a very important enzyme 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:35.060
 which is reverse transcriptase 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.310
 this enzyme is very important for the 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.370
 replication of these viruses and this will be 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.390
 spoken in the specific lessons about the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.970
 virus 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.300
 At this time he only wants to talk about AIDS and 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.450
 which hiv virus cells invade good 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.480
 viruses and invade the white blood cells 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.250
 only those blood cells that 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.560
 these phase cells 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.680
 good people and remembering the globules 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.970
 whites are responsible for the defense of 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.269
 body 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.659
 are very important cells of the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.929
 immune system defense system 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.310
 hiv viruses multiply within 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.619
 of these scenes 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.189
 and then the entire defense system of the 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.399
 body is compromised and this is why 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.950
 that people with AIDS suffer greatly from 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.409
 opportunistic diseases that are caused by 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.689
 by other parasites and these diseases 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.289
 can lead to death 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.049
 but how this disease is transmitted well 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.139
 hiv virus can be found in 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.499
 secretions and that if the elections are 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:45.799
 virus can be found in the blood in the 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:48.859
 semen in vaginal secretions in milk 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.409
 then if a person has contact 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.409
 with these secretions contaminated by 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.209
 virus it will become infected 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.789
 transmission of AIDS can 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.719
 happen from sexual intercourse 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.840
 with people infected by the virus 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.259
 mainly sexual intercourse without 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.869
 condoms 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.959
 transmission may also occur 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.430
 through needles or syringes 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.890
 contaminated 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.230
 here we can also talk about the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.769
 direct contact with contaminated blood 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.690
 from the use of sharp objects 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:27.349
 such as razor blades pliers 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.140
 nail clippers tattoo needles 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.910
 Piercing may lead to contamination 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.940
 also from blood transfusion 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.150
 and also contamination from mother to child 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.450
 during pregnancy or during pregnancy. 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.329
 childbirth already knows that HIV virus 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.209
 can be passed through the milk during 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.019
 breastfeeding and what are the symptoms of 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.360
 aids 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.970
 the acute phase occurs in the first 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.019
 weeks of contamination and often 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.840
 this phase is confused like a flu 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.129
 because the symptoms at this stage 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.579
 include the fever being ill then 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.769
 many times this phase can pass 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.930
 unnoticed and confused with a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.090
 flu or cold 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.569
 only this personal phase is very 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.519
 important because at this stage it has not 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.319
 it is certain that the person is contaminated 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.480
 by hiv virus 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.359
 this increases the chance of 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.840
 contamination to other people 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.329
 these symptoms are non-specific and the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.440
 diagnosis of infection can only be 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:42.799
 confirmed by the anti-HIV test that 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.239
 usually done after three months of 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.430
 date of contamination and in the chronic phase 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.959
 opportunistic diseases that 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.349
 can be tuberculosis pneumonia also 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:01.069
 tumors may appear and these diseases 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.560
 are very dangerous opportunistic diseases 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.200
 you remember which cells are that 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.799
 hiv virus attacks good as i ended up 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.680
 to speak 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.720
 hiv virus attacks white blood cells 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.829
 which are the defense cells of the 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.109
 body 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.440
 these diseases are called diseases 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.870
 opportunistic because in fact it is 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.750
 take advantage of the weakness of the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.140
 which is the system responsible for 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.330
 for taking care of the body's defense and 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.580
 now let's think here what are the 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.419
 prophylactic measures with 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.159
 AIDS is good there is no vaccine and 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.069
 there is healing behind 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.930
 there are drugs that can inhibit 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.969
 reproduction of rivers 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.479
 so as prophylaxis we can 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:49.539
 sexual intercourse with the use of 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.639
 of condoms 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:56.810
 remembering that AIDS is classified as 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.400
 a dst meaning sexually transmitted disease 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.039
 transmissible 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.490
 a good measure is also the use of 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:08.000
 disposable syringes and do not 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.319
 sharp objects such as 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.280
 shaving nail clippers pliers 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:19.159
 we can also place the sorting and 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:23.330
 intention of blood banks to avoid 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:25.279
 the transfusion of contaminated blood and 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.919
 close this personal class I just want 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:32.199
 highlight two very important things 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:34.969
 first having AIDS is different from being 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.819
 carrier of HIV virus 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.250
 but this is because the personal virus has a 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.190
 long incubation period then 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.469
 Sometimes the person is carrying the virus 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.460
 does not show any symptoms and does not 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:53.180
 necessarily will have aids she will be 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.339
 only with hiv z and the second 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.050
 thing that I want to highlight about AIDS 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:02.210
 is that it is a pandemic 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.849
 remembering infectious diseases that are 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.460
 spread throughout the world causing death 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.110
 of many people are considered 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.690
 pandemics 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.409
 so the staff is this we end up with 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.150
 on here 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:18.639
 Next class we will talk about the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.639
 piston hope you there even more
