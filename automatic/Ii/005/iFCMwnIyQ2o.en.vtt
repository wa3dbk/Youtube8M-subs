able to find one show you how to change
the<00:00:26.910> battery<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> credit<00:00:27.990> card<00:00:28.289> key<00:00:28.560> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the battery for the credit card key so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
the battery for the credit card key so
here<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.090> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
here it is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.200 
here it is
now<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.410> key<00:00:31.679> set<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.070> I'm<00:00:32.189> using<00:00:32.489> applies

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
now the key set that I'm using applies

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.000 
now the key set that I'm using applies
to<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> is250

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to the is250

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.330 
to the is250
but<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.059> believe<00:00:36.329> most<00:00:36.630> late-model<00:00:37.230> mixes<00:00:37.829> use

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
but I believe most late-model mixes use

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.520 
but I believe most late-model mixes use
the<00:00:38.730> same<00:00:38.940> key<00:00:39.239> set<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the same key set so I think the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.190 
the same key set so I think the
procedure<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.489> battery<00:00:42.180> types<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:43.079> be

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
procedure and the battery types will be

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.619 
procedure and the battery types will be
common<00:00:43.559> across<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> range<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
common across all of the range but I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.290 
common across all of the range but I
recommend<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.770> don't<00:00:47.039> drive<00:00:47.309> an<00:00:47.460> is250

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
recommend if you don't drive an is250

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.189 
recommend if you don't drive an is250
just<00:00:48.780> double<00:00:49.140> check

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
just double check

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.350 
just double check
now<00:00:52.199> you'll<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.620> everything<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:54.180> you
