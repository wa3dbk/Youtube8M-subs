 first game of this episode 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.340
 play against this team and this team has 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.900
 huntelaar in the rush hour 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.790
 and by the way huntelaar he really is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.020
 exclusive images that just has 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:48.090
 last for the first time in his life 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:55.230
 just ate a banana and I think 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.879
 you the nice klaas-jan I say no 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.430
 seriously what do you think of the taste of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.640
 that banana cops her real name fool 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.979
 too bad man that intro box sorry 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 perfect animals this competition stands 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.000
 pretty bad because here is our 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.350
 Bananas that hate the email from it 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.299
 against will make and he goes 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.400
 even believe it or don't believe it 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.750
 that makes huntelaar even the 2 0 i know 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 who fortunately still have a goal back 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.710
 come with the legend ronaldinho who the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.409
 make two one like that but continue 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.380
 no longer scored and so I lose crazy 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.600
 say yes that is pretty crazy for the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 vision 8 the lost loss yes ma 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.299
 then I still have the one and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.040
 other coins rule my tits 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.360
 improve then I also buy two 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.130
 players 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.590
 this player is this right back of which 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.159
 you think and I that no you do 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.689
 not 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.220
 and the second player who buy stabilo 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.899
 slides and right that portuguese 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.159
 libri but right with to begin with 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.750
 and with that play from the following 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.909
 match against this team looks good 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.439
 but Alexandre Pato is the one from 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.670
 is going to make an io in this competition and 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.320
 alexandre pato 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.759
 is one that even the two 0's 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
 in this competition and at that time 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.649
 my opponent seemed off 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.070
 fuck that shit i darling which which 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.810
 I am 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.560
 and the first three points in that view, yes 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.820
 8 pakkie yes yes but we are going again right away 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.410
 on to the next game and something 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.630
 against this team and this team looks 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.850
 reasonable off yes and this competition continues 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.890
 and ready to zero for too long 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.880
 finally here Fernandinho slide 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.560
 is you 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.970
 so the shot is going to make a whole 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.470
 by the way not the fernandinho of city 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.850
 but it's my left with that too fine 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.200
 to you you know what the fuck I know 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.000
 love and then the boys who meet 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.920
 but turned out to be a trick that of a drum and 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.610
 Then you talk to you through that 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.770
 comes to the keeper in his own way 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.060
 making that all I can score 2 0 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.920
 the image stays on a give 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.959
 moment poor you know it can do one thing 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.220
 mean great squid 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.959
 so I win and easy this 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.580
 screen that so boom those points there 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.540
 because I apparently have this with this one 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.600
 competition not included 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.580
 yes shit happens too 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.920
 no that's not crazy that's just wrong 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.720
 and it can happen hang they work 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.250
 huntelaar at least it has to be against 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.440
 this team in the next match and it 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.000
 is a silver bpl team and I am coming too 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.180
 even at a zero behind that through 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.100
 by the way an hour hot that they orientation 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.870
 speak guys i know we are going together 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.239
 eat but go back via ronaldinho 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.940
 the I did not even consciously go 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.650
 just saying that now but you see 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.720
 also alexandre pato the two one 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.549
 that lead again is that 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.730
 possible will was yes and then 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.450
 pour danilo die lias the three one in 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.010
 that lias the one that advances 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.410
 fantastic own goal from thomas k 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.120
 what an idiot but we continue because 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.190
 andre easy on the road and that even goes the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.320
 five make one but aba does n't have it 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.720
 because Danilo Diaz is on sale here 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.200
 and he is going to make one like the chef and 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.700
 so the method is scored little 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.480
 6th the lead by three points and it goes 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.480
 yes just fine 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.940
 marathon but just by going there 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.080
 next we are against this team with no 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.340
 but in the rush hour and that is natural 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.510
 where we want to go, we do n't want to 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.430
 but in the pointed side wall and is a series 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:06.500
 very far all your strength please 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.940
 we can stop this but this one 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.680
 as if despite his good ten 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.360
 with such a reasonable egg 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.250
 because you see ronaldinho here the one 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.770
 make laughter and then he comes too 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.150
 fernandinho the dead wae will make neo 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.160
 and that is not the finances of it 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.530
 city that is this is the village once 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.910
 funny world that is still in this case 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.680
 andrÃ© comes through and he goes the three 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.860
 going through this match factory shaft 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.330
 the one who was neutral I was allowed 2 2 de 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.100
 two that makes no sense in van 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.960
 fabbrica smite in butter back making 3 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.730
 one becomes but something will come of it 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.140
 me because everyone she couldn't go there on marlowe 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.760
 Santana ran out but needles can 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.320
 of course also fantastic buy that headline 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.940
 the four inside and eventually so 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.470
 to which you also have a goaltje score and 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.200
 it is really a goal of standing in this 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.389
 last games but I want this one 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.370
 match and I have to call one 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.410
 victory needed and then yes then I am 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.820
 already on the title of this the vision year 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.050
 later it also just took a try 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.400
 to drag in that victory and 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.050
 grab that title but we will 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.310
 not do without a new type I have 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.630
 received many good suggestions for 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.340
 which goalkeeper i should buy from that 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.900
 I requested a previous episode and by 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.500
 far most people are diego 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.450
 alves so buy it helps to get to so 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.010
 I hope I return everything that we do 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.900
 enter this competition and we play 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.430
 against this team and this pink stuff 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.630
 a team with 2 strikers 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.210
 that currently fall in the real 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.780
 life and I shouldn't have done that 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.550
 I think or say so because yes that cream 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.810
 creates the e-mail here 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.340
 and yes the rest makes the two zero here 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.050
 but of course I never give up on here 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.090
 a cross that had and I learn Jan 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.960
 dry 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.020
 sao paulo ends up 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.680
 leandro sao paulo 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.660
 would i have you team me oh yeah that's that 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.430
 right back that nobody knows yes well know 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.919
 I it again he makes the 2 in more cases 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.260
 1 and the 2 2 also comes through here 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.030
 ms sont super chill unfortunately tides 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.380
 conergy how the three two score 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.730
 I can't do anything else there 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.320
 put everything to the comeback 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.060
 still to set it works 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.620
 partly I think because fathers short that the 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.020
 the last coven we are and that's 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.780
 the three 3s will be this competition 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.100
 so I now enter the title 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.000
 at least not yet grab but that is still 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.860
 well my 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.120
 those are my ambitions for years to come 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.010
 in the far future 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.390
 what you know how inconsistent I upload 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.100
 maybe I plan to pass a 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.480
 month again no the to the only one of these 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.950
 episode is already over I hope so 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.020
 you this again a fat episode of 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.060

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.650
 the channel is that fifa uploads that way 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.360
