00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello dear gardeners and 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.410
 gardeners now we will raise from 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.300
 leek cellar which was stored in 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.609
 cellar throughout the winter 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.390
 Today, May 2, he goes with us now we 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:24.189
 let's see how it looks raise there 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:29.329
 we have them on special shelves 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:33.079
 right now you see we are with you 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.210
 raised here it looks in general like that 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.329
 so scary 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.600
 all of it seemed to some whole 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.699
 rotten but this is the outer film of him 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.980
 wet does not have any of this 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.469
 its external on its on its qualitative 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.839
 properties now we will go out and 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.969
 analyze it as expected and you will find out 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.489
 what he will not we will not take 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.629
 stop shooting so you don't 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.429
 thought that there is some kind of setup 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.330
 to you from the store and from the store onions 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:16.810
 said we also went out with cabbage and 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:16.810
 also we go out with a bow we went out with you 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.500
 you left now we will examine it 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.570
 it turns out that here it is outside here 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:39.230
 like macro wool but he can 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.290
 take the outer layer start start start 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.960
 disassemble from him and all that he has 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:53.180
 on top of the wet it goes away 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:02:00.590
 leaves us he will absolutely be 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:02.720
 absolutely clean and crisp all that 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.840
 stored for a year in the cellar she 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.080
 the store arrives after the special 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.760
 treatments where people are by the elbow 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.100
 you men in the mud handle it for 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.380
 so that he entered the store in 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:26.060
 quality form here we will remove 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:28.459
 it came in and the exterior is perfectly dry and not 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.390
 may be in time because everything 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:38.390
 the cellar has its own dampness 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:43.160
 it turns out that's all we put into it 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:48.400
 all wet and we see here see 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.549
 such a bow we have such a white we 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.370
 we land 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.250
 we plant it especially deep and 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.700
 him our green onions that were 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.180
 leaves outside when laying in the cellar 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.930
 he had such disagreeables 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.920
 they ended up falling off there and stayed in 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:17.570
 he is such a solid white 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:22.370
 crafty this listen what dense here 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:26.239
 he is in our cellar so it was kept whole 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.900
 I spend the whole winter onions and now Iâ€™ll give you 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.329
 I will show you again I will prove to you that he was kept 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:40.070
 a whole year , you see, we have tapas 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:43.700
 moral plan tulips water it means 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:47.209
 we have today May 2 and in the cellar this bow 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.040
 must be stored in the grid shelves are not 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.300
 on the deaf wooden shelves she is very 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.810
 lattice can be laid 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.840
 in 2 layers but not so solid but a little 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.450
 one row of onions you stack on the spike 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.130
 one side and the second row of onions 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.080
 lay diagonally already 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.270
 the opposite side so how would they 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.910
 crosswise lay on the shelves and not 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.490
 more than two layers means if you 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.980
 a large amount of onion is laid then the Japanese 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.890
 there should be such creatures on the shelf 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.140
 enough to be low between 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.720
 shelves can be 15 20 centimeters 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.810
 heights and now they need to be laid here 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.490
 This onions as they say many who in 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.990
 Internet tells how to store 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.440
 many say that he should 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.260
 stand 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.390
 its roots in the sand even moistened 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.970
 I know that the cellar in general happens in winter 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.790
 quite raw and so she planted it 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.620
 on tuesday the roots of the hoof the sand is not 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.900
 proved itself not justified 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.090
 onions begin to grow in the middle of winter and just 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.520
 starting even the shooter and let him 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.780
 His roots are equal 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.290
 some moisture from the air 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.060
 cellar and well kept course in 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.060
 storage time in the legs here it is 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.030
 the outer layers of this onion die off and 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.630
 begins to spoil a little 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.400
 soaked but the most important thing is that I tell you 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.160
 did not tell when I got this bow from 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.280
 cellar we get it for a week in advance 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.250
 there are about ten such 12 such bows and 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.710
 put and somewhere there on the paper and i 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.980
 here it lies one day j these are external 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.230
 the layers they dry out completely and take them off 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.870
 can be just like some kind of wrapping 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.120
 paper around this bow and he's there under 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.270
 she's the same here pure white as 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.520
 here I show you now and clean it 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.740
 you need the most important thing you need to understand that 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.410
 this bow it is hardy and pretty 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.810
 even the first frosts don't touch it but 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.640
 you cannot overdo it because 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.919
 if you drank it well it is cola 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.200
 I water every day necessarily if not 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.870
 it rains because it loves moisture 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.810
 we must not lose that moment when he 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.180
 will start giving an arrow to him 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.430
 begins the very bottom goes pretty 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.370
 thick can be straight centimeter 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.990
 arrow thickness if here you take 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.910
 from there to choose from 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.090
 bow and we must look to this arrow 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:10.510
 until it is necessary to remove the bow somewhere already 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.580
 September 1, September 5, onions need this 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.470
 completely remove the whole already and put 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.240
 cellar because the clearing until September he 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.220
 already abruptly here in the southern Urals 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.920
 starts giving 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.480
 arrow which then in the cellar still 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.010
 evolving will give quite significant 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.080
 if you still have a cellar all the more 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.140
 warm it will develop and then 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.510
 may take even about 80 percent of 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.700
 the whole volume of your bow and you him 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.560
 can no longer be able to use so 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.080
 like an arrow in food with me is not suitable she 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.700
 changes the taste of the onion itself even if part 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.160
 here these arrows get you 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.500
 chopped up your your dishes then they 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.280
 change the taste it will be something not very 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:52.270
 your wolfhound is also acceptable to you 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:54.640
 bow pulls out of the garden and from it 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.710
 it needs the root system 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.040
 shorten a little trim to 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:02.560
 the roots were her centimeters 45 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.920
 but still there should be leaves 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.450
 his top greens are higher 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.820
 main thick barrel 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.440
 must be cut off somewhere to 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.960
 15 centimeters were these green 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.030
 leaves on the tip everything else that by 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.680
 the sides you already have leaves from fall away 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.220
 from his trunk, too, must be carefully 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.490
 tear off 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.260
 and in the cellar is no longer placed and so everything 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.230
 we already know how she is 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.920
 the cellar is kept until we have until May all 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.030
 will be good 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.530
