00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.650
 climbing plants this is the ideal on 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.449
 a terrace or balcony because that 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.699
 climbs up and his station nor the walls for that 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.920
 a suitable varieties like here a 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.320
 clematis is largely sufficient 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.000
 a great pot ideally here a pot in 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.860
 plastic material of large volumes which 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.090
 is going to be at that will offer stability 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.500
 that's all it takes for a 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.010
 milf slope and now there are 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.510
 more than planting started by placing 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.929
 a drainage layer at the bottom of the pot 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.140
 here it is powder with lan add 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.370
 then potting soil over check 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.079
 that there is enough in placing the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.649
 clematis in the pot like here there is 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.030
 not enough 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.030
 we will add potting soil 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.059
 we check again and there is 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.100
 sète hérault 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.409
 so we believe planted clematis in the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.670
 coming out of his pot to unravel especially 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.000
 not the roots because it would be harmful 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.879
 for the clematis that's there in his 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.229
 vertical biennial pot of a hand held 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.909
 your clematis and the other 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.210
 fill the free volume with 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.210
 mold 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.580
 add potting soil until you bury the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.900
 base of the motte potte to tamp the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.900
 potting soil is to stick to the roots 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.680
 that's right now a tutor enough 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.420
 strong to support the future rods of 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.320
 the plant that can be heavy and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.549
 offer a catch to the wind do not forget 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.060
 of the task and as soon as she goes out to her 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.060
 final location 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.960
 your clematis is almost ready 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.450
 water 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.950
 and then place the pot at the millions the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.549
 clematis grows quickly and the flowers 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.549
 will be for soon 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 no 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.760
