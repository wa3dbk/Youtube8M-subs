00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:14.110
 how do I learn my first mount in this 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.300
 server is worth with the wizard kong loud 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.100
 well once we reach level 20 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.539
 we can agree to buy a mount 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.599
 ok they will send us a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.339
 a quest worth mail you go 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.140
 to a mailbox this for example from here what 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.600
 take me I have it taken I have it here 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.140
 OK 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.590
 it's an email I've put him winner will be 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.560
 messages and take the missions without 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.640
 importance to promote the do 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.520
 used to deliver it 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.480
 here 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.740
 that the riding instructor 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.870
 during the dissolved experience either 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.060
 nothing happens to do it either but that and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.340
 for not doing it once you are 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.440
 You give kings and apprentice horse riding 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.820
 there's level 20 riding and it's 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.950
 the 40's 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.659
 once they have horsemanship you come here 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.770
 you look for file that comes to the saddle 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.840
 in this case is this I have this if it is 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.060
 This is the truth that with the zero tail 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.899
 brown or me pastel or black 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.899
 90 worth of silver is worth and the other cost 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.860
 360 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.480
 a place right click to the mount 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.280
 you will learn you have the key 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.010
 here it's worth 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.010
 and that aysÃ©n pets and the soldier 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960
 it gets 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.560
 this is the double mount to tie it 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.560
 site is getting 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.550
 good another little thing I'm following 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.410
 acquired the truth to make me art and 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.720
 that certainly not with the 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.640
 spells could go up to 80 what 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.540
 you know now 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.490
