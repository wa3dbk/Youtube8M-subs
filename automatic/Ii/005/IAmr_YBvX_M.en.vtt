large spool is here this is a five-ton

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.620 
large spool is here this is a five-ton
winch<00:00:25.290> so<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.770> has<00:00:25.890> about<00:00:26.160> 3,300<00:00:26.970> feet<00:00:27.420> of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.479 
cable on it the loose end of the winch
but<00:00:30.690> we<00:00:30.810> actually<00:00:30.930> hooked<00:00:31.680> to<00:00:31.860> the<00:00:31.980> pic<00:00:32.190> point

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
but we actually hooked to the pic point

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280 
but we actually hooked to the pic point
or<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> fixed<00:00:33.120> point<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> top<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.080> run

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
or the fixed point at the top of the run
you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.920> actually<00:00:35.070> use<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> winch<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> pull

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
you can actually use the winch to pull

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:51.000 
you can actually use the winch to pull
you<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.840> run

what we're doing right now on this run

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.869 
what we're doing right now on this run
is<00:00:53.230> removing<00:00:53.679> the<00:00:53.769> snow<00:00:53.829> from<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.399> low<00:00:54.550> side

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
is removing the snow from the low side

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.119 
is removing the snow from the low side
of<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.149> run<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.930> skiers<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.500> boarders<00:00:56.559> bring

of the run the skiers and boarders bring

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.970 
of the run the skiers and boarders bring
all<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.430> snow<00:00:57.670> down<00:00:57.969> into<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.480> low<00:00:58.659> side<00:00:58.980> so

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
all the snow down into the low side so

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.200 
all the snow down into the low side so
at<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.190> wedge<00:01:00.339> cab<00:01:00.640> what<00:01:00.789> we're<00:01:00.909> doing<00:01:01.120> is

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
at the wedge cab what we're doing is

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.090 
at the wedge cab what we're doing is
we're<00:01:01.359> working<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.839> snow<00:01:02.140> back<00:01:02.379> across<00:01:02.739> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
we're working that snow back across the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.070 
we're working that snow back across the
run<00:01:03.280> against<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:03.820> fall<00:01:04.030> line<00:01:04.269> we're<00:01:04.809> moving

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
run against the fall line we're moving

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.499 
run against the fall line we're moving
it<00:01:05.199> back<00:01:05.409> uphill<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:06.340> covering<00:01:07.180> up<00:01:07.299> whatever

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
it back uphill and covering up whatever

it back uphill and covering up whatever
thin<00:01:07.899> spots<00:01:08.259> might<00:01:08.560> be<00:01:08.710> up<00:01:08.830> there
