00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
large which makes room for huge brakes

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
large which makes room for huge brakes
yeah<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.440> used<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> fixed<00:00:41.129> calipers<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
yeah we used to fixed calipers on the

yeah we used to fixed calipers on the
front<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.090> rear<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> 135i<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:44.010> used<00:00:44.309> l

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
front and rear on the 135i we used l

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.369 
front and rear on the 135i we used l
minium<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> material<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.780> they're<00:00:46.050> both

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
minium as the material so they're both
