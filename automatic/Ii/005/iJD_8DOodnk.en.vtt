solidworks at Hawkridge systems wanted
to<00:00:12.440> go<00:00:12.559> over<00:00:12.590> a<00:00:13.039> great<00:00:13.490> new<00:00:13.839> enhancement<00:00:14.839> to

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
to go over a great new enhancement to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.749 
to go over a great new enhancement to
the<00:00:15.019> sketching<00:00:15.650> environment<00:00:16.160> in<00:00:16.309> SolidWorks

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:16.759

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.140 
the sketching environment in SolidWorks
2014<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.619> one<00:00:18.830> really<00:00:19.520> comes<00:00:19.910> into<00:00:20.060> play

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
2014 and this one really comes into play

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.620 
2014 and this one really comes into play
when<00:00:20.689> we're<00:00:20.869> doing<00:00:21.020> geometry<00:00:21.890> like<00:00:22.340> this<00:00:22.630> kind

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
when we're doing geometry like this kind

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.679 
when we're doing geometry like this kind
of<00:00:23.689> freeform<00:00:23.990> very<00:00:24.650> smooth<00:00:25.070> contour<00:00:25.849> type

geometry based on curves and splines
this<00:00:29.599> is<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.750> foot<00:00:30.050> bed<00:00:30.289> or<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:30.920> stand<00:00:31.339> up<00:00:31.490> a<00:00:31.640> TV

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
this is a foot bed or a stand up a TV

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.689 
this is a foot bed or a stand up a TV
that<00:00:33.199> you<00:00:33.230> may<00:00:33.530> have<00:00:33.559> seen<00:00:33.800> on<00:00:33.860> our<00:00:34.100> website<00:00:34.519> or

that you may have seen on our website or

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.600 
that you may have seen on our website or
the<00:00:34.730> solidworks<00:00:35.269> website<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.070> we<00:00:37.070> want<00:00:37.309> to

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
the solidworks website and we want to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.789 
the solidworks website and we want to
you<00:00:37.940> know<00:00:38.030> there's<00:00:38.210> no<00:00:38.360> straight<00:00:39.350> lines<00:00:39.500> or

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:39.799 
you know there's no straight lines or

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.100 
you know there's no straight lines or
arcs<00:00:40.190> it's<00:00:41.089> hard<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.330> put<00:00:41.479> dimensions<00:00:41.960> on<00:00:42.080> this

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
arcs it's hard to put dimensions on this

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.960 
arcs it's hard to put dimensions on this
kind<00:00:42.409> of<00:00:42.470> geometry<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:43.280> what<00:00:43.460> we<00:00:43.549> usually<00:00:43.760> use

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
kind of geometry so what we usually use

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.759 
kind of geometry so what we usually use
is<00:00:44.570> some<00:00:45.260> type<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:46.150> photography<00:00:47.150> or<00:00:48.019> digital

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
is some type of photography or digital

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.820 
is some type of photography or digital
concept<00:00:49.519> art<00:00:49.850> that<00:00:50.839> we<00:00:50.989> can<00:00:51.199> then<00:00:51.229> use<00:00:51.619> as<00:00:51.799> a

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
concept art that we can then use as a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.340 
concept art that we can then use as a
guideline<00:00:52.159> for<00:00:52.400> these<00:00:52.820> more<00:00:53.000> freeform<00:00:53.360> type

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
guideline for these more freeform type

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.320 
guideline for these more freeform type
shapes<00:00:54.769> so<00:00:55.369> we<00:00:55.489> do<00:00:55.610> that<00:00:55.790> with<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.059> sketch

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
shapes so we do that with the sketch

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.910 
shapes so we do that with the sketch
picture<00:00:56.750> tool<00:00:56.960> which<00:00:57.140> has<00:00:57.260> been<00:00:57.409> around<00:00:57.530> for<00:00:57.890> a

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
picture tool which has been around for a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.390 
picture tool which has been around for a
while<00:00:58.900> and<00:00:59.900> let's<00:01:00.320> just<00:01:00.379> go<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:01.129> feel<00:01:01.280> this

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
while and let's just go to feel this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.240 
while and let's just go to feel this
pain<00:01:01.489> one<00:01:01.909> more<00:01:02.150> time<00:01:02.449> before<00:01:02.689> we<00:01:02.839> move<00:01:03.049> on<00:01:03.199> to

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
pain one more time before we move on to

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.350 
pain one more time before we move on to
2014<00:01:04.250> let's<00:01:04.430> turn<00:01:04.580> off<00:01:04.729> this<00:01:04.939> great<00:01:05.180> new<00:01:05.299> tool

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
2014 let's turn off this great new tool

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.380 
2014 let's turn off this great new tool
and<00:01:05.840> let's<00:01:06.770> just<00:01:06.830> see<00:01:07.549> how<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.700> was<00:01:07.880> done<00:01:08.150> in

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
and let's just see how it was done in

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.830 
and let's just see how it was done in
the<00:01:08.720> old<00:01:08.869> days<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:09.799> we<00:01:09.920> have<00:01:10.159> our<00:01:10.490> true<00:01:11.390> sketch

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
the old days so we have our true sketch

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840 
the old days so we have our true sketch
construction<00:01:12.649> geometry<00:01:12.920> here<00:01:13.399> with<00:01:13.609> some

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
construction geometry here with some

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.520 
construction geometry here with some
known<00:01:14.060> dimensions<00:01:14.299> that<00:01:14.719> I<00:01:14.750> need<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.109> hit<00:01:15.259> and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
known dimensions that I need to hit and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.340 
known dimensions that I need to hit and
now<00:01:16.159> I<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:17.030> sketch<00:01:17.539> picture<00:01:17.960> comes<00:01:18.170> in

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
now I the sketch picture comes in

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.770 
now I the sketch picture comes in
without<00:01:18.469> any<00:01:18.799> scale<00:01:19.159> information<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:20.659> up

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
without any scale information so it's up

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.020 
without any scale information so it's up
to<00:01:20.810> me<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.049> get<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.649> located<00:01:22.100> correctly<00:01:22.759> and

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
to me to get it located correctly and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.719 
to me to get it located correctly and
then<00:01:23.630> change<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.320> size<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.070> then<00:01:25.369> once<00:01:25.579> I

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
then change the size and then once I

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.450 
then change the size and then once I
think<00:01:25.969> I<00:01:26.060> get<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.270> size<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.899> way<00:01:27.020> I<00:01:27.049> like<00:01:27.320> it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
think I get the size the way I like it

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.919 
think I get the size the way I like it
well<00:01:28.460> now<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.700> position<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:29.270> wrong<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.780> then

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
well now the position is wrong and then

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.980 
well now the position is wrong and then
I<00:01:30.020> get<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.259> move<00:01:30.409> it<00:01:30.560> up<00:01:30.649> again<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.990> as

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
I get to move it up again and as

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.870 
I get to move it up again and as
designers<00:01:33.499> we<00:01:33.530> r<00:01:33.679> perfectionist<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.520> we<00:01:34.700> tend

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
designers we r perfectionist so we tend

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.969 
designers we r perfectionist so we tend
to<00:01:34.969> probably<00:01:35.270> take<00:01:35.359> way<00:01:35.810> too<00:01:35.840> long<00:01:36.109> way<00:01:36.950> too

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
to probably take way too long way too

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.459 
to probably take way too long way too
many<00:01:37.249> passes<00:01:37.789> at<00:01:37.909> this<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.359> get<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.689> just<00:01:39.380> right

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
many passes at this to get it just right

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.760 
many passes at this to get it just right
but<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:40.130> can't<00:01:40.340> resist<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:41.090> we<00:01:41.240> are<00:01:41.560> okay<00:01:42.560> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
but we can't resist to we are okay and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.039 
but we can't resist to we are okay and
so<00:01:43.189> we're<00:01:43.399> close<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:44.090> even<00:01:44.450> now<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:44.659> can

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
so we're close and then even now I can

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.989 
so we're close and then even now I can
still<00:01:45.350> see<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.219> scanner<00:01:46.520> bed<00:01:46.789> they

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
still see that in the scanner bed they

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.450 
still see that in the scanner bed they
probably<00:01:47.240> put<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.509> in<00:01:47.719> crooked<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:48.889> now<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.189> need

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
probably put it in crooked so now I need

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.980 
probably put it in crooked so now I need
to<00:01:49.579> try<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.819> guess<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.299> don't<00:01:50.450> know<00:01:50.509> maybe<00:01:50.719> one

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
to try to guess I don't know maybe one

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.789 
to try to guess I don't know maybe one
degree<00:01:51.350> rotate<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.460> up<00:01:52.639> nope<00:01:52.999> too<00:01:53.329> much<00:01:53.770> okay<00:01:54.770> I

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
degree rotate it up nope too much okay I

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.559 
degree rotate it up nope too much okay I
don't<00:01:55.069> know<00:01:55.130> point<00:01:55.460> seven<00:01:55.850> as<00:01:55.969> you<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.240> see<00:01:56.420> it

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
don't know point seven as you can see it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.590 
don't know point seven as you can see it
just<00:01:56.780> takes<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.319> little<00:01:57.619> bit<00:01:57.770> too<00:01:58.009> much<00:01:58.600> too

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
just takes a little bit too much too

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.789 
just takes a little bit too much too
many<00:01:59.749> iterations<00:01:59.929> to<00:02:00.380> get<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:00.740> thing

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
many iterations to get this thing

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.099 
many iterations to get this thing
exactly<00:02:01.340> right<00:02:01.789> so<00:02:02.119> we're<00:02:02.450> going<00:02:02.539> to<00:02:02.630> show<00:02:02.869> how

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
exactly right so we're going to show how

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.669 
exactly right so we're going to show how
we<00:02:03.170> can<00:02:03.439> make<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.799> lot<00:02:04.069> easier<00:02:04.429> now<00:02:04.670> in

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
we can make that a lot easier now in

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.719 
we can make that a lot easier now in
2014<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:06.920> we'll<00:02:07.009> get<00:02:07.069> rid<00:02:07.219> of<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.340> one<00:02:07.549> and

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
2014 so we'll get rid of that one and

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.699 
2014 so we'll get rid of that one and
we'll<00:02:07.819> bring<00:02:07.939> in<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.209> again<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:09.319> time<00:02:09.380> we

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
we'll bring in it again and this time we

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.380 
we'll bring in it again and this time we
are<00:02:09.920> going<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.310> use<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.670> great<00:02:10.940> new<00:02:11.090> feature

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
are going to use this great new feature

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.280 
are going to use this great new feature
called<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:12.080> sketch<00:02:13.069> picture<00:02:13.700> scale<00:02:14.120> tool

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
called the sketch picture scale tool

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.140 
called the sketch picture scale tool
okay<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.040> there's<00:02:16.250> our<00:02:16.370> picture<00:02:16.760> again<00:02:16.969> this

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
okay so there's our picture again this

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.000 
okay so there's our picture again this
time<00:02:17.360> with<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.750> blue<00:02:18.019> line<00:02:18.049> that<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
time with this blue line that is the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.970 
time with this blue line that is the
tool<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:20.060> way<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.329> works<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.950> place

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
tool and the way it works is you place

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.729 
tool and the way it works is you place
it<00:02:22.519> on<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> model<00:02:23.420> hopefully<00:02:23.930> whoever

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
it on the model hopefully whoever

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.559 
it on the model hopefully whoever
created<00:02:25.189> the<00:02:25.340> digital<00:02:25.700> art<00:02:25.909> has<00:02:26.150> given<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.450> at

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
created the digital art has given you at

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.330 
created the digital art has given you at
least<00:02:26.750> one<00:02:26.959> good<00:02:27.170> hard<00:02:27.500> reference<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.159> there

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
least one good hard reference on there

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.759 
least one good hard reference on there
that<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.640> can<00:02:28.819> use<00:02:29.060> okay<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.049> want<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.319> place<00:02:30.560> it

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
that you can use okay I want to place it

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.149 
that you can use okay I want to place it
on<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:30.980> picture<00:02:31.879> that's<00:02:32.269> step<00:02:32.720> one<00:02:32.989> step<00:02:33.950> two

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
on the picture that's step one step two

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.039 
on the picture that's step one step two
is<00:02:34.549> then<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.819> take<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> other<00:02:35.299> point<00:02:35.629> you<00:02:35.900> can

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
is then to take the other point you can

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.080 
is then to take the other point you can
see<00:02:36.230> here<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.709> even<00:02:36.829> move<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.700> at<00:02:37.819> an<00:02:37.939> angle

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
see here I can even move it at an angle

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.179 
see here I can even move it at an angle
which<00:02:38.450> helps<00:02:38.780> me<00:02:38.959> for<00:02:39.379> those<00:02:39.530> kind<00:02:39.769> of<00:02:39.859> crooked

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
which helps me for those kind of crooked

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.780 
which helps me for those kind of crooked
scans<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:42.230> we'll<00:02:42.709> place<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.250> right<00:02:43.489> at<00:02:43.639> the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
scans and we'll place that right at the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.619 
scans and we'll place that right at the
end<00:02:43.909> of<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.629> extension<00:02:45.530> line<00:02:45.709> okay<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.939> now

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
end of the extension line okay and now

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.690 
end of the extension line okay and now
since<00:02:48.170> we<00:02:48.290> know<00:02:48.379> what<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.680> number<00:02:48.799> is<00:02:48.980> 825

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
since we know what that number is 825

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.009 
since we know what that number is 825
that's<00:02:50.090> what<00:02:50.269> I'm<00:02:50.359> going<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.540> put<00:02:50.689> in<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
that's what I'm going to put in and

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.140 
that's what I'm going to put in and
that's<00:02:51.079> going<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.379> scale<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.980> tool<00:02:52.310> which<00:02:52.970> is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
that's going to scale the tool which is

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.119 
that's going to scale the tool which is
then<00:02:53.329> going<00:02:53.599> to<00:02:53.810> scale<00:02:54.139> the<00:02:54.470> entire<00:02:54.769> picture

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
then going to scale the entire picture

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.539 
then going to scale the entire picture
so<00:02:56.090> now<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.299> picture<00:02:56.870> has<00:02:57.409> is<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.799> right<00:02:58.250> size

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
so now the picture has is the right size

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.259 
so now the picture has is the right size
and<00:02:59.500> now<00:03:00.500> it's<00:03:00.739> just<00:03:00.980> as<00:03:01.189> easy<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:01.519> placing<00:03:02.150> it

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
and now it's just as easy as placing it

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.110 
and now it's just as easy as placing it
I<00:03:02.389> can<00:03:02.569> even<00:03:02.689> use<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.169> tool<00:03:03.470> here<00:03:03.819> place<00:03:04.819> that

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
I can even use this tool here place that

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.890 
I can even use this tool here place that
right<00:03:05.389> on<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.810> end<00:03:05.959> there<00:03:06.139> and<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:08.720> is

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
right on the end there and this is

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.509 
right on the end there and this is
really<00:03:09.109> nice<00:03:09.319> again<00:03:09.739> instead<00:03:10.099> of<00:03:10.250> trying<00:03:10.459> to

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
really nice again instead of trying to

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.460 
really nice again instead of trying to
guess<00:03:10.730> an<00:03:10.909> angle<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.419> can<00:03:11.629> grab<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.290> can

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
guess an angle I can grab this and I can

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.199 
guess an angle I can grab this and I can
just<00:03:12.650> tilt<00:03:12.889> the<00:03:13.069> picture<00:03:13.430> up<00:03:13.609> with<00:03:13.939> the<00:03:14.060> other

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
just tilt the picture up with the other

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.970 
just tilt the picture up with the other
end<00:03:16.540> clearly<00:03:17.540> see<00:03:17.750> yep<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.260> looks<00:03:18.290> good<00:03:18.709> and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
end clearly see yep that looks good and

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.050 
end clearly see yep that looks good and
we're<00:03:19.280> done<00:03:20.440> much<00:03:21.440> less<00:03:21.769> work<00:03:22.069> much<00:03:22.790> less

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
we're done much less work much less

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.559 
we're done much less work much less
tedious<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:23.810> even<00:03:24.409> more<00:03:24.620> precise<00:03:25.510> okay<00:03:26.510> so

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
tedious and even more precise okay so

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.449 
tedious and even more precise okay so
look<00:03:26.930> for<00:03:27.349> that<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.769> now<00:03:27.829> I've<00:03:27.859> got<00:03:28.099> a<00:03:28.129> great

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
look for that and now I've got a great

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.089 
look for that and now I've got a great
reference<00:03:29.239> now<00:03:29.629> that<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.900> can<00:03:30.229> use<00:03:30.409> to<00:03:30.620> trace<00:03:31.069> my

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
reference now that I can use to trace my

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.089 
reference now that I can use to trace my
splines<00:03:32.000> when<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.239> create<00:03:32.599> this<00:03:32.780> geometry<00:03:33.169> so

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
splines when I create this geometry so

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.099 
splines when I create this geometry so
look<00:03:34.250> for<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.489> in<00:03:34.549> SolidWorks<00:03:35.109> 2014

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109
