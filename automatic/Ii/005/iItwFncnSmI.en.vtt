after<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.240> rainstorm<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.230> waters<00:00:16.619> warmed<00:00:17.040> up

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
after a rainstorm the waters warmed up

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.790 
after a rainstorm the waters warmed up
in<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:17.910> shallows<00:00:18.360> to<00:00:18.600> 62<00:00:19.110> degrees<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
in the shallows to 62 degrees out the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.240 
in the shallows to 62 degrees out the
main<00:00:19.980> lake<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.520> 58<00:00:21.380> main<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.619> being<00:00:22.920> seven

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
main lake it's 58 main like being seven

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.880 
main lake it's 58 main like being seven
feet<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.460> water<00:00:23.610> it's<00:00:24.060> quite<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.270> shallow<00:00:24.509> lake

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
feet of water it's quite a shallow lake

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.170 
feet of water it's quite a shallow lake
so<00:00:25.890> I'm<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.040> to<00:00:26.220> fish<00:00:26.369> probably<00:00:26.730> five<00:00:26.910> feet

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
so I'm going to fish probably five feet

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.310 
so I'm going to fish probably five feet
of<00:00:27.270> water<00:00:27.450> that's<00:00:27.599> where<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> found<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> warm

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
of water that's where I found the warm

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560 
of water that's where I found the warm
temperature<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:29.970> try<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.180> be

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
temperature so I'm going to try to be

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.630 
temperature so I'm going to try to be
I've<00:00:30.869> always<00:00:31.050> want<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> try<00:00:31.500> these<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.460> yellow

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I've always want to try these the yellow

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.350 
I've always want to try these the yellow
bird<00:00:32.940> side<00:00:33.269> planer<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.430> i'm<00:00:35.430> using<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.970> spinner

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
bird side planer and i'm using a spinner

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.660 
bird side planer and i'm using a spinner
with<00:00:36.629> a<00:00:36.660> leech<00:00:36.870> behind<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.970> little<00:00:39.590> boats

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
with a leech behind it so little boats

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.410 
with a leech behind it so little boats
by<00:00:41.670> fetal<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:43.580> and<00:00:44.580> they're<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.090> clip

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
by fetal I'm and they're going to clip

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.040 
by fetal I'm and they're going to clip
this<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.700> they<00:00:47.700> look<00:00:47.850> easy<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.300> TV<00:00:48.660> we'll<00:00:48.870> see

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
this on they look easy on TV we'll see

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.770 
this on they look easy on TV we'll see
how<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.500> work<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.980> me<00:00:50.040> here<00:00:53.750> seen<00:00:54.750> enough

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
how they work for me here seen enough

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
how they work for me here seen enough
fishing<00:00:55.200> shows<00:00:55.469> done<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.890> these<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.309> they

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
fishing shows done with these and they

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.400 
fishing shows done with these and they
were<00:00:56.460> successful<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> idea<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.610> that<00:01:00.410> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
were successful so the idea is that the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.319 
were successful so the idea is that the
noise<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.890> boat<00:01:02.070> might<00:01:02.340> cause<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> fish<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
noise the boat might cause the fish to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.109 
noise the boat might cause the fish to
fly<00:01:03.480> off<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> side<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.940> take

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
fly off to the side and this will take

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.139 
fly off to the side and this will take
the<00:01:06.270> hook<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.110> side<00:01:07.580> well<00:01:08.580> I'll<00:01:08.940> show

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
the hook out to the side well I'll show

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.490 
the hook out to the side well I'll show
you<00:01:09.210> how<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.479> works<00:01:09.720> once<00:01:10.110> again<00:01:10.259> I'm

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
you how this works once again I'm

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.600 
you how this works once again I'm
fishing<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.920> by<00:01:11.070> myself<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.820> bear<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.390> me

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
fishing here by myself so bear with me

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
fishing here by myself so bear with me
well<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.940> sat<00:01:15.149> on<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.360> wet<00:01:15.630> carpet<00:01:16.170> anyway

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
well I just sat on a wet carpet anyway

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.020 
well I just sat on a wet carpet anyway
so<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> idea<00:01:18.179> is<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:19.160> yellow<00:01:20.160> planar<00:01:20.700> board

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so the idea is that yellow planar board

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.639 
so the idea is that yellow planar board
out<00:01:21.179> there<00:01:21.390> takes<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:21.840> hook<00:01:22.020> away<00:01:22.319> from<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
out there takes my hook away from the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.480 
out there takes my hook away from the
boat<00:01:22.830> you'll<00:01:23.250> see<00:01:23.429> if<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.700> zoom<00:01:23.849> in<00:01:24.060> for

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
boat you'll see if I can zoom in for

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.589 
boat you'll see if I can zoom in for
looks<00:01:26.490> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> neat<00:01:26.910> and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.149> guess<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.450> idea

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:27.599 
looks kind of neat and I guess the idea

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.859 
looks kind of neat and I guess the idea
is<00:01:27.959> on<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.649> fish<00:01:28.830> bites<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.420> disconnect

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
is on the fish bites it will disconnect

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.969 
is on the fish bites it will disconnect
now<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> slide<00:01:31.470> down<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> fish<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.830> I'll

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
now to slide down to the fish so I'll

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.059 
now to slide down to the fish so I'll
just<00:01:35.009> cuts<00:01:35.940> along<00:01:36.270> I'd<00:01:37.229> love<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
just cuts along I'd love to see this

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.859 
just cuts along I'd love to see this
work<00:01:39.500> as<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.649> can<00:01:40.830> see<00:01:41.239> the<00:01:42.239> weather<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.720> not

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
work as you can see the weather is not

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.320 
work as you can see the weather is not
the<00:01:43.050> greatest<00:01:44.810> once<00:01:45.810> again<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.819> I<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.209> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.760 

you<00:01:59.510> can<00:01:59.630> see<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.020> fish<00:02:00.170> finder<00:02:00.380> with

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
you can see the fish finder with

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.590 
you can see the fish finder with

had I always had to tiller driven and
this<00:02:08.930> is<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> kind<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.590> cool<00:02:09.800> feature<00:02:10.130> I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
this is a kind of a cool feature I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
this is a kind of a cool feature I
thought<00:02:11.020> probably<00:02:12.020> old<00:02:12.380> technology<00:02:13.070> but

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
thought probably old technology but

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.120 
thought probably old technology but

this<00:02:31.490> might<00:02:31.700> work<00:02:31.880> after<00:02:32.330> all<00:02:32.360> we'll<00:02:32.720> see<00:02:37.209> fish

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
this might work after all we'll see fish
