00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hey guys what's up hi y'all doing today

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.190 
hey guys what's up hi y'all doing today
I<00:00:02.250> want<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.760> show<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.000> guys<00:00:03.120> my<00:00:03.200> four-way

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
I want to show you guys my four-way

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.410 
I want to show you guys my four-way
automatic<00:00:04.799> flying<00:00:05.040> machine<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.730> simple<00:00:06.330> eyes

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
automatic flying machine so simple eyes

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.200 
automatic flying machine so simple eyes
automatically<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.429> four<00:00:08.429> directions<00:00:08.519> front

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
automatically in four directions front

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.919 
automatically in four directions front
backwards<00:00:10.050> left<00:00:10.769> right<00:00:11.150> and<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.570> operates

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
backwards left right and it operates

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.900 
backwards left right and it operates
within<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> 12<00:00:13.620> block<00:00:13.980> push<00:00:14.309> limit<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.759> this

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
within the 12 block push limit so this

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.900 
within the 12 block push limit so this
is<00:00:15.179> vanilla<00:00:15.540> minecraft<00:00:16.250> it's<00:00:17.250> not<00:00:17.460> pandas<00:00:17.789> my

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
is vanilla minecraft it's not pandas my

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.590 
is vanilla minecraft it's not pandas my
jar<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.779> Minecraft<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.029> yeah<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.300> I

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
jar this is just Minecraft and yeah so I

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.460 
jar this is just Minecraft and yeah so I
have<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.470> four<00:00:22.650> way<00:00:22.740> flying<00:00:22.949> machine<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:24.470> so

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
have a four way flying machine here so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.259 
have a four way flying machine here so
right<00:00:25.859> right<00:00:26.430> off<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> bat<00:00:26.820> I'll<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.150> show

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
right right off the bat I'll just show

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.259 
right right off the bat I'll just show
you<00:00:27.300> guys<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.930> thing<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.260> action<00:00:29.179> I'm<00:00:30.179> going

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
you guys the thing in action I'm going

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.860 
you guys the thing in action I'm going
to<00:00:30.420> clone<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.019> right<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:32.480> some<00:00:33.480> rip<00:00:33.630> some

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to clone one in right here some rip some

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.200 
to clone one in right here some rip some
blocks<00:00:34.110> there<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.680> put<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.820> configure

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
blocks there to put it in to configure

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.950 
blocks there to put it in to configure
it<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.420> move<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.440> direction<00:00:38.840> update<00:00:39.840> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it to move in that direction update it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.010 
it to move in that direction update it
takes<00:00:40.350> off<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.420> standard<00:00:42.420> two<00:00:42.600> way<00:00:42.719> flying

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
takes off like a standard two way flying

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
takes off like a standard two way flying
with<00:00:43.200> flying<00:00:43.829> machine<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.360> a<00:00:45.360> lot<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.690> stuff

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
with flying machine and a lot of stuff

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.069 
with flying machine and a lot of stuff
is<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.230> happen<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.680> station<00:00:47.100> here

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.630 

and<00:00:54.079> there<00:00:54.260> we<00:00:54.350> go<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.680> thing<00:00:54.890> it's<00:00:55.309> turning

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
and there we go the thing it's turning

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.349 
and there we go the thing it's turning
90<00:00:55.910> degrees<00:00:57.550> some<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.730> theory<00:00:59.120> what<00:00:59.329> we

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
90 degrees some of the theory what we

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.420 
90 degrees some of the theory what we
could<00:00:59.600> do<00:00:59.719> is<00:00:59.870> have<00:00:59.899> like<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.769> know<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.190> same

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
could do is have like you know the same

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.459 
could do is have like you know the same
station<00:01:01.909> is<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:02.239> but<00:01:02.510> rotated<00:01:03.199> 90<00:01:03.440> degrees

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
station is this but rotated 90 degrees

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.710 
station is this but rotated 90 degrees
right<00:01:03.949> here<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.430> then<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.119> same<00:01:05.330> thing<00:01:05.540> again

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
right here and then the same thing again

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.710 
right here and then the same thing again
right<00:01:05.780> here<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.350> right<00:01:06.470> here

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.580 

I<00:01:09.940> couldn't<00:01:10.940> just<00:01:11.000> literally<00:01:11.570> rotate<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.470> with

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
I couldn't just literally rotate it with

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.180 
I couldn't just literally rotate it with
mcedit

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
mcedit

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.910 
mcedit
there's<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:14.360> thing<00:01:14.630> isn't<00:01:15.700> symmetrical<00:01:16.700> in

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
there's this thing isn't symmetrical in

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.160 
there's this thing isn't symmetrical in
on<00:01:18.920> like<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.850> diagonals<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:20.720> uh<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.780> yeah<00:01:24.110> you

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
on like the diagonals but uh so yeah you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.639 
on like the diagonals but uh so yeah you
could<00:01:24.380> just<00:01:24.440> now<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:24.890> can<00:01:25.069> have<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:26.649> 2d

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
could just now you can have you 2d

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.200 
could just now you can have you 2d
patterns<00:01:28.039> that<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:28.399> thing<00:01:28.610> moves<00:01:28.819> along<00:01:29.060> and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
patterns that this thing moves along and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.550 
patterns that this thing moves along and
stuff<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:29.569> some<00:01:29.720> line<00:01:29.929> backwards<00:01:30.229> and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
stuff is some line backwards and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.830 
stuff is some line backwards and
forwards<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.159> can<00:01:31.399> have<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:32.270> it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
forwards so you can have it it it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.940 
forwards so you can have it it it
doesn't<00:01:32.990> have<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.289> be<00:01:33.380> square<00:01:33.649> either<00:01:33.770> you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
doesn't have to be square either you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.219 
doesn't have to be square either you
could<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:34.159> it<00:01:34.250> forward<00:01:34.700> over<00:01:35.000> here<00:01:35.600> down<00:01:35.869> and

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
could do it forward over here down and

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.960 
could do it forward over here down and
then<00:01:36.500> set<00:01:36.860> it<00:01:36.950> back<00:01:37.069> that<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:37.399> grew<00:01:37.580> up<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.880> the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
then set it back that we grew up to the

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.120 
then set it back that we grew up to the
left<00:01:38.179> and<00:01:38.450> do<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.080> bigger<00:01:39.350> loop<00:01:39.590> or<00:01:39.770> something

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
left and do a bigger loop or something

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.760 
left and do a bigger loop or something
but<00:01:40.780> yeah<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:41.990> that's<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.319> idea<00:01:42.409> with<00:01:42.679> the

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
but yeah so that's the idea with the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.350 
but yeah so that's the idea with the
four-way<00:01:43.130> four-way<00:01:43.940> flowing<00:01:44.299> machine<00:01:44.659> here

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
four-way four-way flowing machine here

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.949 
four-way four-way flowing machine here
okay<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.420> now<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.470> wanted<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:48.950> talk<00:01:49.190> about<00:01:49.959> kind

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
okay so now I wanted to talk about kind

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.399 
okay so now I wanted to talk about kind
of<00:01:51.049> like<00:01:51.140> push<00:01:51.409> limits<00:01:51.619> or<00:01:53.020> why<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.080> thing<00:01:54.229> is

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
of like push limits or why this thing is

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.050 
of like push limits or why this thing is
possible<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.100> earlier<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.429> said<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.729> wasn't<00:01:55.909> I

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
possible and earlier I said it wasn't I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.160 
possible and earlier I said it wasn't I
guess<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> while<00:01:58.399> ago<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:59.060> was<00:01:59.869> tweeting

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
guess so a while ago I was tweeting

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.990 
guess so a while ago I was tweeting
about<00:02:00.350> proving<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.159> for<00:02:01.340> directional

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
about proving that for directional

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.450 
about proving that for directional
flying<00:02:02.240> machines<00:02:02.570> were<00:02:02.689> possible<00:02:03.280> within<00:02:04.280> the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
flying machines were possible within the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.270 
flying machines were possible within the
12<00:02:04.700> block<00:02:04.880> push<00:02:05.119> limit<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.079> I<00:02:06.439> thought<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:06.950> had

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
12 block push limit and I thought I had

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.219 
12 block push limit and I thought I had
a<00:02:07.310> proof<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:07.969> like<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> sort<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.600> half

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
a proof of that like a sort of half

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.060 
a proof of that like a sort of half
mathematical<00:02:10.009> half<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:11.959> don't<00:02:12.859> know<00:02:12.920> maybe

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
mathematical half I don't know maybe

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.590 
mathematical half I don't know maybe
I'll<00:02:13.250> post<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.489> video<00:02:13.700> with<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.180> proof<00:02:14.420> is

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
I'll post the video with the proof is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.270 
I'll post the video with the proof is
just<00:02:15.079> kind<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.410> elaborate<00:02:15.769> on<00:02:15.950> that

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
just kind of elaborate on that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.490 
just kind of elaborate on that
but<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.209> proof<00:02:17.390> relied<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.560> one<00:02:18.980> thing<00:02:19.519> about

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
but the proof relied on one thing about

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.319 
but the proof relied on one thing about
sign<00:02:21.500> machine<00:02:21.859> which<00:02:22.100> is<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.880> couldn't

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
sign machine which is that you couldn't

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.550 
sign machine which is that you couldn't
move<00:02:23.480> Pistons<00:02:24.049> around<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.560> them

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
move Pistons around on them

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.699 
move Pistons around on them
but<00:02:27.490> in<00:02:27.730> reality<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.240> easily<00:02:28.959> hand<00:02:29.200> at<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.470> you

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
but in reality you easily hand at it you

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.680 
but in reality you easily hand at it you
move<00:02:30.069> Pistons<00:02:30.459> around<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.790> station<00:02:31.209> there's<00:02:31.480> no

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
move Pistons around a station there's no

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.860 
move Pistons around a station there's no
reason<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:33.880> couldn't<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.450> guess

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
reason that you couldn't so what I guess

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.360 
reason that you couldn't so what I guess
I<00:02:38.020> took<00:02:38.080> away<00:02:38.410> from<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.650> was<00:02:38.800> maybe<00:02:39.100> there's

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
I took away from that was maybe there's

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.550 
I took away from that was maybe there's
a<00:02:39.430> way<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.300> move<00:02:40.420> Pistons<00:02:40.900> around<00:02:41.200> to

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
a way if I can move Pistons around to

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.830 
a way if I can move Pistons around to
make<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.740> four<00:02:42.010> directional<00:02:42.370> flying<00:02:42.880> four

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
make a four directional flying four

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.960 
make a four directional flying four
directional<00:02:44.170> sign<00:02:44.380> machine<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.880> guys

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
directional sign machine if you guys

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.670 
directional sign machine if you guys
remember<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.510> one<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.660> built<00:02:46.870> with<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.200> 16

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
remember the one I built with the 16

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.140 
remember the one I built with the 16
block<00:02:47.860> push<00:02:48.100> limit<00:02:48.430> what<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.700> did<00:02:48.910> was<00:02:49.060> I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
block push limit what I did was I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.120 
block push limit what I did was I
combined<00:02:49.480> two<00:02:49.630> two<00:02:50.050> directional<00:02:50.560> slam

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
combined two two directional slam

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.979 
combined two two directional slam
machines<00:02:51.459> that's<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.450> standard<00:02:52.840> two

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
machines that's a standard two

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.680 
machines that's a standard two
directional<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.530> machine<00:02:53.830> right<00:02:53.980> there<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.690> put

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
directional a machine right there I put

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.560 
directional a machine right there I put
two<00:02:55.840> on<00:02:55.870> top<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.230> each<00:02:56.410> other<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.010> in

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
two on top of each other you know in

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.240 
two on top of each other you know in
perpendicular<00:02:58.570> directions<00:02:58.989> so<00:02:59.560> it<00:03:00.040> could

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
perpendicular directions so it could

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.650 
perpendicular directions so it could
move<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.519> four<00:03:00.760> directions<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.360> then<00:03:01.480> just

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
move in four directions and then just

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.590 
move in four directions and then just
would<00:03:01.900> move<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.260> redstone<00:03:02.680> blocks<00:03:02.890> around<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
would move the redstone blocks around to

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.250 
would move the redstone blocks around to
switch<00:03:04.600> into<00:03:04.810> those<00:03:05.140> different<00:03:05.470> states<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:08.200> I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
switch into those different states but I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.410 
switch into those different states but I
couldn't<00:03:08.769> get<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.400> thing<00:03:09.670> small<00:03:10.120> enough

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
couldn't get this thing small enough

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.550 
couldn't get this thing small enough
without<00:03:10.630> making<00:03:11.620> these<00:03:12.010> two<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:14.140> two<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.530> a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
without making these two the two to a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.960 
without making these two the two to a
flying<00:03:14.980> machines<00:03:15.280> intersect<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:15.940> each

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
flying machines intersect with each

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.440 
flying machines intersect with each
other<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:18.760> whole<00:03:18.790> time<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.150> was<00:03:19.360> doing

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
other and the whole time I was doing

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.550 
other and the whole time I was doing
that<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.720> was<00:03:19.900> trying<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.170> keep<00:03:20.319> all<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
that I was trying to keep all the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.130 
that I was trying to keep all the
Pistons<00:03:21.120> attached<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.420> their<00:03:22.569> respective

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
Pistons attached to their respective

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.880 
Pistons attached to their respective
spaces<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.130> slime<00:03:24.310> components<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.739> what<00:03:26.860> I

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
spaces on the slime components so what I

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.360 
spaces on the slime components so what I
ended<00:03:27.130> up<00:03:27.220> doing<00:03:27.370> was<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:28.660> realized<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:30.340> I

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
ended up doing was I realized that I

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.710 
ended up doing was I realized that I
didn't<00:03:30.700> have<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:30.940> keep<00:03:31.060> them<00:03:31.269> where<00:03:31.420> they<00:03:31.540> were

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
didn't have to keep them where they were

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.060 
didn't have to keep them where they were
so<00:03:32.079> what<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.320> do<00:03:32.890> here<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.549> store<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:35.590> Pistons

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
so what I do here is I store the Pistons

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.370 
so what I do here is I store the Pistons
used<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:36.700> going<00:03:37.209> in<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.720> know<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.930> opposite

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
used for going in you know the opposite

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.920 
used for going in you know the opposite
direction<00:03:38.680> as<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.160> currently<00:03:39.340> facing<00:03:40.000> on

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
direction as it's currently facing on

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.630 
direction as it's currently facing on
the<00:03:41.079> bottom<00:03:41.410> side<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.860> move<00:03:42.070> them<00:03:42.250> into<00:03:42.370> place

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
the bottom side and move them into place

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.759 
the bottom side and move them into place
at<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.299> station<00:03:43.780> over<00:03:43.959> there<00:03:43.989> like<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.290> and

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
at a station over there like that and

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.819 
at a station over there like that and
yeah<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.910> allows<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.450> make<00:03:46.600> um<00:03:46.829> four

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
yeah that allows you to make um four

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.710 
yeah that allows you to make um four
directional<00:03:48.190> fly<00:03:48.370> machine<00:03:48.670> by<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.540> way<00:03:49.690> I

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
directional fly machine by the way I

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.270 
directional fly machine by the way I
apologize<00:03:50.049> for<00:03:50.500> my<00:03:50.650> voice<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.980> probably

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
apologize for my voice that probably

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.830 
apologize for my voice that probably
sounds<00:03:51.549> awful<00:03:51.910> I'm<00:03:52.000> I'm<00:03:52.390> really<00:03:52.630> sick<00:03:52.780> right

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
sounds awful I'm I'm really sick right

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.900 
sounds awful I'm I'm really sick right
now<00:03:53.049> but<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.470> didn't<00:03:53.680> want<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.890> cut<00:03:54.489> off<00:03:54.579> making

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
now but I didn't want to cut off making

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.890 
now but I didn't want to cut off making
this<00:03:55.000> another<00:03:55.269> day

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
this another day

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.530 
this another day
I<00:03:57.159> would<00:03:58.159> have<00:03:58.250> made<00:03:58.430> all<00:03:58.700> four<00:03:58.730> stations<00:03:59.209> as

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
I would have made all four stations as

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.229 
I would have made all four stations as
well<00:03:59.569> but<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.280> didn't<00:04:01.280> want<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.849> wait<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.000> few

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
well but I didn't want to wait a few

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.089 
well but I didn't want to wait a few
more<00:04:02.420> days<00:04:02.599> and<00:04:02.629> build<00:04:03.349> all<00:04:03.500> those<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:03.860> I'll

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
more days and build all those so I'll

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.380 
more days and build all those so I'll
just<00:04:04.220> release<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:04.700> thing<00:04:04.760> now<00:04:07.060> all<00:04:08.060> right<00:04:08.209> so

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
just release this thing now all right so

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.580 
just release this thing now all right so
the<00:04:08.510> last<00:04:08.780> thing<00:04:09.019> I<00:04:09.110> want<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.319> show<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.560> guys

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
the last thing I want to show you guys

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.729 
the last thing I want to show you guys
was<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.220> um<00:04:10.459> just<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.720> piston<00:04:12.170> layout<00:04:12.530> for

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
was just um just the piston layout for

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.550 
was just um just the piston layout for
the<00:04:12.829> station<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.340> have<00:04:13.519> over<00:04:13.790> there<00:04:14.560> because

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
the station I have over there because

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.830 
the station I have over there because
I've<00:04:16.310> tried<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.609> few<00:04:16.699> different<00:04:16.910> designs<00:04:17.600> with

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
I've tried a few different designs with

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.110 
I've tried a few different designs with
moving<00:04:18.350> Pistons<00:04:18.769> around<00:04:19.039> and<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.489> lot<00:04:19.789> of<00:04:19.970> them

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
moving Pistons around and a lot of them

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.840 
moving Pistons around and a lot of them
the<00:04:20.269> problem<00:04:20.630> once<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.979> stations<00:04:22.430> were<00:04:22.669> just

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
the problem once the stations were just

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.610 
the problem once the stations were just
so<00:04:23.090> complex<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.750> move<00:04:23.960> all<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.229> Pistons

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
so complex to move all the Pistons

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.980 
so complex to move all the Pistons
around

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
around

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.189 
around
so<00:04:26.990> yeah<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.620> design<00:04:27.979> ended<00:04:28.729> up<00:04:28.850> working<00:04:29.060> out

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.890 

what<00:04:33.199> I<00:04:33.320> do<00:04:33.380> oh<00:04:33.970> right<00:04:34.970> right<00:04:35.120> move<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.810> red

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
what I do oh right right move the red

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.800 
what I do oh right right move the red
sand<00:04:36.110> blocks<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.500> corners<00:04:36.800> first<00:04:37.810> so

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
sand blocks to the corners first so

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.150 
sand blocks to the corners first so
first<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.169> pull<00:04:39.350> down<00:04:39.380> those<00:04:39.650> Pistons<00:04:39.949> like

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
first you pull down those Pistons like

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.430 
first you pull down those Pistons like
that<00:04:40.720> pull<00:04:41.720> them<00:04:41.840> out<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.139> sides<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.490> then

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
that pull them out to the sides and then

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.260 
that pull them out to the sides and then
we<00:04:45.440> have<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.800> use<00:04:45.949> on<00:04:46.160> some<00:04:46.340> extenders<00:04:46.910> here<00:04:47.120> to

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
we have to use on some extenders here to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.270 
we have to use on some extenders here to
keep<00:04:47.419> these<00:04:47.690> sticky<00:04:48.320> pistons<00:04:48.710> out<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.130> way

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
keep these sticky pistons out of the way

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.800 
keep these sticky pistons out of the way
while<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.580> flies<00:04:49.729> in<00:04:50.090> or<00:04:50.210> out<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.599> station

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
while it flies in or out of the station

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.719 
while it flies in or out of the station
and<00:04:52.270> then<00:04:53.270> now<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:54.160> pistons<00:04:55.160> used<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.490> fly<00:04:55.669> in

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
and then now the pistons used to fly in

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:56.740 
and then now the pistons used to fly in
this<00:04:55.970> direction

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
this direction

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.689 
this direction
I've<00:04:57.110> been<00:04:57.380> moved<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.830> bottom<00:04:57.949> and<00:04:58.340> these

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
I've been moved to the bottom and these

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.150 
I've been moved to the bottom and these
ones<00:04:59.000> can<00:04:59.300> be<00:04:59.360> moved<00:04:59.630> to<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.780> top<00:04:59.949> so<00:05:00.949> to<00:05:01.010> do

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
ones can be moved to the top so to do

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.920 
ones can be moved to the top so to do
that<00:05:01.479> pretty<00:05:02.479> similar<00:05:02.990> way

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.040 

we<00:05:05.990> got<00:05:06.139> there<00:05:06.290> and<00:05:06.410> there<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:07.630> then<00:05:08.630> we<00:05:08.810> send

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
we got there and there and then we send

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.610 
we got there and there and then we send
one<00:05:09.320> two<00:05:09.530> pulses<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:11.840> these<00:05:11.960> Pistons<00:05:12.440> down

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
one two pulses to these Pistons down

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.379 
one two pulses to these Pistons down
here<00:05:12.919> I<00:05:13.790> did<00:05:14.180> not<00:05:14.449> send<00:05:14.690> it<00:05:15.050> else's<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.530> these

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
here I did not send it else's to these

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.670 
here I did not send it else's to these
ok<00:05:17.389> this<00:05:17.539> is<00:05:17.720> not<00:05:18.050> going<00:05:18.259> well<00:05:20.169> ok<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:21.229> remove

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
ok this is not going well ok so remove

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.580 
ok this is not going well ok so remove
the<00:05:21.860> Pistons<00:05:22.250> up<00:05:22.430> um<00:05:22.840> good<00:05:23.840> we<00:05:23.960> got<00:05:24.139> that<00:05:24.380> and

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
the Pistons up um good we got that and

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.890 
the Pistons up um good we got that and
then<00:05:24.759> let's<00:05:25.759> err<00:05:25.910> up<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.180> redstone<00:05:26.570> blocks

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
then let's err up the redstone blocks

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.050 
then let's err up the redstone blocks
are<00:05:27.110> just<00:05:27.289> moved<00:05:27.590> into<00:05:28.070> their<00:05:28.310> new<00:05:28.370> positions

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
are just moved into their new positions

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.219 
are just moved into their new positions
and<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:30.470> machine<00:05:30.710> can<00:05:30.860> be<00:05:30.949> started<00:05:31.190> up<00:05:32.229> there

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
and the machine can be started up there

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.249 
and the machine can be started up there
you<00:05:33.320> go<00:05:34.449> so<00:05:35.449> it<00:05:35.600> can<00:05:35.720> move<00:05:35.810> in<00:05:35.960> all<00:05:36.020> four

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
you go so it can move in all four

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.100 
you go so it can move in all four
directions<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:37.210> can<00:05:38.210> be<00:05:38.300> toggled<00:05:38.720> into<00:05:38.960> those

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
directions and can be toggled into those

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.020 
directions and can be toggled into those
directions<00:05:39.590> by<00:05:39.800> stationary<00:05:41.169> station<00:05:42.610> yeah<00:05:43.610> so

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
directions by stationary station yeah so

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.210 
directions by stationary station yeah so
or<00:05:45.020> directional<00:05:45.380> fly<00:05:45.530> machine<00:05:45.860> hope<00:05:46.010> you<00:05:46.100> guys
