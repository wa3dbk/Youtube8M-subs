a<00:00:32.790> police<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.050> none<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.260> these

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
a police is this is none of these

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.450 
a police is this is none of these
implications<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.309> say<00:00:35.430> what

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
implications but they don't say what

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.490 
implications but they don't say what
it's<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:37.079> give<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> little

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's for but they give you a little

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's for but they give you a little
clues<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.250> there<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.000> simply

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
clues here and there so this one simply

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600 
clues here and there so this one simply
said<00:00:39.750> we've<00:00:40.230> got<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.370> show<00:00:41.579> you

so<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.570> probably<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> fact<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.860> they

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
so it's probably not the fact that they

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040 
so it's probably not the fact that they
are<00:00:44.070> coming<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.789> ipad<00:00:45.120> mini<00:00:45.390> it's

end<00:03:31.630> because<00:03:32.019> you're<00:03:32.170> getting<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.590> lot<00:03:32.799> of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
end because you're getting a lot of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.190 
end because you're getting a lot of
storage<00:03:33.280> space<00:03:33.400> but<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.660> higher<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.019> go<00:03:35.170> up

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
storage space but the higher you go up

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.350 
storage space but the higher you go up
the<00:03:35.560> prices<00:03:35.799> start<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.250> match<00:03:36.519> apples<00:03:37.120> more

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
the prices start to match apples more

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.750 
the prices start to match apples more
evenly<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.110> as<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.769> colleague<00:03:39.190> here<00:03:39.519> says

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
evenly and as a colleague here says

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.520 
evenly and as a colleague here says
microsoft<00:03:40.150> at<00:03:40.660> this<00:03:40.810> point<00:03:41.019> doesn't<00:03:41.230> get<00:03:41.410> to

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
microsoft at this point doesn't get to

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.130 
microsoft at this point doesn't get to
charge<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.070> Apple<00:03:42.670> premium<00:03:43.120> well<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.870> and

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
charge the Apple premium well and and

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.800 
charge the Apple premium well and and
this<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.560> not<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.640> big<00:03:45.940> robust<00:03:46.420> pro

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
this is not the the big robust pro

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.140 
this is not the the big robust pro
version<00:03:47.260> either<00:03:47.380> this<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.910> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
version either this is this is the the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.060 
version either this is this is the the
consumer<00:03:49.600> version<00:03:49.750> yes<00:03:50.110> yeah<00:03:50.650> when<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.890> pro

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
consumer version yes yeah when the pro

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.949 
consumer version yes yeah when the pro
comes<00:03:51.340> out<00:03:51.549> later<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:52.000> year<00:03:52.060> it'll<00:03:52.600> probably

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
comes out later this year it'll probably

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.370 
comes out later this year it'll probably
go<00:03:53.470> even<00:03:53.769> higher<00:03:53.980> than<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.489> RT<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.989> expect

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
go even higher than the RT so expect

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.170 
go even higher than the RT so expect
prices<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.860> go<00:03:56.980> up<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.250> little<00:03:57.310> bit<00:03:57.519> more<00:03:57.670> but

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
prices to go up a little bit more but

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.390 
prices to go up a little bit more but
the<00:03:58.269> bigger<00:03:58.420> question<00:03:58.510> here<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.320> you<00:03:59.890> know<00:03:59.980> we

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
the bigger question here is you know we

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.880 
the bigger question here is you know we
haven't<00:04:00.580> gotten<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.000> see<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:02.080> functionality

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
haven't gotten to see the functionality

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.710 
haven't gotten to see the functionality
of<00:04:02.920> this<00:04:03.100> tablet<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.880> sounds<00:04:04.330> great<00:04:04.510> on<00:04:04.690> paper

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
it looks awesome and advertising but we

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.020 
it looks awesome and advertising but we
really<00:04:07.630> don't<00:04:07.720> know<00:04:07.870> how<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.170> works<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:09.160> like<00:04:09.910> I

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
really don't know how it works so like I

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.710 
really don't know how it works so like I
said<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.420> know<00:04:10.860> 500<00:04:11.860> for<00:04:12.640> 32<00:04:13.030> gigabytes<00:04:13.390> on<00:04:13.660> a

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
said you know 500 for 32 gigabytes on a

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.680 
said you know 500 for 32 gigabytes on a
bigger<00:04:14.470> screen<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:15.100> apples<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.060> good<00:04:16.419> deal

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
bigger screen and apples is a good deal

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.960 
bigger screen and apples is a good deal
but<00:04:17.229> this<00:04:17.410> thing<00:04:17.560> doesn't<00:04:17.859> work<00:04:18.010> then<00:04:18.489> you

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.160 
and I feel like that's kind of the
feature<00:04:46.090> that<00:04:46.360> we're<00:04:46.480> hearing<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.780> lot<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.930> buzz

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.850 
about because in one of the big
drawbacks<00:04:49.420> of<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.690> tablet<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.230> you<00:04:50.650> simply

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
drawbacks of the tablet is you simply

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.710 
soft cover this is what Apple currently
offers<00:05:11.980> and<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.370> think<00:05:12.610> this<00:05:12.730> is<00:05:12.790> similar<00:05:13.600> to

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
offers and I think this is similar to

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.930 
offers and I think this is similar to
what<00:05:14.050> we<00:05:14.140> can<00:05:14.320> expect<00:05:14.440> from<00:05:14.710> Microsoft<00:05:15.310> but

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
what we can expect from Microsoft but

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.010 
what we can expect from Microsoft but
basically<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.420> keyboard<00:05:16.720> will<00:05:16.810> be<00:05:16.900> on

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
basically the keyboard will be on

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.690 
basically the keyboard will be on
something<00:05:17.410> like<00:05:17.500> this<00:05:17.560> and<00:05:18.100> it'll<00:05:18.310> like

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
something like this and it'll like

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.700 
something like this and it'll like
