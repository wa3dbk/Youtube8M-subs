00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 although there is only more for the runner-up and the winner's prize goes against it 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.890
 Mattersburg stands with its back to the relegation rank 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.040
 at the PID stands a majority of the Starnberg crew are the means 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.129
 missing 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.309
 the last, so to speak 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.309
 with Mattersburg plays the weakest away team of the league 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.169
 but pay attention only one win in Hanappi Stadium would be the federal states 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.130
 that comes for him 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.199
 for the latter of the division is the first chance after one 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.310
 Error from Harding 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.310
 loses against March of biomes 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.380
 but the Burgenlaender these are the 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.380
 Duel strength of the team percent 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.430
 for Mattersburg and Wiener, the first possibility of the next action is 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
 good shot 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.410
 the whopping shot down to pop 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.110
 Last but not least 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.820
 then soon the tables off 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.320
 for Mattersburg 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.630
 Naumoski 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 has reports only reads the markets after previously 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 made a serious mistake 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.300
 the Burgenlanders 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.300
 the nature more dangerous team to the next 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.600
 possibility 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.060
 once again 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.070
 the list is hard and explains this goal 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.250
 allows Naumoski 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.680
 Here we see Startup because Naumoski can continue unchecked 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.640
 he looks march in the middle of the world 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 and that is the deserved leadership 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.110
 Patrick Döring Southampton Dix Mattersburg player 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.110
 out of its frame the wind 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.050
 After a short while, this makes it very clever then the ball to the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.750
 two Rapidlern over 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.170
 at the attentive keeper 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.909
 in front of this shot 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.809
 on the short corner 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.809
 Now it is still this perspective 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.550
 as once, both for Lunk to break Arnautovic chip also spectators in the 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.799
 Stadion 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.799
 can like that about the upcoming one 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.219
 pay nothing 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.219
 to the break changes 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.909
 every screen movies come instead of connections 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.059
 comes a little more movement in the tenth game 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.099
 Their youngest goalscorer equal his tenth goal of the season 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.979
 450 votes 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.179
 he was against 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:49.279
 is good he is the bidder Zion 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.649
 every ReachLocal 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:53.729
 he stayed with her 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:55.659
 not really anymore 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.349
 1 2 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.349
 the game 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.019
 in Birkenau had the next round 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.640
 get Economy CEO and chassis the best option was on 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.269
 was on it 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.529
 but mostly three years ago 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.149
 the to the EHC 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:26.119
 Bayer shoot » 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:27.839
 achieved 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.839
 stay until then 1 2 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.709
 Mishap form the Jena Nadal 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.069
 then learns there 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.589
 rapid-i Lamparter electric motors 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.649
 2 2 1 guidance 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:44.379
 her sixtieth minute 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.699
 renewed leadership for Mattersburg 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.729
 we see that this does not happen comes the teaching at the RUB congestion 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.119
 again a number of bordeaux-body Perneker's attack 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.559
 shoot the 2 2 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.369
 Matthias now puts a lot of pressure on the right side 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.149
 more impetuous 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:15.329
 until ex-mattersburger and that means penalty in Celle decided nevertheless 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.259
 not do 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.669
 Here I really do not have bad over the counter the highlights 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 3 2 1 for YB 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.189
 this seems like a preliminary decision 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:35.029
 Steinbeis Business 76 minutes thanks to this free kick 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.370
 gradually the game makes it exciting again 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.430
 a serious mistake 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.990
 that you tore the module 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.460
 and he misses the ball 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.520
 thanks 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.520
 and shoot the connection hit 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:54.129
 three to two for him for the market 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.090
 Rapid also has the final phase 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.279
 good moments 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.689
 Ottokar feel 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.580
 here is beautiful 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.370
 was shortly thereafter 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.259
 but over the gate 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.369
 he accompanies her differently, the Freud was hindered 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.499
 for the flank of teachers 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.360
 but kick-off b-final Renchtal 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.360
 Mattersburg until 17 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.520
 to the 2
