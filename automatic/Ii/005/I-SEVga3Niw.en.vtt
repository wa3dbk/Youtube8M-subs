00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
there's two locks on the side of the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.770 
there's two locks on the side of the
battery<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:01.760> make<00:01:02.090> sure<00:01:02.120> y'all<00:01:02.360> unlock<00:01:02.600> them

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
battery so make sure y'all unlock them

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.760 
battery so make sure y'all unlock them
and<00:01:02.930> pull<00:01:03.080> it<00:01:03.230> out<00:01:08.170> now<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.440> screws<00:01:09.740> are

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
and pull it out now that the screws are

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.100 
and pull it out now that the screws are
gone<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.460> could<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:10.880> pretty<00:01:11.540> much<00:01:11.720> open<00:01:12.020> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
gone you could just pretty much open the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.000 
gone you could just pretty much open the
panel<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.450> what<00:01:14.450> you'll<00:01:14.570> find<00:01:14.630> inside<00:01:15.230> is<00:01:15.500> the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
panel and what you'll find inside is the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.270 
panel and what you'll find inside is the
memory<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.540> SSD<00:01:18.500> hard<00:01:18.740> drive<00:01:19.070> right

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
memory and the SSD hard drive right

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.600 
memory and the SSD hard drive right
above<00:01:19.670> it<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:21.110> memory<00:01:21.410> is<00:01:21.500> held<00:01:21.800> by<00:01:22.550> two

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
above it the memory is held by two

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.000 
above it the memory is held by two
latches<00:01:23.120> one<00:01:23.630> on<00:01:23.780> each<00:01:23.930> side<00:01:23.960> left<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:24.740> right

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
latches one on each side left and right

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.870 
latches one on each side left and right
so<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:25.790> just<00:01:26.270> use<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.450> screw<00:01:26.750> driver<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:27.880> unlock

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
so I just use a screw driver to unlock

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.560 
so I just use a screw driver to unlock
the<00:01:29.120> latches<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:31.729> pops<00:01:32.030> right<00:01:32.180> back<00:01:32.360> up

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
the latches and it pops right back up

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.790 
the latches and it pops right back up
and<00:01:33.100> pull<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.220> out<00:01:34.720> easy<00:01:35.720> as<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.229> that's<00:01:36.560> the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
and pull it out easy as that that's the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.620 
and pull it out easy as that that's the
old<00:01:37.190> memory<00:01:38.470> so<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.950> on<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.970> left<00:01:41.180> it's<00:01:41.479> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
old memory so and on the left it's the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.750 
old memory so and on the left it's the
new<00:01:41.780> memory<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.410> right<00:01:42.619> it's<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.190> old<00:01:43.369> memory

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
new memory the right it's the old memory

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.790 
new memory the right it's the old memory
you<00:01:46.760> pretty<00:01:47.210> much<00:01:47.390> should<00:01:47.630> do<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.290> same<00:01:48.500> thing

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
you pretty much should do the same thing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.070 
you pretty much should do the same thing
pop<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.280> back<00:01:49.310> in<00:01:49.580> place<00:01:49.820> make<00:01:50.780> sure<00:01:50.930> it's

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
pop it back in place make sure it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.920 
pop it back in place make sure it's
securely<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:52.100> there<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.979> push<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.010> down<00:01:55.160> and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
securely in there and push it down and

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.960 
securely in there and push it down and
the<00:01:56.930> latch<00:01:57.170> will<00:01:57.200> lock<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.860> back<00:01:58.010> in<00:02:00.670> that's<00:02:01.670> it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
the latch will lock it back in that's it

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.919 
the latch will lock it back in that's it
you<00:02:02.210> have<00:02:02.420> new<00:02:02.899> memory<00:02:03.289> in<00:02:03.440> there<00:02:04.630> now<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.660> put

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
you have new memory in there now you put

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.859 
you have new memory in there now you put
the<00:02:06.140> cover<00:02:06.560> back<00:02:06.860> on<00:02:07.300> make<00:02:08.300> sure<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.630> holes

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
the cover back on make sure the holes

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.710 
the cover back on make sure the holes
are<00:02:09.140> facing<00:02:09.679> or<00:02:09.890> right<00:02:10.610> above<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.120> screw

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
are facing or right above the screw

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.470 
are facing or right above the screw
holes<00:02:13.960> there's<00:02:14.960> little<00:02:15.290> plastic<00:02:16.480> things

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480

holes there's little plastic things
sticking<00:02:17.990> out<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.590> panel<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.480> make<00:02:20.480> sure

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
sticking out of this panel so make sure

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.410 
sticking out of this panel so make sure
those<00:02:20.840> are<00:02:21.050> popped<00:02:21.320> in<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:22.190> it'll<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.180> fall

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
those are popped in and it'll just fall

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:47.770 
those are popped in and it'll just fall
right<00:02:23.450> back<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:24.370> screw<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.460> back<00:02:25.610> on

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.200 

now<00:02:48.350> put<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.130> battery<00:02:49.490> back<00:02:49.580> in<00:02:49.760> all<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.180> have

to do is slide it in place make sure you
lock<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:54.370> by<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.430> way<00:02:55.640> only<00:02:55.850> one<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.390> locks

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
lock it by the way only one of the locks

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.260 
lock it by the way only one of the locks
actually<00:02:57.350> slide<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.430> lock<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.880> other<00:02:59.030> one

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
actually slide to lock the other one

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.110 
actually slide to lock the other one
snaps<00:03:00.020> back<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:01.730> have<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.940> lock

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
snaps back in so you just have to lock

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.080 
snaps back in so you just have to lock
one<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.720> other<00:03:02.870> ones<00:03:03.020> always<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.680> locking

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
one the other ones always in a locking

00:03:04.090 --> 00:04:28.550 
one the other ones always in a locking
position<00:03:10.480> turn<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.600> back<00:03:11.750> on

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.120 

so<00:04:29.560> it's<00:04:29.920> now<00:04:30.190> booting<00:04:30.700> up<00:04:31.770> I'm<00:04:32.770> gonna<00:04:32.950> show

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
so it's now booting up I'm gonna show
