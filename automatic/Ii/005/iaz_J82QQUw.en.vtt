00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.560 
I thought these bolts had to come off
and<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.240> knocked<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.839> them<00:00:07.049> off<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:08.040> now

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570

material because you don't want to weld

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.300 
material because you don't want to weld
that<00:00:17.910> because<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.390> pink<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:20.010> will<00:00:20.160> make

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310

you sick so you have to knock that off
before<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.650> weld<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.420> with<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> grinder<00:00:24.900> it's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
before you weld it with a grinder it's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.349 
before you weld it with a grinder it's
just<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> spot<00:00:26.519> weld<00:00:26.760> not<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> big

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
just going to be a spot weld not a big

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.240 
just going to be a spot weld not a big
deal<00:00:27.599> I'm<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.650> preheat<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.039> with

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
deal I'm going to preheat it with

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.130 
deal I'm going to preheat it with
propane<00:00:29.640> before<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> start<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> make<00:00:31.019> it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
propane before I start just to make it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.610 
propane before I start just to make it
go<00:00:31.260> easier<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:31.800> my<00:00:32.809> my<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:34.140> welder<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
go easier because my my little welder is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:01:32.060 
go easier because my my little welder is
pretty<00:00:34.860> wimpy

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.150 

so<00:01:33.070> it's<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.620> it<00:01:35.680> October<00:01:36.030> 17th<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.270> I

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
so it's what is it October 17th and I

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.870 
so it's what is it October 17th and I
got<00:01:39.160> my<00:01:40.530> hub<00:01:41.530> or<00:01:41.980> at<00:01:42.100> least<00:01:42.250> one<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.550> my<00:01:42.610> hubs

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
got my hub or at least one of my hubs

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.380 
got my hub or at least one of my hubs
made<00:01:43.120> drill<00:01:43.540> four<00:01:44.230> holes<00:01:44.460> took<00:01:45.460> forever<00:01:45.850> each

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
made drill four holes took forever each

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.530 
made drill four holes took forever each
hole<00:01:46.630> took<00:01:46.870> about<00:01:47.050> an<00:01:47.230> hour<00:01:47.320> because<00:01:47.740> my<00:01:48.540> it's

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
hole took about an hour because my it's

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.040 
hole took about an hour because my it's
stealing<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:50.170> card<00:01:50.620> I<00:01:50.890> guess<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:52.660> my<00:01:52.780> drill

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
stealing a card I guess and my drill

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.359 
stealing a card I guess and my drill
press<00:01:53.080> probably<00:01:53.650> isn't<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.310> best<00:01:55.300> but<00:01:56.250> got<00:01:57.250> it

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
press probably isn't the best but got it

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.170 
press probably isn't the best but got it
done<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.110> here<00:01:59.710> was<00:01:59.890> that<00:01:59.920> my<00:02:01.440> for<00:02:03.180> Grade

done and here was that my for Grade
eight<00:02:04.260> steel<00:02:05.260> bolts<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.130> here<00:02:06.670> we<00:02:06.820> have<00:02:07.030> my

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
eight steel bolts and here we have my

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.380 
eight steel bolts and here we have my
hub<00:02:07.570> with<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.990> holes<00:02:08.170> drilled<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.240> way<00:02:10.360> I

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
hub with the holes drilled and the way I

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.770 
hub with the holes drilled and the way I
got<00:02:10.660> these<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:11.020> line<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:13.120> stuck<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.570> on

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
got these to line up is I stuck this on

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:28.630 
got these to line up is I stuck this on
here<00:02:17.910> made<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> mark<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.770> corresponding<00:02:20.770> mark

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.930 

I'm<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.940> use<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.239> punch<00:02:31.640> which<00:02:32.640> just

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
I'm going to use the punch which just

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.250 
I'm going to use the punch which just
fits<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:35.430> mark<00:02:36.709> inside<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.080> could

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
fits to mark inside so that I could

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.229 
fits to mark inside so that I could
drill<00:02:40.440> those<00:02:40.590> out<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.940> got<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> little

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
drill those out I just got a little

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.880 
drill those out I just got a little
holes<00:02:42.569> on<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> side<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.349> then<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.560> flipped<00:02:43.769> it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
holes on the side and then I flipped it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.890 
holes on the side and then I flipped it
over<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.280> drill<00:02:44.459> from<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.790> side<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.690> one

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
over and drill from this side and one

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.740 
over and drill from this side and one
thing<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.819> you<00:02:47.819> find<00:02:48.120> out<00:02:48.360> when<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.630> do

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
thing you can you find out when you do

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.259 
thing you can you find out when you do
this<00:02:50.510> aluminum<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.750> much<00:02:52.380> much<00:02:53.040> much<00:02:53.550> softer

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
this aluminum is much much much softer

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.030 
this aluminum is much much much softer
than<00:02:54.390> steel<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.840> aluminum<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.530> drills<00:02:58.799> so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
than steel the aluminum just drills so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.280 
than steel the aluminum just drills so
easy<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.640> too<00:03:00.599> easy<00:03:00.840> really

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
easy and too easy really

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.190 
easy and too easy really
and<00:03:01.500> also<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.890> realize<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:03.200> material

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
and also you realize that this material

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.050 
and also you realize that this material
this<00:03:04.530> wheel<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.920> made<00:03:04.950> from<00:03:06.049> really<00:03:07.049> thin<00:03:08.060> so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
this wheel is made from really thin so

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.440 
this wheel is made from really thin so
if<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.269> had<00:03:09.390> any<00:03:09.569> thoughts<00:03:09.599> about

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
if you had any thoughts about

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.569 
if you had any thoughts about
countersinking<00:03:12.450> these<00:03:12.720> holes<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
countersinking these holes so that the

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.750 
countersinking these holes so that the
bolts<00:03:15.329> will<00:03:15.569> are<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.840> nuts<00:03:16.230> will<00:03:16.530> be<00:03:17.430> flush

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
bolts will are the nuts will be flush

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.660 
bolts will are the nuts will be flush
you<00:03:18.299> can<00:03:18.450> forget<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:20.010> instead<00:03:20.370> what<00:03:20.549> I'm

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
you can forget it so instead what I'm

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
you can forget it so instead what I'm
going<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.819> do<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.030> I'm<00:03:21.150> going<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.299> get<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.450> piece

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
going to do is I'm going to get a piece

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.920 
going to do is I'm going to get a piece
of<00:03:21.870> pipe<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.849> sort<00:03:23.849> of<00:03:23.940> cut<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> little<00:03:24.299> wedge

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
of pipe and sort of cut a little wedge

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.890 
of pipe and sort of cut a little wedge
shaped<00:03:25.349> piece<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:26.040> act<00:03:26.760> as<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> kind<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.390> washer

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
shaped piece to act as a kind of washer

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.140 
shaped piece to act as a kind of washer
there<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.380> guess

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
there I guess

00:03:29.150 --> 00:04:47.359 
there I guess
so<00:03:30.150> anyway<00:03:30.540> let's<00:03:30.959> see<00:03:31.170> how<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.440> goes<00:03:31.620> together

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:47.369 

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:54.479 

so<00:04:48.369> there<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.699> is<00:04:50.399> more<00:04:51.399> or<00:04:51.489> less<00:04:51.519> together<00:04:53.489> so

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:54.489 
so there it is more or less together so

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:57.599 
so there it is more or less together so
that's<00:04:54.699> more<00:04:55.389> is<00:04:55.569> that
