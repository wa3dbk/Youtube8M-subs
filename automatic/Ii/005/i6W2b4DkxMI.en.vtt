500 with these extra features and a 560

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.610 
500 with these extra features and a 560
is<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.610> same<00:01:40.820> as<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.030> 510<00:01:41.720> with<00:01:42.020> these<00:01:42.200> extra

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.860 
is the same as a 510 with these extra
features<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:43.610> which<00:01:43.790> unit<00:01:44.150> is<00:01:44.270> right<00:01:44.480> for<00:01:44.720> you

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
features so which unit is right for you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.530 
features so which unit is right for you
that's<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.860> tough<00:01:46.010> question<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:47.330> course

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
that's a tough question of course

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.390 
that's a tough question of course
everybody<00:01:47.900> wants<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.410> 56<00:01:48.920> eats<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.280> most

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
everybody wants the 56 eats the most

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.180 
everybody wants the 56 eats the most
expensive<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.090> has<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.300> most<00:01:50.510> features<00:01:51.190> but

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
expensive and has the most features but

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.970 
expensive and has the most features but
maybe<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.550> doesn't<00:01:52.850> fit<00:01:53.000> into<00:01:53.120> your<00:01:53.210> budget

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
maybe that doesn't fit into your budget

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.140 
maybe that doesn't fit into your budget
so<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.100> first<00:01:55.250> extra<00:01:55.700> feature<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.060> you'll

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
so the first extra feature that you'll

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.410 
so the first extra feature that you'll
find<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.570> 560<00:01:57.260> in<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.440> 550<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.970> AOPA
