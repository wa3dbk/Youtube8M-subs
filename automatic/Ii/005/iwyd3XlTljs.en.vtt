and you're not gonna be able to get
double<00:00:50.960> his<00:00:51.079> face<00:00:51.730> yeah<00:00:52.730> but<00:00:53.329> it's<00:00:53.750> double<00:00:54.110> its

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
double his face yeah but it's double its

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.439 
double his face yeah but it's double its
the<00:00:54.559> amps<00:00:54.920> on<00:00:55.070> e<00:00:55.100> running<00:00:55.489> on<00:00:55.610> 40<00:00:55.879> descent<00:00:56.210> i

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
the amps on e running on 40 descent i

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.630 
the amps on e running on 40 descent i
can<00:00:56.960> double<00:00:57.140> i<00:00:57.379> can<00:00:57.559> more<00:00:57.739> than<00:00:57.769> double<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.309> and

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
can double i can more than double it and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.040 
can double i can more than double it and
these<00:00:58.850> subs<00:00:59.149> or<00:00:59.300> handle<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.659> so<00:00:59.839> that's

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
these subs or handle it so that's

00:01:00.050 --> 00:02:00.420 
these subs or handle it so that's
fucking<00:01:00.530> ridiculous<00:01:00.680> man

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:29.350 

David<00:02:01.430> gone<00:02:08.890> like<00:02:09.890> yeah<00:02:10.130> with<00:02:10.369> all<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
David gone like yeah with all the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:03:11.509 
David gone like yeah with all the
panel's<00:02:29.720> flexing<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.930> hey<00:02:32.930> Tommy

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.300 

I'm<00:03:12.519> going<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.790> set<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> gains<00:03:13.390> now<00:03:13.780> air<00:03:14.769> gains

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
I'm going to set the gains now air gains

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.610 
I'm going to set the gains now air gains
hurt<00:03:15.849> all<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.420> frequencies<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.379> shit

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
hurt all the frequencies and I like shit

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.580 
hurt all the frequencies and I like shit
I<00:03:17.829> never<00:03:18.220> before<00:03:18.549> roughly<00:03:19.140> pretty<00:03:20.140> close<00:03:20.379> to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
I never before roughly pretty close to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.869 
I never before roughly pretty close to
where<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.739> wanted<00:03:21.040> them<00:03:21.099> so<00:03:21.310> I'm<00:03:21.579> going<00:03:21.849> to

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
where I wanted them so I'm going to

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.729 
where I wanted them so I'm going to
double<00:03:22.090> check<00:03:22.269> now<00:03:22.659> get<00:03:23.019> in<00:03:23.140> here<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.530> do<00:03:23.709> it

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
double check now get in here and do it

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.619 
double check now get in here and do it
perfectly<00:03:24.280> look<00:03:25.150> at<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.329> people

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
perfectly look at that people

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.949 
perfectly look at that people
instruction<00:03:26.170> manual<00:03:26.470> got<00:03:27.060> such<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.090> woman<00:03:28.450> so

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
instruction manual got such a woman so

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.660 
instruction manual got such a woman so
this<00:03:29.349> has<00:03:29.500> got<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> lot<00:03:29.709> more<00:03:29.860> features<00:03:30.280> than<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
this has got a lot more features than a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.220 
this has got a lot more features than a
standard<00:03:31.060> amp<00:03:31.239> which<00:03:31.480> would<00:03:31.690> only<00:03:31.870> have<00:03:32.110> your

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
standard amp which would only have your

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.289 
standard amp which would only have your
subsonic<00:03:32.530> low<00:03:32.769> pass<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.819> gain<00:03:34.030> and

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
subsonic low pass and you gain and

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.750 
subsonic low pass and you gain and
that's<00:03:34.420> about<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:35.170> also<00:03:35.349> has<00:03:35.739> a<00:03:36.010> frequency

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
that's about it it also has a frequency

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.610 
that's about it it also has a frequency
that<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.420> can<00:03:37.569> actually<00:03:37.690> choose<00:03:38.079> where<00:03:38.590> you

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
that you can actually choose where you

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.649 
that you can actually choose where you
want<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.129> be<00:03:39.159> like<00:03:39.269> centralized<00:03:40.269> at<00:03:40.510> like

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
want it to be like centralized at like

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.569 
want it to be like centralized at like
the<00:03:40.750> actual<00:03:41.019> frequency<00:03:41.170> you<00:03:41.530> want<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.950> to

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
the actual frequency you want it to to

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.640 
the actual frequency you want it to to
perform<00:03:42.939> best<00:03:43.209> at<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:44.049> have<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> bandwidth

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
perform best at you have the bandwidth

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.949 
perform best at you have the bandwidth
and<00:03:44.920> then<00:03:45.129> obviously<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.519> boost<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.090> normal

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
and then obviously the boost so normal

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.050 
and then obviously the boost so normal
ones<00:03:47.140> never<00:03:47.409> every<00:03:47.859> amps<00:03:48.400> in<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.640> have<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:48.760> boost

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
ones never every amps in to have a boost

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.930 
ones never every amps in to have a boost
and<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.599> level<00:03:50.170> subsonic<00:03:50.829> low-pass<00:03:51.250> phase<00:03:51.670> and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
and a level subsonic low-pass phase and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.539 
and a level subsonic low-pass phase and
all<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.209> but<00:03:52.840> not<00:03:53.170> many<00:03:53.379> apps<00:03:53.560> none<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.430> the

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
all that but not many apps none of the

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.839 
all that but not many apps none of the
ones<00:03:54.639> i've<00:03:54.849> used<00:03:55.120> or<00:03:55.329> had<00:03:55.510> lately<00:03:56.639> they've<00:03:57.639> had

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
ones i've used or had lately they've had

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.119 
ones i've used or had lately they've had
a<00:03:57.879> frequency<00:03:58.450> or<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.569> bandwidth<00:03:59.049> so<00:03:59.440> that's

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
a frequency or a bandwidth so that's

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.369 
a frequency or a bandwidth so that's
pretty<00:04:00.280> good<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.930> loving<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.079> bass<00:04:02.200> control

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
pretty good and loving the bass control

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.220 
pretty good and loving the bass control
knob<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:03.700> it's<00:04:03.940> telling<00:04:04.329> me<00:04:04.359> when<00:04:04.599> it's<00:04:04.780> just

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
knob like it's telling me when it's just

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.960 
knob like it's telling me when it's just
clipping<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.950> everything<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.370> does<00:04:06.400> the

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
clipping and everything it does the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.430 
clipping and everything it does the
green<00:04:07.389> light<00:04:07.599> when<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.900> tells<00:04:08.049> you<00:04:08.200> just

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
green light when it tells you just

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.080 
green light when it tells you just
clipping<00:04:08.769> I<00:04:09.040> just<00:04:09.280> turn<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.609> down<00:04:09.730> just<00:04:09.790> one

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
clipping I just turn it down just one

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.940 
clipping I just turn it down just one
little<00:04:10.329> bit<00:04:10.569> it's<00:04:11.019> got<00:04:11.200> things<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.620> even<00:04:11.769> if

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
little bit it's got things that even if

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.830 
little bit it's got things that even if
the<00:04:12.159> amps<00:04:12.340> getting<00:04:12.579> too<00:04:12.670> hot<00:04:12.879> not<00:04:13.450> once<00:04:13.659> did

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
the amps getting too hot not once did

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.259 
the amps getting too hot not once did
ago<00:04:14.079> it<00:04:14.319> was<00:04:14.470> always<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.739> green<00:04:15.040> which<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.459> means

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
ago it was always a green which is means

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.930 
ago it was always a green which is means
it's<00:04:16.479> perfect<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.470> fine<00:04:17.650> not<00:04:18.340> once<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.699> even

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
it's perfect it's fine not once it even

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.390 
it's perfect it's fine not once it even
yellow<00:04:19.389> red<00:04:20.049> means<00:04:20.260> it's<00:04:20.500> completely<00:04:21.099> you

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
yellow red means it's completely you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.250 
yellow red means it's completely you
know<00:04:21.430> way<00:04:22.090> too<00:04:22.150> hot<00:04:22.449> or<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:23.020> it's<00:04:23.139> pretty

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
know way too hot or so it's pretty

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.430 
know way too hot or so it's pretty
decent<00:04:23.740> i'm<00:04:23.830> pretty<00:04:24.039> happy<00:04:24.160> of<00:04:24.400> that
