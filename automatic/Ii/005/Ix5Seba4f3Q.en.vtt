00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.479 
allow this system is a single xeon
processor<00:04:10.849> you<00:04:11.849> can<00:04:12.150> fit<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.890> dual<00:04:13.890> processor

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
processor you can fit a dual processor

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.920 
processor you can fit a dual processor
system<00:04:14.819> together

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.930 

and<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.620> course<00:04:18.650> we<00:04:19.039> can<00:04:19.190> add<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.310> lot<00:04:19.489> more<00:04:19.549> ram

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
and of course we can add a lot more ram

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.440 
and of course we can add a lot more ram
if<00:04:20.720> required

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
if required

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.450 
if required
or<00:04:22.990> if<00:04:23.200> you<00:04:23.290> just<00:04:23.320> want<00:04:23.620> something<00:04:23.770> basic<00:04:24.280> like

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
or if you just want something basic like

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.360 
or if you just want something basic like
a<00:04:24.640> micro<00:04:25.120> HX<00:04:25.480> mobile<00:04:25.810> board<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.100> single

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
a micro HX mobile board and a single

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.780 
a micro HX mobile board and a single
standard<00:04:28.240> desktop<00:04:28.450> processor<00:04:29.460> this<00:04:30.460> can<00:04:30.670> be

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
standard desktop processor this can be

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.790 
standard desktop processor this can be
done<00:04:30.910> also<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.810> there<00:04:35.170> you<00:04:35.230> have<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.680> X

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
done also so there you have it the X

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.180 
done also so there you have it the X
case<00:04:36.160> RM<00:04:37.000> 208

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.700 

and<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.910> little<00:04:43.060> system<00:04:43.480> builder<00:04:43.810> thanks<00:04:44.560> for

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
and the little system builder thanks for

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.010 
and the little system builder thanks for
listening
