00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.760
 hi to all guys and well found in 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.850
 a new video to make me put me 2013 or 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.220
 of five finally with a new test 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.130
 so I waited until today why 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.920
 finally today as surely many 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.380
 know the new needle carts have come out 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.910
 obviously the randazzo you tell me but 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.660
 he had not said he was no longer in fashion 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.610
 he had said, however, let's say that I am suitable 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950
 I took this as a last in the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.070
 sense ok I still do something though 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.949
 let me not just copy you 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.579
 still decided send around the coaches and bla 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.749
 blah blah our here to tell you everything 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.909
 well then we also surrounded ourselves with 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:55.890
 excellent tractors of course always made 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:58.249
 from him and we publish here for the wagons 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.229
 as you can see we have three versions 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:06.240
 we are with different colors but it is always 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:08.370
 we go back to the domex 700 and I must say that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.760
 they are made really well as you see 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.030
 even from behind they almost seem 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.150
 almost as real as you can see 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.430
 let's say assis mia c behind we are 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.130
 also well done is not that they are wheels 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 throw it away as many seas are months old 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.820
 other wagons 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.600
 we also say the set say i 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.980
 small tubes oil ilaria and anything else 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.800
 we go to connect and that obviously 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.380
 since after they move now I will do 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.350
 see later with liz hook cohabiting 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.180
 they are all the same, they change only a little 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.330
 textures that I have to say are made 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.540
 just as well then anyway we'll go to 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:56.130
 see load a little bit right too 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.290
 to see a little what we say what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.320
 contain when downloading what 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.110
 it happens etc. etc. brothers 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.750
 club written also in other e 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.610
 brothers randazzo rossano 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.790
 so not even close enough 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.050
 in my part I would say good to go to the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.050
 first tractor like this 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.400
 then all good if you flashing 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.930
 it works so they work both 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.310
 of the tractor and that of the wagon 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.019
 wait ok then as you see when you do 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.650
 maneuvers to find us anything else 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.599
 turn on the right ones respectively 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.430
 lights so now it 's doing 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.090
 reverse individual lights of the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.879
 reverse gear 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.879
 then here you see ie brake lights 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.480
 the four arrows that it had gen 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.480
 also say the sound but this is it 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.420
 plus any direction arrows 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.290
 let's say let's leave the dust 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.810
 to the dust cans up is to the tractor 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.000
 that the dog in this case is for the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.520
 first version does not stick out then 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.270
 will also be made say those that 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.760
 get dirty from 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:28.010
 let's say from what we say I heard 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.200
 as you see also internally see 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.780
 that there are these almost like symbols 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.270
 you are not even sides and they are really 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.490
 let's say for the welds that come 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.770
 made when the wagon is made then 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.550
 and I must say that it really is very much 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.770
 real these is there now is using 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.890
 this but three are the same forgotten 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.440
 so I present 1 of them reporting everything 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.270
 how much also on the others the wheels 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.200
 I have to say that they are very much done 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.450
 well and that when it turns televoting you are 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.750
 without problems that are jerky to 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.880
 blows or things turn so slowly 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.620
 they too now go home like this 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.950
 there should be something in the silos and 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.220
 let's go load now I don't know 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.350
 exactly the capacity they have but 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.930
 had anyone leave anyway later 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.320
 it says just read around first 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.130
 time you do that you use the iii bec 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.550
 download in and see let's say how much 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.550
 how much they hold 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.140
 obviously if you want johns to say enough 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.400
 go let's say in my channel i did 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.590
 a video presentation where it is 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.250
 original language in download here 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.040
 something else I ask of you indeed 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.790
 I ask you, I tell you, please avoid 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.660
 move them to other sites or things like that 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.660
 just avoid various incazzature here 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.730
 now I never remember here at home that 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.460
 both 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.289
 Oh well 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.910
 forgive me if I had kids they had 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.819
 just explained this map directions 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.590
 I still don't use it even though I tried to 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.759
 also test a little for the series is 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.069
 forgot to even tell you that 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.900
 obviously the headlights work when 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.639
 they are also turned on behind dear 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.250
 so it's really one hundred percent real 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:25.080
 a hundred now let's get under the first one 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:28.319
 silos also fills well that sense 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.380
 also well textured inside 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:34.410
 we are at 50 percent we are at 15 then 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.820
 capacity of 30,000 if not 50 per 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:42.270
 15 percent and double 15 15 plus 15 fa30 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.849
 therefore then 30,000 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.199
 now let's go and download them there 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.199
 we turn in the court 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.110
 as you see also done very well too 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:11.820
 let's say the cylinder piston we say 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:14.700
 door up let's say the tub is also a lot 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.140
 slow that I like to say why it is 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.000
 much more rare are the crowds in two 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.920
 seconds they empty themselves while 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.540
 this takes us a while and this is it 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:27.450
 more real well I would say that also for 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.060
 this video is everything as you have seen 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.090
 that are made more than good downloadable 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.360
 from the 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.460
 from original monster link download there 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.860
 are two links 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.750
 I used second because it is used 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.130
 I think nothing changes 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.790
 here is now finished to close a lot 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.520
 well then i would say that for that too 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.550
 video is all from mark 95 all thanks 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.840
 still go for these wonderful fashions and 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:01.389
 I hope that people respect you and 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.169
 and anything else hello to everyone next time 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.169
 Hello
