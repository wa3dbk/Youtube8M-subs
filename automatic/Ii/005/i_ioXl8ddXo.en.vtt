00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
that can go on a screen is the next leap

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.200 
that can go on a screen is the next leap
from<00:00:12.960> 1080p<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:14.040> has<00:00:14.490> been<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> dominant

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
from 1080p that has been the dominant

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
issues that we have with our current

issues that we have with our current
screens<00:00:22.020> making<00:00:22.949> entertainment<00:00:23.220> more

immersive<00:00:24.050> productivity<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.260> through<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
immersive productivity go through the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.070 
immersive productivity go through the
roof<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.980> simply<00:00:26.640> make<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.150> go<00:00:27.300> wow<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
roof and simply make you go wow this is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.740 
roof and simply make you go wow this is
the<00:00:28.199> future<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.710> there<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.010> nothing<00:00:29.550> better

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
the future and there is nothing better

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.500 
the future and there is nothing better
so<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> question<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.279> true<00:00:32.700> then

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so the question is if this is true then

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510 
so the question is if this is true then
why<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.410> believe<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> four<00:00:35.010> case<00:00:35.219> shouldn't

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
why do I believe the four case shouldn't

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.090 
why do I believe the four case shouldn't
be<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> future<00:00:36.210> standard<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.559> what

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
be the future standard and if so what

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.000 
be the future standard and if so what
could<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.370> propose<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.210> superior<00:00:39.800> we<00:00:40.800> used

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
could I propose that is superior we used

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.639 
could I propose that is superior we used
to<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.370> four<00:00:41.910> by<00:00:42.059> three<00:00:42.090> monitors<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.469> then

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
to have four by three monitors we then

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.500 
to have four by three monitors we then
had<00:00:43.829> sixteen<00:00:44.160> by<00:00:44.280> 10<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.180> quickly

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
had sixteen by 10 this is quickly

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.299 
had sixteen by 10 this is quickly
followed<00:00:45.870> by<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.230> current<00:00:46.739> standard<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
followed by the current standard of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
followed by the current standard of
sixteen<00:00:47.640> by<00:00:47.760> nine<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> question<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.230> why

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
sixteen by nine so the question is why

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
sixteen by nine so the question is why
would<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.620> ever<00:00:49.890> stop<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.280> sixteen<00:00:50.610> by<00:00:50.760> nine<00:00:50.789> if

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
would we ever stop at sixteen by nine if

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.689 
would we ever stop at sixteen by nine if
wider<00:00:51.840> screens<00:00:52.260> keep<00:00:52.680> providing<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.370> more

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
wider screens keep providing a more

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.490 
wider screens keep providing a more
pleasurable<00:00:54.090> experience<00:00:54.780> does<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> mean<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
pleasurable experience does it mean that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.049 
pleasurable experience does it mean that
sixteen<00:00:55.860> by<00:00:55.980> nine<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.399> actually<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
sixteen by nine is actually just the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.319 
sixteen by nine is actually just the
perfect<00:00:57.600> aspect<00:00:58.410> ratio<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.460> then<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> wider

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
perfect aspect ratio and then the wider

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.020 
perfect aspect ratio and then the wider
would<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:01.050> less<00:01:01.530> immersive<00:01:02.160> providing<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
would be less immersive providing a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.270 
would be less immersive providing a
degraded<00:01:03.660> viewing<00:01:04.019> experience<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.710> that's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
degraded viewing experience as that's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
degraded viewing experience as that's
the<00:01:05.400> only<00:01:05.729> reason<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.330> could<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the only reason that I could see that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.109 
the only reason that I could see that
would<00:01:07.530> warrant<00:01:08.040> stopping<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.610> sixteen<00:01:08.939> by

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
would warrant stopping at sixteen by

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.289 
would warrant stopping at sixteen by
nine<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.380> answer<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.860> no<00:01:11.340> turning<00:01:11.939> behind

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
nine and the answer is no turning behind

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179 
nine and the answer is no turning behind
is<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.960> next<00:01:13.200> step<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.710> sixteen<00:01:14.040> by<00:01:14.159> nine

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
is the next step up from sixteen by nine

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.640

two<00:01:46.740> eyes<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.920> are<00:01:47.430> side<00:01:47.610> by<00:01:47.640> side<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
two eyes that are side by side and it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.770 
two eyes that are side by side and it
gives<00:01:48.840> us<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:49.320> wide<00:01:50.070> field<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.700> vision<00:01:50.850> one

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
gives us a very wide field of vision one

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
gives us a very wide field of vision one
where<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> horizontal<00:01:52.799> field<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.250> view<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.610> far

where a horizontal field of view is far

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 
where a horizontal field of view is far
larger<00:01:54.450> than<00:01:54.720> our<00:01:54.960> vertical<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.100> why

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
larger than our vertical so why

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.710 
larger than our vertical so why
shouldn't<00:01:56.610> technology<00:01:57.210> harness<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.840> fact

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
shouldn't technology harness this fact

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.540 
shouldn't technology harness this fact
so<00:01:59.320> where<00:01:59.530> does<00:01:59.650> 4k<00:01:59.980> fit<00:02:00.190> into<00:02:00.340> this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
so where does 4k fit into this

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.090 
so where does 4k fit into this

pixels by 2160 pixels but my argument is
that<00:02:10.780> resolution<00:02:11.290> isn't<00:02:11.770> what's<00:02:12.160> most

that resolution isn't what's most

important is is lovely to have a greater

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
pixel density but what I strongly
