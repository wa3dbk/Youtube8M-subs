itself<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> left-click<00:00:41.910> button

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
itself with the left-click button

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
itself with the left-click button
left-click<00:00:42.899> actually<00:00:43.559> swings<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> spear<00:00:44.370> in

kind<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> slash<00:00:45.660> motion<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.920> isn't

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
kind of like a slash motion which isn't

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
kind of like a slash motion which isn't
very<00:00:47.340> effective<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> spear<00:00:48.420> itself

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
very effective with the spear itself

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
very effective with the spear itself
you're<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.379> getting<00:00:50.160> much<00:00:50.280> damage

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
gonna try to jump and get that head

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.080 
gonna try to jump and get that head
stabbed<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.390> quick<00:01:49.729> obviously<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> head

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
stabbed really quick obviously the head

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.760 
stabbed really quick obviously the head
stab<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.750> rewarding<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.619> also

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
stab is more rewarding but it's also

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.649 
stab is more rewarding but it's also
more<00:01:53.070> challenging<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> get<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> hit<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.600> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
more challenging to get the hit so I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.270 
more challenging to get the hit so I
kind<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.110> stick<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> lower

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
kind of just stick with that a lower

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.120 
kind of just stick with that a lower
stab<00:01:56.750> usually<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> lower<00:01:58.049> stab<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.920> kill

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
stab usually the lower stab I can kill

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.950 
stab usually the lower stab I can kill
anyone<00:01:59.399> between<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.180> three<00:02:00.329> hits<00:02:00.689> it's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
anyone between one and three hits it's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.959 
anyone between one and three hits it's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
kind of a Campbell archers are usually

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.030 
kind of a Campbell archers are usually
kills<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.299> one<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.990> nights<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> usually<00:02:04.829> takes

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
kills in one but nights it usually takes

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.709 
kills in one but nights it usually takes
three<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.670> band<00:02:05.850> guards<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.420> anywhere

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
three and band guards it's anywhere

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.260 
three and band guards it's anywhere
between<00:02:06.780> two<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.560> three<00:02:07.640> but<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.910> also<00:02:09.060> got

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
between two to three but you also got

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.240 
between two to three but you also got
taken<00:02:09.599> their<00:02:09.780> health<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.410> sometimes<00:02:11.099> they're

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
taken their health so sometimes they're

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
taken their health so sometimes they're
really<00:02:11.400> low<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.610> health<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.300> doesn't

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
really low on health and just doesn't

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.800 
really low on health and just doesn't
take<00:02:12.660> many<00:02:12.870> at<00:02:12.989> all

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
take many at all

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.869 
take many at all
also<00:02:15.810> movement<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.890> big<00:02:17.159> factor<00:02:17.639> in<00:02:17.670> this

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
also movement is a big factor in this

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.179 
also movement is a big factor in this
game<00:02:17.969> for<00:02:18.569> all<00:02:18.749> classes<00:02:19.079> especially<00:02:19.799> when

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
game for all classes especially when

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.729 
game for all classes especially when
you're<00:02:20.340> playing<00:02:20.489> as<00:02:20.639> a<00:02:20.670> spear<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.469> you<00:02:22.469> really

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
you're playing as a spear one you really

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.429 
you're playing as a spear one you really
want<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.069> use<00:02:23.189> your<00:02:23.430> reach<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:25.049> can<00:02:25.079> reach

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
want to use your reach you can reach

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.679 
want to use your reach you can reach
further<00:02:25.709> than<00:02:25.889> most<00:02:26.280> classes<00:02:26.849> with<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.359> long

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
further than most classes with this long

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.569 
further than most classes with this long
spear<00:02:28.139> it's<00:02:28.379> got<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:28.859> really<00:02:29.219> good<00:02:29.370> reach

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
spear it's got really really good reach

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.339 
spear it's got really really good reach
with<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.969> so<00:02:30.389> you<00:02:30.450> can<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.840> get<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:30.989> stab

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
with it so you can kind of get that stab

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.259 
with it so you can kind of get that stab
and<00:02:31.500> they<00:02:31.560> can't<00:02:31.739> even<00:02:31.920> touch<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:33.060> only

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
and they can't even touch you the only

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.479 
and they can't even touch you the only
thing<00:02:33.629> I<00:02:34.290> would<00:02:34.349> say<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.829> careful<00:02:35.159> about<00:02:35.280> is

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
thing I would say be careful about is

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.709 
thing I would say be careful about is
the<00:02:35.609> archers<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.209> don't<00:02:36.389> wonder<00:02:36.569> one

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
the archers you don't wonder one

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.899 
the archers you don't wonder one
straight<00:02:37.319> at<00:02:37.500> them<00:02:37.859> you<00:02:38.400> actually<00:02:38.549> want<00:02:38.879> to

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
straight at them you actually want to

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.490 
straight at them you actually want to
kind<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.180> go<00:02:39.299> like<00:02:39.329> kind<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.930> sideways<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
kind of go like kind of sideways a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.229 
kind of go like kind of sideways a
zigzag<00:02:41.010> motion<00:02:41.219> it's<00:02:41.639> really<00:02:41.879> hard<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
zigzag motion it's really hard to get a

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.119 
zigzag motion it's really hard to get a
hit<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.749> close<00:02:43.049> while<00:02:43.499> you're<00:02:43.650> zigzagging

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
hit that close while you're zigzagging

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.830 
hit that close while you're zigzagging
so<00:02:44.579> just<00:02:44.730> kind<00:02:44.879> of<00:02:44.939> zigzag<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:45.750> then

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
so just kind of zigzag up there and then

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.470 
so just kind of zigzag up there and then
just<00:02:46.049> stab<00:02:46.260> them<00:02:46.409> I'm<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:47.219> it's<00:02:47.969> this<00:02:48.359> is
