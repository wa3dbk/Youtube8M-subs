00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
with a list of bugs they came across and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.530 
with a list of bugs they came across and
features<00:03:25.400> they<00:03:25.549> think<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.849> should<00:03:26.090> be<00:03:26.150> added

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
features they think that should be added

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.020 
features they think that should be added
in<00:03:26.659> before<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.530> beta<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.949> released<00:03:28.459> now<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
in before the beta is released now the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.249 
in before the beta is released now the
reason<00:03:29.209> we<00:03:29.419> are<00:03:29.540> doing<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.840> closed<00:03:30.310> alpha

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:32.259 
reason we are doing a closed alpha

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.610 
reason we are doing a closed alpha
groups<00:03:33.259> is<00:03:33.500> because<00:03:33.919> we<00:03:34.669> think<00:03:34.939> they<00:03:35.090> could

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
groups is because we think they could

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.979 
groups is because we think they could
give<00:03:36.620> us<00:03:36.739> more<00:03:36.949> ideas<00:03:37.400> in<00:03:37.729> a<00:03:38.419> controlled

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
give us more ideas in a controlled

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.670 
give us more ideas in a controlled
environment<00:03:39.259> rather<00:03:40.040> than<00:03:40.189> releasing<00:03:40.879> it<00:03:41.180> all

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
environment rather than releasing it all

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.719 
environment rather than releasing it all
to<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.799> masses<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.729> then<00:03:44.090> having<00:03:44.919> so<00:03:45.919> much<00:03:46.310> to

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
to the masses and then having so much to

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.599 
to the masses and then having so much to
process<00:03:46.939> and<00:03:47.449> filter<00:03:47.810> through<00:03:48.079> that<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:49.189> lot<00:03:49.489> of

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
process and filter through that a lot of

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.729 
process and filter through that a lot of
it<00:03:49.729> won't<00:03:49.970> be<00:03:50.239> things<00:03:50.569> that<00:03:50.659> could<00:03:51.290> get<00:03:51.439> added

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
it won't be things that could get added

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.879 
it won't be things that could get added
but<00:03:52.489> yeah<00:03:52.879> anyways<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.509> the<00:03:54.439> reason<00:03:54.590> we<00:03:54.769> are

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
but yeah anyways and the reason we are
