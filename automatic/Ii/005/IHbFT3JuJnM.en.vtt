now I'm going to show you the next step

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.810 
now I'm going to show you the next step
I'm<00:01:03.710> going<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:03.920> take<00:01:04.100> them<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.399> I'm<00:01:04.519> going<00:01:04.759> to

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
I'm going to take them and I'm going to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.819 
I'm going to take them and I'm going to
pour<00:01:05.030> them<00:01:05.149> on<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:05.509> baking<00:01:05.990> sheet<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:06.530> I've

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
pour them on this baking sheet that I've

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.360 
pour them on this baking sheet that I've
lined<00:01:06.860> with<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> nonstick<00:01:07.640> aluminum<00:01:08.210> foil<00:01:09.370> and

lined with a nonstick aluminum foil and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.399 
lined with a nonstick aluminum foil and
so<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:10.670> next<00:01:10.850> step<00:01:11.330> is<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.720> take<00:01:11.870> a<00:01:12.049> potato

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
so the next step is to take a potato

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.680 
so the next step is to take a potato
masher<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.070> just<00:01:13.360> gently<00:01:14.360> mash<00:01:15.260> them<00:01:16.690> like

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:48.810 
next step is to drizzle them with olive
oil<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.770> now<00:01:47.979> we're<00:01:48.100> going<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.310> sprinkle<00:01:48.520> some
