00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Hi there, this is the seventh issue of reviews 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.720
 mods for minecraft 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.530
 today we have for camping mode you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.620
 dreamed of always spending in nature 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.520
 your vacation in this cubic world is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.470
 it became possible there is not even necessary 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.080
 bother and show you a short 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.449
 because at the very beginning you are issued 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.060
 such a book in which it is told 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.610
 basically everything is how to make every bonfire 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.690
 which a little later and actually how 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:43.489
 make a tent yes all craft true here 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 noticed bogda op op weird why 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:53.879
 for some reason will not change the way yes 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:57.360
 interesting there is no sky but it remains 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.270
 just weird okay so we're sick 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.449
 5 fires proper bonfire 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.820
 who does nothing at all just 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.080
 a fire is burning from the stoves which in which 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.580
 you can cook yourself 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 6 slots for cooking where to put fuel 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 and with 6 slots for output also we have 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.570
 blue fire in which only one 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.939
 slot for cooking on which as again 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.829
 He is called that this chamfer kir that is 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:37.610
 fast cooking is a fire with two 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.790
 slots which is prepared from enders 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.600
 these enders like them and render render 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.600
 render render render 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.980
 Ender pearls 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.290
 so what's going on with my memory 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.080
 it has two slots and doesn't need fuel 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.160
 he is very good at that 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:03.650
 but I will try to bank at least 4 enders 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.890
 that's the last bonfire I don't know what he 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.080
 does because in this book is very 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.190
 very fine print and read almost 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.880
 impossible but at least i can't 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.120
 him open nothing to say in 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:26.270
 comments on what to do with it 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:31.580
 can we make the tent itself 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:36.590
 I want so damn that's actually we can 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:41.680
 make a stand and bed put it 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.680
 bed and quietly sleep here 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.540
 strange here so well and actually 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.400
 putting a fire 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.420
 so we can quietly spend the night so 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:01.100
 same in this fashion there 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.959
 bags they are built from now i will show 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.049
 what material is actually from 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:10.519
 This fabric material are built on 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:13.160
 so here but but they are laid out as 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.630
 stove crafting every subsequent backpack 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.790
 built exactly the same that is 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.890
 laying out of cloth like a stove build 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.049
 but at the same time put the previous backpack 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.049
 three types of backpack is itself 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.840
 first small second medium and 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:34.100
 big you can oddly enough 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:38.930
 put the items here as before 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.060
 In principle, everything but I also forgot to 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.310
 enjoy the sweet life you can 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.100
 craft cotton candy yes where it is and yes and 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.760
 armor 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:58.600
 that's what this mod adds by the way here I am 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:01.170
 I fry it then most likely it matter 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.530
 is well 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.260
 yes this is for this fire nothing 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.190
 need he immediately roasts give him and not 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.110
 need neither fuel just anything right 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.750
 mouse button now I check even if 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.810
 Stuckey Come 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.970
 ladies jarrett and stakami this is very 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:27.150
 interesting discovery by the way 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.170
 it turns out even very profitable to 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.600
 principle on this all 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.120
