00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
going to have a little bit of a problem

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.960 
going to have a little bit of a problem
in<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.290> next<00:03:21.530> version<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.890> android<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.760> last

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
in the next version of android this last

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.580 
in the next version of android this last
week<00:03:23.209> he<00:03:23.510> said<00:03:23.720> it's<00:03:23.870> going<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.140> be<00:03:24.260> just<00:03:24.290> a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
week he said it's going to be just a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.599 
week he said it's going to be just a
little<00:03:24.620> bit<00:03:24.859> harder<00:03:25.250> than<00:03:25.280> he<00:03:25.519> originally

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
little bit harder than he originally

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.880 
little bit harder than he originally
envisioned<00:03:26.420> okay<00:03:27.260> so<00:03:27.319> here's<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.859> deal

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
envisioned okay so here's the deal

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.680 
envisioned okay so here's the deal
originally<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:28.730> was<00:03:28.850> known<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.420> next

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
originally it was known that the next

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.210 
originally it was known that the next
version<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.079> android<00:03:30.230> would<00:03:30.650> restrict<00:03:31.040> how

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
version of android would restrict how

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.220 
version of android would restrict how
apps<00:03:31.459> interacted<00:03:32.120> with<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.359> data<00:03:32.600> partition

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
apps interacted with the data partition

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.050 
apps interacted with the data partition
and<00:03:33.350> thus<00:03:33.650> would<00:03:33.859> require<00:03:34.190> root<00:03:34.459> apps<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.910> work

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
and thus would require root apps to work

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.910 
and thus would require root apps to work
around<00:03:35.359> it<00:03:35.510> however<00:03:36.079> this<00:03:36.380> week<00:03:36.560> we<00:03:36.709> also

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
around it however this week we also

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.650 
around it however this week we also
learned<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.549> number<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.850> other<00:03:38.120> under<00:03:38.540> the

root apps some may think it's a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.460 
root apps some may think it's a
conspiracy<00:03:44.239> theory<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.870> kill<00:03:45.079> off<00:03:45.200> root

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
conspiracy theory to kill off root

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.809 
conspiracy theory to kill off root
access<00:03:45.680> but<00:03:46.130> when<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.340> look<00:03:46.519> at<00:03:46.639> what's

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
access but when you look at what's

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.340 
access but when you look at what's
actually<00:03:46.970> going<00:03:47.329> on<00:03:47.510> it's<00:03:47.780> simply<00:03:48.079> Google

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
actually going on it's simply Google

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.930 
actually going on it's simply Google
making<00:03:48.650> Android<00:03:49.040> more<00:03:49.220> secure<00:03:49.609> and<00:03:49.639> that

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
making Android more secure and that

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.309 
making Android more secure and that
means<00:03:50.150> things<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.480> root<00:03:50.750> access<00:03:50.930> will

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
means things like root access will

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.900 
means things like root access will
