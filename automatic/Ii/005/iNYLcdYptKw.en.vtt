00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.920
 you have to start but our dear 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.020
 windows 7 and when accessing the desktop os 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.190
 you have found the unpleasant 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.040
 surprise that your gadget us 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.990
 appear and where they were previously 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.060
 you have repeatedly made that button 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.340
 right over the gadget option of 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.689
 desk and continue to appear well 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.570
 this tutorial would learn in a way 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.220
 Quick and easy how to show again 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.680
 your desktop data 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.920
 we started the first thing we have to 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.989
 do is verify that making equipment 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.079
 with right on the taskbar of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.829
 windows 7 and choose the start option 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.350
 to the task manager in the tab 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.890
 processes appears sidebar service 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.199
 point excel in my case like the lights and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.300
 that go well for me to see that yes 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.610
 the process appears I will drag a gadget 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.710
 to my desk to see that 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.210
 indeed it appears in your case 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.320
 This is basically you can not do 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.750
 because the process has to be there 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.930
 but the gases from where they do not owe you 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.700
 work then as you see when 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.909
 I drag a gadget over the desk 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.979
 the sidebar exe process appears 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.840
 if this process you have it first thing 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.520
 we have to do is finalize it for 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.890
 it selects the process and now 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.869
 The process ends the process 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.719
 and with this now it will be completely 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.689
 closed then once we have done 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:40.340
 this step the next step is to go to 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:42.140
 start typing cmd and run the console 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.579
 in administrator mode for that what 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.170
 you have to do is right button on 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.840
 cmd run as administrator 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.210
 then we click on yes what 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.070
 we will achieve with this is that if you do not 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.840
 start the windows console with the 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.700
 administrator permissions to be able 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.680
 perform the following steps 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.530
 then the first two we have already 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.310
 done the next step is to insert in 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.189
 the terminal 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.280
 these three commands to repair the 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.709
 files that need the expenses of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.450
 desk and so make it work 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.099
 we usually paste we carry a enter 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.080
 this will not be a small window that 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.900
 It has been performed correctly 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.390
 registry 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.659
 then the next command is more than 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.390
 same these commands or leave in the 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.159
 Video description for that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.579
 are copies of and so they are more 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:39.340
 simple do not have to type by hand 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.590
 well and with this is the last as you see 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.680
 all three have been registered correctly 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.709
 and now the only thing left for us to do 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.750
 is to restart our team to 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.459
 verify that the operation of the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.769
 gadgets you can go back to be the right one and 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.950
 works correctly so for that 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.250
 very easy 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.989
 we click on start the little arrow is 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.989
 and restart so far 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.560
 perfect then once you have 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.700
 rebooted your equipment and you have 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.150
 logged in 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.790
 we will see that indeed 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.730
 gadgets reappear if you continue 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.860
 having the same problem as having 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.780
 rebooted and your gadgets are still 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.700
 appear on the desk tell me 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.280
 because I have other solutions in mind 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.200
 that I can give you to see if with these and 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.269
 solve is definitely the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.590
 problem that your gases do not 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.230
 appear on the desktop just as 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.989
 you had formerly before saying goodbye 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.530
 week and the next I imagine that not 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.290
 I could do new tutorials 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.510
 basically for the simple fact that the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.510
 next week I have to do 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.340

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.340

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.710
 and learn me in conditions and such for 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.380
