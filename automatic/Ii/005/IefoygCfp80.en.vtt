00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so the first thing I'm going to show you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.770 
so the first thing I'm going to show you
our<00:01:36.960> trees<00:01:37.590> every<00:01:38.340> three<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.299> parkour

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
our trees every three you can do parkour

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.800 
our trees every three you can do parkour
on<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.560> literally<00:01:41.100> every<00:01:41.369> freaking<00:01:42.270> tweeted

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
on so literally every freaking tweeted

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.359 
on so literally every freaking tweeted
and<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:43.350> trees<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.829> course<00:01:43.860> because

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and not these trees of course because

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.760 
and not these trees of course because
these<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.810> these<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.259> trees<00:01:46.740> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
these are I'm think these are trees that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.569 
these are I'm think these are trees that
got<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:48.329> spawned<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:50.070> how<00:01:50.430> they

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
got just spawned with and with how they

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.850 
got just spawned with and with how they
call<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.939> again<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.750> spot<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> normal

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
call it again just a spot like a normal

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.200 
call it again just a spot like a normal
tree<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.070> micro<00:01:53.430> everybody<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.119> bit

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
tree of micro everybody got a little bit

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.440 
tree of micro everybody got a little bit

every<00:02:00.990> tree<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:02.100> parkour<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.729> everyt

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
every tree you can do parkour and everyt

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
every tree you can do parkour and everyt
we<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.960> which<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.680> awesome

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
we can get up which is really awesome

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490 
we can get up which is really awesome
you<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.790> also<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:07.020> thing<00:02:07.079> over

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
you can also get up on this thing over

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.290 
you can also get up on this thing over
here<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.129> too<00:02:08.250> sure<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.090> in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
here I'm not too sure what this it's in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.750 
here I'm not too sure what this it's in
like<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> small<00:02:10.289> finish<00:02:10.679> over<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> think<00:02:11.580> or

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
like a small finish over here I think or

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.949 
like a small finish over here I think or
yeah

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
yeah

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.080 
yeah
-<00:02:13.079> sure<00:02:13.230> well<00:02:13.439> this<00:02:13.680> there's<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.069> cave<00:02:14.909> over

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
- sure well this there's a cave over

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.369 
- sure well this there's a cave over
here<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> pretty<00:02:15.689> big<00:02:15.959> map<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.349> you

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
here it's a pretty big map as you

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.039 
here it's a pretty big map as you
probably<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:17.010> probably<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.909> tell<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:19.019> I

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
probably can probably can tell so I

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.110 
probably can probably can tell so I
would<00:02:19.260> suggest<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:19.650> repetitive<00:02:20.159> at<00:02:20.700> least

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
would suggest you repetitive at least

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.089 
would suggest you repetitive at least
six<00:02:21.450> people's<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.989> best<00:02:22.260> played<00:02:22.560> with<00:02:22.590> seven

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
six people's the best played with seven

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.770 
six people's the best played with seven
or<00:02:23.189> eight<00:02:23.370> people<00:02:23.579> and<00:02:24.030> even<00:02:24.329> though<00:02:24.569> you're

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
or eight people and even though you're

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.119 
or eight people and even though you're
playing<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.319> eight<00:02:25.590> people<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:26.010> would

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
playing it with eight people it would

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.619 
playing it with eight people it would
probably<00:02:26.340> take<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.879> really<00:02:27.000> long<00:02:27.359> time

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
probably take you a really long time

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.559 
probably take you a really long time
before<00:02:27.859> um<00:02:28.859> like<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.180> are<00:02:30.239> only<00:02:30.269> two

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
before um like like there are only two

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.420 
before um like like there are only two
people<00:02:30.719> left<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.319> when<00:02:31.439> ones<00:02:31.769> are<00:02:31.920> two<00:02:32.129> people

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
people left and when ones are two people

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.170 
people left and when ones are two people
left<00:02:32.579> it<00:02:32.849> will<00:02:32.969> probably<00:02:33.209> take<00:02:33.510> even<00:02:34.379> longer

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
left it will probably take even longer

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.789 
left it will probably take even longer
so<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.209> think<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.109> will<00:02:37.379> take<00:02:37.590> you

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
so I think that this will take you

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.780 
so I think that this will take you
around<00:02:37.920> 15<00:02:38.609> to<00:02:39.439> 20<00:02:40.439> minutes<00:02:40.859> before<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.370> to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
around 15 to 20 minutes before you to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.699 
around 15 to 20 minutes before you to
cut<00:02:42.000> everyone<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.079> big<00:02:43.260> village

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
cut everyone and this the big village

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.640 
cut everyone and this the big village
and<00:02:43.980> wow<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.970> looks<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.239> awesome<00:02:45.689> I'm<00:02:46.290> I

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500 
and wow it looks really awesome I'm I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
personally can't build that great

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.509 
personally can't build that great
