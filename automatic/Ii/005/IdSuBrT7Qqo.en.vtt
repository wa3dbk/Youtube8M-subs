about<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> lot<00:01:52.439> harder

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560

personally you know like I've talked
about<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:15.990> few<00:03:16.200> times<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.620> think<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.100> black<00:03:17.280> ops

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
about a few times I think the black ops

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.810 
about a few times I think the black ops
1<00:03:17.700> engine<00:03:18.060> engine<00:03:19.040> engine<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.310> sounds<00:03:20.790> like

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
1 engine engine engine it sounds like

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.080 
1 engine engine engine it sounds like
I'm<00:03:20.940> saying<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.390> Indian<00:03:22.310> engine<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:23.670> uh<00:03:23.700> I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
I'm saying in Indian engine but uh I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.150 
I'm saying in Indian engine but uh I
think<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.390> black<00:03:24.510> ops<00:03:24.750> 1<00:03:24.840> engine<00:03:25.140> was<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
think the black ops 1 engine was the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.400 
think the black ops 1 engine was the
best<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.790> obviously<00:03:27.540> that's<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.990> couple<00:03:28.290> years

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
best and obviously that's a couple years

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.890 
best and obviously that's a couple years
old<00:03:28.710> now<00:03:29.210> you<00:03:30.210> know<00:03:30.300> if<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> had<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.660> decent

old now you know if you had a decent

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.350 
old now you know if you had a decent
connection<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:32.250> would<00:03:32.370> get<00:03:32.490> a<00:03:32.550> four<00:03:32.850> bar<00:03:33.060> and

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360

kind<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.030> worse<00:03:51.180> connection<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:52.680> would<00:03:52.800> get

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
kind of a worse connection you would get

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.199 
kind of a worse connection you would get
out<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.130> three<00:03:53.340> bar<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.700> you'd<00:03:53.790> have<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.060> deal

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
out of three bar and you'd have to deal

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.140 
out of three bar and you'd have to deal
with<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.810> know<00:03:54.840> which<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.550> that's<00:03:56.550> life<00:03:56.850> I

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
with it you know which is that's life I

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.940 
with it you know which is that's life I
mean<00:03:57.660> if<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.900> got<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.080> bad<00:03:58.320> connection<00:03:58.590> you're

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
mean if you got a bad connection you're

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.800 
mean if you got a bad connection you're
not<00:03:59.100> gonna<00:03:59.250> you're<00:03:59.790> not<00:03:59.820> gonna<00:03:59.970> ping<00:04:00.330> well<00:04:00.570> to

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
not gonna you're not gonna ping well to

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.280 
not gonna you're not gonna ping well to
the<00:04:00.930> host<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:03.060> shouldn't<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.660> host<00:04:03.900> like

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the host and you shouldn't get host like

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.740 
the host and you shouldn't get host like
in<00:04:04.470> modern<00:04:04.770> warfare<00:04:04.830> 3<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.459> black<00:04:05.610> ops<00:04:05.820> 2<00:04:06.060> you

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
in modern warfare 3 and black ops 2 you

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.980 
in modern warfare 3 and black ops 2 you
can<00:04:06.900> always<00:04:07.050> tell<00:04:07.200> when<00:04:08.100> someone<00:04:08.400> has<00:04:08.520> host

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
can always tell when someone has host

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.780 
can always tell when someone has host
because<00:04:09.990> uh<00:04:10.020> you<00:04:10.560> know<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:11.340> guys<00:04:11.490> have<00:04:11.700> all

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
because uh you know you guys have all

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.949 
because uh you know you guys have all
seen<00:04:11.820> it<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.360> whole<00:04:12.510> lobbies<00:04:13.080> on<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.380> 3<00:04:13.740> bar<00:04:13.950> or

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
seen it the whole lobbies on a 3 bar or

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.599 
seen it the whole lobbies on a 3 bar or
you<00:04:15.959> know<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.290> majority<00:04:16.410> of<00:04:16.739> lobbies<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.340> 3

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
you know the majority of lobbies on a 3

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.760 
you know the majority of lobbies on a 3
bar<00:04:17.760> because<00:04:18.690> they<00:04:18.840> gave<00:04:18.989> host<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.470> someone

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
bar because they gave host to someone

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.740 
bar because they gave host to someone
who<00:04:19.830> can't<00:04:20.040> handle<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:20.790> who<00:04:21.720> knows

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
who can't handle it so who knows

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.180 
who can't handle it so who knows
hopefully

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
hopefully

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.710 
hopefully
I'm<00:04:24.580> pretty<00:04:24.910> sure<00:04:25.060> we're<00:04:25.180> gonna<00:04:25.300> have<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:25.570> deal

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
I'm pretty sure we're gonna have to deal

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.990 
I'm pretty sure we're gonna have to deal
with<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:25.870> compensation<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.800> just<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.430> don't

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
with like compensation I just I don't

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.660 
with like compensation I just I don't
know<00:04:28.180> enough<00:04:28.360> about<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:29.310> say<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.340> it's

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
know enough about it to say that it's

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.980 
know enough about it to say that it's
going<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.910> be<00:04:31.030> gone<00:04:31.210> or<00:04:31.570> they're<00:04:31.690> going<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.870> get

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
going to be gone or they're going to get

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.360 
going to be gone or they're going to get
rid<00:04:32.170> of<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.350> clearly<00:04:32.890> they've<00:04:33.070> had<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.250> few

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
rid of it clearly they've had a few

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.950 
rid of it clearly they've had a few
years<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.030> they<00:04:34.090> still<00:04:34.120> haven't<00:04:34.390> figured<00:04:34.780> it

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
years and they still haven't figured it

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.470 
years and they still haven't figured it
out<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.500> hopefully<00:04:36.100> they<00:04:36.460> do<00:04:36.520> maybe<00:04:37.270> they<00:04:37.450> just

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
out so hopefully they do maybe they just

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.390 
out so hopefully they do maybe they just
revert<00:04:37.990> back<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.230> black<00:04:38.560> ops<00:04:38.770> one<00:04:39.040> kind<00:04:39.370> of

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
revert back to black ops one kind of

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.610 
revert back to black ops one kind of
iron<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.820> out<00:04:39.910> make<00:04:40.210> three<00:04:40.480> bar<00:04:40.690> better<00:04:41.290> I

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
iron it out make three bar better I

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.300 
iron it out make three bar better I
think<00:04:42.550> that'd<00:04:42.820> be<00:04:42.940> great<00:04:43.150> but<00:04:44.100> who<00:04:45.100> knows

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
think that'd be great but who knows

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.820 
think that'd be great but who knows
hopefully<00:04:45.880> like<00:04:46.300> i<00:04:46.390> said<00:04:46.600> its<00:04:46.960> innovation<00:04:47.530> so

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
hopefully like i said its innovation so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.340 
hopefully like i said its innovation so
it<00:04:47.920> should<00:04:48.100> be<00:04:48.190> better<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:49.030> yeah<00:04:50.020> that's

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
it should be better and yeah that's

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.080 
it should be better and yeah that's
pretty<00:04:50.470> much<00:04:50.680> all<00:04:50.860> we<00:04:51.010> know<00:04:51.160> at<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.580> point<00:04:51.790> I

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
pretty much all we know at this point I

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.820 
pretty much all we know at this point I
think<00:04:52.150> there's<00:04:52.960> actually<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.350> new<00:04:53.440> trailer

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
think there's actually a new trailer

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.280 
think there's actually a new trailer
coming<00:04:54.100> out<00:04:54.220> pretty<00:04:54.850> soon<00:04:54.970> like<00:04:55.750> mid<00:04:56.020> May<00:04:56.260> or

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
coming out pretty soon like mid May or

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.430 
coming out pretty soon like mid May or
the<00:04:56.590> end<00:04:56.770> of<00:04:56.890> may<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:58.120> we'll<00:04:58.330> see<00:04:58.570> i'm<00:04:59.110> sure

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
the end of may so we'll see i'm sure

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.410 
the end of may so we'll see i'm sure
i'll<00:04:59.560> do<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.740> video<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.490> as<00:05:00.610> will<00:05:01.120> most

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
i'll do a video on it as will most

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.660 
i'll do a video on it as will most
people<00:05:01.780> because<00:05:02.410> i<00:05:02.620> love<00:05:02.860> call<00:05:03.040> duty<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.520> i'm

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.070 
people because i love call duty and i'm
always<00:05:03.880> excited<00:05:04.000> when<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.420> new<00:05:04.570> one<00:05:04.660> comes<00:05:04.720> out

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
always excited when a new one comes out

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
did really like call duty 4 in its prime

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.970 
did really like call duty 4 in its prime
I<00:05:15.250> wasn't<00:05:15.790> huge<00:05:15.970> fan<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.510> then<00:05:16.660> obviously

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
but looking back call 24 was a good game

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.220 
but looking back call 24 was a good game
modern<00:05:23.170> warfare<00:05:23.320> two<00:05:23.680> had<00:05:24.330> whoa<00:05:25.330> a<00:05:25.630> lot<00:05:26.200> of

modern warfare two had whoa a lot of
fuckit<00:05:26.800> issues<00:05:27.130> but<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.640> was<00:05:27.730> a<00:05:28.390> really<00:05:28.450> fun

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
fuckit issues but it was a really fun

smgs assault rifles they were all very

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.750 
smgs assault rifles they were all very
usable<00:05:54.850> and<00:05:55.030> all<00:05:55.270> really<00:05:55.600> good<00:05:56.010> which<00:05:57.010> was<00:05:57.280> one

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
usable and all really good which was one

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.610

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
had obviously the perk imbalance and the

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.010
