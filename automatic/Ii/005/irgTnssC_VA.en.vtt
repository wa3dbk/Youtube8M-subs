the next battlefield be world war two so

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.779 
the next battlefield be world war two so
it's<00:00:25.080> interesting<00:00:25.260> because<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> past

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
it's interesting because for the past

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.480 
it's interesting because for the past
few<00:00:27.240> years<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.660> lot<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.140> these<00:00:28.349> shooters<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
few years a lot of these shooters have

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.299 
few years a lot of these shooters have
been<00:00:29.939> modern-day<00:00:30.539> shooters<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.830> think

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
been modern-day shooters and I think

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.160 
been modern-day shooters and I think
it's<00:00:32.520> time<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.820> something<00:00:33.239> different<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.079> be

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it's time for something different to be

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.860 
it's time for something different to be
honest<00:00:34.440> whether<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> world<00:00:36.390> war<00:00:36.600> two

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
honest whether that be a world war two

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.770 
honest whether that be a world war two
game<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.670> futuristic<00:00:38.670> game<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.180> doesn't<00:00:39.600> really

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
game a futuristic game it doesn't really

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200 
game a futuristic game it doesn't really
matter<00:00:40.079> i<00:00:40.260> think<00:00:40.590> though<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.180> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
matter i think though it is time for a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600 
matter i think though it is time for a
change<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.770> note<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.219> that's

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
change and on that note I think that's

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.510 
change and on that note I think that's
why<00:00:44.820> titanfall<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:46.260> doing<00:00:46.770> well<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.250> because

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
why titanfall is doing well is because

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
why titanfall is doing well is because
it's<00:00:48.000> something<00:00:48.690> different<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.559> think

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it's something different and I think

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's something different and I think
that's<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.370> lot<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.670> FPS<00:00:51.390> fans<00:00:51.719> are

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that's what a lot of FPS fans are

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.930 
that's what a lot of FPS fans are
looking<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.440> seeing<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.640> again<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
looking for seeing as you know again the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
looking for seeing as you know again the
past<00:00:54.300> few<00:00:54.539> years<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.989> been<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.350> modern

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
past few years have been all modern

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
past few years have been all modern
military<00:00:56.430> shooters<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> say

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
military shooters and that's not to say

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
military shooters and that's not to say
modern<00:00:58.440> military<00:00:58.890> shooters<00:00:59.520> aren't<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.969> bad

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
modern military shooters aren't a bad

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
modern military shooters aren't a bad
thing<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.960> know<00:01:01.079> they're<00:01:01.260> actually<00:01:01.710> good<00:01:02.010> but

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
thing you know they're actually good but

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.700 
thing you know they're actually good but
it's<00:01:03.300> always<00:01:03.690> good<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> change<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it's always good to have a change of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.370 
it's always good to have a change of
pace<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.970> innovate<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.659> feel<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.200> lot

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
pace and to innovate I feel like a lot

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
pace and to innovate I feel like a lot
of<00:01:07.439> these<00:01:07.770> developers<00:01:08.700> hide<00:01:09.180> behind<00:01:09.450> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
of these developers hide behind that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.770 
of these developers hide behind that
modern<00:01:10.439> military<00:01:11.340> thing<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> cause

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
modern military thing as a as a cause

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.899 
modern military thing as a as a cause
for<00:01:12.810> lack<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.260> innovation<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.610> honest

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
for lack of innovation so to be honest

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.520 
for lack of innovation so to be honest
I'm<00:01:15.150> surprised<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.990> haven't<00:01:16.259> seen

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I'm surprised that we haven't seen

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830 
I'm surprised that we haven't seen
another<00:01:17.009> type<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> shooter<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.420> different

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
another type of shooter in a different

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.340 
another type of shooter in a different
time<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.530> think<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.119> excuse<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> pun<00:01:22.080> but

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
time I think it's as excuse the pun but

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.649 
time I think it's as excuse the pun but
it's<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.040> matter<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> time<00:01:23.670> before<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.630> see

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
it's just a matter of time before we see

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.469 
it's just a matter of time before we see
a<00:01:25.110> game<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.180> answer<00:01:27.330> your

imagine right they release a dlc it's a

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.960 
imagine right they release a dlc it's a
2142<00:02:34.250> dlc<00:02:34.970> where<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:35.780> have<00:02:36.080> laser<00:02:36.530> guns<00:02:36.970> mixing

with<00:02:38.180> modern-day<00:02:38.570> weapons<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.440> would

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
with modern-day weapons it would

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.400 
with modern-day weapons it would
probably<00:02:40.010> be<00:02:40.610> awful<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.870> would<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.380> to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
probably be awful but I would like to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.490 
probably be awful but I would like to
see<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:42.980> one<00:02:43.610> for<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> lulz<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.720> two<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.350> would

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
see it one for the lulz and two it would

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.290 
see it one for the lulz and two it would
be<00:02:45.680> something<00:02:45.980> different<00:02:46.190> at<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.670> very<00:02:47.000> least

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
be something different at the very least

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.140 
be something different at the very least
so<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:48.110> think<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.830> mix<00:02:49.130> things<00:02:49.400> up<00:02:49.550> definitely

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
so I think of mix things up definitely

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.910 
so I think of mix things up definitely
