00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.890
 pull will not get to the point I recently 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.049
 looked 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.789
 revised lessons on element 3d and there 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.790
 Kramar dragged such an example as flickr 

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:12.790
 you can find such pictures 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.490
 respectively, then you can download them 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.050
 insert in any editor 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:29.989
 three-dimensional or for example use in 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.629
 3d element for reflections and refractions 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:41.329
 there and other stuff the most interesting 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:43.039
 the thing is that these pictures are free for 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.829
 commercial use is eliminated 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.350
 that's licensed creative commons to their 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.010
 we find go to flicker run 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.449
 search we enter this word here 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.059
 Immediately go down and set 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.449
 Naturally, here are these ticks we miss 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.379
 search and flicker gives us pictures 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.619
 which we can use for example 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.619
 some commercial work and 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:13.790
 lay out for example on the video highway here 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.549
 but Tajiks are still the same I found 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.560
 Here is such a site as you can see that 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.470
 it says that this is free hd paradise 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.990
 image pictures with 32-bit channels 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.200
 colors inside the archive 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.630
 several files there night dzhipeg very 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.630
 large size about 8000 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:46.560
 by 8000 by 4 well, and hdr ki size there 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.530
 they may vary for example in one 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.580
 the archive there and a half thousand was only 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:00.060
 size but in another here here already 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:06.210
 good enough size here if we 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:09.420
 Now let's see what is seen here. 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.270
 hdr to normal color contains all of 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.100
 right we go to the fact that here 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.230
 but offer also watching this video 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.240
 throw any references on 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.240
 similar resources will be useful
