00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
other knives do you need a throwing

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.229 
other knives do you need a throwing
knife<00:03:59.070> perhaps<00:04:00.070> not<00:04:00.280> if<00:04:00.519> you're<00:04:01.090> really

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
experienced in throwing knives which I

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.979
