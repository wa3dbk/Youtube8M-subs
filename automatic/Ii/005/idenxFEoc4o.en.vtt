00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
ok youtube um i'm going to show you step

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.840 
ok youtube um i'm going to show you step
by<00:00:03.720> step<00:00:03.840> up<00:00:04.350> let's<00:00:04.890> step<00:00:05.130> by<00:00:05.250> separate<00:00:05.640> like

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
by step up let's step by separate like

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.080 
by step up let's step by separate like
you<00:00:06.180> know<00:00:06.330> like<00:00:06.359> one<00:00:07.140> by<00:00:07.319> one<00:00:07.670> what<00:00:08.670> these<00:00:08.849> cars

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
you know like one by one what these cars

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.610 
you know like one by one what these cars
look<00:00:09.210> like<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.750> i'm<00:00:09.809> going<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.080> test<00:00:10.410> out

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
out to bed 30 million or break know it

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.140 
out to bed 30 million or break know it
and<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.910> black<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:25.730> clogging<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
office like that by some medium-sized

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.939 
office like that by some medium-sized
line<00:00:48.680> go<00:00:49.680> far<00:00:49.980> back<00:00:54.199> yeah<00:00:55.199> let's<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.770> how<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
line go far back yeah let's see how it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.229 
line go far back yeah let's see how it
is<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.309> its<00:00:56.460> played<00:00:58.250> it's<00:00:59.250> okay<00:00:59.579> i'll<00:00:59.730> blaring

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
is in its played it's okay i'll blaring

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:09.800 
is in its played it's okay i'll blaring
I<00:01:01.250> would<00:01:02.250> suggest<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:06.350> cooking<00:01:08.570> astro<00:01:09.570> fat

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
I would suggest them a cooking astro fat

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.039 
I would suggest them a cooking astro fat
on<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.439> flares<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.100> yeah<00:01:11.869> now<00:01:12.869> let's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
on it with the flares but yeah now let's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:29.120 
on it with the flares but yeah now let's
try<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> truth<00:01:13.680> after<00:01:13.860> day<00:01:27.650> that's<00:01:28.650> how<00:01:28.860> about

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
try the truth after day that's how about

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.719 
try the truth after day that's how about
a<00:01:29.159> collision<00:01:29.930> because<00:01:30.930> please<00:01:34.549> this<00:01:35.549> is

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
a collision because please this is

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.160 
a collision because please this is
actually<00:01:36.090> wider<00:01:36.329> than<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.840> wider

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
actually wider than that what it's wider

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.020 
actually wider than that what it's wider
than<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:42.799> guess<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.040> limited<00:01:44.520> edition<00:01:44.610> towns

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
than I guess the limited edition towns

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.020 
than I guess the limited edition towns
have<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.689> bit<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:45.960> high<00:01:46.140> pressure<00:01:46.439> gas

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
have a little bit more high pressure gas

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:58.340 
have a little bit more high pressure gas
all<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:48.920> now<00:01:49.920> chameleon

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:07.369 

chameleon<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.469> point<00:01:59.770> okay<00:02:00.130> he's<00:02:01.030> not<00:02:01.179> crazy

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:07.379 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.300 

yeah<00:02:08.379> good<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:08.830> I'm<00:02:08.890> just<00:02:09.190> some<00:02:10.149> cans<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:11.310> guess

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
yeah good so I'm just some cans I guess

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.170 
yeah good so I'm just some cans I guess
they<00:02:12.819> have<00:02:13.060> higher<00:02:13.450> pressure<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:15.060> last<00:02:16.060> but

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
they have higher pressure and last but

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.360 
they have higher pressure and last but
not<00:02:16.299> least<00:02:16.799> matte<00:02:17.799> black<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> true

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
not least matte black this is a true

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:34.289 
not least matte black this is a true
block<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.900> has<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:32.640> trap<00:02:33.640> i<00:02:33.819> think<00:02:34.090> my

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
block it has like a trap i think my

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.789 
block it has like a trap i think my
matte<00:02:34.629> black<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.579> clogged<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:38.590> like

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
matte black is so clogged and it's like

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:54.349 
matte black is so clogged and it's like
parody<00:02:39.579> but<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:41.470> was<00:02:41.650> sooo<00:02:41.799> cool<00:02:42.010> fresh<00:02:50.370> crab

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
recommend them that a little pressure

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.909 
recommend them that a little pressure
slowly<00:03:55.239> down<00:03:55.629> side<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:55.959> side<00:03:56.290> like<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.620> pressure

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
slowly down side to side like I pressure

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.340 
slowly down side to side like I pressure
but<00:03:57.250> that<00:03:59.340> these
