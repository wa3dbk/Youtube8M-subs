line all you need to do to set it into a
freerunning<00:00:35.100> mode<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:36.440> rotate<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.629> screw

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
freerunning mode is rotate this screw

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.660 
freerunning mode is rotate this screw
and<00:00:40.079> pull<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> spring

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and pull out it's on the spring

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
and pull out it's on the spring
spring-loaded<00:00:42.329> piston<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> simply

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
spring-loaded piston so you simply

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.860 
spring-loaded piston so you simply
rotate<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.090> lift<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.200> now<00:00:49.070> for<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> reverse

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
rotate and lift and now for the reverse

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
rotate and lift and now for the reverse
simply<00:00:51.870> take<00:00:53.210> this<00:00:54.210> spring<00:00:54.449> piston<00:00:54.750> put<00:00:55.739> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
simply take this spring piston put it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.349 
simply take this spring piston put it
down<00:00:56.420> put<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.289> fits<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.829> bolt<00:00:59.670> spring

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
down put it and it fits a bolt spring

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.330 
down put it and it fits a bolt spring
loaded<00:01:00.539> bolt<00:01:00.870> into<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.500> rather<00:01:02.100> large

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
loaded bolt into this rather large

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.859 
loaded bolt into this rather large
oversized<00:01:02.879> screw<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.140> you're<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
oversized screw here and you're now in

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.050 
oversized screw here and you're now in
freerunning<00:01:06.869> mode<00:01:07.520> that's<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
freerunning mode that's all there is to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.340 
freerunning mode that's all there is to
it

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.440 
it
to<00:01:10.350> take<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.799> once<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> rotate

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
to take it out once more we do is rotate

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.789 
to take it out once more we do is rotate
if<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> spring<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> should<00:01:15.799> not

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
if the spring and it should not

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.440 
if the spring and it should not
automatically<00:01:17.580> lock<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:18.689> in

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
automatically lock now so it's now in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.289 
automatically lock now so it's now in
okay<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> great<00:01:21.869> deal<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.619> say<00:01:22.799> about<00:01:22.830> this

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
okay not a great deal to say about this

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.850 
okay not a great deal to say about this
incredibly<00:01:24.299> incredibly<00:01:24.810> durable<00:01:25.110> they'll

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
incredibly incredibly durable they'll

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.749 
incredibly incredibly durable they'll
probably<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.220> around<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> next

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
probably be around for the next

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.950 
probably be around for the next
millennium<00:01:28.220> expensive<00:01:29.299> cost<00:01:30.299> around<00:01:30.450> 100

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
millennium expensive cost around 100

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.289 
millennium expensive cost around 100
pounds<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.530> before<00:01:32.189> any<00:01:32.340> any<00:01:32.700> extras<00:01:33.119> for

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
pounds and before any any extras for

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.480 
pounds and before any any extras for
this<00:01:33.450> variety<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> narrow<00:01:34.950> variety

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
this variety it's not the narrow variety

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.280 
this variety it's not the narrow variety
so<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.970> you'd<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.270> yours<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:36.900> slimmer

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so if you'd like yours a little slimmer

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
so if you'd like yours a little slimmer
maybe<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> little<00:01:37.799> more<00:01:37.979> streamlined<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:39.090> is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
maybe a little more streamlined there is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.140 
maybe a little more streamlined there is
that<00:01:39.299> option<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.860> 50-meter<00:01:41.640> version

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that option this is the 50-meter version

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.539 
that option this is the 50-meter version
you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.689> more<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.560> less<00:01:43.890> line<00:01:44.130> coming

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
you can have more or less line coming

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.670 
you can have more or less line coming
attached<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.149> it

not<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> great<00:01:46.920> deal<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> say<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.210> this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
not a great deal more to say about this

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.620 
not a great deal more to say about this
