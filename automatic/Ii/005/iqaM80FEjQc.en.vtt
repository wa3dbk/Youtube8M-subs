00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.879
 hello friends my name is Egor 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.010
 sit back today I will show 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.390
 you are very useful in the household 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.189
 apps with nothing fast 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.199
 reasonable discharge of battery think 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.359
 faced many charged before 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.980
 bedtime one hundred percent smartphone in the morning already 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.259
 show fifty to sixty 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.240
 percent from each new version android 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.760
 this issue is heard less and less 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.310
 less however it still is and how with 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.410
 fight it knows not all decision 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.240
 this problem is extremely simple need 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.950
 install a special program which 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.020
 will track smartphone activity 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.090
 of may indicate an application or 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.610
 a process that shamelessly devours a charge 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.470
 battery like programs on 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.600
 open spaces google play great variety 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.240
 but my choice fell on wake lock 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.610
 detector since this application has 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.140
 a number of obvious advantages first she 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.780
 extremely easy to handle 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.700
 secondly, the wake lock detector does not require 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.110
 Root rights and the third is if 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.600
 unsympathetic then certainly not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.759
 repulsive interface and so let's 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 see how the backlog detector works 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.140
 We put it from the market, it's good there 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.789
 absolutely free after which the phone 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.219
 must be left alone for some 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.079
 time is better even for the night it is necessary so that 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.630
 the application could track activity 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.429
 troublemakers in my stats 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.799
 already collected let's see who 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.600
 mercilessly eats up battery first 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.909
 what you need to pay attention is the top 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.009
 bar it shows the attitude of sleep and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.659
 wakefulness besides this you can 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.579
 see what time period 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.649
 The application has collected statistics 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.539
 If you tap on this strip, we will see 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.310
 more information based on 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.960
 which is clear that the phone is sleeping 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.490
 mode is less than 50 percent 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.649
 all time work 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.600
 which means that the smartphone awakens 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.999
 some kind of program she you are 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.219
 cause energy expenditure that seams shred 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:55.020
 the detector will help us find it for this 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.179
 we need to pay attention to the buttons 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.490
 top and only three first menu 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.560
 there is nothing interesting further button 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.079
 with three stripes it will help 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.729
 sort the data but also the most useful 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.840
 button switches display modes 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.000
 statistics 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.220
 it is what we need first of all 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.590
 interested in the future of the program as you 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.810
 see in my case the falcon pro turned out 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.459
 stranglers calm the whole thing is that 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.410
 I did not adjust the frequency correctly 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.450
 tape updates resulting in 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.610
 falcon will always be a smartphone and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.650
 forced him to over discharge 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.840
 if in your case the application is worn 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.910
 name unknown to you or violates 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.010
 peace is not an application process at all 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.349
 a name that doesn't tell you anything 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.780
 then it does not matter to you just enough 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.970
 Tap on the item that interests you 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.379
 and the wake lock detector will offer you 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.660
 more information will help 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.430
 deal with this scoundrel one more 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.130
 useful tab called the processor 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.959
 ny shred judging by the name I think it is clear that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.700
 it displays applications that 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.430
 the processor loads the hardest 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.930
 sleep time if you see in the list 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.880
 processor wake lock any 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.319
 abnormal activity then carefully 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.810
 look at this application 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.730
 maybe you need to reinstall it either 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.590
 find him a replacement for this we have everything 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.510
