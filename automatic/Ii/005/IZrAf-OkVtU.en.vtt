00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
let's put it into action and see how it

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.959 
let's put it into action and see how it
sounds<00:01:19.500> firstly<00:01:20.500> let's<00:01:21.310> play<00:01:21.520> something

now<00:01:44.679> as<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:44.890> mentioned<00:01:45.249> before<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:46.539> difference

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
now as I mentioned before the difference

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.989 
now as I mentioned before the difference
between<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.109> grand<00:01:47.319> mark<00:01:47.530> 2<00:01:47.829> in<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.700> first

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
series of the grant is that the mark 2

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.580 
series of the grant is that the mark 2
has<00:01:52.000> variable<00:01:52.509> controls<00:01:52.899> for<00:01:53.140> drive<00:01:53.380> and
