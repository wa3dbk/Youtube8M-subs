right to here so I'm kind of scared so
not<00:00:40.079> sure<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.590> gonna<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.920> beginning

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
not sure if this gonna be the beginning

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.170 
not sure if this gonna be the beginning
of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> boss<00:00:41.700> battle<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.170> second<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.180> five

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
of the boss battle or the second of five

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330 
of the boss battle or the second of five
hits<00:00:45.570> or<00:00:45.809> something<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.739> guess<00:00:46.980> we'll<00:00:47.160> see

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
hits or something but guess we'll see

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
hits or something but guess we'll see
you've<00:00:47.610> cut<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> number<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.570> redundant

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you've cut down the number of redundant

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.709 
you've cut down the number of redundant
energy<00:00:49.620> batteries<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.250> minor<00:00:50.719> inconvenience

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
energy batteries a minor inconvenience

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.959 
energy batteries a minor inconvenience
as<00:00:52.140> long<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> artifact<00:00:53.550> my

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
as long as I have the artifact my

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.740 
as long as I have the artifact my
reactor<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.629> unstoppable<00:00:59.300> really<00:01:00.300> doesn't

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
reactor is unstoppable really doesn't

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.880 
reactor is unstoppable really doesn't
seem<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:00.960> much<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.260> machine

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 

do<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.820> even<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> slightest<00:01:06.870> idea

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
do you have even the slightest idea

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.930 
do you have even the slightest idea
would<00:01:07.440> complicated<00:01:08.220> engineering<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
would complicated engineering is

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.000 
would complicated engineering is
required<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.960> successfully<00:01:10.650> derive

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
required but to successfully derive

required but to successfully derive
energy<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.790> mystical<00:01:12.270> artifact<00:01:19.490> must<00:01:20.490> find<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
energy the mystical artifact must find a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.610 
energy the mystical artifact must find a
way<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.540> her<00:01:21.690> out<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.870> it

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
way to get her out of it

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.149 
way to get her out of it
oh<00:01:23.680> yeah<00:01:24.400> I<00:01:25.500> can't<00:01:26.500> let<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.740> do<00:01:27.070> that

she's<00:03:01.000> consuming<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.660> great<00:03:01.930> deal<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.290> energy

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
she's consuming a great deal of energy

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.220 
she's consuming a great deal of energy
to<00:03:02.950> get<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.340> find<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.180> way<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.360> use<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:05.020> to
