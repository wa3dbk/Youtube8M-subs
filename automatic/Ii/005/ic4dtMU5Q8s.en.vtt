really all right this is this is it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.380 
really all right this is this is it
thousand<00:00:53.969> plants<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.879> only<00:00:56.910> ones

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
thousand plants that are the only ones

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
thousand plants that are the only ones
like<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> planet<00:00:58.199> earlier<00:00:58.920> earlier<00:00:59.370> it

like it on the planet earlier earlier it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.209 
like it on the planet earlier earlier it
may<00:00:59.730> not<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.090> very<00:01:00.390> different<00:01:00.930> than<00:01:01.859> others

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
may not be very different than others

may not be very different than others
that<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.460> already<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.799> are

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that are already out there but they are

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.800 
that are already out there but they are
different<00:01:05.580> genetically<00:01:06.240> they're<00:01:06.510> different

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
different genetically they're different

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
different genetically they're different
and<00:01:07.229> there's<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.770> something<00:01:08.010> about<00:01:08.250> them

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and there's just something about them

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
and there's just something about them
specifically<00:01:09.619> physically<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.220> could
