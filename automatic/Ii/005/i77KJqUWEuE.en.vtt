00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
actually I could flashback it let's get

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.630 
actually I could flashback it let's get
into<00:01:51.259> our<00:01:51.350> attack<00:01:51.619> first

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.690 

so<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.360> flashback<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:56.020> he<00:01:56.350> goes<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.950> two<00:01:57.280> on

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
so I flashback it he goes to two on

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.040 
so I flashback it he goes to two on
board<00:01:59.130> that<00:02:00.130> seems<00:02:00.340> pretty<00:02:00.460> good<00:02:00.900> just<00:02:01.900> keep

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
board that seems pretty good just keep

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.660 
board that seems pretty good just keep
getting<00:02:02.320> him<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.590> commit<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.340> board<00:02:03.520> I

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
getting him to commit to the board I

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.490 
getting him to commit to the board I
guess<00:02:03.880> if<00:02:04.630> he<00:02:04.720> doesn't<00:02:05.020> come<00:02:05.080> into<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.350> board

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
guess if he doesn't come into the board

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.590 
guess if he doesn't come into the board
we<00:02:05.590> just<00:02:05.770> get<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:05.920> kill<00:02:06.070> them<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.700> yeah<00:02:07.450> it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
we just get to kill them so yeah it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.750 
we just get to kill them so yeah it
seems<00:02:07.780> ok<00:02:08.050> now<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.860> always<00:02:12.190> have<00:02:12.400> Dave

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
seems ok now we always have Dave

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.650 
seems ok now we always have Dave
judgment<00:02:13.180> as<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> backup<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.050> case<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:16.420> he

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
judgment as a backup just in case so he

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.720 
judgment as a backup just in case so he
gets<00:02:16.840> him<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.200> golem<00:02:17.700> that's<00:02:18.700> okay<00:02:19.480> by<00:02:19.660> me

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.330 

and<00:02:25.300> then<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:26.019> even<00:02:26.680> if<00:02:26.769> he<00:02:26.830> kills<00:02:27.040> one<00:02:27.250> of

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and then what even if he kills one of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.979 
and then what even if he kills one of
these<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.790> then<00:02:27.879> day<00:02:28.120> breaks<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.480> guy<00:02:28.629> like

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
these and then day breaks a guy like

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:36.690 
these and then day breaks a guy like
we're<00:02:29.530> still<00:02:29.680> doing<00:02:29.830> pretty<00:02:30.069> well

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.619 

this<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.819> only<00:02:37.909> problem<00:02:38.239> with<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.420> card

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
this is the only problem with this card

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.789 
this is the only problem with this card
sometimes<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.110> need<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.290> know<00:02:39.439> when<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.650> be

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
sometimes you need to know when to be

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.500 
sometimes you need to know when to be
offensive<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.489> defensive<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.269> I<00:02:41.329> think

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
offensive and defensive and I think

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.729 
offensive and defensive and I think
definitely<00:02:41.659> right<00:02:42.019> now<00:02:42.140> we<00:02:42.200> just<00:02:42.409> want<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.680> be

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
definitely right now we just want to be

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.569 
definitely right now we just want to be
offensive<00:02:45.040> although<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.220> could<00:02:46.340> easily

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
offensive although that could easily

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.110 
offensive although that could easily
change<00:02:46.810> depending<00:02:47.810> on<00:02:47.840> what<00:02:48.170> he<00:02:48.230> plays<00:02:48.439> here

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
change depending on what he plays here

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.890 
change depending on what he plays here
but<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.150> feel<00:02:50.659> like<00:02:50.689> right<00:02:51.170> now<00:02:51.200> we're<00:02:51.650> playing

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
but I feel like right now we're playing

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.660 
but I feel like right now we're playing
to<00:02:53.900> our<00:02:53.930> advantage<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:57.680> kill<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.400> spirit

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670

to our advantage so kill the spirit
token<00:02:59.260> okay<00:03:01.599> so<00:03:02.599> we<00:03:02.720> hit<00:03:02.840> them<00:03:02.900> down<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.560> five

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
token okay so we hit them down to five

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.559 
token okay so we hit them down to five
he's<00:03:04.790> still<00:03:05.000> dead<00:03:05.209> on<00:03:05.390> board<00:03:05.840> even<00:03:06.379> with<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
he's still dead on board even with the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.420 
he's still dead on board even with the
daybreak<00:03:08.569> ranger<00:03:08.870> flipped<00:03:09.140> because<00:03:09.799> even<00:03:10.340> if

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
daybreak ranger flipped because even if

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.770 
daybreak ranger flipped because even if
he<00:03:10.489> just<00:03:10.670> kills<00:03:10.819> another<00:03:11.000> spirit<00:03:11.420> open<00:03:11.540> he

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
pass why she's not just dead because he

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.899 
pass why she's not just dead because he
can<00:03:17.750> block<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.079> birds<00:03:18.290> i<00:03:18.500> guess<00:03:18.680> but<00:03:19.010> goes<00:03:19.760> to

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
can block with birds i guess but goes to

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.170 
can block with birds i guess but goes to
2<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.269> he's<00:03:20.989> dead<00:03:21.170> next<00:03:21.440> turn<00:03:21.879> so<00:03:22.879> we're<00:03:23.150> still

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
2 and he's dead next turn so we're still

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.369 
2 and he's dead next turn so we're still
just<00:03:23.389> trying<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.690> get<00:03:23.810> him<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:23.930> commit<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.290> the

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
just trying to get him to commit to the

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.390 
just trying to get him to commit to the
board<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.680> bit<00:03:24.829> oh<00:03:26.620> we<00:03:27.620> could<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.159> ran<00:03:28.370> out

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
board a bit oh we could have ran out

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.180 
board a bit oh we could have ran out
hero<00:03:28.819> to<00:03:29.000> make<00:03:29.209> him<00:03:29.329> kill<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:30.190> which

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
hero to make him kill that which

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.740 
hero to make him kill that which
probably<00:03:31.519> wasn't<00:03:31.879> a<00:03:32.030> terrible<00:03:32.389> idea<00:03:34.720> yeah<00:03:35.720> I

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
probably wasn't a terrible idea yeah I

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.119 
probably wasn't a terrible idea yeah I
probably<00:03:36.109> should've<00:03:36.379> done<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.500> actually<00:03:36.769> I

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
probably should've done that actually I

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.509 
probably should've done that actually I
think<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:37.459> is<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.639> little<00:03:37.670> too<00:03:37.970> defensive<00:03:39.970> hmm

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
think this is a little too defensive hmm

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.650 
think this is a little too defensive hmm
it's<00:03:43.519> possible<00:03:43.910> wait<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.209> see

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.770 

chances<00:03:47.560> are<00:03:47.710> he<00:03:47.950> just<00:03:48.450> kills<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.510> spirit

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
chances are he just kills the spirit

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.190 
chances are he just kills the spirit
open<00:03:49.990> on<00:03:50.080> hook<00:03:50.230> even<00:03:50.590> blocks<00:03:50.890> goes<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.520> two

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.090
