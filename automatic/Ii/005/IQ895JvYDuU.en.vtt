00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.810

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.160
 it's everywhere then to give birth 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.600
 homemade ketchup then to 270 grams of 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.449
 tomato paste 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.379
 we will need 115 grams of 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.559
 white vinegar 50 grams of water and 60 g 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.780
 honey also a teaspoon of 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.010
 sugar half a teaspoon or sem a 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.359
 little more than half a spoon to 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.850
 coffee we'll say three quarters of a 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.159
 teaspoon half teaspoon 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.629
 of onion powder as well as a half 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.999
 teaspoon of garlic powder 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.449
 so we go there all the ingredients in 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.449
 the pan 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.660
 I heat the honey in the microwave 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:10.860
 10 seconds so that they are 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.860
 well liquid and powder sugar salt 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.840
 the garlic couldre and low income shots 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.840
 is on medium heat 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.190
 we're going to mix everything up here I'm going genius 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.869
 the fire over low heat and then ben I'm going 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.900
 cover and I'm going to cook in 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.110
 stirring very regularly during a 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.100
 fifteen or twenty minutes 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.420
 here we come to the end of cooking 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.670
 he resisted well 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.460
 so the wrestler really gets off a 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.570
 good smell here is the ketchup has cooled 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.640
 so I put in a little dish of 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.060
 presentation and who says ketchup says 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.600
 fries 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.530

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.040

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.510

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.130

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.920
 in inef healthy and natural things 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.480

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.510
 the one you buy in the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.300
