00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
was delighted to discover that bamboo

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.730 
was delighted to discover that bamboo
changes<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:22.939> sound<00:00:23.150> because<00:00:23.869> it<00:00:24.140> gives<00:00:24.529> a

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
changes the sound because it gives a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.099 
changes the sound because it gives a
slightly<00:00:25.010> brighter<00:00:25.460> tone<00:00:26.000> with<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:26.660> bamboo

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
slightly brighter tone with the bamboo

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.009 
slightly brighter tone with the bamboo
but<00:00:27.260> it<00:00:27.470> brings<00:00:27.679> me<00:00:28.010> more<00:00:28.460> volume<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.330> it's

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
but it brings me more volume and it's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.450 
but it brings me more volume and it's
loud<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:31.070> can<00:00:31.189> be<00:00:31.340> soft<00:00:32.080> you<00:00:33.080> can<00:00:33.260> play<00:00:33.440> with<00:00:34.430> a

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
different styles on one instrument so I

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.250 
different styles on one instrument so I
also<00:01:23.990> have<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.190> challenge<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.170> finding<00:01:27.170> a

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
also have the challenge of finding a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.470 
also have the challenge of finding a
tuning<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.860> allows<00:01:28.370> me<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.730> play<00:01:28.940> different

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
tuning that allows me to play different

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.380 
tuning that allows me to play different
styles<00:01:29.840> on<00:01:29.930> one<00:01:30.080> instrument<00:01:30.440> so<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.640> use<00:01:32.360> a

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
styles on one instrument so I use a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.350 
styles on one instrument so I use a
compromise<00:01:33.020> tuning<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.850> really<00:01:35.150> suits

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
compromise tuning and that really suits

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.550 
compromise tuning and that really suits
me<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.900> crossover<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.990> ready-made

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
me that the crossover is it's ready-made

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.760 
me that the crossover is it's ready-made
with<00:01:39.800> this<00:01:40.010> compromise<00:01:40.880> tuning<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.770> really

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
with this compromise tuning I really

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.590 
with this compromise tuning I really
don't<00:01:42.980> have<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.310> change<00:01:43.580> anything<00:01:44.000> when<00:01:44.570> I

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
don't have to change anything when I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.140 
don't have to change anything when I
when<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.080> get<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.430> can<00:01:46.670> play<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:46.970> right

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
when I get it and I can play it right

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.130 
when I get it and I can play it right
out<00:01:47.330> of<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.540> box<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:48.200> also<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.190> durable<00:01:49.700> now

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
out of the box it's also so durable now

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.770 
out of the box it's also so durable now
adays<00:01:51.140> it's<00:01:51.980> I<00:01:52.370> can't<00:01:53.030> understand<00:01:53.480> but<00:01:53.600> some

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
adays it's I can't understand but some

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.570 
adays it's I can't understand but some
of<00:01:53.900> these<00:01:54.050> harmonicas<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:54.860> have<00:01:55.130> since<00:01:55.490> the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
of these harmonicas I have since the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.550 
of these harmonicas I have since the
beginning<00:01:56.120> they<00:01:56.630> came<00:01:56.840> out<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.020> think<00:01:57.380> two

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
beginning they came out I think two

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.370 
beginning they came out I think two
years<00:01:57.590> ago<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.880> haven't<00:01:59.060> broken<00:01:59.480> yet<00:01:59.780> after

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
years ago and I haven't broken yet after

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.540 
years ago and I haven't broken yet after
maybe<00:02:01.010> two<00:02:02.110> 200<00:02:03.110> gigs<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.740> incredible<00:02:04.340> I

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
maybe two 200 gigs it's incredible I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.380 
maybe two 200 gigs it's incredible I
never<00:02:04.940> had<00:02:05.120> to<00:02:05.330> return<00:02:06.230> them<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:07.220> mean<00:02:08.119> I

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
never had to return them and I mean I

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.810 
never had to return them and I mean I
almost<00:02:08.750> don't<00:02:09.080> ask<00:02:09.229> for<00:02:09.440> new<00:02:09.739> replace<00:02:10.190> due<00:02:10.580> to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
almost don't ask for new replace due to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.880 
almost don't ask for new replace due to
the<00:02:10.940> factory<00:02:11.330> because<00:02:11.450> they<00:02:12.140> last<00:02:12.380> long<00:02:12.590> and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
the factory because they last long and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.950 
the factory because they last long and
where<00:02:13.460> I<00:02:13.490> come<00:02:13.760> from<00:02:13.790> there's<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.780> much

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
where I come from there's so much

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.490 
where I come from there's so much
humidity<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.740> you

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
humidity that you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.040 
humidity that you
let<00:02:16.620> them<00:02:16.800> outside<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.670> box<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.150> or<00:02:18.780> even

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
let them outside the box and or even

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.590 
let them outside the box and or even
inside<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.500> box<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.700> they<00:02:20.970> swallow<00:02:21.270> but

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
inside the box and and they swallow but

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.920 
inside the box and and they swallow but
the<00:02:21.780> bamboo<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.470> never<00:02:22.770> swallow<00:02:23.160> never<00:02:23.930> looses

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the bamboo it never swallow never looses

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.500 
the bamboo it never swallow never looses
like<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.680> bail<00:02:25.950> being<00:02:26.310> there<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.120> it's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
like the bail being there it's like it's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.420 
like the bail being there it's like it's
always<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.050> looks<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.380> new<00:02:28.530> always<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.280> can

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
always it looks like new always you can
