hey guys has it gone this is Billy world
here<00:00:02.399> again<00:00:02.700> back<00:00:03.000> with<00:00:03.030> another<00:00:03.449> DMR<00:00:03.990> review

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
here again back with another DMR review

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.980 
here again back with another DMR review
today<00:00:05.130> we're<00:00:05.370> looking<00:00:05.460> at<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.790> qbu-88<00:00:06.540> which

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
today we're looking at the qbu-88 which

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.690 
today we're looking at the qbu-88 which
is<00:00:07.170> statistically<00:00:07.859> one<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.220> most<00:00:08.400> unique

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
is statistically one of the most unique

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.450 
is statistically one of the most unique
DMR<00:00:09.240> weapons<00:00:09.660> as<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.500> may<00:00:10.650> know<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.040> DMR's

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
DMR weapons as you may know the DMR's

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.950 
DMR weapons as you may know the DMR's
were<00:00:11.670> recently<00:00:12.059> patched<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.750> are<00:00:12.870> now

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
were recently patched and are now

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.600 
were recently patched and are now
considerably<00:00:13.559> more<00:00:13.799> effective<00:00:14.250> than<00:00:14.429> they

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
considerably more effective than they

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.000 
considerably more effective than they
were<00:00:14.790> at<00:00:14.969> launch<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.599> qbu<00:00:16.289> wasn't<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.890> my

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
were at launch the qbu wasn't one of my

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.680 
were at launch the qbu wasn't one of my
favorite<00:00:17.369> weapons<00:00:17.699> pre<00:00:17.910> patch<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.449> I've<00:00:18.539> got

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
favorite weapons pre patch and I've got

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.420 
favorite weapons pre patch and I've got
to<00:00:18.810> say<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.230> still<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:20.039> favorite

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
to say it's still not one of my favorite

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.580 
to say it's still not one of my favorite
weapons<00:00:20.730> now<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.570> weapon<00:00:21.930> has<00:00:22.109> quite<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> few

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
weapons now this weapon has quite a few

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.990 
weapons now this weapon has quite a few
really<00:00:22.800> great<00:00:23.070> stats<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.850> it's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
really great stats but it's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.939 
really great stats but it's
unfortunately<00:00:24.600> let<00:00:24.930> down<00:00:25.170> by<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> few<00:00:25.680> poor

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
unfortunately let down by a few poor

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.769 
unfortunately let down by a few poor
stats<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.519> well<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.269> affect<00:00:27.630> its

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
stats as well that really affect its

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.900 
stats as well that really affect its
ability<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.260> perform<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.160> long-range<00:00:29.580> role

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
ability to perform in a long-range role

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.179 
ability to perform in a long-range role
DMR's<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:30.990> able<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.320> drop<00:00:31.560> opponents<00:00:32.099> at

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
DMR's are able to drop opponents at

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
DMR's are able to drop opponents at
range<00:00:32.430> much<00:00:32.730> faster<00:00:33.329> than<00:00:33.450> many<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> fully

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
range much faster than many of the fully

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
range much faster than many of the fully
automatic<00:00:34.530> weapons<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> doesn't<00:00:35.910> mean

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
automatic weapons but this doesn't mean

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
automatic weapons but this doesn't mean
you'll<00:00:36.270> necessarily<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.050> taking<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.590> targets

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you'll necessarily be taking out targets

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
you'll necessarily be taking out targets
quickly<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.940> quicker<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> target<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.899> be

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
quickly the quicker a target can be

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
quickly the quicker a target can be
taken<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.469> reduces<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> time<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.399> target<00:00:41.879> has

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
taken out reduces the time a target has

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
taken out reduces the time a target has
to<00:00:42.210> heal<00:00:42.420> or<00:00:42.719> finds<00:00:42.989> cover<00:00:43.320> weapons<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.280> are

favorable at shorter ranges than most

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.910

DMR's and a high rate of fire you'll be

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.870 
DMR's and a high rate of fire you'll be

getting caught on the reload quite a bit

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.390 
getting caught on the reload quite a bit
it's<00:02:59.390> also<00:02:59.660> still<00:03:00.140> only<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.590> three<00:03:00.890> bullet<00:03:01.190> kill

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
it's also still only a three bullet kill

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.320 
it's also still only a three bullet kill
at<00:03:01.550> close<00:03:01.580> range

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
at close range

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.150 
at close range
so<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.600> CQB<00:03:03.230> you're<00:03:03.500> still<00:03:03.709> going<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.890> be<00:03:03.950> out

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
so in CQB you're still going to be out

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.250 
so in CQB you're still going to be out
shot<00:03:04.459> by<00:03:04.640> automatic<00:03:05.150> weapons<00:03:05.510> unless<00:03:06.020> you're

landing<00:03:06.440> headshots<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.640> really<00:03:07.970> leaves

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
landing headshots this really leaves

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.390 
landing headshots this really leaves
only<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.660> very<00:03:08.900> small<00:03:09.260> window<00:03:09.470> at<00:03:09.890> mid<00:03:10.130> range

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
only a very small window at mid range

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.440 
DMR's but in the case of the qbu i'd
probably<00:03:30.890> steer<00:03:31.400> clear<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.940> magnifier

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
probably steer clear of the magnifier

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.360 
probably steer clear of the magnifier
because<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.140> just<00:03:33.320> encourages<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.100> take

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370

early unlock firing the DMR is always a

early unlock firing the DMR is always a
