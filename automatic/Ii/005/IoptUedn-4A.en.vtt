 not but what it looks like at all let me 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.359
 briefly show you the main idea of ​​this 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.849
 shells there is no menu here 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.859
 everything is on the desktop and everything 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.719
 they setup as it simplified for 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.000
 regular user

 play around with brightness change wallpaper 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.209
 the volume further is already special 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.959
 settings where everything is already better and 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.819
 it was developed by lenovo 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.099
 for example, there is a live smart keyboard 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.000
 call face control so on this is all from 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.060
 chips wine in 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.549
 and further there is a system tab where already 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.209
 you can configure the internet bluetooth 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.379
 personalization traffic and everything in that spirit 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.569
 Only one smartphone is used 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.609
