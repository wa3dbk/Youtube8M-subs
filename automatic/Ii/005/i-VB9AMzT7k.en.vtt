the reason being that both the demon

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.640 
the reason being that both the demon
itself<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.330> fire<00:00:27.539> chains<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> good

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
over 40k on paper in this video and the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.319 
over 40k on paper in this video and the
chains<00:00:34.680> were<00:00:34.860> taken<00:00:35.190> from<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.430> 5k<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:35.969> above

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
chains were taken from a 5k and above

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.750 
chains were taken from a 5k and above
while<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> demon<00:00:37.559> was<00:00:37.710> hidden<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.160> 30<00:00:38.460> can

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
while the demon was hidden for 30 can

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.420 
while the demon was hidden for 30 can
above<00:00:39.200> from<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:40.559> research<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.219> have

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
above from a little research I have

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.340 
above from a little research I have
concluded<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> demon<00:00:42.450> spawns<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
concluded that the demon spawns on the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.160 
concluded that the demon spawns on the
direct<00:00:43.860> melee<00:00:44.309> attack<00:00:44.610> only<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.660> skills<00:00:45.989> like

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
direct melee attack only so skills like

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.430 
direct melee attack only so skills like
sprint<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.770> lowland<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> nonprofit<00:00:48.440> despite

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
sprint and lowland and nonprofit despite

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
sprint and lowland and nonprofit despite
this<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> general<00:00:50.160> uptime<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.969> demon<00:00:51.300> is

this the general uptime for the demon is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.060 
this the general uptime for the demon is
around<00:00:51.750> 75%

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
around 75%

other weapon of this sort this means
that<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> weapon<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.970> pretty<00:01:06.270> good<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that the weapon is pretty good for a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
that the weapon is pretty good for a
barb<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> even<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> market<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.909> due<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
barb and even for a market but due to

barb and even for a market but due to
how<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> proc<00:01:09.869> works<00:01:10.229> Wizards<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.280> probably

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
how the proc works Wizards will probably

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.310 
how the proc works Wizards will probably
not<00:01:11.820> enjoy<00:01:12.180> such<00:01:12.840> high<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:14.630> lastly<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
not enjoy such high up lastly because it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.710 
not enjoy such high up lastly because it
only<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.680> roll<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.220> random<00:01:17.759> properties<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
only can roll to random properties and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
only can roll to random properties and
will<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.990> very<00:01:19.290> hard<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> find<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.400> one

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
will be very hard to find a good one
