 ten people per square meter 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.910
 estimated metro carriages total 500 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.620
 passengers are actually at peak times 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.250
 and a half times more that is why in 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.720
 subway car is nothing accidental 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.420
 every little thing works for a ton to 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.800
 transfer as many passengers as possible and 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 as fast as possible 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.239
 square 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.730
 at 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.930
 reportedly 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 such 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.830
 GDP 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.880
 the white stripe on the doors of the cars is not for 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.519
 beauty 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.010
 when moving, the range creates dikan 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.190
 the human eye instinctively on it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520
 linger as a result on the search 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.110
 beryl will be less time 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.860
 this reduces parking 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.450
 just a split second 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.540
 but the scale of the city is colossal 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.470
 time saving 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260
 only chance wagon 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.280
 subway in the center near 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.520
 the plant is a building 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 in which it was in front of the first building on 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.930
 a factory in mexico which allows 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 say and yet it happens often 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.570
 infrequently 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.200
 the second is the place determining the length of all 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.300
 wagons that 8 to 20 years lived in 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.870
 subway distance between 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.080
 in numbers 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.840
 delivering 20 years therefore more than that 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 immediately responded to the situation 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.740
 opposition was created attack is necessary 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.740
 today is worth 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.200
 newest cars close family friend 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.090
 they already appear on them winning in 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.869
 Moscow metro cabin ventilation 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.230
 problem failure 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.490
 in the history of metro 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 sliding areas after which 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.289
 taken for security 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.289
 now even with much desire 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.279
 as well as those who can play 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.919
 but the doors are led 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.009
 pointers for decision making in 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.859
 soon passengers 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.509
 followers 3 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.509
 17 wagons born 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.639
 Thai authorities 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.469
 lining can be repaired 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.899
 to change the environment 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.559
 narrow information from incombustible and hung 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.609
 because for convenience of repair 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.829
 I was answered no 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.689
 trips 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.129
 at the end of a football match 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.549
 had to change completely 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.510
 this is also a secret for anyone the whole carriage 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.309
 got up for repairs usually for 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.669
 depot chief these trips here 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.059
 brought a lot of trouble 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.900
 so there is this news 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.689
 plastic seats 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.989
 and which allow but firstly the percentage 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.489
 minimize labor intensity 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.199
 well, moto seats 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.559
 you can spoil any thing is all things too 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.459
 can spoil the plastic seats 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 just easier to repair all the cabins whom 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.879
 driver Damir Anna Zina painted 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.579
 matt gray paint leaving the station 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.029
 machinist do not pitch for color and in the dark 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:26.809
 tunnels it does not annoy 10 years 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.249
 appliances dark wall in the corner of the cabin 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.449
 candidates this time in case of an accident 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.139
 passengers can pass through 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.519
 car fare tons tons of drams 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.219
 disposable after actuation 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.219
 it breaks all the pairs spoiled 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.099
 this is May Day metro work stations 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.049
 here on the eternal parking lot is two 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.090
 number one in the cabin soft leather 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.969
 sofas 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.029
 window frames from the economy group 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.599
 On October 15, 1934, it was the first time 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.429
 went from the station Komsomolskaya with words 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.090
 took 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.090
 classic gas 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.680
 last few days has been finalized 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.930
 major influence decided cool 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.139
 players 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.800
 I have Oleg Altovsky Turchinov 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.469
 district department 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.580
 he is a member of the council 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.520
 Moscow first secretary 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.520
 city ​​committee of the party andrew balls 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.330
 first soviet bodies at these moments 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.570
 passenger 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.320
 had to act 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.599
 by myself 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.419
 the doors were board match 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.009
 they can be a machinist others 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.349
 train passengers 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.819
 in each car on tuesday iran in case 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.789
 passengers could stop accidents with 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.089
 ipod unlock 

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.029
 tribune 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.659
 but it would probably be surprising to everyone if 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:02.779
 some 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.929
 passenger for one reason or another took and 

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:05.860
 slowed down 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.270
 composition in the middle of a ton 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.750
 it's the same and without the knowledge of the driver it is in general 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.969
 it would hold 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.999
 to serious disruptions in the schedule 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.379
 I think that we are not much 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.679
 and maybe the opposite and eliminating the stop 

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:23.509
 cranes we increased safety 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:24.139
 movements 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.550
 eliminating stop taps in p 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.800
 salon 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.180
 you can still score each car 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.669
 see 6 by day they are located right above 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:33.419
 engine 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:34.409
 after the fire 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.369
 passengers themselves had to open the hatches 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.509
 eye big cash register fountain 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.539
 over 70 years of this fire extinguishing system is not 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.009
 never used 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.599
 now there is no resident alcohol 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.460
 behind the back corner sofas 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.300
 Need 3 Misha drawn such 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.229
 icon sell passengers anyway 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.840
 can't get them Misha locked up 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.319
 on new and renovated 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.259
 wagons crank fire extinguishers no 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.030
 trains installed automatic 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.840
 fire extinguishing system 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.199
 protocols 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.839
 here is or all offenders year 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.979
 want very much 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.969
 Those who I that specifically this that 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:09.680
 such a 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.999
 this period 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:13.229
 the word itself 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.969
 different instrument 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.759
 so it works 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.060
 We are now working and the plan is still not enough and 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:24.059
 which is very important 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:26.839
 a trace remains 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.839
 law and order

 the bomber launched a powerful bomb 

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.539
 in a crowded wagon will be delivered 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.959
 following at the station

 41 people died and over one hundred were injured 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.570
 however the adjacent wagons affected 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.560
 there was practically no shock wave 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.899
 set see carload training 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.399
 in Russian mitrovich 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.199
 there is no foreign car 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.489
 pass-through is requirements 

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:58.529
 security 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:00.949
 the doors are locked and locked from

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.419
 black boxes 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.830
 This black boxes process fix all 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.830
 events that occur 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.490
 interest on the car 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.330
 runner controls the driver 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.129
 how does he lead whether he admits 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:26.310
 some mistakes or allowing some 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.720
 an error, that is, any moment 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.930
 all this can be checked to give 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.410
 safety pedal 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.420
 hold off otherwise let 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.700
 will not budge abidal specifically 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.389
 will not be done as much as possible 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:43.129
 without permission something will happen 

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.150
 however, an instantaneous recent 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.699
 modern computers allows 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.180
 do without it as the fact that Ukraine is all

 equal confidence man is the most 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.629
