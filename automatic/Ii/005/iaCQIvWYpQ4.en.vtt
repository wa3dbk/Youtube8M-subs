 Oranje 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.239
 less is more 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.609
 True to this motto life she has read it and Christof Pollak 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.449
 Almost two years ago, they planned the house together with an architect 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.230
 and let drive in Krefeld forward remains tightly closed so stay 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.020
 curious looks outside 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.610
 BienenbÃ¼ttel's many overlook light falls over the glazed back in 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.700
 the living area 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.610
 the builders have their own ideas on each of the 170 square meters 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.850
 implemented 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.210
 We do not want to in a house in the house abdominal muscle strain 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.730
 and to realize creatively as well as become unusable or the construction phase 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.750
 Resources were fun and it should finally be a bit too 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.340
 Acting bigger than celebrities is actually why all the rooms are very very 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.770
 open 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.820
 so that has room again for himself and his work and even if they are completely 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 different rooms have changed contact with each other 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 Matthias Lazar is a trained chef 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.079
 He has not worked in the job for a long time but is the kitchen 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.069
 his kingdom rausgucken chamber while cooking but not 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.380
 yes, it just does not mean to me 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.630
 we wanted to have the light on the work surface in the workplace 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.670
 here with more flights also not yet 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.729
 And of course the look from the outside was natural dominate 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.950
 Christof Carigiet himself made some of the artworks in the house 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.080
 practical reasons 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.579
 Actually, that's just a coincidence 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.999
 meanwhile, has a control box and here's the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.190
 Carstensen is not disturbed and so are Mans worried 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.550
 Kl by ten percent 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.570
 Patrick Nuo could still give a bit of structure 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.999
 Christopher Wietel wanted to have no hits in the house 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.239
 somehow he has to come upstairs to compromise a staircase 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.689
 who seems to hover who he has a little care himself 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.689
 we can make these stairs without railing 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.189
 and 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.409
 I had thought then to be able to ask the building office, I say 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.380
 raises his head 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.949
 I confirm that we do not have children 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.409
 and then that should be 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.349
 not possible 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.290
 on the first floor, the computer scientist spends every minute of his group 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.650
 Here he listens to music sometimes writes and produces his own house 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:49.159
 Berlin min 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.159
 Emden 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.899
 now in a small room of the house in the bathroom 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:02.319
 Due to the big rooms these had to be best from now on we are turning 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.969
 pushed us together and 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.969
 because the country now again to Julio Cesar 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:17.249
 Google wanted to have a nice big WÃ¶rdemann we just have one 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.670
 Room on the house put on it and that they have seen was found

 Rheine 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.799
 The creative work on her house has parried Christoph and many a crisis 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:28.459
 enjoyed 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.230
 Now that your dream home is done, you're bored to say it 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.940
 the construction of a second house in this simple style is not 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.760
 locked out
