we've got to keep the ball we've got to
be<00:02:04.590> patient<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.189> we've<00:02:06.119> got<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> counter

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
be patient with it we've got a counter

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.969 
be patient with it we've got a counter
though<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.290> will<00:02:07.409> try<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.740> attack

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
though I think they will try and attack

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.710 
though I think they will try and attack
us<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.399> we've<00:02:08.819> got<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> make<00:02:09.119> sure<00:02:09.179> good<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
us so we've got to make sure good on the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.570 
us so we've got to make sure good on the
counter<00:02:10.080> well<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.379> expecting<00:02:10.649> Luis<00:02:11.220> Suarez

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
counter well I'm expecting Luis Suarez

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.699 
counter well I'm expecting Luis Suarez
to<00:02:11.730> play<00:02:11.970> Neymar<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.840> play<00:02:13.020> Messi<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
to play Neymar to play Messi to

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.589 
to play Neymar to play Messi to
so<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.040> front<00:02:14.340> three<00:02:14.609> is<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.359> really

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
so that front three is gonna be really

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.599 
so that front three is gonna be really
solid<00:02:16.049> in<00:02:16.560> midfield<00:02:16.859> that<00:02:17.280> we've<00:02:17.370> got<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.489> bit

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
solid in midfield that we've got a bit

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.550 
solid in midfield that we've got a bit
of<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.730> problem<00:02:17.969> I<00:02:18.269> don't<00:02:18.629> really<00:02:18.989> see<00:02:19.260> sherry

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
of a problem I don't really see sherry

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.530 
of a problem I don't really see sherry
starting<00:02:20.159> I<00:02:20.310> think<00:02:20.549> racket<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.180> will<00:02:21.329> come

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
starting I think racket that will come

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.270 
starting I think racket that will come
in<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:21.930> then<00:02:22.500> you've<00:02:22.650> got<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:22.829> problem<00:02:23.099> with

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
in and then you've got a problem with

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.339 
in and then you've got a problem with
any<00:02:23.459> ester<00:02:23.819> being<00:02:24.000> injured<00:02:24.299> it<00:02:24.450> could<00:02:24.689> pave

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
any ester being injured it could pave

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.800 
any ester being injured it could pave
the<00:02:25.530> way<00:02:25.560> finally<00:02:26.430> for<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:26.939> start<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.390> midfield

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
the way finally for a start in midfield

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.750 
the way finally for a start in midfield
for<00:02:27.930> Raffi<00:02:28.349> near<00:02:28.560> Alcantara<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.370> hope<00:02:29.549> that's

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
for Raffi near Alcantara I hope that's

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.660 
for Raffi near Alcantara I hope that's
the<00:02:29.849> case<00:02:29.939> anyway<00:02:30.680> defensive<00:02:31.680> midfield<00:02:32.069> we're

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the case anyway defensive midfield we're

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.800 
the case anyway defensive midfield we're
looking<00:02:32.909> at<00:02:33.000> probably<00:02:33.209> Sergio<00:02:33.569> Busquets

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
looking at probably Sergio Busquets

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.740 
looking at probably Sergio Busquets
again<00:02:34.760> left<00:02:35.760> back<00:02:36.000> Jordi<00:02:36.389> Alba<00:02:36.510> will

again left back Jordi Alba will

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.940 
again left back Jordi Alba will
definitely<00:02:37.170> return<00:02:37.469> after<00:02:37.799> all<00:02:37.859> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
definitely return after all the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.220 
definitely return after all the
controversy<00:02:38.599> surrounding<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:39.780> know<00:02:39.900> leaving

although Montoya probably deserves a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.940 
Bartra starts used to be played again

the Catalan Cup or in midweek Ian's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.589 
the Catalan Cup or in midweek Ian's
espanol<00:02:53.489> I'd<00:02:53.609> like<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.000> see<00:02:54.180> him<00:02:54.269> start

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
espanol I'd like to see him start

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.390 
espanol I'd like to see him start
whether<00:02:55.290> he<00:02:55.530> will<00:02:55.739> though<00:02:55.889> I'm<00:02:55.980> really<00:02:56.189> not

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
whether he will though I'm really not

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.250 
whether he will though I'm really not
sure<00:02:56.639> I'm<00:02:56.760> not<00:02:56.790> sure<00:02:56.939> if<00:02:57.120> Luis<00:02:57.359> Enrique<00:02:57.870> will

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.050 
sure I'm not sure if Luis Enrique will
go<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.680> him<00:02:58.859> but<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.069> think<00:02:59.280> Bartra<00:02:59.730> deserves

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
go with him but I think Bartra deserves

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.729 
go with him but I think Bartra deserves
a<00:03:00.180> start<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.959> know<00:03:01.079> if<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.290> can<00:03:01.409> play<00:03:01.560> him<00:03:01.680> in

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
his game and he's improving but he does

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.439 
his game and he's improving but he does
need<00:03:16.950> first-team<00:03:17.430> opportunities<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:18.150> hope<00:03:18.299> he

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
need first-team opportunities so hope he

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.229
