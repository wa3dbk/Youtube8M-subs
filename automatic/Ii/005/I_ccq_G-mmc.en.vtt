standard stainless steel kay some kegs
look<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.920> aluminum<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:14.820> believing<00:00:15.210> they're

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
look like aluminum but believing they're

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330 
look like aluminum but believing they're
all<00:00:15.420> stainless<00:00:15.929> these<00:00:16.109> days<00:00:16.349> and<00:00:16.679> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.280> a

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
basically the same kind of connector as

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.180 
basically the same kind of connector as
we<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.770> our<00:00:23.160> towers<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> first<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.980> buy<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
we have on our towers so first you buy a

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.460 
we have on our towers so first you buy a
tower<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:27.270> get<00:00:27.449> an<00:00:27.539> old<00:00:27.689> ring<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.199> wet<00:00:28.439> it

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
tower you get an old ring and you wet it

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.790 
tower you get an old ring and you wet it
which<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.699> kind<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:32.090> get<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> wet<00:00:33.300> enough<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
which I just kind of get a wet enough to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.270 
which I just kind of get a wet enough to
stick<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> groove<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:37.200> bottom<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.190> the
