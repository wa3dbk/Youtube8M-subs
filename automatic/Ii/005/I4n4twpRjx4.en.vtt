 os formerly known as the arcus regime 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.309
 it's an exotic automatic rifle created 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.530
 for the arcus foundation even though I already 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.600
 it's not a standard rifle it's still in 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.050
 active service and is used by the

 of the land to which the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.080
 guardians 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.120
 all the equipment belonging to the 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.280
 vanguard whether weapons or aircraft 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.920
 are labeled with the acronyms of this 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.870
 organization all weapons of the arsenal 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.940
 of the avant-garde are customizable 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.150

 surf engineers designed you the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.280
 regime based on the diagrams 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.110
 recovered from the golden age by having 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.690
 discontinued in its production by the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.970
 shortage of intelligent matter the few 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.950
 rifles that remain in circulation are 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.700
 very appreciated by those lucky 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.619
 guardians that we own 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.180
 it is rumored that much of the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.039
 manufacture of these rifles were 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.079
 delivered to the nine so that their 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.700
 South agent could trade with them 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.909
 in order that only the guardians 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.380
 hardened people made use of him as 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.869
 you see guards there's not much history 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.780
 about the southern regime or there are not many 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.340
 data neither nor much smells so 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.079
