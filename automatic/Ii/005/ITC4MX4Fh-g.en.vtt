pretty tough to do construction is

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.520 
pretty tough to do construction is
simple<00:02:45.300> start<00:02:45.989> with<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> graham<00:02:46.500> cracker

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530

simple start with a graham cracker
follow<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.670> up<00:02:47.820> with<00:02:48.060> some<00:02:49.050> chocolate<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.769> this

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
follow it up with some chocolate in this

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.520 
follow it up with some chocolate in this
case<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.700> 1/4<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.720> full<00:02:51.930> sized<00:02:52.140> Hershey

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.270 
right followed by the final graham
cracker<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.140> top<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.500> all<00:02:58.590> off<00:02:58.620> now<00:02:59.070> if<00:02:59.160> you're

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
cracker to top it all off now if you're

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.340 
cracker to top it all off now if you're
using<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.700> s'more<00:02:59.970> Express<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:00.660> something<00:03:01.170> like

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
using a s'more Express or something like

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.640 
using a s'more Express or something like
it

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
it

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.220 
it
you<00:03:01.860> need<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.100> slowly<00:03:02.489> drop<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.360> lid<00:03:03.600> on<00:03:03.810> top

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
you need to slowly drop the lid on top

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.770 
you need to slowly drop the lid on top
so<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.560> don't<00:03:04.709> destroy<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:06.209> little<00:03:06.450> s'more

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
so you don't destroy the little s'more

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.320 
so you don't destroy the little s'more
construction<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.680> inside<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.850> next<00:03:09.120> part

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
construction on the inside the next part

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330 
construction on the inside the next part
is<00:03:09.420> probably<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.140> most<00:03:10.320> fun<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.160> where

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
is probably the most fun this is where

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.310 
is probably the most fun this is where
your<00:03:11.489> s'more<00:03:11.850> becomes<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.390> s'more<00:03:12.780> not<00:03:13.050> just

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
your s'more becomes a s'more not just

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.140 
your s'more becomes a s'more not just
some<00:03:13.530> crackers<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.370> marshmallow<00:03:14.850> and
