00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.550 

I'm<00:00:02.820> here<00:00:03.120> inside<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:05.240> 2006<00:00:06.240> Ford<00:00:06.810> Taurus<00:00:07.259> and

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
I'm here inside a 2006 Ford Taurus and

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.580 
I'm here inside a 2006 Ford Taurus and
I've<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.820> new<00:00:09.590> keyless<00:00:10.590> entry<00:00:12.349> dongle<00:00:13.349> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
I've got a new keyless entry dongle and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.589 
I've got a new keyless entry dongle and
I<00:00:13.889> want<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.160> program<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.969> car<00:00:15.240> as<00:00:15.420> you

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I want to program it for this car as you

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.820 
I want to program it for this car as you
can<00:00:15.719> see<00:00:15.929> now<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:17.070> doesn't<00:00:17.279> work<00:00:17.580> at<00:00:18.090> all<00:00:18.830> here

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
can see now it doesn't work at all here

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.910 
can see now it doesn't work at all here
I<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.460> old<00:00:20.609> set<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.060> keys<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.769> you<00:00:22.769> can

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
I have the old set of keys and you can

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.400 
I have the old set of keys and you can
hear<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.539> unlocks<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> locks<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.230> one

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
hear the unlocks and locks this one

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.029 
hear the unlocks and locks this one
works<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.960> instructions<00:00:28.260> here

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
works so I have the instructions here

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.110 
works so I have the instructions here
for<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:30.720> new<00:00:31.439> dongle<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.579> seems<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
for the new dongle and it seems like I

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.180 
for the new dongle and it seems like I
have<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.329> maybe<00:00:33.630> program<00:00:34.170> both<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.590> these<00:00:34.710> at

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
have to maybe program both of these at

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.540 
have to maybe program both of these at
the<00:00:35.430> same<00:00:35.579> time<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.350> that<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.649> car<00:00:37.860> recognizes

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the same time so that the car recognizes

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.160 
the same time so that the car recognizes
there<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.030> fact<00:00:39.059> two<00:00:39.300> dongles<00:00:39.809> instead<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
there are in fact two dongles instead of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
there are in fact two dongles instead of
just<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> go<00:00:41.610> ahead

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
just one so I'm just going to go ahead

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
just one so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:00:41.850> follow<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> instructions<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.809> you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and follow the instructions so you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.799 
and follow the instructions so you
insert<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> key<00:00:43.910> turn<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.120> key<00:00:45.390> ignition

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
insert the key turn the key ignition

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.260 
insert the key turn the key ignition
back<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.350> forth<00:00:46.590> eight<00:00:46.860> times<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
back and forth eight times and on the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270 
back and forth eight times and on the
eighth<00:00:48.390> time<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.079> leave<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> on

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
eighth time you leave it in the on

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
eighth time you leave it in the on
position<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:51.390> those<00:00:51.570> eight<00:00:51.750> transitions<00:00:52.410> have

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
position of those eight transitions have

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.959 
position of those eight transitions have
to<00:00:52.739> happen<00:00:53.070> within<00:00:53.280> 10<00:00:53.610> seconds<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
to happen within 10 seconds and then you

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.090 
to happen within 10 seconds and then you
after<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> doors<00:00:57.329> lock<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.809> unlock

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
after the doors lock and unlock

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
after the doors lock and unlock
automatically<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.340> their<00:00:59.489> own<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.090> doors<00:01:00.329> are

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
automatically on their own the doors are

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.020 
automatically on their own the doors are
unlocked<00:01:00.570> right<00:01:01.140> now<00:01:01.399> you<00:01:02.399> push<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> button<00:01:02.760> on

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
unlocked right now you push a button on

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750 
unlocked right now you push a button on
this<00:01:03.239> dongle<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.229> should<00:01:04.409> program<00:01:04.769> this

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this dongle and that should program this

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.520 
this dongle and that should program this
dongle<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.570> within<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.200> door<00:01:07.350> should

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
dongle and then within the door should

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.260 
dongle and then within the door should
block<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> unlock<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.460> within<00:01:08.850> seven

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
block it unlock and then within seven

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.440 
block it unlock and then within seven
seconds<00:01:09.689> press<00:01:10.670> any<00:01:11.670> button<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.299> new

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
seconds press any button on the new

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.969 
seconds press any button on the new
dongle<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.260> should<00:01:13.439> program<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> new

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
dongle and that should program the new

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.510 
dongle and that should program the new
dongle<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.430> let's<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> try<00:01:17.330> one<00:01:18.330> two<00:01:19.520> three

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.940 
that's the new one let's turn it off
let's<00:01:58.040> try<00:01:58.250> this<00:02:00.610> yep<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.850> new<00:02:01.970> dongle<00:02:02.360> is

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
let's try this yep the new dongle is

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.590 
let's try this yep the new dongle is
programmed

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.969 

let's<00:02:08.600> test<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.200> old<00:02:09.320> one<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.560> make<00:02:09.710> sure<00:02:09.740> it

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
let's test the old one to make sure it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.590 
let's test the old one to make sure it
works<00:02:10.160> still<00:02:13.570> yep<00:02:14.570> all<00:02:15.320> set
