00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
of positive feedback it took me probably

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.390 
of positive feedback it took me probably
about<00:01:05.720> maybe<00:01:06.720> 10<00:01:07.049> hours<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.799> split<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> up

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
about maybe 10 hours but I split it up

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.560 
about maybe 10 hours but I split it up
over<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:09.570> days<00:01:09.810> because<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:10.950> off<00:01:11.360> two<00:01:12.360> days

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
over two days because I was off two days

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.090 
over two days because I was off two days
in<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> row<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:14.180> um<00:01:17.390> some<00:01:18.390> cons<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.200> when

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
in a row and um some cons about it when

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.770 
in a row and um some cons about it when
you<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> twist<00:01:20.820> method<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.540> does<00:01:21.750> look

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you do the twist method it does look

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.440 
you do the twist method it does look
more<00:01:22.200> natural<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:24.000> i<00:01:24.030> would<00:01:24.270> suggest

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
more natural so i would suggest

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.600 
more natural so i would suggest
definitely<00:01:25.200> doing<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.439> around<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.920> front

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
definitely doing that around the front

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.140 
definitely doing that around the front
of<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.060> hair<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
of your hair but in the back is kind of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
of your hair but in the back is kind of
hard<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> twist<00:01:31.170> method<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.130> i

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
hard to do that twist method so i

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
hard to do that twist method so i
started<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> braid<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> back<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
started out with a braid in the back and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.990 
started out with a braid in the back and
then<00:01:35.159> started<00:01:35.640> twisting<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.930> went<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
then started twisting as i went down the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.190 
then started twisting as i went down the
tho<00:01:39.000> down<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:41.750> another<00:01:42.750> con

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
tho down there and then another con

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.710 
tho down there and then another con
would<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.939> it's<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.240> heavy<00:01:45.680> like<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.720> can't

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
would be it's really heavy like I can't

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.210 
would be it's really heavy like I can't
put<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.409> hair<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> ponytail

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
put all of this hair in a ponytail

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.999 
put all of this hair in a ponytail
because<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.909> way<00:01:51.060> too<00:01:51.119> much<00:01:51.360> hair<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
because it's just way too much hair and

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.280 
because it's just way too much hair and
sometimes<00:01:53.009> when<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.479> we<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.869> shower<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
sometimes when you we have to shower you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770 
sometimes when you we have to shower you
have<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> bun<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.299> it's
