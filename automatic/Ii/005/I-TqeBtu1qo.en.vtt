click<00:01:14.270> on<00:01:14.479> DC<00:01:15.170> Universe<00:01:15.590> I<00:01:15.890> meant<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.430> click<00:01:16.610> on

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
click on DC Universe I meant to click on

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.540 
click on DC Universe I meant to click on
the<00:01:17.000> old<00:01:17.119> republic<00:01:17.240> well<00:01:18.110> that's<00:01:18.259> okay<00:01:18.680> right

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
the old republic well that's okay right

now<00:01:19.729> we're<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.030> PVE<00:01:20.420> phase<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:23.500> guess<00:01:24.500> we

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
now we're in the PVE phase so I guess we

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.010 
now we're in the PVE phase so I guess we
won't<00:01:24.830> be<00:01:24.860> going<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.700> smashing<00:01:26.390> level<00:01:26.720> fours

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020

and calling that gameplay I'm not into

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.400 
and calling that gameplay I'm not into
that<00:01:30.110> anyway<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:32.240> don't<00:01:32.660> honestly<00:01:33.050> don't

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
that anyway I I don't honestly don't

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.440 
that anyway I I don't honestly don't
remember<00:01:33.500> how<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.860> play<00:01:33.920> either<00:01:34.250> um<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:34.970> know

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
remember how to play either um I know

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.190 
remember how to play either um I know
that<00:01:35.800> this<00:01:36.800> does<00:01:37.039> some<00:01:37.250> sort<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.580> kick<00:01:38.170> okay<00:01:39.170> I

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
that this does some sort of kick okay I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.900 
that this does some sort of kick okay I
guess<00:01:39.410> that<00:01:39.560> doesn't<00:01:39.740> help<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:40.070> drop<00:01:40.340> really

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910
