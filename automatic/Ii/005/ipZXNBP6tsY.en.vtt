white ink drawings these images serve as

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.250

a<00:04:09.470> transition<00:04:10.280> from<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.819> classical<00:04:11.389> dance<00:04:11.659> to

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.360 

this<00:04:27.090> seems<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.750> me<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.800> best<00:04:29.010> sense<00:04:29.250> of

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
this seems to me in the best sense of

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.170 
this seems to me in the best sense of
the<00:04:29.430> word<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:30.090> be<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:31.250> world<00:04:32.250> collaborative

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
the word to be a world collaborative

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.840 
the word to be a world collaborative
yeah<00:04:33.930> I<00:04:34.290> think<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.610> think<00:04:35.640> that

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
yeah I think so and I think that

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.610 
yeah I think so and I think that
flamenco<00:04:36.510> music<00:04:36.720> from<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.050> south<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.410> Spain

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
flamenco music from the south of Spain

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.310 
flamenco music from the south of Spain
just<00:04:37.830> given<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.790> people<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.150> came<00:04:39.600> and

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
just given the the people that came and

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.590 
just given the the people that came and
went<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:41.010> Andalusia<00:04:41.670> and<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.090> South<00:04:42.300> they're

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
went to Andalusia and the South they're

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.530 
went to Andalusia and the South they're
created<00:04:43.470> flamenco<00:04:44.130> as<00:04:44.370> what<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.090> call<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.450> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
created flamenco as what I call it the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.090 
created flamenco as what I call it the
first<00:04:45.750> world<00:04:46.020> music<00:04:46.200> just<00:04:46.560> because<00:04:46.710> so<00:04:46.950> many

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
first world music just because so many

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.160 
first world music just because so many
different<00:04:47.520> cultures<00:04:47.700> had<00:04:48.030> an<00:04:48.120> influence<00:04:48.450> so

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
different cultures had an influence so

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.410 
different cultures had an influence so
world<00:04:49.410> music<00:04:49.770> isn't<00:04:49.920> really<00:04:50.310> anything<00:04:50.580> new<00:04:51.000> I

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
world music isn't really anything new I

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.150 
world music isn't really anything new I
think<00:04:51.750> it's<00:04:52.200> kind<00:04:52.380> of<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.500> hip<00:04:52.650> term<00:04:52.920> that

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
think it's kind of a hip term that

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.860 
think it's kind of a hip term that
everybody<00:04:53.490> uses<00:04:53.700> now<00:04:53.940> but<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.150> think<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.510> you

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
everybody uses now but I think that you

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.510 
everybody uses now but I think that you
know<00:04:54.990> if<00:04:55.080> your<00:04:55.200> definition<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:56.070> number<00:04:56.400> of

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
know if your definition is a number of

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.310 
know if your definition is a number of
cultures<00:04:56.970> had<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.240> hand<00:04:57.540> in<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:57.780> like<00:04:57.930> my<00:04:58.080> friend

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
cultures had a hand in it like my friend

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320 
cultures had a hand in it like my friend
Richard<00:04:58.560> Rene<00:04:58.800> says<00:04:59.040> music<00:04:59.220> doesn't<00:04:59.760> have<00:04:59.880> DNA

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
Richard Rene says music doesn't have DNA
