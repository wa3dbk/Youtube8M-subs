 become a machine of fortune 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.200
 that multiplies the salary to 130,000 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.599
 Government employees provide benefits 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.580

 economic situation that most of 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.050
 public and private employees of the country 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.970
 All these benefits are paid by the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.000
 Costa Ricans with our taxes 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.890
 they are a privileged class see and compare 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.320
 their working condition with which they 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.340

 the collective conventions 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.680
 a collective of recope is one of the most 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.460
 of the country dates from the end of the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 again to 1600 employees 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 administrative of schools and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 maintenance has some of the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.720
 most criticized benefits in the sector 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.910
 public for example with a thousand colones in 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.160
 Recope areas reach to buy 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.110
 three pasts since part of the

 Feeding of associates is paid 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.540
 by the government this is established by 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.640
 Article 152 of the collective agreement 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.949
 In addition, employees are entitled to 35 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.470
 a thousand colones a year to buy glasses 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.600
 although the worker does not need them 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.880
 who gets married received a prize of 40 thousand 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.250
 colones and if you have a child you have right 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.890
 to 28 thousand extra colones in his salary 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.140
 In addition, the company is obliged to give 6 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.960
 million 25 thousand colones a year for 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.510
 union activities plus 5 million 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.260
 600 thousand to buy last 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.450
 employees and 11 million 235 thousand colones 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.450
 annuals for bees studying the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.090
 employees all this money adds to the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.760
 20 severance pay that is paid to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.400
 employees if they are dismissed or when 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.400
 they get pensioned plus they are paid all 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.160
 annuity years 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.260
 percent of exclusive dedication 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.600
 review and professional career all 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.340
 these processes end up duplicating and 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.520
 up to tripling the salary of the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.860
 1,600 recope workers that kind of 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.420
 excesses and privileges are those 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.240
 exist in this country in the sector 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.760
 public and that unfortunately is not 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.860
 wants to enter since June 12, 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.840
 We asked the president to issue a 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.430
 guideline and stella now that the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.490
 president of the republic has not 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.190
 answered there are collective conventions to 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.530
 buzz that have abusive clauses and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.730
 those collective conventions 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.070
 evidently they are to the detriment not 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.590
 only from the institution but from the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.480
 been in general the convention 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.600
 Recope collective wins next 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.220
 first of January 2015 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.140
 recognizes the workers' union 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.930
 these benefits 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.870
 as abusive and think reduce the we have 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.970
 accepted the vote the votes of the room that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.370
 have come to do in depression the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.250
 workers but we still consider 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.830
 that we will continue giving the fight because 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.690
 hit us more because I consider 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.430
 that is a right of all according to a 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.560
 study of the aresep the employees of 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.870
 recope are the most expensive in the sector 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.540
 energy costs Costa Ricans 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.150
 26 million colones a year each 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.920
 out of a total of 42 billion 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.660
 colones the government of luis william 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.110
 solÃ­s has the opportunity to denounce 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.230
 excessive abuse thinks about doing it 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.370
 We will proceed to report it before the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.890
 November 30 of this year for which 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.140
 we are doing a step-by-step analysis 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.220
 step by point of the convention 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.230
 for 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.129
 elaborate the proposal 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.129
 a birth 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.659
 the japdeva union also adds a 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.519
 series of benefits that cost the 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.400
 country 11 billion colones 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.690
 in addition to the 28 billion 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.910
 colones who pay wages per year 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.460
 and each of the 1800 employees of 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.040
 japdeva is left with an average of 22 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.320
 million colones a year among those 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.140
 benefits is the free food 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.060
 24 hours to the employees and if they 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.790
 they do not want to eat they are given boxes of 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.230
 milk so they can take it home like this 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.660
 the collective agreement establishes it 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.640
 also the employees of japdeva have 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.090
 right to 30 business days of vacation 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.460
 the year they also continue to train the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.400
 government completes 100% of the 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.130
 salary each mollero takes between 200 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.070
 300 thousand additional colones to his salary 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.840
 per month to make productivity the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.110
 government has a savings fund 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.600
 which deposits 5% of the salary every month 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.850
 the worker and the employee only puts 3 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.390
 percent of your salary this convention 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.820
 wins next 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.690
 December, what does the union of 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:56.400
 japdeva there is no problem that 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.830
 we touch articles truth in what yes 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.750
 ensures from now sintrajap is that 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.810
 No article that is intended to 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.790
 improve and we will accommodate for a 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.280
 negotiation will end the government of 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.860
 guillermo solids with these benefits to 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.590
 these public employees me what am I 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.300
 doing is an analysis that analysis there 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.780
 what to do in economic terms 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.050
 and administrative to take a 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.240
 decision of what are those items of 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.400
 the collective agreement that would be 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.770
 I need to rethink how about 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.080
 there are also four other conventions that 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.000
 they expire like the one in the guide 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.699
 union instead of reducing 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.889
 benefits demand more details 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.130
 tomorrow in the stellar news edition 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.130
