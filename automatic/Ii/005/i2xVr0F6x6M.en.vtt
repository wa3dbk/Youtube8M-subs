best<00:02:54.939> position<00:02:55.389> for<00:02:55.419> him<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.829> would<00:02:56.980> have

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
best position for him so you would have

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.159

and<00:03:04.209> he<00:03:04.599> did<00:03:04.810> score<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.139> most<00:03:05.260> their<00:03:06.269> position

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
and he did score the most their position

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
as his passing wasn't very good but

through<00:04:57.429> on<00:04:57.519> goal<00:04:57.729> I<00:04:57.969> mainly<00:04:58.360> just<00:04:58.479> powered<00:04:58.779> it

00:04:58.949 --> 00:04:58.959 
through on goal I mainly just powered it

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.929 
through on goal I mainly just powered it
from<00:04:59.110> close<00:04:59.319> range<00:04:59.439> as<00:04:59.800> it<00:05:00.069> basically<00:05:00.489> went<00:05:00.789> in

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:00.939 
from close range as it basically went in

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.149 
from close range as it basically went in
the<00:05:01.029> top<00:05:01.209> corner<00:05:01.419> every<00:05:02.050> single<00:05:02.379> time<00:05:02.559> and<00:05:02.769> I

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
the top corner every single time and I

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.589 
the top corner every single time and I
thought<00:05:03.309> most<00:05:03.429> was<00:05:03.639> shot<00:05:03.789> dead<00:05:03.999> most<00:05:04.239> of<00:05:04.360> shots

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599

well<00:05:27.669> as<00:05:27.789> is<00:05:27.879> 99<00:05:28.360> dirty<00:05:28.599> and<00:05:28.989> 85<00:05:29.499> buns<00:05:29.739> made<00:05:30.309> it

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:30.429 
well as is 99 dirty and 85 buns made it

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:31.799 
well as is 99 dirty and 85 buns made it
really<00:05:30.699> really<00:05:30.849> easy<00:05:31.059> to<00:05:31.419> weave<00:05:31.629> between

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:31.809 
really really easy to weave between

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.769 
really really easy to weave between
defenders<00:05:32.759> one<00:05:33.759> bad<00:05:34.029> thing<00:05:34.059> though<00:05:34.479> is<00:05:34.719> that

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:34.779 
defenders one bad thing though is that

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.259 
defenders one bad thing though is that
he<00:05:35.289> does<00:05:35.589> only<00:05:35.829> have<00:05:36.039> three<00:05:36.279> star<00:05:36.489> skills<00:05:36.819> so

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:37.269 
he does only have three star skills so

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:39.239 
he does only have three star skills so
that<00:05:37.300> is<00:05:37.509> a<00:05:37.539> bit<00:05:37.989> of<00:05:38.139> a<00:05:38.169> downside<00:05:38.679> would<00:05:38.919> prefer

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:39.249 
that is a bit of a downside would prefer

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:41.129 
that is a bit of a downside would prefer
if<00:05:39.399> he<00:05:39.459> had<00:05:39.550> four<00:05:39.759> star<00:05:39.969> skills<00:05:40.269> but<00:05:40.779> it<00:05:40.869> didn't

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
if he had four star skills but it didn't

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.409 
if he had four star skills but it didn't
matter<00:05:41.409> too<00:05:41.829> much<00:05:41.860> as<00:05:42.399> you<00:05:42.849> still<00:05:43.089> scoring

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
matter too much as you still scoring

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.879 
matter too much as you still scoring
plenty<00:05:43.809> of<00:05:43.869> goals<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.349> going<00:05:44.499> around<00:05:44.589> plenty

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
plenty of goals and going around plenty

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.699 
plenty of goals and going around plenty
of<00:05:45.069> defenders<00:05:45.490> there's<00:05:46.389> also<00:05:46.569> is<00:05:46.749> 81<00:05:47.289> strength

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:47.709 
of defenders there's also is 81 strength

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:51.809 
of defenders there's also is 81 strength
which<00:05:48.429> was<00:05:48.459> also<00:05:49.059> really<00:05:49.479> useful<00:05:49.599> and<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:51.550> just

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
which was also really useful and it just

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.609 
which was also really useful and it just
helps<00:05:52.179> really<00:05:52.449> go<00:05:52.599> through<00:05:52.869> past<00:05:53.229> the<00:05:53.409> past

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:53.619 
helps really go through past the past

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.139 
helps really go through past the past
defenders<00:05:53.979> didn't<00:05:54.459> really<00:05:54.610> get<00:05:54.759> muscle<00:05:55.059> off

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:55.149 
defenders didn't really get muscle off

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:57.089 
defenders didn't really get muscle off
the<00:05:55.269> ball<00:05:55.419> and<00:05:55.629> what<00:05:56.169> surprised<00:05:56.649> me<00:05:56.800> as<00:05:57.039> a

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
the ball and what surprised me as a

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.619 
the ball and what surprised me as a
smaller<00:05:57.579> player<00:05:57.849> was<00:05:58.059> letting<00:05:58.300> managed<00:05:58.509> to

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
smaller player was letting managed to

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.409 
smaller player was letting managed to
win<00:05:58.719> lots<00:05:59.079> and<00:05:59.259> lots<00:05:59.379> of<00:05:59.469> headers<00:05:59.769> so<00:06:00.419> overall

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
win lots and lots of headers so overall

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.569 
win lots and lots of headers so overall
do<00:06:01.569> I<00:06:01.599> think<00:06:01.959> that<00:06:02.199> he's<00:06:02.439> worth<00:06:02.769> it<00:06:03.009> but<00:06:03.459> if<00:06:03.519> you

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:03.579 
do I think that he's worth it but if you

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:05.100 
do I think that he's worth it but if you
compared<00:06:03.939> someone<00:06:04.389> like<00:06:04.599> team<00:06:04.869> this<00:06:04.989> season

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
compared someone like team this season

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.719 
compared someone like team this season
Molina<00:06:05.349> who<00:06:05.709> is<00:06:05.739> a<00:06:05.860> similar<00:06:06.279> player<00:06:06.489> in<00:06:06.639> the

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
Molina who is a similar player in the

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.029 
Molina who is a similar player in the
k-league<00:06:06.969> they're<00:06:07.539> miles<00:06:07.869> apart<00:06:08.229> even<00:06:08.919> though

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
k-league they're miles apart even though

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.739 
k-league they're miles apart even though
Rana<00:06:09.279> doesn't<00:06:09.729> have<00:06:09.879> the<00:06:09.999> four-star<00:06:10.449> skills

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:10.749 
Rana doesn't have the four-star skills

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:12.600 
Rana doesn't have the four-star skills
like<00:06:10.929> Molina<00:06:11.199> he's<00:06:11.679> pretty<00:06:12.039> much<00:06:12.279> greater

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
like Molina he's pretty much greater

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.279 
like Molina he's pretty much greater
everything<00:06:13.179> else<00:06:13.329> was<00:06:13.569> shot<00:06:13.779> impressing<00:06:14.199> me

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
everything else was shot impressing me

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.619 
everything else was shot impressing me
the<00:06:14.379> most<00:06:14.559> he's<00:06:15.339> also<00:06:15.579> likely<00:06:15.909> to<00:06:16.089> come<00:06:16.360> down<00:06:16.599> a

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
the most he's also likely to come down a

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.719 
the most he's also likely to come down a
price<00:06:16.929> per<00:06:17.409> for<00:06:17.649> wednesday<00:06:18.069> so<00:06:18.129> it's<00:06:18.429> worth

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
price per for wednesday so it's worth

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.879

getting between now and then as he's
only<00:06:21.459> you<00:06:22.209> should<00:06:22.419> go<00:06:22.569> down<00:06:22.779> from<00:06:23.110> sort<00:06:23.499> of<00:06:23.559> 50k
