00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.850
 so sir vernet me I am a 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 thief if I steal a car I'm going 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.300
 remove the wires from the battery is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.030
 like that the tracker will be disabled no 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.110
 yes you can try I think 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.640
 many thieves the bottom but 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.970
 unfortunately we have a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 technology that recalls autonomous it's 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.870
 housings that without self powered 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.720
 you have an autonomy of 7 years so 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.239
 we no longer connect the enclosures 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.250
 and tracker on the car battery 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.629
 an autonomy of 7 years but how you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.880
 do finally so that is to say that the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.559
 casing without being recharged is active 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.809
 for seven years you are protected 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.250
 for seven years quite there we 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.620
 have it's really it's a 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.680
 important technical innovation 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.140
 we optimized the consumption 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.970
 electric so that the the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.530
 case can last for this period 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.700
 can not do anything for my phone 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.600
 portable because I at the end of a 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.830
 day to listen we have not yet 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 worked cell phones but 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.869
 for sure we could also do 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.740
 some progress there are more and more 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.720
 of electric cars 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.700
 now every constructor we had 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.710
 also a lotto offers his solution 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.939
 electric but then I guess 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.409
 it's a problem for you because the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.600
 tracker it has to pump a lot of 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.280
 battery and therefore it decreases the autonomy 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.869
 when we have an electric vehicle then 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.979
 in theory one might think so but in 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.100
 practice not at all because we 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.020
 have two products one of them is 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 totally autonomous so he has a 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.510
 battery 1 directly integrated it's a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.130
 small box 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.140
 this battery has a battery life of 7 years 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.820
 so the case of the stamps in your 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.460
 vehicle for seven years you are 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.990
 quiet there is no connectivity 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.910
 with the vehicle it means two 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.070
 things that means that already you have 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.390
 the peace of mind that it does not interfere 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.310
 not with your vehicle which you can 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.720
 equip what you want cars 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.550
 hybrid electric certainly but you 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.990
 can also equipped with two wheels for 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.520
 equip jet skis you can clip 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.840
 is finally here after there are more limits 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.240
 since we can equip everything we 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.740
 wants with this case there and then there is 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.120
 no harlem wire for the thief because 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.380
 that the thief he can not look for a 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.080
 thread to try to go back to a 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.430
 eventual case there is not the second 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.250
 housing 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 it's the tracker i-link 0 this little 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.920
 housing is dear to him his autonomy of 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.049
 smart way 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.049
 so in fact as long as the vehicle is in 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.939
 walking he will regenerate his energy and his 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.730
 battery and when the vehicle is shut off 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.159
 he will consume his little energy to him 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.989
 so much so that in fact we are not going again 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.370
 interfere with the vehicle so 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.019
 negative and once again we're going 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.189
 able to equip vehicles of the type 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.189
 electric or hybrid type
