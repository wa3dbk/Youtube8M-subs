again you learn to jog again and you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.910 
again you learn to jog again and you
take<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.019> step<00:03:09.200> by<00:03:09.230> step<00:03:09.350> but<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:09.739> suppose

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
take it step by step but I suppose

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.800 
take it step by step but I suppose
that's<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.220> key<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:10.970> getting<00:03:11.120> back<00:03:11.420> here

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that's the key to getting back here

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.870 
that's the key to getting back here
a<00:03:12.870> step<00:03:13.620> from<00:03:13.890> player<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.250> coach<00:03:14.280> isn't<00:03:14.670> an

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
a step from player to coach isn't an

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.790 
a step from player to coach isn't an
easy<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.390> relationships<00:03:16.380> will

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
easy one and relationships will

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.160 
easy one and relationships will
inevitably<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.880> change<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.480> trip<00:03:19.020> to

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
inevitably have to change a trip to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.470 
inevitably have to change a trip to
Bermuda<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.830> help<00:03:20.040> grassroots<00:03:20.670> rugby<00:03:21.090> not<00:03:21.450> a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
Bermuda to help grassroots rugby not a

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.260 
Bermuda to help grassroots rugby not a
bad<00:03:21.750> way<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.020> start<00:03:22.200> though<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.980> think<00:03:23.880> there's

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
bad way to start though I think there's

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.309 
bad way to start though I think there's
a<00:03:24.330> lot<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.630> said<00:03:24.750> about<00:03:24.810> being<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> good

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
a lot to be said about being a good

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.600 
a lot to be said about being a good
person<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.800> I'm<00:03:25.950> treating<00:03:26.250> people<00:03:26.459> with<00:03:26.550> a

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
person and I'm treating people with a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.979 
person and I'm treating people with a
lot<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.760> respect<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.599> know<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.720> think<00:03:27.810> it's

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
lot of respect you know I think it's

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.509 
lot of respect you know I think it's
important<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.380> do<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.590> as<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> coach<00:03:28.950> it's<00:03:29.430> not

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
important to do that as a coach it's not

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.339 
important to do that as a coach it's not
often<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:29.970> great<00:03:30.599> players<00:03:30.840> go<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.230> become

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
often that great players go on to become

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.990 
often that great players go on to become
great<00:03:31.680> coaches<00:03:32.099> but<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.310> think<00:03:32.550> Georgie's<00:03:32.849> got

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
great coaches but I think Georgie's got

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.120 
great coaches but I think Georgie's got
such<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.260> high<00:03:34.260> understanding<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.950> game

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
such a high understanding of the game

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.620 
such a high understanding of the game
