across<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.770> map<00:01:57.600> getting<00:01:58.600> going<00:01:58.720> slow<00:01:58.990> things

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
across the map getting going slow things

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.330 
across the map getting going slow things
down<00:01:59.260> as<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.590> action<00:01:59.890> gets<00:01:59.980> closer<00:02:00.250> and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
down as the action gets closer and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.380 
down as the action gets closer and
closer<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.880> does<00:02:01.000> look<00:02:01.150> like<00:02:01.240> this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
closer and it does look like this

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.240 
closer and it does look like this
