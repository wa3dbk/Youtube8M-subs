oven for about 10 minutes now I'm going

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.140 
oven for about 10 minutes now I'm going
to<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.240> push<00:01:43.810> them<00:01:44.020> close<00:01:44.290> together<00:01:45.150> just

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
to do is push them close together just

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.490 
to do is push them close together just
like<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:46.930> then<00:01:47.020> just<00:01:47.860> grate<00:01:48.760> some

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
like so and then just grate some

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.010 
like so and then just grate some
good-quality<00:01:50.700> parmigiano<00:01:51.700> all<00:01:52.060> over<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.780> top

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
good-quality parmigiano all over the top

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.230 
good-quality parmigiano all over the top
and<00:01:53.350> again<00:01:53.860> this<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.340> just<00:01:54.460> gives<00:01:54.730> it<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.210> much

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
and again this is just gives it so much

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.630 
and again this is just gives it so much
flavor<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.380> something<00:01:56.980> that<00:01:57.160> could<00:01:57.340> be<00:01:57.430> so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640
