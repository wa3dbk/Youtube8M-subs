00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:09.300
 do not often ask questions such a question 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.490
 plan I would like to cook or would like 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.790
 cook dishes raw 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.810
 the kitchen is alive but I don't know where to start 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.199
 Here I want to share with you one by one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.789
 from basic dishes in my kitchen 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.730
 which but here it is both tasty and healthy 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.750
 and universal has let's say several 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.960
 options 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.850
 immediately serving this seed dish 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.680
 maybe you never cooked this 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.850
 not heard but you have a chance 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.550
 to try 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 we need seeds usually i take the seeds 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.710
 sesame pumpkin seeds and seeds 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.410
 sunflower in different ratios can 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.320
 take sesame for example and only pumpkin 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.899
 seeds but naturally we are talking 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.829
 by no means raw seeds 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.909
 not fried because well then sense 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.700
 living product it is completely lost 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.720
 the seeds we need to just chop on 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.360
 coffee grinder 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.159
 well, or in a meat grinder or some other 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.520
 well, that is, we need to get 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.799
 here is something that's powdered not 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.540
 necessarily very small there may 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.869
 remain some blotch well 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.729
 small enough that it was next 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.400
 we will need spices 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.400
 what do you like well salt there garlic 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.900
 some indian spices greens 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.420
 welcome but if not possible 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.170
 do without it and we will need 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.500
 tomato tomatoes can either finely 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 just cut with a knife or rub on 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.759
 terochku and or grind some other 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.040
 way well in general we need peace 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.530
 chopped tomato no matter if he 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.360
 knife cut it will work anyway 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.829
 as needed, that is, he will give the necessary 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.980
 juice and it will turn out what we need well 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.190
 here I rubbed a grated tomato 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.910
 and it needs to be mixed with our ground 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.610
 seeds already added spices 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.070
 do not need to immediately lay out the entire volume 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.140
 tomatoes because we need to get 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.540
 let's say a certain consistency 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.430
 this mass if it turns out too 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.040
 liquid but you can not from it anything 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.350
 blind though she too has the right to 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.930
 existence that is if it is too 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.060
 liquid in it can be for something to smear 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.630
 or just eat like that 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.990
 gruel but I usually make something out of it 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.510
 like the type of chops or now you 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:54.810
 You will see here because she is very satisfying and 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.340
 she is very tasty all who tried 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.200
 Well, in general, they responded from 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.660
 high enough and taste and 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.570
 Now you see in what form we have it 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.750
 use can make cutlets such 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.360
 small together here they are in this in this 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.470
 option together with zucchini spaghetti 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.230
 Naturally zucchini is also here raw and 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.140
 the recipe for making such spaghetti I 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.870
 already recorded on video here is a big portion 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.090
 big male portion the same but 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.300
 there are already big chops and big 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.880
 a portion of spaghetti zucchini there refueling 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.580
 very tasty here is another option you 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.950
 they see here even another color they 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.010
 lighter these burgers well apparently here 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.700
 more sesame was and absolutely not 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.150
 greenery 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.130
 but however it's just another dish but not 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.900
 worse and no better she just has another 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:54.360
 taste is such an option for me 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.480
 I wanted balls such as not burgers 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.370
 small balls that just can 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.270
 dunk was in avocado and greens sauce 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.170
 very well by the way is a combination here 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.510
 this soft 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.109
 confuse such sauce such nourishing 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.220
 balls and for balance such here 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.170
 juicy tomatoes here these are this dish 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.840
 to me 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.660
 prompted let's say these little ones 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.060
 Bulgarian peppers that I bought straight 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.360
 set they are three colors orange and 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.460
 yellow even 4 were red and green and i 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.170
 just stuffed this pasta 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.870
 well it turned out great here too 1 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.030
 Bulgarian pepper as if well larger 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.510
 here are quarters of pepper stuffed with this 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.120
 sprinkle with sesame paste and tomato 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.060
 very tasty is just perfect 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.930
 combination here you are also this pasta but she 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.680
 softer here just on the leaves 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.540
 lettuce 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:10.880
 the next version of the halves of tomatoes 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:14.000
 stuffed with avocado paste and these 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.980
 Well, lettuce leaves can also be halves 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.050
 tomatoes stuffed with a paste of nuts and 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.840
 even here we have them 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.850
 use the spoon to use just for 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.890
 in order to make this paste that is 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.640
 completely wasteless technology here you are 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.890
 see these halves of small tomatoes 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.260
 Well, here's a holiday option it's me 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:43.220
 cooked here for the new year 2015 met 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:46.460
 here is a dish well, I hope that for you 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.030
 there was nothing complicated about that recipe 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.180
 clear you just try 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.490
 and come up with something 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.800
 my own variant I think that 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.230
 There are no such recipes. 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.970
 conditions here the most important is your desire 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.760
 your creativity 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.760
 your your enthusiast
