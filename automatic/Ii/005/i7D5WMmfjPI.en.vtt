 For 315 years, the transalp good 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.530
 turn 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.790
 no idea i think so 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.640
 I think it was 315 4 3 np 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.710
 You have to be a bit cocky 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.540
 stupid comes two rockets 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.790
 he makes a jammer now and the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.370
 do not meet but now it upset me 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.050
 this area always but but you have to 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.480
 say i do it just because it all 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.060
 would make others 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.570
 I would but it is just mega 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.780
 and group pressure fucking I have that 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.020
 now flipped that I hold quite normal 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.010
 with the spacebar, make your nose high yes 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.830
 but then I can not do any more 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.210
 just with middle button 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.890
 I decide that forward then I am 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.420
 in front of the other jet so that the mouse can 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.470
 I make that much better foliage is it 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.910
 better because I just ein 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.950
 mouse click liquid really high 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:36.660
 do not finally make a picture almost 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.070
 my score i thought i thought so 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.200
 I'm watching now because I have just 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.880
 so keep thinking if you have one now 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.010
 lying florist gameplay it is so 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.590
 hard as in the tickets but then 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.930
 then I'm bruised or is in 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:04:01.230

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.080
 I am a glass where I am 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:20.139

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.979
 hate there is the make is something extra 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.389

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.560
 a few people are three people 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.810
