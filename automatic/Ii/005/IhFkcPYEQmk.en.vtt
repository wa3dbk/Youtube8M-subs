look<00:02:44.130> like<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.580> get<00:02:44.790> fitter<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.420> top<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:46.020> his

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
look like you get fitter on top of his

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.150 
look like you get fitter on top of his
it<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.550> snip<00:02:48.240> tiny<00:02:48.959> tiny<00:02:49.470> tiny<00:02:49.650> a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
it so I just snip tiny tiny tiny a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.330 
it so I just snip tiny tiny tiny a
little<00:02:50.580> bit<00:02:50.760> see<00:02:51.330> this<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.620> already<00:02:52.980> pre

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
little bit see this and I already pre

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.509 
little bit see this and I already pre
sponge<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:54.300> they're<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.660> gonna

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
sponge this but they're not gonna

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.970 
sponge this but they're not gonna
feather<00:02:56.750> disappear<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> bit<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.709> looked

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
feather disappear a bit so it looked

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.400 
feather disappear a bit so it looked
like<00:03:02.160> feathers<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.540> there's<00:03:03.750> gonna<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.320> the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
like feathers so there's gonna go in the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.780 
like feathers so there's gonna go in the
back<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.800> his<00:03:04.950> head<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:09.350> my<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:11.310> other<00:03:11.519> two

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
back of his head and my the other two

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.960 
back of his head and my the other two
cards<00:03:12.330> are<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> little<00:03:13.200> bit<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:14.280> try<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.640> make

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
cards are a little bit you try to make

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.810 
cards are a little bit you try to make
it<00:03:15.150> more<00:03:15.360> pointy<00:03:15.959> say<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.800> one<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.430> it

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
it more pointy say this one I think it

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.540 
it more pointy say this one I think it
go<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.300> little<00:03:18.570> bit<00:03:18.840> too<00:03:19.080> much<00:03:19.260> sideways<00:03:20.160> and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
go a little bit too much sideways and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.100 
go a little bit too much sideways and
this<00:03:21.510> one

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
this one

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.740 
this one
ergo<00:03:22.260> more<00:03:22.830> up<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.790> think<00:03:24.090> that's<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.540> look

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
ergo more up and I think that's the look

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.500 
ergo more up and I think that's the look
that<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.200> want<00:03:25.470> more<00:03:25.890> up<00:03:26.180> then<00:03:27.180> I'm<00:03:27.360> gonna

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
that you want more up then I'm gonna

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.430 
that you want more up then I'm gonna
take<00:03:27.870> my<00:03:28.560> poker<00:03:29.340> here<00:03:29.850> poke<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.750> little<00:03:30.959> old

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
take my poker here poke a little old

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:40.400 
take my poker here poke a little old
there<00:03:31.830> for<00:03:32.280> his<00:03:32.519> eyes<00:03:34.489> put<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.670> bread<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
there for his eyes put the bread in and

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.130 
there for his eyes put the bread in and
then<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.340> wing<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.180> back<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.660> put<00:03:42.690> it
