00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.910 

I<00:00:17.140> was<00:00:18.140> talking<00:00:18.680> about<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.369> theory<00:00:20.000> that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
I was talking about the theory that

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.499 
I was talking about the theory that
universes<00:00:21.920> can<00:00:22.580> actually<00:00:23.480> reproduce<00:00:24.200> and

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
universes can actually reproduce and

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.540 
universes can actually reproduce and
that<00:00:26.509> our<00:00:26.779> universe<00:00:27.410> might<00:00:27.710> be<00:00:27.860> so<00:00:28.099> apparently

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
that our universe might be so apparently

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.249 
that our universe might be so apparently
evolved<00:00:29.150> because<00:00:29.480> it's<00:00:29.630> not<00:00:29.869> a<00:00:29.900> first

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
evolved because it's not a first

evolved because it's not a first

down<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.239> enormous<00:00:35.780> birth<00:00:36.140> canal<00:00:36.590> of<00:00:36.830> a<00:00:37.489> black

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
down the enormous birth canal of a black

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.750 
down the enormous birth canal of a black
hole<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.949> thus<00:00:39.949> has<00:00:40.300> inherited<00:00:41.300> its<00:00:42.760> parent

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.810 
universes more managable attributes then
I<00:00:50.059> talked<00:00:50.390> about<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.750> idea<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:51.200> we<00:00:52.129> may<00:00:52.579> well

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
I talked about the idea that we may well

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.340 
I talked about the idea that we may well
be<00:00:52.969> living<00:00:53.149> in<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.690> computer<00:00:54.110> simulation<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:56.719> I

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
be living in a computer simulation and I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.500 
be living in a computer simulation and I
finally<00:00:57.710> rounded<00:00:58.219> off<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:58.520> evening<00:00:58.969> with<00:00:59.480> a

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
finally rounded off the evening with a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.439 
finally rounded off the evening with a
brief<00:00:59.840> discourse<00:01:00.379> about<00:01:00.800> how<00:01:01.449> recent

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
brief discourse about how recent

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.520 
brief discourse about how recent
evidence<00:01:02.719> seems<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.559> show<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:05.140> we<00:01:06.140> are<00:01:06.170> in

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
evidence seems to show that we are in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.730 
evidence seems to show that we are in
fact<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.979> hologram<00:01:07.520> being<00:01:08.330> projected<00:01:09.080> from<00:01:09.590> the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
fact a hologram being projected from the

fact a hologram being projected from the
outside<00:01:10.729> edge<00:01:11.149> of<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.810> universe<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.479> as<00:01:14.830> we

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
outside edge of the universe and as we

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.380 
outside edge of the universe and as we
pointed<00:01:16.160> out<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.759> stuff<00:01:17.890> the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
pointed out this is stuff the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.710 
pointed out this is stuff the
rationalists<00:01:20.390> find<00:01:21.259> credible<00:01:21.649> I<00:01:22.539> would<00:01:23.539> say

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
rationalists find credible I would say

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.290 
rationalists find credible I would say
in<00:01:23.899> that<00:01:23.929> light<00:01:24.349> the<00:01:25.220> more<00:01:25.520> worship<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.209> a

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
in that light the more worship of a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.359 
in that light the more worship of a
second-century<00:01:26.830> sockpuppets<00:01:27.830> night<00:01:28.039> God

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
second-century sockpuppets night God

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.730 
second-century sockpuppets night God
seems<00:01:28.729> entirely<00:01:29.270> reasonable

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.380 

well<00:01:34.740> I've<00:01:34.890> always<00:01:35.070> been<00:01:35.310> impressed<00:01:35.790> by<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
well I've always been impressed by the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.750 
well I've always been impressed by the
imagination<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.950> scientists<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:41.340> don't

imagination of scientists I I don't

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.800 
imagination of scientists I I don't
really<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.300> that<00:01:43.340> we're<00:01:44.340> even<00:01:44.810> necessarily

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
really think that we're even necessarily

really think that we're even necessarily

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
in terms of scientists and just whatever

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.350 
in terms of scientists and just whatever
I'm<00:01:50.910> supposed<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.750> um<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.970> that

I'm supposed to be um I don't think that

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.340 
I'm supposed to be um I don't think that
there's<00:01:54.600> any<00:01:54.810> real<00:01:55.320> disparity<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:57.600> mean<00:01:58.020> most

of science as far as I can see it's

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.960 
of science as far as I can see it's

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
the as yet unimaginable and I would say

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.390 
the as yet unimaginable and I would say
that<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.670> has<00:03:14.940> been<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.299> same<00:03:15.690> for<00:03:16.400> artists

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400

I would prefer to Skype solution I think
that<00:03:28.599> more<00:03:29.599> basic<00:03:30.049> premise<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:31.569> human

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
that more basic premise is that human

evidence for it is all around us in the

because<00:05:55.500> as<00:05:55.789> information<00:05:56.789> is<00:05:56.880> our<00:05:57.060> most

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
because as information is our most

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.839 
because as information is our most
precious<00:05:57.419> commodity<00:05:58.199> if<00:05:58.409> we<00:05:59.219> lose<00:05:59.460> all<00:05:59.669> the

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
precious commodity if we lose all the

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.390 
precious commodity if we lose all the
physical<00:06:00.330> stuff<00:06:00.509> as<00:06:01.110> long<00:06:01.169> as<00:06:01.560> we've<00:06:01.770> got<00:06:01.800> the

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
physical stuff as long as we've got the

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.760 
physical stuff as long as we've got the
memory<00:06:03.180> of<00:06:03.240> how<00:06:03.539> to<00:06:03.599> make<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.169> we've<00:06:04.560> lost

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
memory of how to make that we've lost

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.939 
memory of how to make that we've lost
nothing<00:06:06.469> so<00:06:07.469> I<00:06:07.500> think<00:06:07.710> that<00:06:08.219> that<00:06:08.250> tends<00:06:08.940> to

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
nothing so I think that that tends to

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.790 
nothing so I think that that tends to
unfortunately<00:06:10.949> it<00:06:11.219> perhaps<00:06:11.430> tends<00:06:11.880> to<00:06:12.150> drive

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
unfortunately it perhaps tends to drive

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.439 
unfortunately it perhaps tends to drive
scientists<00:06:13.800> who<00:06:13.919> are<00:06:14.069> obviously<00:06:14.610> concerned

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
scientists who are obviously concerned

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.700 
scientists who are obviously concerned
about<00:06:15.960> those<00:06:16.169> possibilities<00:06:17.419> into<00:06:18.419> an<00:06:18.750> almost

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
about those possibilities into an almost

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.520 
about those possibilities into an almost
religious<00:06:20.520> position<00:06:20.819> themselves<00:06:21.530> now

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
religious position themselves now

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.040

religion<00:06:23.099> etymologically<00:06:23.969> it<00:06:24.180> doesn't<00:06:24.750> mean

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050
