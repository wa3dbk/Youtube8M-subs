00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.990 

we're<00:00:11.519> interested<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.120> having<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.599> portable

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
we're interested in having a portable

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.490 
we're interested in having a portable
brain<00:00:15.000> imaging<00:00:15.389> device<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.049> could<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.320> used

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
brain imaging device that could be used

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380 
brain imaging device that could be used
in<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> intensive<00:00:17.340> care<00:00:17.520> unit<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
in the intensive care unit so that you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.810 
in the intensive care unit so that you
could<00:00:18.600> watch<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.859> happens<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.460> infant

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
could watch what happens in infant

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.000 
could watch what happens in infant
brains<00:00:21.029> while<00:00:21.750> you're<00:00:21.960> changing<00:00:22.470> different

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
brains while you're changing different

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
brains while you're changing different
things<00:00:23.189> about<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.180> care<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.600> infants

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
things about your the care for infants

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.310 
things about your the care for infants
one<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> main<00:00:27.029> benefits<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> optical

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
one of the main benefits of the optical

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.339 
one of the main benefits of the optical
tomography<00:00:28.830> imaging<00:00:29.760> approach<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:31.050> it's

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
tomography imaging approach is that it's

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.729 
tomography imaging approach is that it's
something<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.809> maybe<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.020> size<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.590> small

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
something that maybe the size of a small

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.610 
something that maybe the size of a small
refrigerator<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.579> perhaps<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.840> microwave<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
refrigerator or perhaps a microwave that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.549 
refrigerator or perhaps a microwave that
can<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.950> moved<00:00:38.670> around<00:00:38.840> into<00:00:39.840> intensive<00:00:40.500> care

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
can be moved around into intensive care

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.860 
can be moved around into intensive care
units<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.120> means<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.719> can

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
units and so that means that we can

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.660 
units and so that means that we can
bring<00:00:43.020> neuroimaging<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> subject

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
bring neuroimaging to the subject

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.180 
bring neuroimaging to the subject
instead<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> having<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> take<00:00:45.980> remove<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
instead of having to take remove the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.420 
instead of having to take remove the
subject<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.300> neural<00:00:48.690> imaging<00:00:48.809> device<00:00:49.430> so

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
subject to the neural imaging device so

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.510 
subject to the neural imaging device so
that<00:00:50.460> has<00:00:51.030> sort<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> clear<00:00:52.199> utility<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.190> any<00:00:53.370> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
a limit to how deep we can image into

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
a limit to how deep we can image into
the<00:01:31.829> brain<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.450> infants<00:01:33.960> we

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the brain and so for infants we

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.560 
the brain and so for infants we
potentially<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.460> scan<00:01:35.759> entire<00:01:36.240> brain

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
potentially can scan entire brain

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.929 
potentially can scan entire brain
whereas<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.170> adults<00:01:37.470> will<00:01:38.280> probably<00:01:38.759> be

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
whereas for adults will probably be

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.270 
whereas for adults will probably be
restricted<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.600> scanning<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.860> instance<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
infants are a match for the imaging

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.660 
infants are a match for the imaging
