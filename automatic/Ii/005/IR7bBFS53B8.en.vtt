 in case you want to download 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.830

 we have the part to add to ringtones 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.870
 but before we can reproduce what is 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.640
 the corner to know if we like that 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.800
 part we would simply have to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.720
 select it and it will automatically 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.210
 start loading how to listen to stacks 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 and love pity that copyright does not 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.390
 You can leave the song but good 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.920
 are the default tones but you 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.960
 you want to do one you're just going to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
 have to select maker ringtone you're going 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.430
 to select from where you're going to do it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.320
 from something downloaded look in the network or 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.940
 from the thing from the music once 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.920
 that you are there, you are simply going to have 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.630
 to select the one you want 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.180
 example this song and we will be able to 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.729
 select from 120 seconds up to 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.290
 minimum that are 12 point 12 seconds 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.970
 let's play to see if we like 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.800
 that part and in case we have 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.229
 liked we would simply have to put 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.990
 save what is in this part 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.450
 it will automatically be processed and ready 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.979
 automatically this will be saved in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.780
 the part of the ring tones 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.390
 I would simply have to enter the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.700
 tones and you saw that there appears the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.700
 song that I select simply 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.450
 let's see if it works 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.920
 and as you can see it plays 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.349
 perfectly but the question does not come 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.090
 I liked the tone how can you remove it 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.760
 we would simply have to return to 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.370
 what is the tweet you are going to select the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.370
 song that you want to delete and under us 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.170
 a basket appears to eliminate 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.790
 simply the selected ones we are going to 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.260
 erase is not going to tell you to confirm it 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.200
 be careful with that let's go back 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.870
 to the tones we go out to sounds 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.569
 let's try to go back and how can you 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.730
 see now it does not appear simply 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.250
 I have to re-select my tone and 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.260
 ready so is the easiest way to 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.120
 put tones to what is your device 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.920
