00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
um on the rebel yell record I kind of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.670 
um on the rebel yell record I kind of
replicated<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:39.090> had<00:00:39.690> some<00:00:39.870> toy<00:00:40.020> ray<00:00:40.230> guns<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:40.649> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
replicated I had some toy ray guns but I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.040 
replicated I had some toy ray guns but I
never<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.910> know<00:00:42.000> thought<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:42.420> doing<00:00:42.930> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
never you know thought about doing it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.889 
never you know thought about doing it
with<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.829> ray<00:00:44.579> gun<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:44.789> anything<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
with with like ray gun or anything so

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.729 
with with like ray gun or anything so
and<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> PC<00:00:46.770> note<00:00:46.890> let's<00:00:47.129> become<00:00:47.280> PC

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
and that is a PC note let's become PC

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.189 
and that is a PC note let's become PC
m41<00:00:49.739> okay<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.809> like

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
m41 okay and all it is is just like

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
m41 okay and all it is is just like
turning<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> modulation<00:00:53.370> all<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> way

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
turning up the modulation all the way

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.000 
turning up the modulation all the way
very<00:00:54.480> small<00:00:55.140> very<00:00:55.469> slow<00:00:56.149> or<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:58.109> short<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
very small very slow or very short to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.729 
very small very slow or very short to
delay<00:00:59.699> delay<00:01:00.510> time<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.440> letting<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
delay delay time and just letting the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.560 
delay delay time and just letting the
modulation<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> had

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
modulation just you know and then I had

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.479 
modulation just you know and then I had
another<00:01:03.690> foot<00:01:04.140> switch<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.040> whole<00:01:05.280> thing

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
another foot switch so the whole thing

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210 
another foot switch so the whole thing
just<00:01:05.700> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> goes<00:01:06.000> did<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.780> yeah<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.070> did

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
just kind of goes did it yeah but we did

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.670 
just kind of goes did it yeah but we did
have<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> punch<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.450> edit<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.290> took<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
have to punch in and edit it took a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.830 
have to punch in and edit it took a
while<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> kind<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.210> wasn't<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
while to kind of get it it wasn't like I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.190 
while to kind of get it it wasn't like I
just<00:01:12.900> played<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.600> yeah<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.930> then

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
just played the thing and yeah and then

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.590 
just played the thing and yeah and then
so<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.950> after<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> started<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> think<00:01:18.299> well

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
make sure the speaker is on the right

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.740 
make sure the speaker is on the right
side<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.810> play<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> from<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> guitar<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:39.119> then

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
side to play it from the guitar and then

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.120 
side to play it from the guitar and then
this<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.590> i<00:01:40.619> tinkered<00:01:41.040> around

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
reengineering yeah they're really into

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.430 
reengineering yeah they're really into
but<00:01:56.760> they<00:01:56.850> use<00:01:57.090> all<00:01:57.330> these<00:01:57.480> toys<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.840> stuff

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.970 
inside and I looked at this tiny little
circuit<00:02:06.930> board<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.290> realized<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.800> could

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
circuit board and I realized I could

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.760 
circuit board and I realized I could
vary<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.460> rate<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.869> one<00:02:10.140> resistor

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
vary the rate of this one resistor

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.130 
vary the rate of this one resistor
because<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.940> potentiometer<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:12.720> nothing<00:02:13.020> but

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
because the potentiometer is nothing but

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.690 
because the potentiometer is nothing but
a<00:02:13.200> variable<00:02:13.560> resistor<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.630> you've<00:02:15.810> got

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
a variable resistor so so you've got

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.250 
a variable resistor so so you've got
basically<00:02:18.350> these<00:02:19.350> seven<00:02:19.860> sounds<00:02:20.100> on<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
basically these seven sounds on this and

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.190 
basically these seven sounds on this and
each<00:02:22.260> time<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.560> hit<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:24.170> pull<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
each time you hit the the pull the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.920 
each time you hit the the pull the
trigger<00:02:25.470> it'll<00:02:25.950> trigger<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.250> different<00:02:26.580> sound

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
trigger it'll trigger a different sound

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.630 
trigger it'll trigger a different sound
so<00:02:27.950> I'll<00:02:28.950> say<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:29.810> now<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.080> do<00:02:31.140> that

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
so I'll say that one now if I do that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.680 
so I'll say that one now if I do that
when<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:32.880> when<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.480> buy<00:02:33.630> this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
when you get when you just buy this

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.880 
when you get when you just buy this
thing<00:02:34.020> it's<00:02:34.770> just<00:02:34.950> going<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.490> but<00:02:36.180> I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
thing it's just going to do that but I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:56.809 
thing it's just going to do that but I
realized<00:02:48.050> you<00:02:49.050> can<00:02:49.230> hold<00:02:49.470> them<00:02:49.620> no

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:06.820 

you

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.230 

the<00:03:07.830> whole<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.220> musical<00:03:08.730> performance

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
the whole like musical performance

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.180 
the whole like musical performance
because<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.450> cross-fading<00:03:10.260> yeah<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:11.070> by

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
because you cross-fading yeah just by

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.560 
because you cross-fading yeah just by
bringing<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.640> closer<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.210> guitar<00:03:12.540> and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
bringing it closer to the guitar and

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.290 
bringing it closer to the guitar and
then<00:03:12.750> going<00:03:13.020> away<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:14.070> that's<00:03:14.580> that's

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
then going away so that's that's that's

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.700 
then going away so that's that's that's
the<00:03:15.480> whole<00:03:15.600> thing<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.080> Raygun

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
the whole thing of the Raygun

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.320 
the whole thing of the Raygun
I<00:03:16.740> knew<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> Reagan's<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.850> didn't<00:03:18.120> know<00:03:18.210> that

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
I knew the Reagan's I didn't know that

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.360 
I knew the Reagan's I didn't know that
you<00:03:18.450> put<00:03:18.630> potentiometers<00:03:19.590> yeah<00:03:19.830> I<00:03:20.040> was<00:03:20.220> gonna

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
you put potentiometers yeah I was gonna

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.280 
you put potentiometers yeah I was gonna
wonder<00:03:20.670> how<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.850> got<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.270> you<00:03:21.960> gotta<00:03:22.140> too

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
wonder how you got the you gotta too

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.200 
wonder how you got the you gotta too
much<00:03:22.470> as<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.400> want<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.760> vary<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
much as you want you want to vary the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.010 
much as you want you want to vary the
rate<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.750> I've<00:03:25.350> got<00:03:25.530> about<00:03:25.740> three<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.370> these

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
rate so I've got about three of these

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.330 
rate so I've got about three of these
this<00:03:28.020> one<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.260> keep<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.590> home<00:03:28.770> then<00:03:28.980> there's<00:03:29.160> two

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
this one I keep it home then there's two

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.980 
this one I keep it home then there's two
that<00:03:29.520> I<00:03:29.610> tour<00:03:29.880> with<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.360> they<00:03:30.660> all<00:03:30.810> sound

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
that I tour with and they all sound

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.320 
that I tour with and they all sound
different<00:03:31.500> but<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.610> main<00:03:32.730> thing<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.000> realize

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
different but the main thing I realize

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.390 
different but the main thing I realize
is<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:34.440> gotta<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.830> speaker<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
is you gotta have the speaker on the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.530 
is you gotta have the speaker on the
right<00:03:35.700> side<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.990> and<00:03:37.290> then<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.910> because

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
right side of that and then and because

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.870 
right side of that and then and because
some<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.780> them<00:03:39.870> get<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.590> like<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.550> becomes

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
some of them get it like this it becomes

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.570 
some of them get it like this it becomes
a<00:03:42.030> whole<00:03:42.210> pain<00:03:42.660> in<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.900> answer<00:03:43.400> that's<00:03:44.400> the

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
a whole pain in the answer that's the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.910 
a whole pain in the answer that's the
