00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
things together and then i'm going to

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.010 
things together and then i'm going to
have<00:02:51.460> to<00:02:51.490> use<00:02:51.850> electronic<00:02:52.510> quick<00:02:52.720> sort<00:02:52.900> of

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
have to use electronic quick sort of

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.230 
have to use electronic quick sort of
shake<00:02:53.230> shake<00:02:53.530> shake<00:02:53.560> shake<00:02:54.040> them<00:02:54.940> all

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
shake shake shake shake them all

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.240 
shake shake shake shake them all
together<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:56.080> then<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.950> would<00:02:57.100> be<00:02:57.130> a

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
together and then that would be a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.480 
together and then that would be a
homogeneous<00:02:58.150> mixture<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.900> then<00:02:59.310> i'm<00:03:00.310> going

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
homogeneous mixture and then i'm going

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.640 
homogeneous mixture and then i'm going
to<00:03:00.550> put<00:03:01.180> them<00:03:01.330> in<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.510> oven<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.080> they're

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
to put them in the oven and they're

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.340 
to put them in the oven and they're
going<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.920> get<00:03:03.160> all<00:03:03.310> warm<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.450> they're<00:03:05.170> going

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
going to get all warm and they're going

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.990 
going to get all warm and they're going
to<00:03:05.410> bake<00:03:07.500> now<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.530> all<00:03:12.130> i<00:03:12.190> have<00:03:12.460> for<00:03:12.700> you

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
to bake now that is all i have for you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.600 
to bake now that is all i have for you
and<00:03:13.740> meanwhile<00:03:14.740> i'm<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.250> mix<00:03:15.460> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
and meanwhile i'm going to mix a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.120 
and meanwhile i'm going to mix a
substance<00:03:16.180> i'm<00:03:16.750> going<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.170> mix<00:03:17.350> all<00:03:17.560> our

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
substance i'm going to mix all our

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.380 
substance i'm going to mix all our
different<00:03:18.550> ingredients<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:20.460> make<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:21.970> cake

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
different ingredients and make the cake

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:38.730 
different ingredients and make the cake
batter

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.760 

now<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:39.850> mix<00:03:40.240> all<00:03:40.540> ingredients<00:03:40.770> together

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
now that I mix all ingredients together

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.670 
now that I mix all ingredients together
and<00:03:42.220> our<00:03:42.310> names<00:03:42.760> from<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.090> eggs<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.930> oil<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
and our names from the eggs the oil the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.400 
and our names from the eggs the oil the
water<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.310> cake<00:03:45.550> mix<00:03:45.850> I<00:03:46.150> mix<00:03:47.050> them<00:03:47.260> all

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
water and the cake mix I mix them all

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.350 
water and the cake mix I mix them all
together<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:48.430> make<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.610> homogeneous<00:03:49.330> mixture

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
together to make a homogeneous mixture

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.530 
together to make a homogeneous mixture
and<00:03:50.080> if<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.830> look<00:03:51.100> at<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.700> is<00:03:51.910> completely

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
and if you look at this it is completely

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.730 
and if you look at this it is completely
blended<00:03:53.440> together<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:55.060> chemically<00:03:55.740> it

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
blended together is it chemically it

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.440 
blended together is it chemically it
isn't<00:03:57.010> chemically<00:03:57.490> bonded<00:03:57.880> together<00:03:58.060> though

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
isn't chemically bonded together though

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.180 
isn't chemically bonded together though
or<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.810> would<00:03:58.930> be<00:03:59.020> a<00:03:59.050> compound<00:03:59.620> this<00:04:00.040> is

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
or that would be a compound this is

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.070 
or that would be a compound this is
still<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.490> mixture<00:04:00.880> it's<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.240> homogeneous

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
still a mixture it's a homogeneous

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.070 
still a mixture it's a homogeneous
mixture<00:04:03.210> heterogeneous<00:04:04.210> mixture<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.900> where

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
mixture heterogeneous mixture is where

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.540 
mixture heterogeneous mixture is where
you<00:04:05.170> can<00:04:05.290> see<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.560> different<00:04:05.980> parts<00:04:06.250> but<00:04:06.460> you

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
you can see the different parts but you

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.850 
you can see the different parts but you
can't<00:04:06.970> see<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.360> different<00:04:07.690> parts<00:04:08.050> so<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:08.830> is

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
can't see the different parts so this is

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.180 
can't see the different parts so this is
homogeneous<00:04:11.400> now<00:04:12.400> let's<00:04:13.060> talk<00:04:13.330> about<00:04:13.390> density

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
homogeneous now let's talk about density

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.800 
homogeneous now let's talk about density
density<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.760> kind<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.150> what<00:04:16.299> makes<00:04:16.330> things

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
density is kind of what makes things

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.490 
density is kind of what makes things
float<00:04:17.140> sick<00:04:17.970> because<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.209> density<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:20.080> lighter

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
float sick because a density is lighter

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.130 
float sick because a density is lighter
things<00:04:21.190> would<00:04:21.580> float<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.510> because<00:04:22.990> the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
things would float and because the

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.250 
things would float and because the
density<00:04:23.380> density<00:04:24.040> would<00:04:24.460> be<00:04:24.610> heavier<00:04:25.540> things

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
density density would be heavier things

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.190 
density density would be heavier things
would<00:04:26.590> sink<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:27.960> with<00:04:28.960> oil<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.590> water<00:04:29.890> oil

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
would sink and with oil and water oil

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.280 
would sink and with oil and water oil
the<00:04:32.200> oils<00:04:32.560> density<00:04:33.100> is<00:04:33.340> less<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.450> it<00:04:34.630> floats<00:04:34.960> on

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
the oils density is less so it floats on

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.650 
the oils density is less so it floats on
top<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:35.980> water<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:37.240> can<00:04:37.420> try<00:04:37.630> that

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
top of the water you can try that

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.520 
top of the water you can try that
experiment<00:04:38.260> home<00:04:39.330> now<00:04:40.330> since<00:04:40.960> we're<00:04:41.320> all

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
experiment home now since we're all

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.970 
experiment home now since we're all
mixed<00:04:41.950> up<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.490> ready<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.850> go<00:04:42.940> I'm<00:04:43.900> going<00:04:44.740> to

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
mixed up and ready to go I'm going to

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.190 
mixed up and ready to go I'm going to
put<00:04:45.310> my<00:04:45.340> oven<00:04:45.970> mitts<00:04:46.150> on<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.720> we're<00:04:46.930> going<00:04:47.110> to

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
put my oven mitts on and we're going to

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.280 
put my oven mitts on and we're going to
go<00:04:47.350> ahead<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.710> put<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.550> cake<00:04:48.850> in<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.240> oven

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.660 

then<00:04:53.290> I'm<00:04:53.440> going<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.740> give<00:04:53.890> you<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.130> close-up

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
then I'm going to give you a close-up

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:02.370 
then I'm going to give you a close-up
view<00:04:54.970> what's<00:04:55.510> happening<00:04:57.930> right<00:04:58.930> now<00:05:01.380> 350

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
view what's happening right now 350

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.350 
view what's happening right now 350
degrees<00:05:02.770> Fahrenheit<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.460> that's<00:05:03.790> really<00:05:04.180> hot

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
degrees Fahrenheit and that's really hot

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.530 
degrees Fahrenheit and that's really hot
so<00:05:04.630> we<00:05:04.780> got<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.050> make<00:05:05.230> sure<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.590> put<00:05:05.740> my<00:05:06.390> oven<00:05:07.390> is

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
so we got to make sure I put my oven is

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.590 
so we got to make sure I put my oven is
on<00:05:07.810> so<00:05:08.230> I<00:05:08.290> don't<00:05:08.530> get<00:05:08.740> burnt<00:05:10.410> now<00:05:11.550> go<00:05:12.550> ahead<00:05:12.610> up

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
on so I don't get burnt now go ahead up

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.170 
on so I don't get burnt now go ahead up
and<00:05:13.900> now<00:05:14.530> i'm<00:05:14.770> going<00:05:14.980> to<00:05:15.100> give<00:05:15.280> you<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.550> closer

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
and now i'm going to give you a closer

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.510 
and now i'm going to give you a closer
look<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.350> what's<00:05:17.620> happening<00:05:18.070> happening

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
look and what's happening happening

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:46.440 
look and what's happening happening
inside<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.780> oven

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.360 

now<00:05:47.450> that<00:05:47.720> our<00:05:47.840> beautiful<00:05:48.410> golden<00:05:48.830> brown<00:05:48.860> cake

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
now that our beautiful golden brown cake

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.950 
now that our beautiful golden brown cake
is<00:05:49.550> come<00:05:49.730> out<00:05:49.850> of<00:05:50.000> the<00:05:50.060> oven<00:05:50.090> I'm<00:05:50.600> going<00:05:50.870> to

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
is come out of the oven I'm going to

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.670 
is come out of the oven I'm going to
talk<00:05:51.350> to<00:05:51.410> you<00:05:51.860> about<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:54.080> law<00:05:54.320> of

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
talk to you about the law of

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.330 
talk to you about the law of
conservation<00:05:55.490> of<00:05:56.030> mess<00:05:56.300> this<00:05:57.230> is<00:05:57.500> when<00:05:57.740> if<00:05:58.100> the

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
conservation of mess this is when if the

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.280 
conservation of mess this is when if the
cake<00:05:58.610> batter<00:05:58.910> laid<00:05:59.380> 100<00:06:00.380> grams<00:06:00.680> and<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:03.050> cake

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
cake batter laid 100 grams and the cake

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.210 
cake batter laid 100 grams and the cake
right<00:06:03.560> now<00:06:03.860> that<00:06:04.550> was<00:06:04.850> big<00:06:05.120> with<00:06:05.740> 95<00:06:06.740> grams

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
right now that was big with 95 grams

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.430 
right now that was big with 95 grams
then<00:06:08.150> five<00:06:08.630> of<00:06:09.050> those<00:06:09.200> grams<00:06:09.550> were<00:06:10.550> lost<00:06:10.820> and

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
then five of those grams were lost and

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.930 
then five of those grams were lost and
they<00:06:12.440> would<00:06:12.620> have<00:06:12.740> been<00:06:12.830> lost<00:06:13.040> in<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.430> oven

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
they would have been lost in the oven

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.930 
they would have been lost in the oven
and<00:06:14.380> they<00:06:15.380> would<00:06:15.530> probably<00:06:15.770> be<00:06:16.190> in<00:06:16.250> moisture

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
and they would probably be in moisture

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.200 
and they would probably be in moisture
from<00:06:17.389> the<00:06:17.450> cake<00:06:17.780> that<00:06:18.110> what<00:06:18.440> that<00:06:18.950> had<00:06:19.520> been<00:06:19.729> he

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
from the cake that what that had been he

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.180 
from the cake that what that had been he
dropped<00:06:20.600> so<00:06:21.520> if<00:06:22.520> we<00:06:23.090> add<00:06:23.300> the<00:06:23.600> 95<00:06:24.320> of<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.950> cake

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
dropped so if we add the 95 of the cake

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.700 
dropped so if we add the 95 of the cake
right<00:06:25.430> now<00:06:25.460> in<00:06:25.940> the<00:06:26.090> five<00:06:26.330> that<00:06:26.720> lost<00:06:27.110> you

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
right now in the five that lost you

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.370 
right now in the five that lost you
would<00:06:27.860> get<00:06:28.010> the<00:06:28.190> original<00:06:29.110> we<00:06:30.110> get<00:06:30.260> the

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
would get the original we get the

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.680 
would get the original we get the
original<00:06:30.919> weight<00:06:31.310> or<00:06:31.880> mass<00:06:32.330> of<00:06:33.400> the<00:06:34.690> cake

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
original weight or mass of the cake

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:42.070 
original weight or mass of the cake
batter<00:06:35.990> which<00:06:36.860> was<00:06:37.160> 100<00:06:37.700> grams<00:06:40.660> now<00:06:41.660> I'm<00:06:41.900> going

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
batter which was 100 grams now I'm going

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.110 
batter which was 100 grams now I'm going
to<00:06:42.200> talk<00:06:42.350> to<00:06:42.410> you<00:06:42.710> about<00:06:42.830> energy<00:06:43.220> and<00:06:43.580> two

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
to talk to you about energy and two

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.529 
to talk to you about energy and two
types<00:06:44.389> of<00:06:44.510> energy<00:06:44.960> that's<00:06:45.970> exothermic<00:06:46.970> energy

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
types of energy that's exothermic energy

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.469 
types of energy that's exothermic energy
and<00:06:47.810> endothermic<00:06:48.500> energy<00:06:49.479> endothermic

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
and endothermic energy endothermic

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.360 
and endothermic energy endothermic
energy<00:06:50.930> is<00:06:51.080> when<00:06:51.260> we<00:06:51.470> put<00:06:51.650> energy<00:06:51.860> into

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
energy is when we put energy into

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.080 
energy is when we put energy into
something<00:06:52.789> so<00:06:53.720> the<00:06:54.110> oven<00:06:54.530> was<00:06:55.130> putting<00:06:55.640> heat

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
something so the oven was putting heat

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.469 
something so the oven was putting heat
into<00:06:57.020> the<00:06:57.169> cake<00:06:57.410> to<00:06:58.039> make<00:06:58.130> it<00:06:58.310> big<00:06:58.580> so<00:06:58.910> that

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
into the cake to make it big so that

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.779 
into the cake to make it big so that
would<00:06:59.630> be<00:06:59.660> endothermic<00:07:00.080> energy<00:07:00.800> now<00:07:01.550> that

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:01.789 
would be endothermic energy now that

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.450 
would be endothermic energy now that
that<00:07:02.000> cake<00:07:02.330> is<00:07:02.360> cooling<00:07:02.750> it<00:07:03.140> is<00:07:03.890> giving<00:07:04.250> off

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
that cake is cooling it is giving off

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.250 
that cake is cooling it is giving off
heat<00:07:04.850> so<00:07:05.120> that<00:07:05.270> would<00:07:05.570> be<00:07:05.600> exothermic<00:07:06.320> energy

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
heat so that would be exothermic energy

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.890 
heat so that would be exothermic energy
that's<00:07:09.260> all<00:07:09.530> I<00:07:09.560> have<00:07:09.950> to<00:07:10.130> talk<00:07:10.310> about<00:07:10.370> and<00:07:11.060> this

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:11.900 
that's all I have to talk about and this

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.140 
that's all I have to talk about and this
was<00:07:12.169> Rory<00:07:12.530> Davis<00:07:13.010> with<00:07:13.430> physical<00:07:14.000> and

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
was Rory Davis with physical and

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:20.050 
was Rory Davis with physical and
chemical<00:07:14.270> changes<00:07:15.080> thank<00:07:15.650> you<00:07:15.770> for<00:07:15.950> watching

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.120
