00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.920
 there are very good kids here villaman is 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.930
 this new video we are here in the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.769
 second of the channel we've been like 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.079
 fifa word and as the title says method 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.809
 of the trade or number one a very 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:19.440
 simple I explain more or less that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.130
 this game is a fifa style 14 voucher 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.840
 and well fifa 14 but also this 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.840
 matrix and the fifa 12 is a bit weird and it's 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.670
 free from origin good I explain 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.950
 we have to go to the store that is here 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.670
 up we go to these special envelopes 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.960
 of six coin stores 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.640
 in the load we open them 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.340
 and you will see what comes out 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.930
 As you can see, there are four contracts 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.949
 valued gold two silver and one of 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.620
 bronze vale here is the question 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:57.559
 We make 600 coins and each contract 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.129
 gold is worth 550 550 plus three hundred more 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.250
 three hundred plus two hundred we have 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.630
 amortized the envelope and earning money 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.540
 so we send everything to the list 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.420
 of transferable it is worth it you put it to 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.050
 sell and make a paste but let's go 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.390
 that flips and colorless successes 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.770
 the bronze we discard it is not usually 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.210
 to sell 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.359
 we are going to with the following about come 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.070
 let's open another one, let's buy it 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.539
 and position three coins I do not know how much 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.329

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:43.510

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.060

 so you can see what can come out 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.450
 also because there is a single contract but 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.020
