00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.429
 there's everybody that's attacking so 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.160
 today for a brand new 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.049
 video potential next great so that's the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.389
 second episode of this new series 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.190
 I mean I was really 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.019
 very very surprised at this first 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.929
 episode you have been very very many 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.490
 to love to comment and to share with me 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.650
 of your opinion so for these next 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.359
 players so for this second episode 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.119
 there are quite a few players that I've been 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.039
 look for myself and where I got myself 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 little used of you so had not 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.420
 bad good ideas like like there are 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.270
 twelve zai and griezmann so that's right 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.829
 that the merit so we will start with 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.380
 this first player who is Sunday 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.059
 berardi the italian player of sassuolo 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.550
 which base is at 72.2 usually rare 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.309
 that I passed to 76 gold no 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.350
 rare so it makes an increase of +4 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.129
 still not bad to note that it is 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.260
 already had two boost versions and so at 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 still be able to have very 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 very good gold stats I hope 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.750
 anyway he is I think landais 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 best scorer in series at 6 I think he 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.489
 must in the top 3 that's for sure and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.250
 certain 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.460
 for a player who is loaned by the juve 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 is a modest Italian club that makes 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.090
 still a good good 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.430
 nuggets in the future so that's why 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 that 76 is well deserved then we 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.909
 pass to the second player so this is the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.180
 French player two olympiques lyonnais 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.180
 alexandre lacazette so it's 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.680
 simple big fat season from him 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.930
 there too I believe that there he is in the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.049
 top 3 top 4 top scorers 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.250
 league behind ibrahimovic and cavani 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.360
 it seems to me that it's him with 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.520
 aboubakar so him the 75 our rare of 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.649
 basis was to move it to 78 and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.230
 blue m rare simply because in 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.020
 binding he does not have much 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.000
 by gomis who is his teammate but 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.890
 commits here it is not too much the top 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.130
 to play with lacazette it was 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.960
 really good gtc I really liked the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.480
 his card would really hurt more 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.130
 with a put feel it should 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.780
 something rather good 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.740
 then we will go to the third player 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.810
 the belgian manchester united so adnan 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.800
 januzaj so it goes down and it's simple 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.760
 it is 61 rare bronze so I put a 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.160
 little new to raise to 70 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.630
 in money so note that ben on his 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.120
 bronze card it's rather middle right 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.320
 but yesterday she plays middle left or 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.510
 offensive midfielder so that's why 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.120
 I put middle left or middle 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.890
 offensive just what I do not know 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.290
 which paid post will put it in any case 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.570
 it is a young player who was 18 years old 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.920
 who for months had executors with m 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.590
 and there is no problem for them 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.540
 be increased and 66 general I think 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.330
 that this will be his note 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.160
 then we continue with this 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.670
 fourth player who plays the real 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.010
 sociedad 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.100
 he is French it is of course antoine 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.540
 griezmann so him it's you who me 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.270
 said but I agree with you because 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.820
 it's a very good season I think 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.760
 that behind falck not falcao diego 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:10.470
 costa and crisis helping ronaldo this is the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.330
 top scorer so he makes 3rd of liga 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.860
 bbva and that's it I think it's one of 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.100
 very best at his position 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.770
 currently more than 10 goals in La Liga this 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.319
 does the tough 80 not rare I pass 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.230
 at 82.2 general with 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.670
 the rare card I hope he will have 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.989
 because he deserves it anyway and that 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.959
 would make a good map on the side 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.219
 left for a french and finally for 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.980
 finish with this fifth and last 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.790
 player of borussia german 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.760
 mönchengladbach 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.030
 marc andré ter stegen who is a little 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.310
 like antoine griezmann 80 our rare that 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.739
 I decided to move to 80 2 and 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.139
 to pass rare is simply 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.099
 one of the best or even maybe the 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.120
 best German goalkeeper of the moment 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.719
 certainly he did not have any greenery 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.120
 booth but every game is decisive 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:05.739
 gladbach and is not not 4th for nothing 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.810
 so here I think marc andré ter 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.849
 stegen simply deserves it 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.099
 one of the best germany so here we go 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.769
 I hope this second episode of 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.209
 potential the ex a brave you will have pleased if 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.639
 this is the case did not comment to 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.949
 to love and to tell me also in 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.470
 comments as often as the 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.660
 players that I can m at the next 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.750
 episodes that was razak by all the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.750
 world
