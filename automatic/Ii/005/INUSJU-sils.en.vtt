00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
on the other side you can hang this

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.840 
on the other side you can hang this
obviously<00:00:52.820> if<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:53.890> you<00:00:54.890> know<00:00:54.920> needs<00:00:55.670> to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
obviously if you have you know needs to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.389 
obviously if you have you know needs to
do<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.149> through<00:00:56.539> there<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:57.250> that's<00:00:58.250> pretty

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
do that through there and that's pretty

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.010 
do that through there and that's pretty
much<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.640> there's<00:00:58.940> no<00:00:59.030> led<00:00:59.420> by<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.690> way<00:00:59.840> no

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
much it there's no led by the way no

it's<00:01:02.510> about<00:01:02.750> capacity<00:01:03.620> performance<00:01:04.190> here<00:01:04.789> it

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
it's about capacity performance here it

264<00:01:23.030> mix<00:01:23.840> per<00:01:24.050> second<00:01:24.440> compared<00:01:25.069> to<00:01:25.220> the

264 mix per second compared to the
advertised<00:01:26.149> speed<00:01:26.300> so<00:01:26.690> falls<00:01:26.899> a<00:01:26.929> little<00:01:27.020> bit

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
advertised speed so falls a little bit

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.830 
advertised speed so falls a little bit
short<00:01:27.470> there<00:01:27.649> on<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.099> right<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:29.149> however<00:01:29.360> on

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
short there on the right but however on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.199 
short there on the right but however on
the<00:01:29.959> crystal<00:01:30.380> disk<00:01:30.679> mark<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.250> exceeded<00:01:31.970> both

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
the crystal disk mark it exceeded both

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.020 
the crystal disk mark it exceeded both
the<00:01:32.720> read<00:01:32.959> and<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.289> right<00:01:33.590> advertised<00:01:34.250> speed

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
the read and the right advertised speed

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.059 
the read and the right advertised speed
so<00:01:35.300> definitely<00:01:35.690> much<00:01:35.899> faster<00:01:36.410> than<00:01:36.560> what<00:01:36.890> it

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
so definitely much faster than what it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.490 
so definitely much faster than what it
mentioned<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.990> here<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.140> another<00:01:39.319> example

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
mentioned and here is another example

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.100 
mentioned and here is another example

copying a 2 gigabyte file I did copy a

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
500 and then I tried a 2 gigabyte file

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.960 
500 and then I tried a 2 gigabyte file
you<00:01:44.690> can<00:01:44.810> see<00:01:45.050> 14<00:01:45.530> seconds<00:01:46.069> to<00:01:46.429> copy<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.880> over

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
you can see 14 seconds to copy it over

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.710 
you can see 14 seconds to copy it over
