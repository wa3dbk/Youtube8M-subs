to<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.160> original<00:01:25.250> texture<00:01:26.000> it's<00:01:26.240> really

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
to the original texture it's really

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.310 
to the original texture it's really
really<00:01:27.200> pretty<00:01:27.490> it<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:28.760> all<00:01:29.300> one<00:01:29.750> length<00:01:30.050> all

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
really pretty it is all one length all

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.000 
really pretty it is all one length all
the<00:01:30.560> way<00:01:30.650> around<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:33.050> all<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.320> this<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:33.590> 22

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
the way around so all of this is 22

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.340 
the way around so all of this is 22
inches<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.940> I'm<00:01:35.090> thinking<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.870> best<00:01:36.080> thing

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
inches so I'm thinking the best thing

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.580 
inches so I'm thinking the best thing
for<00:01:36.380> me<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.680> do<00:01:37.070> is<00:01:37.370> to<00:01:37.660> style<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.930> on<00:01:39.110> my<00:01:39.290> own

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
for me to do is to style it on my own

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.360 
for me to do is to style it on my own
and<00:01:40.220> then<00:01:40.580> cut<00:01:41.120> some<00:01:41.330> layers<00:01:41.570> into<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.290> but<00:01:43.040> I'm

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
and then cut some layers into it but I'm

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.510 
and then cut some layers into it but I'm
really<00:01:43.760> really<00:01:43.880> feeling<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:44.930> pad<00:01:45.500> this<00:01:45.770> wavy

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
really really feeling this pad this wavy

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.890 
really really feeling this pad this wavy
pattern<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.840> hair<00:01:48.050> is<00:01:48.230> so<00:01:48.790> soft<00:01:49.790> it<00:01:50.300> was<00:01:50.660> soft

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
pattern the hair is so soft it was soft

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.390 
pattern the hair is so soft it was soft
when<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.140> got<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:51.620> now<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.920> I've<00:01:52.010> washed

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.520 
when I got it but now that I've washed
it<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.700> conditioned<00:01:53.240> it<00:01:53.390> it's<00:01:53.870> just<00:01:54.110> extra

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
it and conditioned it it's just extra

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.410 
it and conditioned it it's just extra
soft<00:01:54.740> has<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.960> comes<00:01:57.350> right<00:01:57.680> here<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.280> comb<00:01:59.240> in

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.440 
so one clip on this and one clip on this
s<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.220> can<00:02:04.370> actually<00:02:04.550> get<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.060> secure

styling it I did not cut this wig at all

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.110 
styling it I did not cut this wig at all
after<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.440> curled<00:03:59.860> it<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.100> really<00:04:00.610> really<00:04:00.910> liked

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
after I curled it I really really liked

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.690 
after I curled it I really really liked
it<00:04:01.560> maybe<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.770> was<00:04:02.860> just<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.130> fact<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.489> it

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
it maybe it was just the fact that it

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.090 
it maybe it was just the fact that it
needed<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:04.300> little<00:04:04.600> extra<00:04:04.810> something<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.980> be

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
needed a little extra something to be

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.690 
needed a little extra something to be
styled<00:04:06.640> so<00:04:08.760> all<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:09.940> did<00:04:10.000> was<00:04:10.269> use<00:04:10.300> a<00:04:10.620> spiral

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
styled so all I did was use a spiral

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.840 
styled so all I did was use a spiral
curling<00:04:12.700> iron<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.269> I<00:04:14.200> used<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.769> this<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.730> so
