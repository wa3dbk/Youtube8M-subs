00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
here outside Seattle on I think this is

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.160 
here outside Seattle on I think this is
so<00:00:49.820> snow<00:00:50.239> all<00:00:50.420> me

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170

pass with obvious snow and from pretty
deep<00:00:55.399> snow<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.729> boot<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.620> it's<00:00:57.620> even<00:00:57.920> more<00:00:57.949> fun

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
deep snow to boot and it's even more fun

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.350 
deep snow to boot and it's even more fun
than<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.460> couple<00:00:58.729> years<00:00:58.940> ago<00:01:00.909> big<00:01:01.909> things<00:01:02.180> with

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
the year old for this year they've got

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.680 
the year old for this year they've got
disc<00:01:04.280> brakes<00:01:04.369> all<00:01:04.759> around<00:01:04.789> they<00:01:05.210> had<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.420> disc

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
brake up front and 2011 when we last

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.040 
brake up front and 2011 when we last
tested<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:08.090> bike<00:01:08.330> but<00:01:08.539> now<00:01:08.600> they've<00:01:08.780> got<00:01:08.929> it

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
tested this bike but now they've got it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.469 
tested this bike but now they've got it
on<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.289> side<00:01:10.250> car<00:01:10.490> side<00:01:10.729> as<00:01:10.909> well<00:01:11.060> as<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.300> rear

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
on the side car side as well as the rear

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.690 
on the side car side as well as the rear
wheel<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:11.929> probably<00:01:12.710> even<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.860> bigger<00:01:13.100> deal<00:01:13.429> is

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
wheel and probably even a bigger deal is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.950 
wheel and probably even a bigger deal is
fuel<00:01:14.240> injection

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
fuel injection

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.080 
fuel injection
yes<00:01:15.289> Ural<00:01:15.679> has<00:01:15.860> sort<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.190> joined<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.759> modern

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
yes Ural has sort of joined the modern

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.899 
yes Ural has sort of joined the modern
age<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.630> some<00:01:17.840> degree<00:01:18.250> with<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.310> fuel<00:01:19.610> injection

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
age to some degree with a fuel injection

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.790 
age to some degree with a fuel injection
for<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:20.330> year<00:01:20.539> so<00:01:20.720> far<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.350> know<00:01:21.380> it<00:01:21.590> seems

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
for this year so far you know it seems

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.440 
for this year so far you know it seems
to<00:01:21.890> be<00:01:21.950> working<00:01:22.039> great<00:01:22.429> I<00:01:22.670> think<00:01:23.060> they<00:01:23.270> still

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
to be working great I think they still

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.020 
to be working great I think they still
got<00:01:23.600> little<00:01:23.810> bugs<00:01:23.960> work<00:01:24.229> out<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:24.470> little<00:01:24.710> bit<00:01:24.979> of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
got little bugs work out a little bit of

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.570 
got little bugs work out a little bit of
kind<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.060> hard<00:01:26.390> transition<00:01:26.750> between<00:01:27.580> dead

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
kind of hard transition between dead

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.700 
kind of hard transition between dead
stop<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:28.970> getting<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:29.810> going<00:01:29.899> in<00:01:30.200> first<00:01:30.409> gear

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
stop to getting it going in first gear

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.050 
stop to getting it going in first gear
but<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.069> know<00:01:31.159> that's<00:01:31.340> just<00:01:31.399> a<00:01:31.580> small<00:01:31.700> grub

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
but you know that's just a small grub

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.639 
but you know that's just a small grub
and<00:01:32.179> work<00:01:32.390> through<00:01:32.659> otherwise<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.530> know

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
and work through otherwise you know

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.710 
and work through otherwise you know
we're<00:01:33.830> up<00:01:33.920> your<00:01:34.100> elevation<00:01:34.490> obviously<00:01:35.179> it's

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
we're up your elevation obviously it's

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.840 
we're up your elevation obviously it's
running<00:01:36.080> fine<00:01:36.289> up<00:01:36.470> here<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:37.100> mean<00:01:37.460> we<00:01:37.610> run

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
running fine up here and I mean we run

running fine up here and I mean we run
it<00:01:37.970> through<00:01:38.000> deep<00:01:38.660> snow<00:01:38.869> all<00:01:39.140> day<00:01:39.170> we<00:01:39.590> run<00:01:39.830> it

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
it through deep snow all day we run it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.240 
it through deep snow all day we run it
through<00:01:40.000> stream<00:01:41.000> crossings<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.020> nothing<00:01:43.009> has

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
through stream crossings and nothing has

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.820 
through stream crossings and nothing has
stopped<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:43.970> motorcycle<00:01:44.660> so<00:01:44.810> far<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.709> know

stopped this motorcycle so far you know
obviously<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:46.399> is<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.640> two<00:01:46.789> wheel<00:01:47.000> drive

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
obviously this is the two wheel drive

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.229 
obviously this is the two wheel drive
version<00:01:47.690> this<00:01:48.470> dream<00:01:48.770> crossing<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.819> mean<00:01:50.119> oh<00:01:50.209> my

the new disc brakes they're utilizing a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.140 
the new disc brakes they're utilizing a
little<00:02:15.330> bit<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.569> drawback<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:17.150> $2,000

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
