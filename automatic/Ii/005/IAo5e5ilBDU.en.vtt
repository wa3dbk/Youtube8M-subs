00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
let's say we're in our office we're

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539 
let's say we're in our office we're
roaming<00:02:03.899> we're<00:02:04.229> outside<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> country<00:02:04.799> or

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
roaming we're outside the country or

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.069 
roaming we're outside the country or
trying<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> do<00:02:06.090> show<00:02:06.240> me<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> apps<00:02:06.600> without<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
trying to do show me the apps without a

trying to do show me the apps without a
wireless<00:02:07.530> signal

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.649 

so<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.680> idea<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.220> we<00:02:12.610> really<00:02:12.819> we<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.239> our

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
so the idea is that we really we and our

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.089 
so the idea is that we really we and our
philosophy<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.650> everything<00:02:15.069> should

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
philosophy is that everything should

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.240 
philosophy is that everything should
stay<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.670> same<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.480> way<00:02:16.629> you've<00:02:16.810> dial<00:02:17.250> should
