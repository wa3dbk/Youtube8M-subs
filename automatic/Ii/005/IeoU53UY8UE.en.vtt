00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 hi how about i'm going to start here is 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.160
 targeted by weaving my 2 chains very 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.320
 reinforced as regularly start 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.039
 my tissues 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.039
 here 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.480
 is just fine from here I'm going 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.849
 to weave five chains 2 3 4 5 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.610
 just as you see here that's how the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.890
 I start all my tissues that are with 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.900
 two very reinforced chains after 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.000
 continue with my string strip 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.180
 depending on the stitch that is going to be 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.089
 in this case it was a stitch that is a 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.040
 cord that was very narrow and it is 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.230
 basically like we started the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.320
 I will show you here because there are 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.629
 people who have asked me how 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.930
 finish a good fabric here we saw 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.940
 how the tissue starts every tissue I 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.280
 I start same with two very chains 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.250
 reinforced and then I start my fabric 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.910
 and I'll finish it here with two chains 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.240
 very reinforced that would make the chain 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:17.230
 and pulling the thread as it can pulled 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.570
 to be a few centimeters long 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.720
 more or less this long really is not 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.680
 much the four centimeters cut the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.910
 strand and here pulled and with this I no longer 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.620
 thwart this is how we finish another 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.620
 thing that I have also been asked is 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.860
 how can they hide the thread that remained 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.920
 at the beginning and at the end of the good tissue 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.110
 here I depending on each fabric but 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.960
 what I suggest is that you 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.140
 look where the hidden 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.810
 strand in a way that we can 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.030
 go through more points for example here if 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 I have tissues these high points here 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.640
 I here grab the base of the points that 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.340
 is this where we have left to say the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.110
 chains very close together 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.490
 and here I put the hook 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.490
 between points 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.000
 A) Yes 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.420
 then grab it look at it go through 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.150
 several points that were anchored 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.860
 I grab the thread here and I pass it here 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.080
 until you get it to the other end like this here 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.290
 I can already cut that era or I can 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.630
 continue hiding the and in some other 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.420
 point here here for example 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.180
 we have the advantage of that and what 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.849
 We are hiding and tissue where 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.400
 we are hiding it is the same color by 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.670
 example here look I would go again to 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.220
 the basis of the turn that would be in these 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.750
 points in these points is where 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.630
 the strand is easily hidden 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.620
 Look, I've already passed the hook over there and here 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.890
 happened here 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.620
 and here for example as I already had 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.590
 several points sure it is not going to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.099
 Saving what is the thread then I 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.310
 I can cut that is here for example 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:23.800
 Be careful not to cut the tissue 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.290
 to hide it in what is the beginning 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.950
 now I'm going to hide it in what is the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.440
 final in the end for example here I what 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.010
 what I do is grabbed by the part of 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.319
 I put up the hook and pulled this 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.099
 is another way of hiding it and then by 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:46.180
 the bottom of the next point 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:49.660
 of the hook grabbed the thread and pulled it out 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.640
 down there are different ways of 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.200
 hide it is what you 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.769
 look better because there are also 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.200
 Stitches that are very flexible are very 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.750
 easy to hide the strand and there 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.450
 other stitches in what are so open 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.940
 that hide the thread this we have to 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.040
 look for him but something that I like is 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.500
 always go to what is the basis of 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.470
 point from here of the high point point 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.510
 are here here for example me at the time of 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.000
 pulling the thread was thus true the point 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.000
 I arranged it to see how far it goes 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.340
 the thread and I there already cut him because 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.860
 because let's say that 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.680
 somehow it is enough to pass the 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.500
 point by about 4 points and already with that no 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.250
 it is disrupted and so different than it was 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.010
 when we join together when we're done 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.380
 hide the strands that if we leave it like that 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.510
 these threads look very ugly and also 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.050
 something else for example in this case this 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.780
 which is very thick in the tissue we 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.210
 We use a thicker hook sometimes 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.150
 we could also more easily 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.900
 take a hook that is thinner to 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.960
 that we use with the fabric and we pass 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.360
 our thread through the points here 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.750
 for example as it was short it was 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.060
 easy to hide it and in this case here by 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.180
 example I'm going to the base as they 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.910
 said about the points how the hook is 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.460
 thinner it's easier to enter here 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.610
 nothing else grabbed and you have to have nothing else 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.520
 note that if it is thinner the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.970
 width sometimes 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.040
 pulling the thread does not pull it to the 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:36.260
 first then 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.260
 there we will go see with practice 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.100
 we can go here point by point 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:56.410
 and has already gone through these points with this 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.410
 It would be enough here and we cut 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.480
 and they were hidden 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.580
 thank you for being here that are very 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.580
 well until the next
