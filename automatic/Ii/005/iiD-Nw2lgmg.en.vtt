00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.510
 out of the house on the front of my house from the garden drawing mythos biking 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.750
 on the saddle 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.820

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.160

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.590
 of life 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.020
 let's say everyday life I don't remember about what is their course. the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.260
 Rovereto's films see the stories of the people you put in that make me 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.840
 nearly every day 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.950
 let's talk about a gentleman 8 copies who died 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.859
 more than fifty years ago at dawn from 2 January 1960 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.690
 our gentleman bartali gino 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.799
 he died ten years ago but in fact ended his cycling career 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.790
 55 years ago 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.610
 greenhouse 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130
 the rival to beat 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.450
 was 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 the rival from 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.360
 that beat him for this faint coppi coppi fausto 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.370
 fausto coppi ooh that one there 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.520
 going around home so much so then 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.119
 empoli finding myself with fassino copy with marina copy 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.280
 it is as if I had found a home with friends that I feel 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.450
 it is so 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.790
 between them 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.790
 there was great professional esteem 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.290
 a great 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.520
 great fairness and loyalty outside 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.530
 but when they were running they had signed for two different teams and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.599
 therefore they gave battle without exclusion of blows with hardness with 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.430
 stubbornness with strength with intelligence pumice the beginning with cunning but always with 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.519
 loyalty never with malice 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.519
 if I talk to you here are your old e 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:27.959
 runners who ran like he does if my dad's team got me 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.439
 always said that I work. papa stravato san martino 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.899
 virgilio I've always said the opposite 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.789
 so let's leave let's leave this thing to a stove 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.839
 the imagination of people my father to avoid creating problems 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.639
 I would answer by asking another question 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.449
 you are bartali setelco si that of wax for bartali 3 5 glossy shot for tiles 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.649
 of the date he 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.979
 repairs to batteries that I saw 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.460
 once parma 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.970
 when I still 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.250
 guy creates a stage of the tour of italy say this man 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.179
 marchetti followed by just laughing 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.819
 around with his car I will remember a white car with 'stay 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.199
 bartali 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.199
 you still bring me his physical superstars school 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.390
 that 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.240
 despite being quite a young pro if I still have the whole second only 7 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.640
 go to the phone center alone the person definitely 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.690
 do not hesitate to understand the four way philosopher for my dad because he has 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.690
 a physical except yourself 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.749
 bartali begin to win very young 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:04:00.619
 he was 22 years old and at 22 he won his first tour of Italy at 23 he won the 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.309
 his second tour of Italy 24 years b on his first tour de force then 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.299
 in 1940 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.319
 when he was 26 years old 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.999
 the war started 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.589
 and try to think what is lit to lose 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.569
 all the years ranging from 26 to 31 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.370
 in fact his career came from biotin 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.740
 smooth do many other things after they want to do it again 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.990
 not even the world title which was perhaps the only thing I envy of its great 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.500
 rival 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.029
 fausto coppi 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.870
 bartali then 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.870
 he was close to copp in so many moments so many moments were exchanged 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.189
 moments like saying pain 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.000
 surely the first to go when you buy not 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.490
 his big bank was just gino bartali 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.909
 tiles 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.189
 he began to run 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.409
 by the end of the 1930s in 1940 it was already q 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.770
 but even for him the war was deadly, you think he won his first lap 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.770
 from Italy its first of the five tours of Italy 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.620
 June 9, 1940 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.629
 the day after the war slow buffering 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.729
 a bad day certainly for Italy but also for beating even for movie mice 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.469
 whole massacred their career 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.360
 kolko still likes you so much during the war even succeeded 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.990
 conquer the hour record the vigorelli bombed the fortresses 

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:21.020
 Anglo-Americans in Milan 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.780
 guide made war mischa barton and reality only made it though he did 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.120
 heroic gestures in the street militia 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.330
 copying 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.409
 in africa kidney taken prisoner 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.229
 I mark the soft rights that malaria that then would have cost the 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.529
 life when he was not yet 40 years old 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.969
 his career developed especially after the war was the first runner 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.619
 win the tour the tour simultaneously in the same year 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:49.939
 then in 1949 he made 52 n53 porn his career becoming world champion 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.229
 e60 coppi and bartali should have run together war 3 had a team 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.210
 the young pilgrim saint 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.629
 and coppi must be his non-player captain, not runners on the pitch 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:06.819
 logisty clouds differently for you coppi you went to africa contras an illness 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.180
 that the doctors at the tortona hospital could not identify 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.060
 at dawn 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.020
 2002 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.819
 January of 1960 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:16.919
 bartali 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.259
 seen so many years after him 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.580
 the champion is perhaps not even melancholy, perhaps in decline, perhaps to whom 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.289
 something was missing to say that his career was perfect 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.629
 but he lived and died a gentleman 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.889
 he died ten years ago he got buried 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.659
 with a tertiary Dominican habit white volley in the coffin 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.409
 for what 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.990
 the gold medal for civil valor that he had won by saving 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.960
 dozens and dozens of Jews 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.779
 during the war but this is felt alone 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:51.279
 the badge of Catholic action that had been the beacon of his life 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.370
 and someone even slipped a photograph of fausto coppi into his coffin 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.849
 so these great rivals 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:59.879
 the month together together per cent
