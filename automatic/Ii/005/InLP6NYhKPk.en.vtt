being a video game nerd it kind of goes

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.119 
being a video game nerd it kind of goes
without<00:00:50.370> saying<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.969> should<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
without saying that you should see it

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.979 
without saying that you should see it
but<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.370> also<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.390> people<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.899> are

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
but I think also for people that are

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.889 
but I think also for people that are
sort<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.820> just<00:00:56.820> independent<00:00:57.270> filmmakers<00:00:57.719> or

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
sort of just independent filmmakers or

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
sort of just independent filmmakers or
people<00:00:58.170> thinking<00:00:58.530> about<00:00:58.800> getting<00:00:59.280> in

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
people thinking about getting in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.950 
people thinking about getting in
directing<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.180> things<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.510> there's<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
directing and things like that there's a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.509 
directing and things like that there's a
lot<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.320> learn<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.809> kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> watching

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
lot to learn from this kind of watching

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.890 
lot to learn from this kind of watching
the<00:01:05.519> process<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.090> how<00:01:06.180> James<00:01:06.450> has<00:01:06.630> put<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the process of how James has put this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.359 
the process of how James has put this
movie<00:01:07.170> together<00:01:07.320> over<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.799> past<00:01:07.979> three<00:01:08.340> or

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
movie together over the past three or

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.030 
movie together over the past three or
four<00:01:08.580> years<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> seeing<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
four years and kind of seeing what the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
four years and kind of seeing what the
end<00:01:11.189> result<00:01:11.520> looks<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.960> were

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
end result looks like what they were

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.870 
end result looks like what they were
able<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.770> their<00:01:13.890> their<00:01:14.400> budget<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
able to do for their their budget of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
able to do for their their budget of
they<00:01:15.720> may<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.320> three<00:01:16.439> hundred

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
they may have like three hundred

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.719 
they may have like three hundred
twenty-five<00:01:16.920> thousand<00:01:17.340> dollars<00:01:17.580> or

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
twenty-five thousand dollars or

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.380 
twenty-five thousand dollars or
something<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> movie<00:01:20.390> so

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
something like that to make the movie so

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.910 
something like that to make the movie so
from<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.570> perspective<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.229> also<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.590> fun

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
from that perspective it's also very fun

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.350 
from that perspective it's also very fun
I<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.340> there's<00:01:23.460> probably<00:01:23.610> people<00:01:24.180> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
I think there's probably people that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
I think there's probably people that
wouldn't<00:01:24.659> enjoy<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.189> you're<00:01:26.310> not

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
wouldn't enjoy it I think if you're not

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.539 
wouldn't enjoy it I think if you're not
familiar<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.939> his<00:01:27.119> comedy<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.920> probably

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
familiar with his comedy it probably

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
familiar with his comedy it probably
wouldn't<00:01:30.299> work<00:01:30.360> too<00:01:30.689> well<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.439> does<00:01:31.619> kind<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
wouldn't work too well it does kind of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.120 
wouldn't work too well it does kind of
run<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> long<00:01:32.850> side<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> full

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
run on the long side it is like a full

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.670 
run on the long side it is like a full

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
got to see this and we had tears in our

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.600 
got to see this and we had tears in our
eyes<00:02:08.700> laughing<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.720> hard<00:02:09.959> at<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.580> when<00:02:11.580> I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
eyes laughing so hard at it and when I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.550 
eyes laughing so hard at it and when I
heard<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.330> they<00:02:12.450> were<00:02:12.480> making<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
heard that they were making a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
heard that they were making a
feature<00:02:13.770> length<00:02:14.250> film<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.360> almost

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
feature length film out of it I almost

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.300 
feature length film out of it I almost
thought<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.349> would<00:02:16.410> be<00:02:16.560> impossible<00:02:16.590> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
thought that it would be impossible that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.210 
thought that it would be impossible that
it<00:02:17.459> would<00:02:17.550> be<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.849> funny<00:02:18.150> because<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.620> works<00:02:19.980> so

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
it would be is funny because it works so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.010 
it would be is funny because it works so
well<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.760> short<00:02:21.000> form<00:02:21.360> yeah<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.989> I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
well in the short form yeah that I

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.780 
well in the short form yeah that I
thought<00:02:22.319> that<00:02:22.590> extending<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.280> was<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.700> to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
thought that extending it was going to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.600 
thought that extending it was going to
just<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.780> know<00:02:24.810> murdering<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.830> but

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
just be like you know murdering it but

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.420 
just be like you know murdering it but
it<00:02:26.910> played<00:02:27.810> more<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.349> kind<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> kevin

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430

smith jay and silent bob strike back

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.370 
smith jay and silent bob strike back
kind<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.370> really<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.150> kind<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.599> thing<00:02:33.810> yeah

done but in a very precise manner and it
still<00:04:01.410> comes<00:04:01.620> across<00:04:01.859> as<00:04:02.100> very<00:04:02.130> funny<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.150> my

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
still comes across as very funny in my

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
and third acts are definitely the better

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.740

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
talk a little bit more about just kind

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.490

of<00:04:25.120> things<00:04:25.300> about<00:04:25.450> it<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:28.320> was<00:04:29.320> actually

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
of things about it I I was actually

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.250 
of things about it I I was actually
surprised<00:04:30.040> at<00:04:30.280> how<00:04:30.430> well<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.450> held<00:04:31.870> up<00:04:32.050> I

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
surprised at how well it held up I

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.110 
surprised at how well it held up I
thought<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.620> they<00:04:32.770> would<00:04:32.920> kind<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:33.910> lose

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
thought that they would kind of lose

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.210 
thought that they would kind of lose
momentum<00:04:34.720> after<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.290> while<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:35.740> really<00:04:36.010> start

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
momentum after a while you really start

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.850 
momentum after a while you really start
to<00:04:36.250> sit<00:04:36.460> down<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:38.230> felt<00:04:38.440> like<00:04:38.500> they<00:04:38.680> did<00:04:38.830> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
to sit down and I felt like they did a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.980 
to sit down and I felt like they did a
really<00:04:39.040> good<00:04:39.190> job<00:04:39.250> of<00:04:39.690> holding<00:04:40.690> things

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
really good job of holding things

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.680 
really good job of holding things
together<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:42.340> know<00:04:42.520> making<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:43.030> making

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
together and you know making it making

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.240 
together and you know making it making
it<00:04:43.750> funny<00:04:43.990> throughout<00:04:44.350> its<00:04:44.500> like<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> balancing

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
it funny throughout its like a balancing

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.460 
it funny throughout its like a balancing
act<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.730> being<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.090> good<00:04:46.300> bad<00:04:46.570> movie<00:04:47.050> like

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470

but they don't want to make a completely

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.730 
but they don't want to make a completely
unwatchable<00:04:52.030> piece<00:04:52.510> of<00:04:52.870> either<00:04:53.110> riot

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
unwatchable piece of either riot

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.950 
unwatchable piece of either riot
and<00:04:53.980> they<00:04:54.520> do<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.700> great<00:04:54.910> job<00:04:55.030> balancing<00:04:55.480> that

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
and they do a great job balancing that

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.800 
and they do a great job balancing that
for<00:04:56.230> the<00:04:56.290> sake<00:04:56.500> of<00:04:56.530> comedy<00:04:57.100> yeah<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.880> he<00:04:58.210> even

for the sake of comedy yeah and he even

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.230 
for the sake of comedy yeah and he even
