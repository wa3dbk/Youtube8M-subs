00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.350
 he is a fable rock resende and this morning 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.010
 in China 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.260
 this is the little bug -lazy heat 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.849
 It's summer, right? 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.190
 and you need the note yet for 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.170
 protect tattoos in the cause of the sun 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 top of the sun with your dog with us 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.529
 but today I will speak because which a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.490
 little different is easy 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.590
 the bath the dogs then with this heat have 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.590
 A lot of people who will think 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.640
 cool to walk my dog's mother every day 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.759
 that's nice 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.079
 the difference of bath and play in the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.200
 water because it is the bath is when you use a 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 product a shampoo in the most beautiful house such 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.530
 go play nawa damey and dirt can even 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.539
 be since there was nothing that one thing 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.550
 very important to think because people 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.440
 When are you saying that I thought that? 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.410
 remember the frequency of the bath which 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.809
 animal would then be submitted 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.520
 You bathe in it every day, you 're not. 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.559
 doing the best for your dog 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.260
 Ideally, you bathe in your 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.909
 dog once a week at most to 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 unless the veterinarian has a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.310
 reason to recommend more baths 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 that's where you pay attention to the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.020
 water temperature because if you 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 it was very hot, your dog is going 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.430
 to die of heat even to a water 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.409
 very cold it will die of cold or 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.320
 any right temperature is one that 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.500
 you put it in your hand you will feel a 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.870
 Rum 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.910
 alone to jump on my back in child 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.470
 I already tell it is not a very 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.710
 important you have to pay close attention to 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.530
 because you have products to trade the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.410
 cub own products product 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.810
 will these there is a good reason 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.180
 the veterinarians who explain it there 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.470
 you have to see then also beyond this 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.729
 age issue 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.790
 the type of shampoo - smoked 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.740
 do not use that super fragrant already thought 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.869
 scream you're going to kill your dog 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.369
 But the smell is already getting irritated. 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.740
 with people who went through a lot of danger 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.649
 near you imagine a dog that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.440
 gave much better fact much more 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.899
 found that our example sort of 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.190
 heads 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.830
 so now I have a very question 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.489
 important after the bath is to dry your 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.930
 dog 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.540
 this pressure of the most important points 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.040
 if you do not know your dog right 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.730
 in the first place you can predispose 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.520
 there is a ringworm for example are fungi 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.830
 which grow in public places and beyond 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.420
 The question of ringworm is also the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.640
 They like to shower the dog. 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.519
 stop being and drying in the sun 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.170
 This is really cool because the dog 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.570
 drying what it works more or less 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.060
 how a food comes out of the oven 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.340
 they are very small things, they are 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.290
 leader and loses heat very fast then 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.799
 you can be present with your dog to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.410
 hyperthermia or hypothermia 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.769
 so you better dry it really well 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.950
 dry before let out to walk 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.320
 she uses a hair dryer can 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.910
 help in this activity 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.620
 then put the dryer 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.860
 Let's thank the hair in a 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.280
 temperature well and you can use 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.180
 now in some gains that are afraid of 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.800
 dryer 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.540
 But we'll talk about this in another one. 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.460
 drugs there we will explain better 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.630
 this list of seven years 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.630
 bye bye bye
