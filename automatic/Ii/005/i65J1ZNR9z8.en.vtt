which have the dark bezel your eye sees
the<00:01:31.850> bezel<00:01:32.179> as<00:01:32.299> part<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.899> fighting<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.530> the

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
the bezel as part of the fighting of the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.919 
the bezel as part of the fighting of the

walk in part of the dial and that gives

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.410 
walk in part of the dial and that gives
it<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.109> visual<00:01:36.469> effect<00:01:36.829> of<00:01:37.039> being<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.909> larger

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
it a visual effect of being a larger

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.660 
it a visual effect of being a larger
watch<00:01:38.719> this<00:01:39.439> I<00:01:39.590> think<00:01:39.649> will<00:01:40.009> certainly<00:01:40.369> suit

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
watch this I think will certainly suit

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.969 
watch this I think will certainly suit
people<00:01:41.090> who<00:01:41.179> have<00:01:41.420> an<00:01:41.719> issue<00:01:41.899> with<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.530> larger

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
people who have an issue with a larger

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.679 
people who have an issue with a larger
body<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:43.609> can<00:01:43.729> still<00:01:43.909> wear<00:01:43.999> that<00:01:44.060> 44

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
body you can still wear that 44

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.539 
body you can still wear that 44
millimeter<00:01:45.109> and<00:01:45.710> because<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.100> is<00:01:46.189> a<00:01:46.219> steel

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
millimeter and because it is a steel

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.660 
millimeter and because it is a steel
bezel<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.960> will<00:01:48.200> sure<00:01:48.920> enough<00:01:49.249> pick<00:01:49.460> up<00:01:49.609> a

bezel you will sure enough pick up a
couple<00:01:49.789> scratches<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.450> won't

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
couple scratches but it won't

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.749 
couple scratches but it won't
deteriorate<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.710> sense<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.189> its<00:01:52.369> visual

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759

job yeah exactly I think that's pretty
sharp<00:02:27.120> too<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.720> believe<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> great<00:02:28.500> addition<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
sharp too I believe a great addition to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.760 
sharp too I believe a great addition to
the<00:02:29.610> iris<00:02:30.030> diver<00:02:30.390> date<00:02:30.630> range<00:02:30.930> really

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the iris diver date range really

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.950 
the iris diver date range really
complements<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.060> said<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.840> a

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
complements it and like I said it's a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.990 
complements it and like I said it's a
watch<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.350> appears<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:35.220> West<00:02:35.460> more<00:02:35.730> than<00:02:35.910> it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
watch that appears to West more than it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.980 
watch that appears to West more than it
really<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.690> also<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:39.090> another<00:02:39.450> addition

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
really is and also it's another addition

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.930 
really is and also it's another addition
to<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> diver<00:02:40.380> range<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:41.520> will<00:02:41.700> quite

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
to the diver range that will quite

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.520 
to the diver range that will quite
easily<00:02:42.180> wear<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> dress<00:02:42.960> watch<00:02:43.320> yeah
