 U 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.090
 My furniture is now 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.240
 Used in everyday life 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.150
 More visual than furniture 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:33.130
 In the genre that highlighted the formative part 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:38.230
 Art phone is a car, but it can be seen as a combination of art and furniture 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:44.290
 The exhibition is now larger Chevy Mother pattern is not now ripe 5 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:49.390
 It means organic, but it's natural and curvy . 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:52.780
 In general , you can see a square or triangle circle in clothes or wallpaper 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.839
 Button I combine 3,000 metal and wood 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.809
 Sometimes they reveal a three-dimensional form. 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:04.780
 With the combination of fabric and wood 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 Visually interesting by combining a soft, curved feel with the estuary 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.430
 You can see the sculptures 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.640
 This time, when agent 5 prepares the pattern, 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:28.000
 It's the first work I've done, but the title is Flow, 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:33.430
 I have the concept of flowing. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.210
 Right big bones that make up the bench eunira buy another conversation piece and look to buy 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.369
 Connecting 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:45.550
 There are changes in the nuts and bolts of the strength of the skeleton and 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:47.560
 It is natural when you see the bones of the length or the top of the canine, 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.830
 As if showing a wavy pattern 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.130
 Now, the Bose can 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.880
 We are making fun of it. 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.080
 And the tree I used is light, and the pitch tree is now in another tree 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.690
 In comparison 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:09.399
 It has high strength and flexibility so people do not fall when they sit down. 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.450
 When I bounce and come back again, I am younger than any other tree. 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.450
 I declare and use it. 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.340
 I 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:29.519
 There's so much going on in the beginning created the title off Pell 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.670
 It will have the waver is twitching away the surface with a mean 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.230
 Now look is actually flat 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.280
 The wider part comes out and looks like it came in good parts, 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.720
 Rolled 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.319
 It can be seen as a product that causes a slight optical ill effect by showing such a shape 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.489
 There is 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:53.489
 This image is created using a computer program . 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:55.920
 The wood is placed horizontally yeogida now a machine with a computer program. 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.810
 It was like the shape of the yaw curve. 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.650
 Then, 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.400
 In the way I put a vertical tree 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.620
 I do not actually bounced a straight processed wood 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.770
 You'll jump in and you 'll see the shape . 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.420
 The white bird on the back is a cliff 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.170
 Look at the combination of colors and feel the Korean lighting 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.170
 Then I loaded it. 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:38.510
 It's Suspendra work, but the stand means it's going to take a while now. 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:44.000
 The great feature of this work is that it is a hard wood, 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.320
 Fabric combination to Lee government is starting to head in the middle of the three of us are running 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.100

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:57.170
 I've been put in the part where the gap widens and the debt cleans and holds. 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:04.200
 When light comes out * 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:12.010
 You can see more of the intensity of light changes 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.010
