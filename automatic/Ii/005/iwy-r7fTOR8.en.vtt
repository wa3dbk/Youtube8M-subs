00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.210
 yo everybody knows that so cases 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.880
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.849
 video about setting up a rack for 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 tell little lucile hiatus so a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.400
 rack what is it basically at the post office 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.519
 of a terrarium it's a box 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.760
 plastic so already why choose a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.699
 rack so in general have chosen the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.650
 halls for a matter of place 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.930
 why because so that allows you to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.520
 will say to superimpose the milk cans 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.649
 to store them on the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.480
 others in order to gain a gain of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.550
 place for example a terrarium 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.500
 you can stack them one on the other 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 others but there will always be there will be 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.629
 always bigger question decor is 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 everything while there he will really have the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.910
 the same size panaf we will say not 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.480
 will be a little smaller than a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.219
 terrarium 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.789
 but he will have ample plague hull he 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.360
 must be in his will we say in 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.119
 are in a good living condition 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.750
 so here so it's for a couple of 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.390
 raku dactyle us so that normally I 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:27.659
 get tomorrow it's a little late 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:29.340
 it's about 10:15 am so I'm going 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.820
 try to do this fast enough 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.369
 so here so it's a box that makes 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.509
 60 liters which therefore measure 60 per 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.009
 40 by 32 o 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.770
 so I'll be able to put a couple 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.210
 even a trio of raco small luce 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.299
 so we will start so first of all 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.229
 the substrate therefore the best sopalin for 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.659
 all that is rare 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.210
 so why sopaline yes it's not 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.790
 aesthetic at all 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.380
 but then why already had question 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.479
 cleaning is the top 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.770
 you just have to change them once 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:11.750
 every week and then basta 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:14.630
 then no controls and risk 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.500
 of critters with as with the sand or 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:22.520
 what or not and that peat and last 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.290
 point that's I know what I'm doing 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.110
 say oh yes it avoids occlusions 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.730
 intestinal so for that it's really 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.060
 top up 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.480
 So that's the basis of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.090
 our rac then 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.850
 so you can see my video so on 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.380
 the mast will hold kodak stylus i think that 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.560
 I do it again one so stays in the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.170
 collection and into a rack and not 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.320
 in one case so there is need for moisture 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.720
 and of land because there they like well 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.830
 to dig while we have a box of 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.660
 well wet peat 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.600
 so here I am, I 'm proud to see 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.739
 my 36 shots that they have when 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.739
 even enough to dig well 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:20.730
 then hop for them the better they 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.159
 are still quite arboreal so 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.580
 who die times the branches and 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.010
 leaves 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.290
 so that after either you put some 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.480
 pits of false plants except vaud 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.730
 but real me so I have a tree 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.260
 who makes leaves not bad with 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.230
 branches a little bit wavy and everything 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.069
 so I think it's nice so here 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.040
 a small branch 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:47.329
 they have enough to hide and all of 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:51.269
 to jump we are like that 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.769
 then two small bowls then they 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:59.819
 make toddlers wiam moors to him 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:03.810
 so a compote or chi space and 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:14.940
 the other for the water to pick a 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:17.310
 of water and our jules left empty and 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.310
 Here in yes I forgot to show you 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.930
 obviously I think about it at the end then 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:28.979
 that's it - and that's the full bucket 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.349
 is good has changed super good it's not 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.680
 serious rare a way it's fast or 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:39.690
 more than one rack 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:43.320
 so yes we have to make holes then 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.880
 I do not know if you see there to do 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.880
 holes all the way around 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.120
 hop 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:56.520
 little advice do it with a iron to 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.370
 solder soldering iron so you leave 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.880
 heat up and then you do it 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.979
 to melt 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.979
 it's a lot faster it stays 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.500
 clean enough and where so I did that 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.479
 in two minutes all the loved ones must 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:16.550
 do and is west went 150 holes in 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:20.780
 everything so that's so it's pretty fast 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.780
 then a lid 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.309
 hop 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.949
 so the best thing is to have a box 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.779
 transparent 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.949
 why just like that you 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.779
 do not need to add two lamps 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.949
 you put it a place lit up there 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.319
 will have his cycle day night 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.839
 it does not need heating so no 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:44.409
 need more and here you have your 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:44.409
 rack for a cost of news cydia tus
