I think the reason they call this one
the<00:02:25.640> vintage<00:02:26.120> overdrive<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.140> doesn't<00:02:27.440> go

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
the vintage overdrive is it doesn't go

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.560 
the vintage overdrive is it doesn't go
over<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.040> top<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.610> amount<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.270> driver

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570
