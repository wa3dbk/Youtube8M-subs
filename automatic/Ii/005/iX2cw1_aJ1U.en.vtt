00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.240
 today we are going to make a case for 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.060
 save pencils or whatever we want 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.879
 delineate we're going to need eva rubber 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.830
 yellow blue colors minion a scissors 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.990
 a zipper of 20 centimeters and 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.770
 glue for rubber eva I use with the 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:23.110
 hot we take a yellow strip of 15 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.510
 x 25 and a blue of 8 x 25 we put the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.460
 blue on top of the yellow you see this goes 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.400
 to be our minion now let's 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.710
 cut the blue cut to make the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.120
 pants cut some circles 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.440
 semicircles on each side 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.870
 I start cutting a side then folded the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.940
 I cut the other one like the first one and 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.940
 last I'll cut in the center 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.330
 well now unfold and stick the pants 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.110
 to the yellow part to the rubber eva 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.480
 yellow we beat well and we already have the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.420
 first part the following we are going to 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.540
 need white gray black eva rubber 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 to do what is the top part 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.450
 we will also need to do the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.280
 pockets that we will make in rubber 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.190
 eva blue 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.840
 Well, you see, I made a pocket that 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.160
 we're going to put it in the center of the breastplate 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.580
 in the front part which is the 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.820
 right from what we are doing then 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.130
 I've done two rounds milestones that go to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.150
 be the side pockets and finally 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.680
 what is the stitching of my pocket 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.170
 Now cut a piece of black eva rubber 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.880
 that I stick part in what is the strip of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.580
 the glasses I have also cut a circle 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.950
 in gray and white good inside the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.630
 white circle I will put the black pupil and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.610
 then a white tip that will be the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.920
 look I'm also going to cut 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.740
 a little black to make the mouth that 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.170
 it costs angry or happy I'm going to 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.789
 put happy now we have to do 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.380
 the side windows so that the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.570
 case is more spacious and fit 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.250
 many pencils or whatever we want for 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.310
 I'm going to cut two pieces of eva rubber 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.280
 I'm going to cut one blue and one 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.320
 yellow these pieces measure 8 x 4 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.850
 centimeters or so I can make a 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.800
 little rounded in the corner below 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.420
 Well, I'll put the blue part 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.209
 of the trousers and yellow in the part 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.400
 from above to do what I do is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.730
 fold in my minion in half for 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.430
 have the middle point and I hit the blue 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.980
 right in the middle say together the two 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.530
 eva rubber centers I put a little bit of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.970
 glue and I stick it out I'm going to 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.590
 paste blue different than yellow 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.390
 so you can see the difference the blue what 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.430
 He hits inward and yellow you 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.890
 I'll stick out but you can do the same 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.959
 paste them as you want now raised a 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.810
 little one of the corners I put glue 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.450
 again on the side of the blue and I hit 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.160
 that eye wall that does not have to reach me 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.840
 up and everything has to be a 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.750
 piece to put the zipper 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.750
 well now I hit the other side I put 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.819
 again glue on that side and I stick it 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.890
 If there's a little left over 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.750
 of the corners so cut is one step 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.310
 more because it's better to do them a bit 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.140
 round always squared all 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.420
 It's also easier if you do it in 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.840
 good block you see that I stayed here 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.060
 a gap in which I will be able to put the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.879
 zipper the zipper goes sideways to 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.230
 side and I'm going to paste it too I remove it 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.080
 that is careful is that when I stuck it 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.580
 do not stick on top of the zig zag because 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.440
 if not then the zipper does not go up and down 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.510
 so be careful that it's only in 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.519
 the fabric part if you have done it with 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.260
 the same measures as they left over one 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.060
 little zipper nothing happens because 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.980
 that will help us then to open 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.910
 and it closes better then we'll cover the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.079
 final 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.989
 well then once we have it stuck 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.090
 we open the zipper and hit the other 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.750
 I can open it, you can do it without 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.160
 open 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.140
 it's easier so I think then 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.060
 we put again glue on the 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.459
 zipper with care as I say no 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.459
 touch the zig-zag and paste 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.910
 Well, we already have the zipper 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.209
 list you see 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.310
 now let's paste the yellow bellows and 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.930
 then we will finish the zipper 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.850
 to paste the yellow was the same 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.380
 we've done in the blue we started with 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.810
 the center that I'm going to now 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.120
 in front you see and then we paste the 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.700
 side that's what suits me like 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.820
 I give equal preference for both 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.620
 ways you see now we turn inwards 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.100
 and we helped each other a little by putting our hands 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.260
 inside 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.060
 and we do the same with the other side and 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.190
 so we have left we will finish the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.950
 zipper for that let's put a 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.210
 yellow strip because it touches on the side of 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.790
 the head so we paste a bit the two 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.820
 parts together and now we stick by the 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.160
 other side and that 's it and finally we're going to 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.750
 also put the eva rubber strip on the 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.790
 another part of the zipper in the part 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.580
 below you see this strip that we have 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.380
 gluing helps us to stretch to open and 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.420
 at the bottom we put a strip 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.800
 blue because it is close to the pants that 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.800
 it's blue to make it look cooler 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.550
 good and we only have to put a 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.340
 ace instead of the anagram of the minions 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.470
 because chris wants it so we put these 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.240
 the art of cris and that's all we have left 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.190
 put things because I hope that I have 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.419
 liked this video we salute because what 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.460
 I'm doing in summer and it's very 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.350
 complicated to do that but nothing if it has 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.210
 liked to like and share it 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.210
 you already know how to say hello in the next video
