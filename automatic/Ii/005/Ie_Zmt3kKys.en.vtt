been a lot of storms in this area and so
Internet's<00:00:41.129> kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> an<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.690> can't

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
Internet's kind of an out so he can't

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.319 
Internet's kind of an out so he can't
really<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.309> quick<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.640> this

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
really get it to me really quick so this

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
really get it to me really quick so this
gameplay<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.559> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.010> own<00:00:47.250> it's

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
gameplay is not going to be my own it's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.229 
gameplay is not going to be my own it's
a<00:00:48.239> borrowed<00:00:48.989> gameplay<00:00:49.500> from<00:00:49.559> FearCrads<00:00:50.280> also

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
a borrowed gameplay from FearCrads also

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.069 
a borrowed gameplay from FearCrads also
known<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.570> my<00:00:51.809> he<00:00:52.260> graciously<00:00:52.530> allowed<00:00:53.219> me<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
known as my he graciously allowed me to

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.770 
known as my he graciously allowed me to
download<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.500> his<00:00:55.620> videos<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.570> use<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
