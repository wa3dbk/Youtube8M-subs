00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.400
 hi to all so just a little 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.429
 video to talk to you so about ppa 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.929
 so run to make your pay not 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.280
 course to you need a software 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.490
 which is called pepa courade designer 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.330
 then a file in pdo so me 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 I downloaded the predator file 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.500
 so it's like this 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.630
 so you have on one side the 3d helmet 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.210
 and the boss of the helmet you 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.780
 all your rooms 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.160
 knowing that the square has a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.260
 leaf 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.430
 so you can bring together several pieces 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.890
 on a sheet to make some paper 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.070
 then in a second time it takes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.860
 settle if you want to wear it there you 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.350
 must put it to your size 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.520
 so you go into two menu debut 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.770
 forgiveness and then recalculated it by 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.489
 I do not know how to speak English well 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.200
 so I prefer to tell you thing is here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.220
 you will go home so I went to me 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.159
 39 cm because I have an idea in mind in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.030
 done is to stick on a helmet a 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.479
 old motorcycle helmet just to rave 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.640
 so I put 39 cm and the rest is settled 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.210
 all by yourself you just need to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.640
 put the height of your helmet 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.530
 then you put hockey and the most 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.119
 boring is moving your pieces because 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.130
 that's okay all you help him settle in 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.880
 does that gonna put you some pieces a 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.180
 little bit of everywhere so you go on 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.680
 this little drawing the little square 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.729
 how are you going to select all 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.040
 pieces you see actually it's used to see 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.350
 which room is going with which room 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.340
 if you take this one it is sticking 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.210
 with this one and so on well 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.920
 follow well use this software 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.160
 because otherwise you 're never going 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.280
 can actually ride it I'm here you go 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.860
 like this you're going to have little ones 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.879
 drawn numbers above written on 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.150
 forgiveness and one must help oneself of these of his 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.489
 numbers actually you go as has by 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.069
 example I'm doing the helmet 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.360
 of halo 4 you have lots of numbers 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.300
 drawn on it 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.970
 it must absolutely be well 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.379
 registered tonight on the puzzle otherwise 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:43.680
 it's the merdouille then to check 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:47.970
 that it is well put I think it's 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:53.580
 here it is necessary that shaw wade ideas 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:58.319
 be well validate then you in 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.920
 do not mind the rest then to move 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.989
 your room just the left click of 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.220
 the mouse and you can move it 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.560
 anywhere do you see that put you 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.080
 all the brothel pieces actually 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.860
 so the goal of the ges the goal of the game is 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.019
 to put everything back or not 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.849
 wasting paper in fact so that's 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.709
 true it's a bit long to do especially 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.870
 when you have helmets like halo 4 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.500
 where is not how many pieces 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.110
 be extremely careful you can 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.209
 move your helmet on this side to see 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.930
 what does it look like in 3d you 're 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.810
 europe it's great it's you hold 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.690
 press the second click end the click 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.500
 right mouse and you can move 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.900
 the pieces you can know the piece 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.079
 where is she so it tells you 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.569
 and it tells you with qualys it sticks 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.360
 and so on in fact so this 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.860
 software is very convenient 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.129
 I had a second one called pep 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:07.510
 acura viewer but finally it's just for 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.879
 see your pdf files you can not 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.819
 modify them while with pepa will run 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:17.019
 designers you can edit them 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.570
 change the size of arranging the 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.300
 pieces all this before printing some 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.710
 very important thing 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:28.210
 sorry for the brimer neighbor decided to 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:32.229
 do some work today so you 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:39.120
 go on file and you go on a year 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:42.160
 sorry, I'm telling you nonsense 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.840
 print so you go on sitting fritz 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.550
 ring and paper alas forgotten no 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.419
 master that you are going to print on 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.380
 A4 sheets because automatically I 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.620
 believe it's going to put you on the 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.650
 drive so it fucks bad it's going you 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.560
 do anything you will curse 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.120
 the software the spacing between 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.030
 pieces I put 5 5 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.580
 I think it's going very well 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.520
 is enough in the hand then so you 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.880
 confirm you put ok to print 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.230
 to check well you go in line 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.250
 and you go in 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:27.530
 print no it's good what the day premium 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:29.630
 preview so play so that's fine 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.840
 already put you see you have 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.710
 well the numbers to print the little ones 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.220
 numbers that will help you assemble 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.190
 your puzzle 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.910
 Then I also wanted to explain 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:50.030
 in in the rooms actually you have 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:54.110
 several traits so I do not know if my 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:57.260
 device will do you have the little ones 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.980
 stuff like that that's following each other so 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.980
 that's folded 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:11.050
 it's bent downhill you see no 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:14.840
 you not see this doc 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.660
 so that's the foot down and 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.300
 you have another type of trait 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.830
 these are small traits a little bit more 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.800
 big it's folded in front of you it's 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.730
 like these it's important to the 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.220
 know because it's not easy 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.830
 obviously afterwards once you 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.030
 have everything print your parts must 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.730
 arm yourself with patience to make a 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.790
 piece so I advise you to 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:48.890
 to take a scalpel is much more 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.780
 accurate and a glue like these extra 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.070
 strong because it's finally she 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.330
 hang on right now what does it glue 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.350
 right now you do not have to hold 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.000
 fifteen years your piece of paper 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.150
 so that was just for 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.050
 tell you about the software and the 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.490
 preparing your pay will not run 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:11.060
 so I'll make you a second video 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.830
 to show you the the resin and a 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.870
 third video to show you the 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.890
 mastic 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.350
 I thank you for watching my 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.730
 video and I'll see you soon 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.980
 If you have any questions do not hesitate 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.980
 I'm here to answer hot
