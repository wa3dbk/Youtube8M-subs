00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.309
 I'm going to be doing a Libyan regime today. 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.140
 in meeting the cruise leader 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.919
 black box 360 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.079
 how can you read 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.980
 I just bought the control 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.929
 At this time, people on the beach in venezuela

 and all products are well made 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.720
 I've never had a problem with any of them. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.010
 so I hope this control is not different 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.440
 we started to compare the control of the same the official control of the sport 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.680
 inside the goal is not a recession 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.960
 I think it's an advantage 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.120
 I do not like this box 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120

 and it is not that we ourselves but with four 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.630
 because it does not change me very happily 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.980
 not have been unsuccessful 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.980
 now the analogue one can have right it is necessary 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.740
 you could tighten 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.950
