00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
combined one that has come together it's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.140 
combined one that has come together it's
time<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.620> knead<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.220> dough<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:26.970> want

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
time to knead the dough so you just want

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.120 
time to knead the dough so you just want
to<00:02:27.180> tip<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.540> onto<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:28.110> floured<00:02:28.410> surface<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
to tip it out onto a floured surface and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.580 
to tip it out onto a floured surface and
knead<00:02:29.910> until<00:02:30.180> essentially<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.900> power<00:02:31.170> or<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
knead until essentially the power or the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.650 
knead until essentially the power or the
dough<00:02:32.070> doesn't<00:02:32.670> stick<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.450> anymore

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
dough doesn't stick to you anymore

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.080 
dough doesn't stick to you anymore
that's<00:02:34.470> when<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.770> know<00:02:34.890> you're<00:02:35.070> done<00:02:35.130> don't

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
that's when you know you're done don't

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.240 
that's when you know you're done don't
think<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.450> point<00:02:36.810> that's<00:02:37.050> time<00:02:37.530> start

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
think it's that point that's time start

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.620 
think it's that point that's time start
rolling<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:40.940> what<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.030> want<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.240> do<00:02:42.390> with

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
rolling out what you want to do with

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.960 
rolling out what you want to do with
your<00:02:42.810> rolling<00:02:43.740> is<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.040> want<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> get<00:02:44.730> your

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
your rolling is you want to get your

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.270 
your rolling is you want to get your
dough<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.720> shape<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.470> about<00:02:46.800> 30

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
dough to a shape that is about 30

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.840 
dough to a shape that is about 30
centimeters<00:02:47.700> by<00:02:48.660> 25<00:02:49.440> centimeters<00:02:50.250> you're

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
centimeters by 25 centimeters you're

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.610 
centimeters by 25 centimeters you're
going<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> need<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.210> roll<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.840> out<00:02:52.020> and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
going to need to roll this out and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.900 
going to need to roll this out and
that's<00:02:52.740> we're<00:02:52.980> going<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.160> put<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.370> ceiling<00:02:53.670> on

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
that's we're going to put a ceiling on

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.080 
that's we're going to put a ceiling on
because<00:02:54.660> there<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.990> no<00:02:55.290> butter<00:02:55.770> or<00:02:56.190> oil<00:02:56.670> in

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
because there is no butter or oil in

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.910 
because there is no butter or oil in
this<00:02:57.209> feeling<00:02:57.570> you've<00:02:58.170> got<00:02:58.410> essentially<00:02:58.830> get

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
this feeling you've got essentially get

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.900 
this feeling you've got essentially get
it<00:02:59.010> out<00:02:59.190> nice<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> flat<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:00.990> not<00:03:01.200> too<00:03:01.410> chunky

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
it out nice and flat but not too chunky

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.280 
it out nice and flat but not too chunky
so<00:03:02.910> then<00:03:03.420> we're<00:03:03.570> going<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.840> our<00:03:04.050> brown

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
so then we're going to get our brown

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.570 
so then we're going to get our brown
sugar<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.800> we're<00:03:05.040> going<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.250> lightly

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
sugar and we're going to lightly

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.270 
sugar and we're going to lightly
sprinkle<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.240> all<00:03:06.480> over<00:03:06.900> our<00:03:07.320> dough<00:03:07.740> making

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
sprinkle this all over our dough making

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.949 
sprinkle this all over our dough making
sure<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.670> we<00:03:08.760> don't<00:03:08.940> need<00:03:09.209> all<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.570> one<00:03:09.600> end

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
sure that we don't need all in one end

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.280 
sure that we don't need all in one end
and<00:03:10.170> make<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.500> nice<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.770> even<00:03:12.110> then<00:03:13.110> we're

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
and make it nice and even then we're

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.600 
and make it nice and even then we're
going<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> do<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.680> same<00:03:13.709> with<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.220> cinema

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
going to do the same with a cinema

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.210 
going to do the same with a cinema
making<00:03:15.390> sure<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.690> course<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:16.080> get<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.380> fair

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
making sure of course we get a fair

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.160 
making sure of course we get a fair
amount<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.550> cinema<00:03:17.970> all<00:03:18.239> over<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.780> floured

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
amount of cinema all over the floured

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.770 
amount of cinema all over the floured
surface<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.770> it's<00:03:19.890> like<00:03:20.070> just<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.459> end<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.120> of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
surface so it's like just one end and of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.570 
surface so it's like just one end and of
course<00:03:21.989> one<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.769> edges<00:03:23.070> as<00:03:23.220> much<00:03:23.400> as

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
course one to the edges as much as

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.290 
course one to the edges as much as
possible<00:03:24.080> then<00:03:25.080> we<00:03:26.010> got<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.850> start

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
possible then we got to do is start

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.780 
possible then we got to do is start
rolling<00:03:27.870> up

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.420 

so<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:32.150> roll<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.450> up<00:03:32.569> I<00:03:32.780> always<00:03:32.900> roll<00:03:33.349> away<00:03:34.069> from

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
so to roll it up I always roll away from

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.860 
so to roll it up I always roll away from
myself<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:35.030> don't<00:03:35.269> know<00:03:35.329> I<00:03:35.360> thought<00:03:35.629> that<00:03:35.750> was

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
myself I don't know I thought that was

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.750 
myself I don't know I thought that was
the<00:03:36.049> best<00:03:36.319> as<00:03:36.530> opposed<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:36.980> towards<00:03:37.579> yourself

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
the best as opposed to towards yourself

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.520 
the best as opposed to towards yourself
but<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.510> wanna<00:03:38.629> make<00:03:38.750> your<00:03:38.870> first<00:03:39.049> rule<00:03:39.319> very

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
but you wanna make your first rule very

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.220 
but you wanna make your first rule very
very<00:03:39.739> tight<00:03:40.069> and<00:03:40.340> then<00:03:40.879> use<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.629> force<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:42.170> a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
very tight and then use the force of a

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.350 
very tight and then use the force of a
weight<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.040> role<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.430> go<00:03:43.549> on<00:03:43.610> top<00:03:43.849> itself

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
weight of the role to go on top itself

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.110 
weight of the role to go on top itself
so<00:03:44.720> roll<00:03:45.379> it<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:45.680> nice<00:03:46.099> and<00:03:46.159> tight<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:46.970> don't

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
so roll it up nice and tight and don't

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.880 
so roll it up nice and tight and don't
be<00:03:47.329> afraid<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.599> give<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.049> good<00:03:48.230> roll<00:03:48.500> once<00:03:48.739> it

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
be afraid to give it a good roll once it

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.490 
be afraid to give it a good roll once it
has<00:03:49.069> all<00:03:49.310> come<00:03:49.340> together<00:03:50.049> of<00:03:51.049> course<00:03:51.260> this<00:03:51.349> is

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
has all come together of course this is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.839 
has all come together of course this is
going<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.680> make<00:03:51.799> twelve<00:03:52.129> of<00:03:52.310> these<00:03:52.400> bad<00:03:52.640> boys

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
going to make twelve of these bad boys

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.399 
going to make twelve of these bad boys
for<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.510> need<00:03:53.659> to<00:03:53.780> cut<00:03:53.989> off<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.170> ends

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
for you so you need to cut off the ends

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.099 
for you so you need to cut off the ends
that<00:03:54.500> are<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.620> bit<00:03:54.650> nobly<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.599> then<00:03:56.599> you<00:03:56.959> want

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
that are a bit nobly and then you want

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.349 
that are a bit nobly and then you want
to<00:03:57.170> cut<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.560> ingredients<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.400> half<00:03:58.670> half

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
to cut the ingredients in half half

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.479 
to cut the ingredients in half half
again<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.989> then<00:04:00.379> into<00:04:00.620> thirds<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.159> give<00:04:01.310> you

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
again and then into thirds to give you

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.180 
again and then into thirds to give you
12<00:04:01.879> in<00:04:02.209> total<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:03.470> course<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.799> don't<00:04:03.890> have<00:04:04.099> to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
12 in total of course you don't have to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.710 
12 in total of course you don't have to
be<00:04:04.310> too<00:04:04.579> big<00:04:04.760> because<00:04:04.940> essentially<00:04:05.480> this<00:04:05.659> is

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
be too big because essentially this is

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.089 
be too big because essentially this is
self<00:04:06.019> raising<00:04:06.200> flour<00:04:06.379> and<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.829> bottom

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
self raising flour and the bottom

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.670 
self raising flour and the bottom
looking<00:04:07.310> at<00:04:07.430> one<00:04:07.549> is<00:04:07.639> pop<00:04:07.879> up<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:08.780> don't<00:04:09.470> go<00:04:09.560> too

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
looking at one is pop up so don't go too

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.160 
looking at one is pop up so don't go too
chunky<00:04:10.069> on<00:04:10.370> this<00:04:10.629> then<00:04:11.629> all<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.780> need<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.989> do

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
chunky on this then all you need to do

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.670 
chunky on this then all you need to do
is<00:04:12.379> get<00:04:12.620> your<00:04:12.829> cut<00:04:13.720> there<00:04:14.720> are<00:04:14.840> buns<00:04:15.049> and<00:04:15.290> cut

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
is get your cut there are buns and cut

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.279 
is get your cut there are buns and cut
them<00:04:15.859> into<00:04:16.100> your<00:04:16.760> muffin<00:04:17.239> tin<00:04:17.600> making<00:04:18.229> sure

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
them into your muffin tin making sure

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.449 
them into your muffin tin making sure
that<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.500> do<00:04:18.680> give<00:04:18.829> them<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.979> little<00:04:19.160> bit<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.370> us

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
that you do give them a little bit of us

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.210 
that you do give them a little bit of us
push<00:04:19.699> down<00:04:19.970> not<00:04:20.299> too<00:04:20.570> much<00:04:20.780> just<00:04:21.079> so<00:04:21.620> they<00:04:21.799> even

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
push down not too much just so they even

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.450 
push down not too much just so they even
out<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.580> fill<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:23.150> muffin<00:04:23.510> tin<00:04:23.720> completely

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
out and fill the muffin tin completely

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.860 
out and fill the muffin tin completely
then<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.789> want<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:25.970> brush<00:04:26.090> them<00:04:26.360> with<00:04:26.389> just

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
then you want to brush them with just

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.310 
then you want to brush them with just
some<00:04:27.080> low<00:04:27.500> fat<00:04:27.800> or<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.449> but<00:04:29.449> reduced<00:04:30.050> fat<00:04:30.260> milk

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
some low fat or and but reduced fat milk

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.290 
some low fat or and but reduced fat milk
just<00:04:31.220> give<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.520> nice<00:04:31.699> clean<00:04:32.560> yeah<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:34.300> then

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
just give it a nice clean yeah and then

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.270 
just give it a nice clean yeah and then
I've<00:04:35.630> got<00:04:35.690> some<00:04:36.169> cake<00:04:36.440> hands<00:04:36.650> which<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:37.039> have

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
I've got some cake hands which I have

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.070 
I've got some cake hands which I have
finely<00:04:37.760> chopped<00:04:38.030> you're<00:04:38.210> not<00:04:38.360> too<00:04:38.510> chunky<00:04:38.750> but

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
finely chopped you're not too chunky but

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.750 
finely chopped you're not too chunky but
not<00:04:39.229> too<00:04:39.410> small<00:04:39.620> I'm<00:04:40.220> going<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.490> lightly

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
not too small I'm going to lightly

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.330 
not too small I'm going to lightly
sprinkle<00:04:41.300> these<00:04:41.449> on<00:04:41.870> top<00:04:42.169> you<00:04:42.680> can<00:04:42.830> push<00:04:43.160> them

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
sprinkle these on top you can push them

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.610 
sprinkle these on top you can push them
a<00:04:43.370> little<00:04:43.430> bit<00:04:43.760> in<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.030> probably<00:04:44.449> would<00:04:44.780> because

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
a little bit in I probably would because

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.050 
a little bit in I probably would because
I<00:04:45.710> kind<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:46.010> feel<00:04:46.160> a<00:04:46.340> little<00:04:46.520> bit<00:04:46.699> at<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:46.910> end

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
I kind of feel a little bit at the end

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.089 
I kind of feel a little bit at the end
then<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.810> want<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:47.960> bake<00:04:48.110> in<00:04:48.260> your<00:04:48.410> oven<00:04:48.590> nice

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
then you want to bake in your oven nice

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.430 
then you want to bake in your oven nice
hot<00:04:49.340> oven<00:04:49.610> 12<00:04:50.030> minutes<00:04:50.389> while<00:04:50.990> that's<00:04:51.199> in

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
hot oven 12 minutes while that's in

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.960 
hot oven 12 minutes while that's in
there<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:51.740> they've<00:04:51.830> come<00:04:52.130> out<00:04:52.340> it's<00:04:52.639> time<00:04:52.849> to

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
there and they've come out it's time to

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.460 
there and they've come out it's time to
make<00:04:53.060> our<00:04:53.150> IC<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.599> this<00:04:53.690> is<00:04:53.810> our<00:04:53.960> white

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
make our IC and this is our white

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.950 
make our IC and this is our white
vanilla<00:04:55.190> icing<00:04:55.820> just<00:04:56.449> a<00:04:56.539> little<00:04:56.690> bit<00:04:56.840> of

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
vanilla icing just a little bit of

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.080 
vanilla icing just a little bit of
vanilla<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.410> I'm<00:04:57.740> very<00:04:57.919> small<00:04:58.280> about<00:04:58.580> milk

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
vanilla and I'm very small about milk

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.129 
vanilla and I'm very small about milk

here to make our icing sugar and milk
I'm<00:05:03.380> not<00:05:03.949> going<00:05:04.099> to<00:05:04.160> Gilbert<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.669> measure<00:05:04.849> it

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
I'm not going to Gilbert and measure it

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.029 
I'm not going to Gilbert and measure it
because<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.330> can<00:05:05.539> change<00:05:05.900> but<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:06.740> want<00:05:07.010> it

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
because it can change but you want it

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.230 
because it can change but you want it
essentially<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.550> nice<00:05:07.699> approvingly

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
essentially a nice approvingly

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.180 
essentially a nice approvingly
consistency<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.650> can<00:05:09.949> eventually

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
consistency that you can eventually

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.570 
consistency that you can eventually
drizzle<00:05:11.060> it<00:05:11.180> until<00:05:11.599> who<00:05:11.720> your<00:05:11.870> cinnamon<00:05:12.320> buns

drizzle it until who your cinnamon buns

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.070
