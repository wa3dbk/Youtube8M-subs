 Thank you for watching it 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.120
 Introduce how to make 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.559
 First of all we will introduce the necessary tools and materials. 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.500
 It is a bracket paper pan screw for pop paper plastic board weight 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.190
 Pop paper is suitable for matte paper for paper craft 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:32.801
 The plastic plate is 0.2 mm thick and the metal fitting is as light as possible within 15 * 55 mm. 

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:36.730
 Please prepare. Go to Tokyu Hands etc. and get it. 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.000
 The truck is made of Greenmax 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.720
 Please use your favorite one It will be around 400 yen each 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.920
 The pan head screws are made of iron, stainless steel and plastic 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.440
 Is a bit more expensive but not recommended 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 It is made of plastic 3 * 15mm 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.069
 Necessary tools are Cemedine bond cutter or design knife Ruler 

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.939
 Tweezers and cellophane tape too 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.020
 I recommend that there be a metal ruler 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.959
 Let's make it now 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:21.329
 First download the deployment file and open it with Adobe Reader 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.719
 Select Print from File and Print to Your Printer 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.219
 At this time, set the page scaling to none 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.770
 Also, from the properties, set the paper settings to a paper bag such as high-grade paper 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.819
 Set on certain paper and print on pop paper 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.329
 The color may be reddish depending on the printer. 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.859
 It may be better to adjust the color from the property 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.670
 Then cut the printed paper 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.869
 And five thin paper sheets become one board 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.909
 I will repeat in Cemedine 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.040
 Hold this in a heavy book etc. and dry it more than 1 circle 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.170
 Make a U-shaped plastic bag while waiting 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.980
 Stick U-shaped paper with cellophane tape and cut around 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.980
 I will 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.290
 Assemble the smaller part once it's dried 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 Crease lines and elongate rectangular parts bond corners 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.110
 The parts placed in the book are assembled so that the gray part becomes a box shape 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.409
 I will 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.209
 I will attach parts when I can do this 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.799
 Weight when we stick the smallest part on the line of the largest part 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.989
 Paste the plastic board to the side after pasting it on the floor board 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.329
 Attach a bond to the short side of the rectangular part on top of it 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.980
 At this time, adjust the height from the lower box to the top to be 19 mm. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.860
 Finally, attach the dolly Finally, mount the dolly using the screws. 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.159
 I will 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.530
 It looks like this when viewed from the side Bogie screw washer floor board screw 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.310
 I screw in order so it becomes too tight at this time 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.260
 I will not 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.269
 It's completed with this 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.349
