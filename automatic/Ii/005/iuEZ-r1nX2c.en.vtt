just moving it around till it's getting
coke<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.910> stuff<00:04:03.120> okay<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.960> one<00:04:04.110> takes

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
coke and stuff okay so this one takes

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.050 
coke and stuff okay so this one takes
like<00:04:04.380> four<00:04:04.620> minutes<00:04:04.800> I'll<00:04:05.040> also<00:04:05.280> leave<00:04:05.880> like

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
like four minutes I'll also leave like

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.610 
like four minutes I'll also leave like
the<00:04:06.180> top<00:04:06.420> over<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.140> kind<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.320> seems

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
the top over it so it kind of seems

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.100 
the top over it so it kind of seems
better<00:04:08.400> quicker<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.270> faster<00:04:09.300> are<00:04:09.720> definitely

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
better quicker and faster are definitely

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.250 
better quicker and faster are definitely
recommend<00:04:10.410> doing<00:04:10.530> next<00:04:10.770> feat<00:04:11.010> at<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.220> process

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
recommend doing next feat at the process

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.080

I'm gonna put some water on top of that
amalah<00:04:15.330> just<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.109> Seas<00:04:16.500> will<00:04:16.710> stick

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
amalah just so the Seas will stick

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.650 
amalah just so the Seas will stick
spatter<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.700> like<00:04:18.120> I'm<00:04:18.239> going<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.420> put<00:04:18.540> on
