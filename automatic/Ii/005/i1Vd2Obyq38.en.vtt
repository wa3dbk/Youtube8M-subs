 hello her father I'm back and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.200
 As you can see, I'm talking now 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.510
 German I have decided the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.880
 to make next videos in German 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.370
 because it just makes it easier for me and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.780
 I so easy to explain more can I 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.310
 May like depending on importance 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.779
 Show subtitles 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.029
 and if you do not understand something 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.020
 You should also be able to ask then 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.210
 I also in English again 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.949
 to explain 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.039
 I want you my newest today 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.189
 Design show the mocking mockery 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.350
 buffalo exactly the sports temple no den 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.329
 sports temple of the tribute of panem 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.579
 I designed it two days ago 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.140
 and I'm actually pretty happy 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.969
 about that 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.300
 the tail has something to do 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.670
 be creative and vary somewhat, the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 a very different from the original of 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.030
 front looks but halfway elegant 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.890
 but otherwise the feelings the wings 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.890
 I really like the poultry and 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.010
 not'm in a fucking definitely 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.680
 I'm happy with that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.850
 I got it from 17 5 centimeters myself 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.210
 made 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.759
 made aluh paper so I have two 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.670
 alu papers glued together like that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.360
 that the aluminum foil is outside and that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.509
 So you paper exactly the reverse 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.930
 School free so to speak that was very 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.539
 access roads interest has such a 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.630
 a little something from 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.130
 Turning the copper was a bit difficult 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.030
 Behavior but it holds in the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:55.200
 pretty cool and pretty good 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:57.299
 Forms given so much if you 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.799
 I want to know more about that 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.390
 but just in the comments if you 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.729
 You can give me an instruction 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.109
 write that down 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.579
 however , I will believe it first 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.069
 tutorial if really 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.590
 Some people like to find you 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.500
 Rides would not vote but still 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.329
 consume quite a long time 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.470
 otherwise you had well and until 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.470
