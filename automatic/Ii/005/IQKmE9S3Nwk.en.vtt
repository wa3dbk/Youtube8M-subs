think<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.880> wasn't<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.360> circle<00:00:36.840> would<00:00:36.930> be

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
think it wasn't that circle would be

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.860 
think it wasn't that circle would be
that<00:00:37.200> great<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.559> now<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.540> last<00:00:39.540> time<00:00:39.719> i<00:00:39.780> went

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
