00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.100
 hello i mean my life so today i want to 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.330
 making sweet apple snails 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.330
 I hope you like 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 So first off you should 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.080
 your oven to 200 degrees above 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.300
 heat down because it works that way 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160
 is fast as did that is 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.779
 the oven preheated and then you can 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.779
 we'll get started right away 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.300
 So next you also have two apples 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.350
 I have gutted my well washed 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.840
 and make small pieces cut and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.629
 that will not head for now 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:55.860
 a little bit smaller 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:01:02.549
 namely 30 round felt afterwards 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.629
 this size is an athlete and 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:05.629
 push them down a bit 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.100
 Next we give five tablespoons 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 I do not know how 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.950
 I could weigh that up a lot as for 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:30.299
 that is 5 tablespoons so with me 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:40.259
 it program 160 and get there at 1560 and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:42.299
 with you from 50 g chopped almonds 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.810
 but you can rosin instead 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:54.229
 take only we do not like raisins 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:57.049
 chopped almonds and a pinch of cinnamon each 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.810
 After that if lover can since the crisis 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.810
 also bigger than mine 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.789
 that's is already dismissed again 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.789
 a little different 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.810
 here you can run left and then 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:24.980
 I say ten seconds again 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 Level 4 fits again signed 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.349
 so that the apples up here 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.349
 Stolen in the evening stay down there too 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.480
 Now we only need letter dough 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.590
 I took that out of the fridge 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.360
 now you also want him out and 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.329
 spread the puff pastry with the mass 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.000
 then rolled him from the short side 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.670
 back up and cut that way 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.590
 thumb thickness snails or stripes 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.680
 In other words, those are the ones 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.530
 snail and puts the hope and 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.130
 grabs the then you have to look like that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.890
 15 20 minutes as I said at 200 degrees 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.069
 top down from the heat I'm doing now 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.489
 times then I'll get back to you 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.489
 is equal to 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.030
 these are my sweet apple now 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.480
 Bargains and they are now at 200 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.030
 degrees upper lower heat as I said for 15 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.290
 to 20 minutes I'll look like you 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.120
 then look and bake so bad 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.709
 that you can not smell how tasty 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.760
 The wonderful smell is just heavenly 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.280
 I still have some icing sugar 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.540
 sprinkled on my sweet apple 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.510
 Bargains and that's what they look like now 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.220
 they were now 25 for me 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.350
 minutes in the oven so I have it 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.239
 a little longer because they left 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.250
 me a bit too bright at the beginning 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.920
 looked too cheesy 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.980
 but now they were just right me 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.970
 Hope you liked the video 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.830
 she also tries out and 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.360
 leave with a feedback like her 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.690
 you have tasted it very much 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.120
 curious and until then I say goodbye 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.780
 It's all good until next time thank you 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.780
