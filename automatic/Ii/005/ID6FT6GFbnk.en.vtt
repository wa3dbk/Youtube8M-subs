00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
couple of years ago when we first

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.439 
couple of years ago when we first
started<00:00:55.520> building<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> recipe<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.300> what

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
started building the recipe for what

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
started building the recipe for what
would<00:00:57.600> go<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.250> a

would go into it we have to put in a
huge<00:00:59.940> amount<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.270> thought<00:01:00.480> into<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.170> did<00:01:01.440> we

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
huge amount of thought into do we did we

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.200 
huge amount of thought into do we did we
