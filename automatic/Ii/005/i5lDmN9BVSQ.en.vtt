00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.420
 once we 're done we do the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.420
 last little group of two together 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.420
 a chain and remember that here 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.760
 we start only when a group 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.200
 let's make the second group to 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.200
 end there with the conchita 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.760
 we make a chain and a half point 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:33.000
 to finish downtown ok 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:36.829
 we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 little shells and now 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.170
 we start again we raise 2 chains 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.420
 and we make the whole point 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 a head and now let's make a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.230
 small group of these in front and behind the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.700
 previous row 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.150
 we make a small group of 2 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.329
 a chain 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.739
 another little group 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.539
 of two together chain where we made the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.280
 conchita let's do the 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.060
 conchita 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.810
 a little group two chains 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.810
 a little group 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.350
 a chain and we continue ahead and 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.080
 back we're going to do the colon 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.100
 together and so we continue until 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.100
 let's finish the row 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.860
 ok we are already finishing with the last 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.920
 little group 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.470
 of two together the chain and we finished 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.980
 here with half the shell that we 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.700
 was missing 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.380
 a chain and a half point because if I walk 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.920
 this war in hexagon because if you 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.270
 they realize that we are getting a hexagon 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.140
 this will be the center part of the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.390
 head 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.600
 let's continue knitting like this 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.130
 conchita and always the points between 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.650
 what we have done in the previous row 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.220
 until we have the desired size of 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.220
 head
