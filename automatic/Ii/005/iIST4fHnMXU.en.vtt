hi I'm Tim Slater a play music magazine

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.789 
hi I'm Tim Slater a play music magazine
and<00:00:10.000> today<00:00:10.690> we're<00:00:11.050> looking<00:00:11.170> at<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.590> new

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799 
and today we're looking at the new

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:29.820 
and today we're looking at the new
Fender<00:00:12.700> machete<00:00:13.299> combo

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.499 

well<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.310> fender<00:00:31.609> machetes<00:00:32.059> certainly<00:00:32.480> a

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
well the fender machetes certainly a

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.360 
well the fender machetes certainly a
formidable<00:00:32.780> amplifier

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
formidable amplifier

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.630

I<00:00:34.510> think<00:00:35.510> fender<00:00:35.900> quite<00:00:36.260> determined<00:00:37.129> to<00:00:37.399> break

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
I think fender quite determined to break

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.689 
I think fender quite determined to break
into<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.090> high<00:00:38.300> gain<00:00:38.590> amplifier<00:00:39.590> market<00:00:40.129> it's

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
into the high gain amplifier market it's

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.700 
into the high gain amplifier market it's
not<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.879> sector<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:41.570> they're<00:00:41.780> obviously

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
not a sector that they're obviously

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.250 
not a sector that they're obviously
particularly<00:00:43.160> renowned<00:00:43.760> for<00:00:44.170> but<00:00:45.170> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
is a mid-range sweep there's a little

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
mid-range notch in there have you

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.870 
mid-range notch in there have you
imagined<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.570> little<00:02:42.810> V<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> mids<00:02:43.530> and

the<00:02:44.880> not<00:02:45.270> control<00:02:45.750> sweeps<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.740> around<00:02:47.100> so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the not control sweeps this around so

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.880 
the not control sweeps this around so
that<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.670> can<00:02:47.850> change<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.510> overall<00:02:49.020> zambra

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890

of<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.340> amplifier<00:02:50.850> it's<00:02:51.780> one<00:02:52.560> extreme<00:02:52.740> you

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
of the amplifier it's one extreme you

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.090 
of the amplifier it's one extreme you
have<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> very<00:02:53.970> scooped<00:02:54.780> American<00:02:55.440> sound<00:02:55.830> which

have a very scooped American sound which

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.040 
have a very scooped American sound which
places<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.550> lot<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.760> emphasis<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.780> highs

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
as well it's a little bit of a similar

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.830 
as well it's a little bit of a similar
feature<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.199> old<00:05:11.490> PV<00:05:12.490> xxx<00:05:13.000> head<00:05:13.449> I<00:05:13.629> don't

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
feature to the old PV xxx head I don't

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.390 
feature to the old PV xxx head I don't
know<00:05:13.900> if<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.020> remember<00:05:14.229> those<00:05:14.500> at<00:05:14.650> all<00:05:14.830> but

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
know if you remember those at all but

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.920 
know if you remember those at all but
you<00:05:15.490> could<00:05:15.729> use<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.120> effects<00:05:16.389> loop<00:05:16.599> as<00:05:16.810> an

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
you could use the effects loop as an

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.170 
you could use the effects loop as an
extra<00:05:17.169> boost<00:05:17.349> on<00:05:18.039> both<00:05:18.250> channels<00:05:18.520> it's<00:05:19.090> a

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
extra boost on both channels it's a

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.279 
extra boost on both channels it's a
similar<00:05:19.479> kind<00:05:19.690> of<00:05:19.810> setup<00:05:20.379> here<00:05:20.740> we<00:05:21.310> also<00:05:21.460> have

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
similar kind of setup here we also have

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.019 
similar kind of setup here we also have
speaker<00:05:23.289> outputs<00:05:23.949> which<00:05:24.550> can<00:05:24.789> be<00:05:24.909> switched

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:25.029 
speaker outputs which can be switched

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.749 
speaker outputs which can be switched
between<00:05:25.300> 4<00:05:25.810> 8<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.289> 16<00:05:26.469> ohms<00:05:26.949> if<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.370> do<00:05:27.550> need

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
between 4 8 and 16 ohms if you do need

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
their attempt to break into the high

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.089 
their attempt to break into the high
gain<00:06:07.539> market<00:06:07.990> there's<00:06:08.710> some<00:06:08.889> very

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
so fender already has some pretty steep

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.119 
so fender already has some pretty steep
hill<00:06:19.389> to<00:06:19.629> climb<00:06:19.810> to<00:06:20.319> make<00:06:20.469> this<00:06:20.589> presence<00:06:20.949> felt

in<00:06:21.279> this<00:06:21.430> market<00:06:21.909> but<00:06:22.330> nevertheless<00:06:22.569> the

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
in this market but nevertheless the

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.360 
in this market but nevertheless the
machete<00:06:23.229> is<00:06:23.379> a<00:06:23.500> very<00:06:23.710> good<00:06:23.830> amp<00:06:24.009> it's<00:06:24.190> very

convincing

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.610 
convincing
I<00:06:25.150> think<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.839> fender<00:06:26.139> have<00:06:26.229> done<00:06:26.409> the<00:06:26.500> right

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
I think the fender have done the right

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.200 
I think the fender have done the right
thing<00:06:26.680> to<00:06:27.129> make<00:06:27.279> it<00:06:27.430> look<00:06:27.610> different<00:06:27.639> from

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
thing to make it look different from

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.959 
thing to make it look different from
their<00:06:28.449> traditional<00:06:28.599> amplifiers<00:06:29.699> so<00:06:30.699> players

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:30.969 
their traditional amplifiers so players

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:32.219 
their traditional amplifiers so players
that<00:06:31.240> are<00:06:31.300> seeking<00:06:31.509> something<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:32.080> bit

looking<00:06:34.930> this<00:06:35.680> definitely<00:06:36.190> fits<00:06:36.399> the<00:06:36.490> bill

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
looking this definitely fits the bill

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.600 
looking this definitely fits the bill
whether<00:06:37.630> or<00:06:37.779> not<00:06:37.870> it'll<00:06:38.110> float<00:06:38.380> your<00:06:38.589> boat

clearly you'll have to go and try one

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.559 
clearly you'll have to go and try one
out<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:42.550> see<00:06:42.699> for<00:06:42.819> yourself<00:06:43.120> but<00:06:43.330> you<00:06:43.449> know
