a<00:00:26.070> game<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.279> domination<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.119> new<00:00:27.269> town<00:00:27.570> where

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
a game of domination on new town where

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.580 
a game of domination on new town where
I've<00:00:27.810> played<00:00:28.019> solo<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.880> lone<00:00:29.880> wolf<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I've played solo a lone wolf and as you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.080 
I've played solo a lone wolf and as you
can<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.279> cut<00:00:32.460> flags<00:00:32.790> all<00:00:32.969> by

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
can see I like to cut flags all by

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.090 
can see I like to cut flags all by
myself<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.719> mean<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.559> look<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.950> one

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
myself I mean if you just look not one

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
myself I mean if you just look not one
person<00:00:35.340> comes<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.360> help<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.840> B<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.649> this

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
person comes to help me out B and this

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.799 
person comes to help me out B and this
is<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.190> frustrates<00:00:38.670> me<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.000> play<00:00:39.239> solo

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
is what frustrates me when I play solo

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
is what frustrates me when I play solo
but<00:00:39.989> then<00:00:40.110> again<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.379> suppose<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.890> opposite

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
but then again I suppose the opposite

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060 
but then again I suppose the opposite
team<00:00:41.930> they<00:00:42.930> aren't<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.440> kind<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.800> kept

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
team they aren't really kind of kept

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.100 
team they aren't really kind of kept
like<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> evo<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> guess<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.719> worked<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:46.020> in

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
like the evo so I guess it worked out in

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.670 
like the evo so I guess it worked out in
my<00:00:46.230> favor<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.989> did<00:00:48.989> feel<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> guys

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
my favor but I did feel that the guys

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
my favor but I did feel that the guys
that<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.820> playing<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.300> found<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.870> well

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that I was playing with found it well

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.360 
that I was playing with found it well
the<00:00:52.079> hard<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> understand<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> significance

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the hard to understand the significance

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.639 
the hard to understand the significance
of<00:00:53.940> having<00:00:54.120> flag<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.350> obvious

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
of having flag be because for obvious

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.819 
of having flag be because for obvious
reasons<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.510> spawn<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> opponents

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
reasons you can spawn have the opponents

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
reasons you can spawn have the opponents
and<00:00:58.949> basically<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.730> let<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.270> let<00:01:00.539> them

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and basically just not let not let them

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.290 
and basically just not let not let them
win<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> game<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.309> easily<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> suppose

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
win the game so easily but I suppose

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.320 
win the game so easily but I suppose
everyone<00:01:04.400> did<00:01:05.400> well<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> defend<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> two

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
everyone did well to defend the two

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.870 
everyone did well to defend the two
