00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
not gonna be that hard since a lot of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
not gonna be that hard since a lot of
this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.300> water<00:01:03.570> already<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:04.379> most

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this is water already your most

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.780 
this is water already your most
difficult<00:01:04.710> part<00:01:05.159> will<00:01:05.280> probably<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
difficult part will probably be the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.310 
difficult part will probably be the
mountains<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> eliminate

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
mountains but if you eliminate

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.690 
mountains but if you eliminate
everything<00:01:07.560> else<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.549> some

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
everything else and you can have some

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.719 
everything else and you can have some
very<00:01:08.939> good<00:01:09.210> spawn<00:01:09.900> rates<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> yeah<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.640> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
very good spawn rates so yeah there you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.770 
very good spawn rates so yeah there you
go<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.150> first<00:01:12.360> village<00:01:12.450> i<00:01:12.659> also

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
go that was the first village i also

description as well and yeah so if you
come<00:01:17.729> back<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> spawn<00:01:18.479> over<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
come back to the spawn over here and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.950 
come back to the spawn over here and
turn<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.310> left<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.360> believe<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.930> are

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
to go two hundred two hundred blocks ish

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.780 
to go two hundred two hundred blocks ish
and<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.380> Mark<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> assassination<00:01:29.640> by

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and you know Mark the assassination by

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.899 
and you know Mark the assassination by
this<00:01:30.509> tree<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.670> we

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this tree right here and right here we

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.050 
this tree right here and right here we
got<00:01:33.030> our<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.689> double<00:01:34.680> spawners<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.400> right

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
got our first double spawners and right

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
got our first double spawners and right
here<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> coordinates<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
here here are the coordinates to this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.010 
here here are the coordinates to this
one<00:01:37.890> will<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> way<00:01:39.210> down<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.420> Y

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
one will be going all the way down to Y

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.690 
one will be going all the way down to Y
14<00:01:40.770> i<00:01:40.950> believe<00:01:41.600> yep<00:01:42.600> spot<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
14 i believe yep spot on and we have a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.899 
14 i believe yep spot on and we have a
zombie<00:01:45.329> spawner<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.200> let's<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.640> loop

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
zombie spawner so let's we got the loop

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.460 
zombie spawner so let's we got the loop
here<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.710> saddle<00:01:51.229> sorry<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.350> I've
