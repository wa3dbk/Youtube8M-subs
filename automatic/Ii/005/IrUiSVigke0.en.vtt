a<00:03:39.049> lot<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.290> fun<00:03:39.379> to<00:03:39.620> do<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.859> remix<00:03:40.069> because<00:03:40.400> it

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
a lot of fun to do that remix because it

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.699 
a lot of fun to do that remix because it
was<00:03:40.579> kind<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.849> a<00:03:40.940> fusion<00:03:41.359> of<00:03:41.449> electro<00:03:42.319> which<00:03:42.530> is

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
was kind of a fusion of electro which is

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.530 
was kind of a fusion of electro which is
what<00:03:42.919> more<00:03:43.159> what<00:03:43.340> my<00:03:43.489> sound<00:03:43.819> gears<00:03:44.090> towards

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
what more what my sound gears towards

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.119 
what more what my sound gears towards
but<00:03:44.989> he<00:03:45.139> brought<00:03:45.290> in<00:03:45.349> kind<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.799> glitchy

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
but he brought in kind of a glitchy

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.460 
but he brought in kind of a glitchy
breakbeat<00:03:46.879> like<00:03:47.599> breakdown<00:03:48.079> kind<00:03:48.319> of

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
breakbeat like breakdown kind of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.839 
breakbeat like breakdown kind of
elements<00:03:48.829> into<00:03:49.069> it<00:03:49.190> so<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.370> has<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.489> little<00:03:49.699> bit

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
elements into it so it has a little bit

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.490 
elements into it so it has a little bit
of<00:03:49.909> old<00:03:50.120> school<00:03:50.479> in<00:03:50.629> new<00:03:50.810> school<00:03:51.109> and<00:03:51.409> it's

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
of old school in new school and it's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.020 
of old school in new school and it's
probably<00:03:51.650> one<00:03:51.859> of<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.010> more<00:03:52.220> different

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
probably one of the more different

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.250 
probably one of the more different
tracks<00:03:53.299> that<00:03:53.449> I've<00:03:53.569> had<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.780> opportunity<00:03:53.870> to

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
tracks that I've had the opportunity to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.569 
tracks that I've had the opportunity to
work<00:03:54.409> on<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:54.769> it's<00:03:54.859> probably<00:03:55.010> my<00:03:55.159> favorite<00:03:55.459> one

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
work on so it's probably my favorite one

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.670 
work on so it's probably my favorite one

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
i started doing it I had the whole thing

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.270 
i started doing it I had the whole thing
pretty<00:04:24.520> much<00:04:24.610> mapped<00:04:25.180> out<00:04:25.419> in<00:04:25.630> my<00:04:25.660> head<00:04:25.780> and

pretty much mapped out in my head and
when<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.310> finally<00:04:27.610> did<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.120> put<00:04:28.210> the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
when I finally did it and put the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.420 
when I finally did it and put the
YouTube<00:04:29.050> video<00:04:29.200> together<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:29.710> was<00:04:29.980> thinking

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
YouTube video together I was thinking

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.030 
YouTube video together I was thinking
maybe<00:04:31.150> like<00:04:31.330> 20,000<00:04:32.320> views<00:04:32.530> or<00:04:32.740> something

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
maybe like 20,000 views or something

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.040 
maybe like 20,000 views or something
like<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.639> it's<00:04:33.820> it's<00:04:34.150> skyrocketed<00:04:35.020> to

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
like that and it's it's skyrocketed to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.470 
like that and it's it's skyrocketed to
almost<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.620> million<00:04:35.860> it's<00:04:36.250> getting<00:04:36.639> thousands

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
almost a million it's getting thousands

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.629 
almost a million it's getting thousands
of<00:04:37.630> plays<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.870> day<00:04:38.230> and<00:04:38.530> people<00:04:39.220> are<00:04:39.400> commenting
