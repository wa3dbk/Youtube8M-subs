00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 i 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.029
 Hello everyone I am good jim bowie 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.630
 plus ultra adventure and today I came to 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.130
 bring you an object that in our opinion 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.439
 is very important at the time of 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.980
 survival a watch as you can see 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.340
 almost a good brand specifically is the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.020
 Number 5.176 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.420
 because we have chosen this model 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.740
 good is boiling 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.500
 the clock of course 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.720
 it will not be appreciated that he has a needle and a 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.300
 digital something quite comfortable and 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.579
 important let's see what shows in the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.390
 box 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.390
 warranty 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.570
 Y 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.820
 this book instructions just by watching it 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.120
 we can already deduce that it has some 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.970
 how many functions are we going to see a brief 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.730
 description of each one first 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.870
 tell you that this watch has a 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:23.320
 100 meters depth resistance 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.020
 It is worth this gives us that whether it is 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.670
 rain like in a stream like someone 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.940
 who likes swimming or snorkeling 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.950
 this clock will be perfect for us 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.979
 all these activities 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.409
 and then highlight here has what it is 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.770
 in the part of the sensor it is worth to us 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.659
 will serve for different functions 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 thermometer 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.229
 Altimeter barometer is worth these 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.920
 functions when it comes to survival 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.729
 the altimeter is important because 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.030
 because people who like sports 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.799
 high mountain will let you know about 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.600
 what height it is and this will help us 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.149
 example when knowing routes of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.729
 Climbing barometer is important because 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.829
 Believe it or not you can help us 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.760
 predict the time depending on the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.670
 barometers rise or descend we can 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.360
 know if the temperature will 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.140
 completely measured by hectopascals 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.520
 and the thermometer a paragraph once 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.410
 we would wear them if we wanted 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.570
 calculate the room temperature we should 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.010
 take it off because the temperature of the 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.240
 body 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.240
 would influence that measurement 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.210
 then it has more normal functions 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.670
 how is the alarm in this case has 5 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.560
 whether to get up to take us 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.580
 a pill or to know if that has 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.820
 done late the alarms are going very well 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.550
 has countdown of course we 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.400
 will allow for example to know when 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.250
 we must return or stop making a 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.170
 certain activity and stopwatch that we 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.880
 will let you know how long we are 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.850
 doing something we all know the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.680
 stopwatch and apart from the time we 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.490
 lets know the calendar that is to say we 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.800
 says the day the month and the number and day 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.180
 that is, if we are on Saturday, Sunday, day 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.390
 12 and the month 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.760
 it's worth more as we can see the clock 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.780
 It is made of plastic which gives us enough 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.780
 resistance when putting it and going 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.560
 because with the system of tonality of 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.540
 watch which I quite like is the 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.239
 system better system in my opinion given 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.560
 that if it's a button, you can 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.200
 let go much more easily than 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.290
 being of this type of hook that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:48.230
 we all know good this has been the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:51.049
 casio review 5.176 I hope that you 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.439
 have liked a greeting and in bowie and 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.439
 until next time
