00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.053
 Such a unique housing is a high-rise bar for component designers. 

00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:13.273
 Ultrabook must be not only nice, but also efficient. 

00:00:13.273 --> 00:00:17.280
 How does the Sony Vaio Pro 13 handle it? 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.673
 Pretty good. 

00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:21.700
 Because it's an ultrabook inspired by Intel, 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.013
 we will find here a modern fourth generation Intel Core processor and graphic layout of this company, 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.086
 and up to 8GB of RAM and up to 512GB of SSD. 

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:38.580
 Usually, the processor is clocked at 1.6 GHz, 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.460
 but in turbo mode this frequency increases to 2.6 GHz. 

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:50.506
 However, because the Core i5-4200U is a dual-core, four-threaded processor, 

00:00:50.506 --> 00:00:56.013
 the clock can drop to 2.3 GHz when all four threads are used. 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.293
 The processor is based on the new Haswell architecture. 

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:04.773
 Under this code name is the fourth generation of Intel Core processors, 

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:07.733
 thanks to which we get lower energy consumption 

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.786
 with increased performance and a much more efficient graphics layout. 

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.326
 In addition, Haswell provides even easier 

00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:19.933
 and wireless delayed image transmission to an external monitor 

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.126
 thanks to Intel WiDi technology [Å‚aj daj] 4.1. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.193
 This wireless display allows computers connected to the WiFI network 

00:01:30.193 --> 00:01:34.706
 transmission of the image in Full HD quality with sound 5.1 

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:39.046
 for devices compatible with this standard, eg TV sets. 

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:44.213
 And as we are already in wireless communication, it is worth mentioning that ... 

00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:47.173
 In addition to the previously mentioned NFC technology, 

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:50.820
 the computer is also equipped with other ways to connect with the world. 

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:53.926
 In addition to the WiFi wireless card (n), 

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:57.313
 we still have Bluetooth version 4.0 available. 

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:03.113
 A few words worth devoting to the battery that Sony Vaio Pro 13 has. 

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:07.273
 This is the longest running ultrabook that came to our program. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.313
 Nearly 7 hours in typical applications 

00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:14.040
 means that you can easily use the device throughout the day 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.433
 when wireless connectivity is enabled. 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.253
 All this despite the small weight and the use of a relatively small battery. 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.913
 Of course, it will be difficult to play the ultrabook on the battery for a long time. 

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:28.660
 However, the components themselves are so efficient, 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.566
 to run some rather demanding titles on it, 

00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:34.480
 such as Diablo 3 or Starcraft 2. 

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:37.266
 With the extremely popular League of Legends 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.453
 Sony Vaio Pro 13 can handle it without a problem.
