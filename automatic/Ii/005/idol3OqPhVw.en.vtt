 events in Russia, Vladimir Putin today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.400
 held a meeting with government members 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.679
 Russian Federation on it some 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 ministers again got from the president 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.210
 Putin criticized the Deputy Prime Minister 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.119
 arkady dvorkovich and this time behind 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.430
 electric trains returned them but ticket prices 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.680
 have grown at times the head of state called 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 the work of the vice-premier formal approach 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.609
 to the problem what other words were spoken on 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.349
 meeting knows arkady nazarenko 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.420
 Cabinet last week reported 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.309
 interruptions with commuter trains in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 the country is no more and in general it is true 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.820
 but now a new attack 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.980
 this is only one example of Transbaikalian 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 village sbega the nearest school for local 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.300
 children is in a nearby village to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 she is 13 kilometers and now attention 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.469
 one way ticket cost one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 thousand rubles there is no other transport 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.550
 Naturally the inhabitants run away and do not have such 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 money in general children extraordinary 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 holidays 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.590
 where prices are today Vladimir Putin 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.510
 tried to figure it out with economists from 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.160
 governments more precisely in Arcadia 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
 Dvorkovich after all precisely he quite 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.650
 recently instructed to follow up 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.640
 setting to move gradually 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.680
 unsatisfactory analysis all 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.729
 the situation before we all had this 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.550
 understand to feel at the Treasury by them 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.300
 on the eve 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.800
 development of your own you have complete 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.500
 a picture of what's going on with finances 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.100
 in the regions from r7 here so i will ask 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.230
 more closely here as they formally 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.310
 The situation in which we say in Mary El 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:38.200
 the average fare was 22 rubles to 189 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.360
 Transbaikal region was 22 table 90 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.130
 but she doesn't take exactly the same on 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.290
 the week before last Putin was chanting 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.360
 Dvorkovich for something more than 20 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.200
 Russian regions, the train stopped 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.210
 walk completely 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.190
 government members asked for a month on 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.450
 the solution to the problem ultimately took 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.020
 just a few days 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.300
 gear for a day I will offer financial 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.160
 solution that will provide 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.470
 message recovery obedient as 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.600
 searched numb by them immediately well 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.930
 wait means you need to restore 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.030
 immediately suggesting how to solve 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.650
 financial problems the president personally 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.660
 solved one problem now 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.760
 formed the second with which it seems to him 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.020
 I will also have to deal personally in 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.390
 Popular Front monitored 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.840
 fares on trains in different 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.150
 regions 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 the results lay on Putin's table one of 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.900
 most difficult situations in the Transbaikalia and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.970
 Leningrad region there is increasing 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.670
 more than forty percent in novosibirsk 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.650
 just waiting for the increase it is scheduled for 25 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.410
 February in the Crimea from February 16 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.459
 tariffs will rise immediately by 55 percent 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.470
 losses grow it's understandable because in 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.900
 decision time was taken and not at all 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.739
 insist on having 25 again 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.890
 went down for 1 percent but jump 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.910
 so from one percent to 25 this too 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.230
 somehow a strange decision was haze 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.110
 the process has become 25 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.030
 but it was impossible to calm gradually 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.980
 timely it all goes and only 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.110
 residents of the Vologda region themselves were 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.940
 previous fare prices held rallies 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.070
 under the windows of the local administration 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.230
 the train stopped working in the regions 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.360
 you are a little mad have gone that here so Vladimir 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.459
 Putin began his meeting a week ago 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.890
 in the same intonation from the mouth of the president in 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.600
 address of the members of the Cabinet and today and the promise to 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.670
 Generally the same representatives of the people 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.350
 the front when carried out their monitoring 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.150
 noticed as soon as the tariffs 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.560
 people begin to grow in order to save 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.850
 just stop using 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.890
 trains in 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.750
 eventually they go half empty where here 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.850
 logic if regional carrier 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.440
 thus working at a loss 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.750
 trains should not go empty otherwise 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.850
 it's simple but a formal relationship to 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.650
 Besides what they spoke, I ask 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.270
 more closely and now new 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.340
 instruction to the government and dvorkovich 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.260
 personally, an urgent need to address the issue 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.330
 connect the federal tariff service 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.460
 In the near future, Putin is waiting for specific 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.140
 decisions if such a price increase is dictated 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.660
 need need this need 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.490
 clearly justify if someone in the next 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.130
 just want to get super profit 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.460
 he must be punished by akade nazarenko
