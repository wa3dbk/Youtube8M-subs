00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
at Apple we believe the way to make a

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
innovate them together with Lyon we've

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.970 
innovate them together with Lyon we've
rethought<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:13.080> basic<00:00:13.410> things<00:00:13.620> we've<00:00:13.769> used

now we can take advantage of the new

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 
now we can take advantage of the new
faster<00:00:22.170> more<00:00:22.529> powerful<00:00:23.010> hardware<00:00:23.130> to

that's<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> standard<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.369> what<00:00:29.490> a
