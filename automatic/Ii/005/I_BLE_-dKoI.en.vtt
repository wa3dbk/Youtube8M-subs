00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.600
 already officially confirmed in this 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.080
 no one survived the crash 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.720

 flying from Moscow fell not reached all 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 150 meters to the landing strip when 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.450
 the earth remained seconds 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.030
 the crew unexpectedly reported that the liner was not 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.369
 ready landing and requested permission to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.560
 second round but gaining height airplane 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.380
 apparently caught wing soil 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.000
 car lost control 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.130
 crashed to the ground there was an explosion 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.350
 fuel tanks and aircraft instantly 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.240
 turned into a flame of chance to escape 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.590
 due to nobody 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.329
 consider several versions at once 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.310
 technical error 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.219
 the aircraft malfunction was in 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 operating 23 years age solid but 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.939
 literally not at all critical 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.310
 minutes ago we got footage from cameras 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.700
 CCTV that captured 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.159
 boeing 737 aircraft crashes and flying 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.500
 from Kazan to Moscow and spasms are shackled 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.869
 this is the video of the last seconds of the flight 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.750
 judging because we see the plane fell on 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.360
 the ground is almost vertical and not touched 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.250
 its wing as previously assumed this 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.770
 the record is now carefully studying 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.830
 investigators experts monomakh 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.500
 given it was released in one thousand 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.390
 nine hundred and ninety year however 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.649
 talk about what's old air 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.560
 ship years incorrect alawar operate 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.930
 other concepts then airworthiness if 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.700
 the plane is in the air if it 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.370
 flies it means that he has them 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.370
 acts the so-called 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.109
 certificate of airworthiness to document 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.620
 confirming that the aircraft is in 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:27.380
 their pieces sleepy able that he can 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.540
 secure block and what is he 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.030
 ensure the pen smelled the swedes crew and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.859
 passengers when flying almost 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.200
 Immediately after the disaster in Kazan began 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.810
 heavy rain at the time of landing 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.609
 weather conditions were close to perfect 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.500
 visibility 5,000 meters to the same airport 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.760
 has been significantly upgraded to 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
 Universiade then thorough 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.150
 repaired the runway 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.799
 lane a control rooms 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.130
 staffed with modern navigation 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.380
 equipment 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.690
 but technically claims to this board 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.610
 were before 12 years ago the plane got 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.980
 in a serious accident in brazil again 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.570
 when landing, the landing gear broke and 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.110
 the liner landed hard on one of 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.970
 engines 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.830
 after which a long repair took place 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.570
 Yes, and the last landing of the aircraft in Moscow 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.690
 the passengers were also not told 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.690
 a simple plane at the moment of landing 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.670
 I started to sausage hard enough 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.980
 shaking in different directions is not difficult 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.970
 say were it weather conditions or 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.730
 there were some technical issues but 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 was shaking so badly that in general I have to 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.110
 white knuckles 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.090
 clutched the rail and her seat 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.070
 when we finally landed landed 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.120
 we are the first time a man next to me 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:39.270
 said that he is an adult enough man with 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.010
 mind and calm and skilled enough 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.410
 I said that in my life never 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.140
 didn't land and it was very scary 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.840
 flew today by this plane from Kazan to 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.070
 Moscow at 15-20 the pilot barely leveled 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.720
 vessel before landing 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.610
 when contacting us a little bit 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.730
 brought on a pilot and I managed 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.770
 crossed I flew the other day with them in 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.560
 the cabin was a patch patched in a hole 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.480
 metal armchair loosened by myself closely 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.640
 associated with aviation and I was not difficult 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.250
 understand how really long it flies 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.780
 specialist trough alarming yet 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.580
 one thing is known that 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.590
 the crashed aircraft was operated in 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.090
 different countries of the planets flew to France 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.120
 brazil bulgaria and romania and 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.530
 african uganda and only 2008 he 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.239
 was rented in Russia 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.860
 Boeing has already announced that 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.740
 sent their experts to help 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.540

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.990

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.790

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.590
 necessary checks and at the time of departure 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.539
 was technically sound will
