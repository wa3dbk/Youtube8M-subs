out of this you can glide for ages this
one<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.990> think<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> furthest

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
one right here I think it's the furthest

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
one right here I think it's the furthest
one<00:01:47.640> I've<00:01:47.820> ever<00:01:47.850> been<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.899> normally<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.380> get

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
one I've ever been like normally I get

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
one I've ever been like normally I get
towards<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> sea<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.000> go<00:01:51.240> down

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
towards the sea and I just like go down

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719 
towards the sea and I just like go down
but<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.799> kept<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
but this one I just kept going out and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.580 
but this one I just kept going out and
out<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.049> went<00:01:55.200> any

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
out and out and out and if I went any

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.200 
out and out and out and if I went any
further<00:01:55.829> I'd<00:01:56.070> probably<00:01:56.280> end<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.759> by<00:01:56.909> sea<00:01:57.180> or

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
further I'd probably end up in by sea or

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.959 
further I'd probably end up in by sea or
something<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.259> quite<00:01:58.469> weird<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.790> just

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
something it's quite weird but you just

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
something it's quite weird but you just
got<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.180> keep<00:02:00.329> gradually<00:02:00.840> tilting<00:02:01.200> back<00:02:01.380> don't

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
got to keep gradually tilting back don't

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.560 
got to keep gradually tilting back don't
have<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> spawn<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:02.909> X<00:02:03.090> or<00:02:03.390> whatnot

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
have to spawn a or X or whatnot

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.810 
have to spawn a or X or whatnot
depending<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.439> what<00:02:04.619> comes<00:02:04.890> oh<00:02:05.070> you're<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
depending on what comes oh you're on you

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.210 
depending on what comes oh you're on you
only<00:02:05.939> need<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> jump<00:02:06.509> off<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
only need to jump off like and just and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.010 
only need to jump off like and just and
just<00:02:08.489> tilt<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> left<00:02:09.569> analog<00:02:09.810> stick

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
just tilt back on the left analog stick

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.080 
just tilt back on the left analog stick
and<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.890> keep<00:02:11.039> gliding<00:02:11.580> England

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and you just keep gliding England

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.720 
and you just keep gliding England
gliding<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.080> gliding<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.709> gliding<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.370> look

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
gliding and gliding and gliding and look

Mount chiliad and one from the actual
but<00:02:50.640> back<00:02:51.060> where<00:02:51.329> we<00:02:51.510> were<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:52.230> as<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.470> see<00:02:52.650> it

can<00:02:54.750> see<00:02:54.930> me<00:02:55.079> start<00:02:55.440> gliding<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.610> need<00:02:56.760> a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
can see me start gliding but you need a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.539 
can see me start gliding but you need a
lot<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.180> room<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.750> actually<00:02:57.930> fall<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.099> like

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
lot of room to actually fall so like

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.860 
lot of room to actually fall so like
this<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.090> need<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.329> lot<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.569> room<00:03:00.840> to

this you just need a lot of room to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.750 
this you just need a lot of room to
actually<00:03:01.140> fall<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:01.769> get<00:03:01.950> speed<00:03:02.250> going<00:03:02.579> down

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
actually fall we get speed going down

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.059 
actually fall we get speed going down
this<00:03:02.940> hill<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.450> then<00:03:03.989> we<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.829> lean

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
this hill and then we just like lean

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.720 
this hill and then we just like lean
back<00:03:05.340> after<00:03:06.319> right<00:03:07.319> bunny<00:03:08.040> hop<00:03:08.250> them<00:03:08.430> but<00:03:08.579> look

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
back after right bunny hop them but look

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.890 
back after right bunny hop them but look
at<00:03:08.849> that<00:03:08.940> massive<00:03:09.269> drop<00:03:09.450> that's<00:03:09.660> what<00:03:09.810> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
at that massive drop that's what you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.660 
at that massive drop that's what you
need<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.200> need<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.349> big<00:03:10.560> drop<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.370> might<00:03:11.519> go

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
need to need a big drop so you might go

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.130 
need to need a big drop so you might go
to<00:03:11.730> do<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:11.970> off<00:03:12.090> certain<00:03:12.420> buildings<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.019> I'd

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
to do it off certain buildings but I'd

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.869 
to do it off certain buildings but I'd
