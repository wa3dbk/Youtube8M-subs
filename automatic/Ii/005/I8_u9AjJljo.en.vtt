world turns into leather ice age the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.560 
world turns into leather ice age the
temperature<00:04:59.890> is<00:05:00.070> increasingly<00:05:00.670> dropping<00:05:01.360> so

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
temperature is increasingly dropping so

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.450 
temperature is increasingly dropping so
you're<00:05:01.720> getting<00:05:01.840> more<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:02.350> more<00:05:02.440> cold<00:05:02.920> you

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
didn't really plan on this ice age so

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.920 
didn't really plan on this ice age so
you<00:05:05.950> only<00:05:06.130> wore<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:06.400> t-shirt<00:05:06.670> and<00:05:07.030> shorts<00:05:07.090> so

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
could not stand from like the third page

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.330 
could not stand from like the third page
I<00:05:33.430> hated<00:05:33.970> it<00:05:34.240> it's<00:05:34.900> literally<00:05:35.320> only<00:05:35.620> like<00:05:36.070> 200

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
pages long which is a short novel

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.670 
pages long which is a short novel
absolutely<00:05:39.640> hatred<00:05:40.030> for<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.360> book<00:05:40.680> it's

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
absolutely hatred for that book it's

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.240 
absolutely hatred for that book it's
probably<00:05:41.830> not<00:05:42.460> good<00:05:42.910> for<00:05:43.740> burning<00:05:44.740> since<00:05:44.980> it's

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
probably not good for burning since it's

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.700 
probably not good for burning since it's
not<00:05:45.790> got<00:05:46.330> that<00:05:46.510> many<00:05:46.690> pages<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.410> my<00:05:47.530> other

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
not got that many pages so my other

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.170 
not got that many pages so my other
answer<00:05:48.040> for<00:05:48.190> this<00:05:48.280> scenario<00:05:48.460> would<00:05:48.910> be<00:05:48.970> the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
answer for this scenario would be the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.690 
answer for this scenario would be the
complete<00:05:49.570> works<00:05:49.930> of<00:05:50.200> Shakespeare<00:05:50.830> because

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
complete works of Shakespeare because

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.970 
complete works of Shakespeare because
you<00:05:51.910> know<00:05:52.060> that<00:05:52.870> library<00:05:53.470> is<00:05:53.590> not<00:05:53.770> going<00:05:53.920> to

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
you know that library is not going to

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.370 
you know that library is not going to
have<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.370> last<00:05:54.730> copy<00:05:55.210> of<00:05:55.600> the<00:05:55.810> complete<00:05:56.230> works

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
have the last copy of the complete works

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.260 
have the last copy of the complete works
of<00:05:56.590> Shakespeare<00:05:57.190> so<00:05:57.640> it's<00:05:57.790> not<00:05:57.850> like<00:05:58.090> you're

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
of Shakespeare so it's not like you're

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.330 
of Shakespeare so it's not like you're
burning<00:05:58.630> an<00:05:58.720> entire<00:05:59.050> culture<00:05:59.380> you're<00:06:00.160> just

burning an entire culture you're just
burning<00:06:00.760> a<00:06:00.820> few<00:06:01.000> pages<00:06:01.240> and<00:06:01.690> it's<00:06:02.200> a<00:06:02.320> pretty

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
burning a few pages and it's a pretty

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.000 
burning a few pages and it's a pretty
hefty<00:06:03.190> book<00:06:03.670> so<00:06:04.000> you'd<00:06:04.900> be<00:06:05.050> warm<00:06:05.500> for<00:06:05.590> quite<00:06:05.980> a
