00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it because it really really requires

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
it because it really really requires
just<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.009> much<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.400> tedious<00:01:29.610> detail<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.540> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
just so much little tedious detail to it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
just so much little tedious detail to it
which<00:01:30.960> hopefully<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.920> Minecraft

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
which hopefully we can get in Minecraft

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.069 
which hopefully we can get in Minecraft
I've<00:01:32.520> been<00:01:32.610> trying<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> few<00:01:33.150> things<00:01:33.329> like

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
I've been trying with a few things like

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.800 
I've been trying with a few things like
your<00:01:34.409> arm<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.790> leathers<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.689> but

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
your arm you know leathers or so but

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359 
your arm you know leathers or so but
they<00:01:36.869> look<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:37.140> silly<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.740> arms<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.220> just

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
they look a bit silly as arms I just

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.270 
they look a bit silly as arms I just
look<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:39.119> very<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.780> odd<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.680> we'll

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
look very very very very odd so we'll

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
look very very very very odd so we'll
see<00:01:41.490> how<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.640> goes<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.420> future<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.320> on

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
see how that goes in the future now on

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.380 
see how that goes in the future now on
the<00:01:43.619> base<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.490> some<00:01:44.759> half<00:01:45.000> wooden

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the base here we have some half wooden

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.960 
the base here we have some half wooden
blocks<00:01:45.630> cocoa<00:01:45.899> puffs<00:01:46.350> stone<00:01:46.799> blocks<00:01:46.829> re<00:01:47.369> going

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
blocks cocoa puffs stone blocks re going

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.130 
blocks cocoa puffs stone blocks re going
all<00:01:48.119> around<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.540> building<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.899> just

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
all around the building and that just

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.310 
all around the building and that just
gives<00:01:49.320> our<00:01:49.500> basis<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.159> our<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:51.360> our<00:01:51.630> build<00:01:51.960> we

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
gives our basis of our of our build we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200 
gives our basis of our of our build we
also<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.710> used<00:01:53.130> some<00:01:53.399> fences<00:01:53.820> he<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
also have used some fences he be of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.389 
also have used some fences he be of
vienna<00:01:54.479> those<00:01:54.630> sort<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> those<00:01:55.799> planks<00:01:56.070> ago<00:01:56.340> on

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
vienna those sort of those planks ago on

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.889 
vienna those sort of those planks ago on
an<00:01:56.520> angle<00:01:56.969> i<00:01:57.090> suppose<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.329> want<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> call<00:01:57.869> it

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
an angle i suppose you want to call it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.450 
an angle i suppose you want to call it
that<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.740> they<00:01:58.860> look<00:01:59.040> alright<00:01:59.219> I've

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that and that they look alright I've

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.639 
that and that they look alright I've
experiment<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:00.509> some<00:02:00.540> half<00:02:00.930> box<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
experiment with some half box here and I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.780 
experiment with some half box here and I
think<00:02:01.979> they<00:02:02.070> look<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.579> bit<00:02:02.670> better

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
think they look just a bit better

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.880 
think they look just a bit better
without<00:02:03.000> them<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.079> know<00:02:04.200> makes<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.619> look

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
without them just you know makes it look

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.170 
without them just you know makes it look
a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.070> bit<00:02:05.250> cleaner<00:02:05.610> which<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.060> know

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
a little bit cleaner which you know

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.020 
a little bit cleaner which you know
clean<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.079> always<00:02:07.530> always<00:02:07.770> lovely<00:02:08.399> now

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
clean this is always always lovely now

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.089 
clean this is always always lovely now
if<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.300> go<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.780> back<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.530> will<00:02:10.739> see

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
if we go to the back here we will see

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.400 
if we go to the back here we will see
that<00:02:11.340> we're<00:02:11.970> missing<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.360> massive<00:02:12.780> chunk<00:02:13.110> now

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that we're missing a massive chunk now

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.820 
that we're missing a massive chunk now
as<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.620> go

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
of the building there was a massive

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.120 
of the building there was a massive

of<00:02:29.010> suger<00:02:29.520> work<00:02:29.760> at<00:02:29.940> how<00:02:30.060> I'm<00:02:30.270> going<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.600> build

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
of suger work at how I'm going to build

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.660 
of suger work at how I'm going to build
that<00:02:31.380> across<00:02:31.770> here<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:32.610> got

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
that across here as you can see it's got

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.120 
that across here as you can see it's got
to<00:02:32.820> go<00:02:32.940> at<00:02:33.330> least<00:02:33.390> two<00:02:33.960> about<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.470> think<00:02:34.920> about

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
to go at least two about I think about

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.120 
to go at least two about I think about
here<00:02:35.550> at<00:02:36.000> least<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.900> make<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.260> sort<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.860> rowing

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
here at least to make it sort of rowing

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.700 
here at least to make it sort of rowing
might<00:02:38.280> even<00:02:38.550> have<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.880> extend<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.630> more<00:02:40.110> now<00:02:40.590> of

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
might even have to extend it more now of

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.840 
might even have to extend it more now of
course<00:02:40.890> you're<00:02:41.070> all<00:02:41.160> wondering<00:02:41.460> what<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.730> this

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
course you're all wondering what is this

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.700 
course you're all wondering what is this
massive<00:02:42.330> gap<00:02:42.600> under<00:02:42.990> here<00:02:43.170> now<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
massive gap under here now this is the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.150 
massive gap under here now this is the
underside<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.360> Euro<00:02:45.660> Bhaskar

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
underside of the Euro Bhaskar

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.840 
underside of the Euro Bhaskar
construction<00:02:47.160> eyes<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.640> it's<00:02:47.760> your

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
construction eyes I think it's your

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.820 
construction eyes I think it's your
basket<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.270> we'll<00:02:48.420> go<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.720> anyway<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.170> I've

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
basket but we'll go it anyway and I've

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.770 
basket but we'll go it anyway and I've
used<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.370> wall<00:02:50.880> here<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.270> sort<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.510> give<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
used the wall here to sort of give a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.290 
used the wall here to sort of give a
little<00:02:51.840> floor<00:02:52.500> plan<00:02:52.800> which<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.490> think<00:02:53.730> gives<00:02:54.090> it

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
little floor plan which I think gives it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.699 
little floor plan which I think gives it
gives<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.750> nice<00:02:54.870> little<00:02:54.930> outline<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.560> what

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
gives it a nice little outline of what

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.650 
gives it a nice little outline of what
we're<00:02:55.860> trying<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.220> achieve<00:02:56.370> here<00:02:56.820> obviously

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
we're trying to achieve here obviously

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
this little emptied out space here is

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.880 
this little emptied out space here is
where<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.660> first<00:03:06.959> meet<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.380> companion

so<00:03:10.950> what<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.190> end<00:03:11.340> up<00:03:11.400> eating<00:03:11.580> which<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.270> bit

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
so what you end up eating which is a bit

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.690 
so what you end up eating which is a bit
funny<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.740> we'll<00:03:14.250> see<00:03:14.280> how<00:03:14.640> that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
funny so you know we'll see how that

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.699 
funny so you know we'll see how that
goes<00:03:14.820> know<00:03:15.240> as<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.510> see<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.840> put<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.560> a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
goes know as you can see I put that a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.080 
goes know as you can see I put that a
little<00:03:17.010> bit<00:03:17.070> further<00:03:17.340> back<00:03:17.580> here<00:03:17.850> but<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.060> I

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
little bit further back here but then I

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.120 
little bit further back here but then I
realize<00:03:18.450> know<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.200> way<00:03:19.500> way<00:03:19.769> too<00:03:19.800> far

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
realize know that that's way way too far

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.650 
realize know that that's way way too far
it<00:03:20.310> does<00:03:20.640> not<00:03:20.760> need<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.030> be<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.269> far<00:03:21.480> back<00:03:21.600> so

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
it does not need to be that far back so

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.120 
it does not need to be that far back so
I<00:03:21.780> brought<00:03:21.870> forward<00:03:22.230> bit<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.010> that's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
I brought forward bit and I think that's

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.770 
I brought forward bit and I think that's
a<00:03:23.310> much<00:03:23.519> better<00:03:23.550> distance<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.510> doesn't

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
a much better distance it doesn't

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.570 
a much better distance it doesn't
involve<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.080> marathon<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.680> get<00:03:25.800> from<00:03:26.040> point<00:03:26.370> A

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
involve a marathon to get from point A

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.640 
involve a marathon to get from point A
to<00:03:26.640> point<00:03:26.850> B<00:03:27.180> just<00:03:27.720> takes<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.110> man<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.410> straw

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
to point B just takes a man of straw

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.680 
to point B just takes a man of straw
which<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.340> know<00:03:29.489> matches<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.030> lot<00:03:30.330> better

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
which you know matches it a lot better

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.259 
which you know matches it a lot better
now<00:03:31.290> if<00:03:31.350> we<00:03:31.470> look<00:03:31.500> on<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.920> inside

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
now if we look on the inside

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.850 
now if we look on the inside
unfortunately<00:03:33.269> because<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.170> dimensions

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
unfortunately because of the dimensions

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.320 
unfortunately because of the dimensions
of<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.130> outside<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> building<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.239> the

of the outside of the building and the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.840 
of the outside of the building and the
inside<00:03:36.870> don't<00:03:37.110> completely<00:03:37.620> match<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.250> skirim

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
inside don't completely match in skirim

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.270 
inside don't completely match in skirim
there<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.630> had<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.019> in<00:03:40.230> theme<00:03:40.650> exceptions

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
there have had to be in theme exceptions

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.910 
there have had to be in theme exceptions

you<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:44.280> see<00:03:44.430> here<00:03:44.610> I've<00:03:44.790> kept<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.390> fire

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
you can see here I've kept the fire

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.590 
you can see here I've kept the fire
relatively<00:03:46.590> exact<00:03:47.580> what<00:03:47.820> I'm<00:03:47.940> what<00:03:48.300> was<00:03:48.450> in

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
relatively exact what I'm what was in

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.050 
relatively exact what I'm what was in
the<00:03:49.100> building<00:03:50.100> main<00:03:50.400> reason<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.760> was

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
the building main reason that was

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.759 
the building main reason that was
because<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.780> focal<00:03:52.110> point<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.380> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
because this is the focal point of the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.979 
because this is the focal point of the
insight<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.610> my<00:03:53.790> opinion<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.450> needs<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.840> be

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
insight in my opinion and it needs to be

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.259 
insight in my opinion and it needs to be
the<00:03:55.140> one<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:56.070> most<00:03:56.250> accurate<00:03:56.519> now

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
the one that is the most accurate now

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.110 
the one that is the most accurate now
I've<00:03:57.480> tried<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.900> emulate<00:03:58.730> carpet<00:03:59.730> by<00:03:59.850> putting

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
I've tried to emulate carpet by putting

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.460 
I've tried to emulate carpet by putting
these<00:04:00.209> wooden<00:04:00.480> blocks<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:00.840> wool<00:04:01.230> blocks

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
these wooden blocks of wool blocks

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.050 
these wooden blocks of wool blocks
around<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.190> think<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.610> does<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.790> pretty<00:04:02.910> good

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
around and I think it does a pretty good

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.150 
around and I think it does a pretty good
job<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.510> tried<00:04:03.959> playing<00:04:04.170> some<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:05.130> know

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
job I tried playing some you know

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.550 
job I tried playing some you know
preparation<00:04:06.000> type<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.780> tables<00:04:07.260> over<00:04:07.530> here

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
preparation type of tables over here

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.220 
preparation type of tables over here
however<00:04:08.459> they<00:04:08.610> caught<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.150> fire<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.720> that

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
however they caught on fire and that

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.810 
however they caught on fire and that
wasn't<00:04:10.560> very<00:04:10.590> good<00:04:10.769> i<00:04:10.950> lost<00:04:11.190> about<00:04:11.340> half<00:04:11.670> of

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
wasn't very good i lost about half of

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.449 
wasn't very good i lost about half of
this<00:04:12.030> section<00:04:12.900> here<00:04:13.049> which<00:04:13.200> wasn't<00:04:13.500> very<00:04:13.799> nice

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
this section here which wasn't very nice

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.670 
this section here which wasn't very nice
and<00:04:14.790> yes<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.330> may<00:04:15.420> be<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.570> bit<00:04:15.720> sad<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.530> besides

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
and yes it may be a bit sad so besides

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.070 
and yes it may be a bit sad so besides
that<00:04:16.950> we<00:04:17.070> might<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.850> know<00:04:17.940> we've<00:04:18.570> managed<00:04:18.930> we

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
that we might you know we've managed we

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.509 
that we might you know we've managed we
might<00:04:19.229> have<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.530> put<00:04:19.650> them<00:04:19.769> back<00:04:19.890> around<00:04:20.280> here

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
might have to put them back around here

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.550 
might have to put them back around here
I<00:04:20.549> think<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:20.850> might<00:04:21.000> be<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.180> better<00:04:21.570> better

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
I think that might be a better better

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.500 
I think that might be a better better
idea<00:04:22.890> because<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.220> gives<00:04:23.400> us<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.640> bit<00:04:23.789> more<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:24.390> bit

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
idea because I gives us a bit more a bit

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.820 
idea because I gives us a bit more a bit
more<00:04:24.810> distance<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.530> know<00:04:25.650> they're<00:04:25.800> not

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
more distance and we know they're not

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.390 
more distance and we know they're not
going<00:04:25.979> to<00:04:26.039> catch<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.370> fire<00:04:26.610> or<00:04:26.910> even

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
going to catch on fire or even

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.620 
going to catch on fire or even
just<00:04:27.580> put<00:04:27.729> them<00:04:27.820> on<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.000> side<00:04:28.240> here<00:04:28.270> and

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
just put them on the side here and

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.909 
just put them on the side here and
obviously<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.350> isn't<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.620> hundred<00:04:29.860> percent

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
obviously it isn't a hundred percent

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.950 
obviously it isn't a hundred percent
accurate<00:04:30.490> however<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.540> best<00:04:31.720> we<00:04:31.870> can

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
accurate however it is the best we can

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.689 
accurate however it is the best we can
do<00:04:32.139> within<00:04:32.350> these<00:04:32.590> space<00:04:32.889> restrictions<00:04:33.580> and

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
do within these space restrictions and

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:34.560 
do within these space restrictions and
of<00:04:33.790> course<00:04:34.000> if<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.210> guys<00:04:34.360> have<00:04:34.509> any

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
of course if you guys have any

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.420 
of course if you guys have any
suggestions<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.350> would<00:04:35.650> love<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.830> hear<00:04:36.160> them<00:04:36.310> I

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
suggestions I would love to hear them I

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.460 
suggestions I would love to hear them I
read<00:04:36.669> them<00:04:36.820> all<00:04:37.000> because<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.539> guys<00:04:37.810> are<00:04:38.080> great

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
read them all because you guys are great

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.230 
read them all because you guys are great
now<00:04:38.979> as<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.160> can<00:04:39.280> see<00:04:39.340> here<00:04:39.639> we<00:04:39.759> have<00:04:39.789> our

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
now as you can see here we have our

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.360 
now as you can see here we have our
office<00:04:40.870> room<00:04:41.139> which<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.470> find<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.130> I<00:04:42.160> think

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
office room which you find and I think

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.439 
office room which you find and I think
it's<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.550> other<00:04:42.580> side<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.150> building

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
it's the other side of the building

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.420 
it's the other side of the building
however<00:04:43.990> for<00:04:44.169> this<00:04:44.259> build<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:44.770> prefer<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.190> on

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
however for this build I prefer to on

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.710 
however for this build I prefer to on
this<00:04:45.699> one<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:45.970> just<00:04:46.030> look<00:04:46.210> do<00:04:46.330> it<00:04:46.419> better<00:04:46.630> with

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
this one and just look do it better with

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.810 
this one and just look do it better with
it<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.139> know<00:04:47.169> all<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.440> whole<00:04:47.820> arrangements

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
it you know all the whole arrangements

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.430 
it you know all the whole arrangements
and<00:04:48.880> everything<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.330> just<00:04:49.360> worked<00:04:49.990> up<00:04:50.199> be

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
and everything it just worked up be

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.379 
and everything it just worked up be
easier<00:04:51.039> as<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.669> can<00:04:51.729> see<00:04:51.880> here<00:04:52.060> we<00:04:52.150> haven't

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
easier as you can see here we haven't

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.670 
easier as you can see here we haven't
done<00:04:52.509> much<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:52.780> here<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.259> pretty<00:04:53.440> much<00:04:53.620> the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
done much in here is pretty much the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.320 
done much in here is pretty much the
same<00:04:53.889> as<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.220> other<00:04:54.370> rooms<00:04:54.669> however<00:04:54.910> you<00:04:55.240> know

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
same as the other rooms however you know

same as the other rooms however you know
we'll<00:04:55.479> be<00:04:55.570> putting<00:04:55.889> you<00:04:56.889> know<00:04:57.009> carpet<00:04:57.490> along

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
we'll be putting you know carpet along

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.180 
we'll be putting you know carpet along

here and decorations and all that stuff

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.279 
here and decorations and all that stuff
which<00:05:00.490> will<00:05:00.669> come<00:05:00.880> in<00:05:01.060> time<00:05:01.180> once<00:05:01.419> we<00:05:01.510> have<00:05:01.810> the

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
which will come in time once we have the

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.360 
which will come in time once we have the
you<00:05:02.650> know<00:05:02.770> available<00:05:03.370> time<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.449> you<00:05:04.930> know

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
you know available time and you know

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.740 
you know available time and you know
preparation<00:05:06.370> because<00:05:06.490> once<00:05:06.789> we've<00:05:07.270> got<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.449> lot

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
preparation because once we've got a lot

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.900 
preparation because once we've got a lot
to<00:05:07.780> do<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.289> don't<00:05:08.770> get<00:05:08.889> me<00:05:08.979> wrong<00:05:09.160> we're<00:05:09.729> only

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
to do you don't get me wrong we're only

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.939 
to do you don't get me wrong we're only
about<00:05:10.090> probably<00:05:10.510> sixty<00:05:10.930> percent<00:05:11.080> if<00:05:11.560> that

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
about probably sixty percent if that

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.620 
about probably sixty percent if that
through<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.729> bill<00:05:12.880> may<00:05:13.000> be<00:05:13.030> about<00:05:13.270> forty

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
through the bill may be about forty

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.659 
through the bill may be about forty
percent<00:05:13.870> so<00:05:14.050> there<00:05:14.199> is<00:05:14.350> still<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.710> lot<00:05:14.770> more<00:05:15.460> to

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
percent so there is still a lot more to

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.909 
percent so there is still a lot more to
go<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.240> once<00:05:16.570> again<00:05:16.720> over<00:05:17.050> here<00:05:17.289> we<00:05:17.440> have<00:05:17.710> our

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
go and once again over here we have our

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.070 
go and once again over here we have our
little<00:05:18.070> entrance<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.970> underground<00:05:19.360> area

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
little entrance to the underground area

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.960 
little entrance to the underground area
of<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.500> building<00:05:20.650> these<00:05:21.010> many<00:05:21.340> shells<00:05:21.699> which

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
of the building these many shells which

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.150 
of the building these many shells which
will<00:05:22.090> probably<00:05:22.270> be<00:05:22.419> changed<00:05:23.010> multiple<00:05:24.010> times

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
will probably be changed multiple times

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.120 
will probably be changed multiple times
during<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:25.300> construction<00:05:26.139> which<00:05:26.680> will<00:05:26.979> be

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
during the construction which will be

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.730 
during the construction which will be
quite<00:05:27.580> interesting<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.180> keep<00:05:28.509> an<00:05:28.690> eye<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.020> now

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
quite interesting to keep an eye on now

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.230 
quite interesting to keep an eye on now
it<00:05:29.889> is<00:05:30.009> important<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.460> note<00:05:30.610> guys<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:31.090> this

like I said is in the early stages of
its<00:05:33.580> of<00:05:33.729> its<00:05:34.060> construction<00:05:34.449> I<00:05:34.840> wanted<00:05:35.260> to<00:05:35.380> arm
