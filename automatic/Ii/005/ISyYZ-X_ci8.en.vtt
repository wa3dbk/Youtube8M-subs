00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.440 
through here okay to show you how quick
the<00:00:53.890> wiring<00:00:54.310> with<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.640> wiring<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.090> all<00:00:55.210> about

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
the wiring with the wiring is all about

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.860 
the wiring with the wiring is all about
here<00:00:55.750> it's<00:00:56.350> really<00:00:56.950> easy<00:00:57.190> so<00:00:57.550> right<00:00:58.540> there<00:00:58.780> if

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
here it's really easy so right there if

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.600 
here it's really easy so right there if
you've<00:00:59.020> never<00:00:59.170> seen<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.500> tee<00:00:59.740> flip-flop<00:01:00.220> that's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
you've never seen a tee flip-flop that's

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.180 
you've never seen a tee flip-flop that's
a<00:01:00.760> tee<00:01:00.910> flip-flop<00:01:01.390> that<00:01:01.690> whole<00:01:02.010> square<00:01:03.010> right

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
a tee flip-flop that whole square right

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.130 
a tee flip-flop that whole square right
there<00:01:03.430> is<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.579> tee<00:01:03.790> flip-flop<00:01:04.239> now<00:01:04.780> I<00:01:04.809> don't

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
there is a tee flip-flop now I don't

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.960 
there is a tee flip-flop now I don't
really<00:01:05.320> know<00:01:05.530> understand<00:01:06.040> how<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.460> works<00:01:06.490> I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
really know understand how it works I

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.940 
really know understand how it works I
can<00:01:07.150> guess<00:01:07.360> how<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.750> works<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:08.229> guess<00:01:08.619> when<00:01:08.829> you

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
can guess how it works I guess when you

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.460 
can guess how it works I guess when you
press<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.400> button<00:01:09.430> it<00:01:10.090> basically<00:01:10.960> works<00:01:11.290> like

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
press the button it basically works like

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.200 
press the button it basically works like
to<00:01:11.890> me<00:01:12.010> it<00:01:12.130> would<00:01:12.250> work<00:01:12.340> like<00:01:12.520> an<00:01:12.670> RS<00:01:12.940> nor<00:01:13.150> latch

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
to me it would work like an RS nor latch

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.960 
to me it would work like an RS nor latch
but<00:01:13.780> there<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.320> no<00:01:14.500> reset<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.220> reset<00:01:15.640> is<00:01:15.820> the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
but there is no reset the reset is the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.690 
but there is no reset the reset is the
button<00:01:16.210> itself<00:01:16.330> so<00:01:17.260> if<00:01:17.409> i<00:01:17.500> push<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.010> button<00:01:18.310> it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
button itself so if i push the button it

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.030 
button itself so if i push the button it
brings<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.150> charge<00:01:19.510> through<00:01:19.900> opens<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.830> door

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
brings the charge through opens the door

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.310 
brings the charge through opens the door
and<00:01:21.250> then<00:01:21.820> if<00:01:21.909> i<00:01:22.000> push<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.450> button<00:01:22.720> again<00:01:22.900> it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
and then if i push the button again it

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.680 
and then if i push the button again it
releases<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.340> closes<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.790> door<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.360> it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
releases that and closes the door and it

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.350 
releases that and closes the door and it
does<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.080> from<00:01:26.380> several<00:01:27.090> different<00:01:28.090> sources

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
does it from several different sources

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.660 
does it from several different sources
so<00:01:29.050> like<00:01:29.229> right<00:01:29.500> now<00:01:29.650> i<00:01:29.680> have<00:01:29.920> two<00:01:30.130> sources<00:01:30.340> i

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
so like right now i have two sources i

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.280 
so like right now i have two sources i
could<00:01:30.820> probably<00:01:31.000> put<00:01:31.240> five<00:01:31.479> buttons<00:01:31.870> on<00:01:32.110> this

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
could probably put five buttons on this

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.560 
could probably put five buttons on this
and<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.620> would<00:01:32.740> work<00:01:32.890> just<00:01:32.950> fine<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:34.180> yeah<00:01:34.330> so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
and it would work just fine so yeah so

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.270 
and it would work just fine so yeah so
that's<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.229> was<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.740> mean<00:01:35.979> I<00:01:36.040> couldn't

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
that's it that was it I mean I couldn't

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.430 
that's it that was it I mean I couldn't
believe<00:01:36.549> how<00:01:36.700> easy<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.180> was<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:38.020> yeah<00:01:38.140> t

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
believe how easy that was so yeah t

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.899 
believe how easy that was so yeah t

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
is like this is what a tee flip-flop

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.010 
is like this is what a tee flip-flop
looks<00:01:41.770> like<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:42.760> yes<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.570> want<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.840> thank
