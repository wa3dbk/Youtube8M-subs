it<00:02:58.239> was<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.750> very<00:02:59.049> slow<00:02:59.469> so<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.400> hosted<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.239> a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
it was so very slow so I hosted up a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.979 
it was so very slow so I hosted up a
barrel<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.140> secured<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:03.129> rope<00:03:03.310> below<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.780> in

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
barrel and secured a rope below but in

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.770 
barrel and secured a rope below but in
me<00:03:05.200> haste<00:03:05.469> to<00:03:05.829> fill<00:03:06.069> it<00:03:06.219> up<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.670> was<00:03:07.120> too<00:03:07.420> blind

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
me haste to fill it up I was too blind

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.679 
me haste to fill it up I was too blind
to<00:03:07.930> see<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:09.099> barrel<00:03:09.670> full<00:03:09.939> of<00:03:10.000> building

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
to see that a barrel full of building

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.140 
to see that a barrel full of building
bricks<00:03:10.989> was<00:03:11.530> heavier<00:03:11.920> than<00:03:12.340> me

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
bricks was heavier than me

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.009

and<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.560> when<00:03:14.920> he<00:03:14.950> cast<00:03:15.519> off<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> line<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
and so when he cast off the line the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.589 
and so when he cast off the line the
barrel<00:03:17.379> fell<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.859> LED<00:03:18.189> and<00:03:18.670> clinging

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
barrel fell like LED and clinging

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.089

this almighty blow while the barrel

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.640 
this almighty blow while the barrel
spilled<00:03:48.579> out<00:03:48.819> half<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.450> bricks<00:03:49.689> some<00:03:50.109> 14

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
spilled out half the bricks some 14

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.509 
spilled out half the bricks some 14
floors<00:03:51.099> below<00:03:52.200> now<00:03:53.200> when<00:03:53.230> these<00:03:53.829> bricks<00:03:54.310> had

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
floors below now when these bricks had

was<00:03:58.030> heavier<00:03:58.419> than<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.959> barrel<00:03:59.379> and<00:03:59.650> so

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
was heavier than the barrel and so

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.420 
was heavier than the barrel and so
started<00:04:00.699> down<00:04:00.940> once<00:04:01.239> more<00:04:01.919> still<00:04:02.919> clinging
