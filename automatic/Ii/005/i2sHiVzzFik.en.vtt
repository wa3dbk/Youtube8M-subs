agree<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> dice<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.619> still<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.100> darker

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

my one issue with them though is that

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.020 
my one issue with them though is that

someone who was using a flashlight or a

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
laser sight or what's really obvious is

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.099 
laser sight or what's really obvious is
the<00:03:29.310> flare<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.329> look<00:03:30.599> at<00:03:30.750> some<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.049> those

crossing<00:04:41.699> my<00:04:41.970> fingers<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.690> they<00:04:42.840> would<00:04:42.990> be

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
crossing my fingers that they would be

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.570 
crossing my fingers that they would be
able<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.440> implement<00:04:43.710> something<00:04:44.070> like<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:44.370> on

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
able to implement something like this on

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.520 
able to implement something like this on
the<00:04:44.729> CTE<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.780> we<00:04:45.870> could<00:04:45.990> at<00:04:46.080> least<00:04:46.290> test

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
the CTE so that we could at least test

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.050 
the CTE so that we could at least test
it<00:04:46.710> out<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:46.979> see<00:04:47.310> if<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.639> is<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.880> right

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
it out and see if it is the right

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.390 
it out and see if it is the right
direction<00:04:48.449> that's<00:04:49.110> these<00:04:49.620> night<00:04:49.919> maps<00:04:50.190> should

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
direction that's these night maps should

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.909 
direction that's these night maps should
be<00:04:50.520> heading<00:04:50.820> down<00:04:51.060> some<00:04:52.020> other<00:04:52.199> amazing<00:04:52.470> news

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
be heading down some other amazing news

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.370 
be heading down some other amazing news
is<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.280> dice<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.790> once<00:04:53.970> again<00:04:54.120> making<00:04:54.870> even

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
is that dice is once again making even

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.820 
is that dice is once again making even
more<00:04:55.639> improvements<00:04:56.639> to<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.330> netcode

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
more improvements to the netcode

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.810 
more improvements to the netcode
essentially<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:58.950> way<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.070> works<00:04:59.400> is<00:04:59.639> that

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
essentially the way it works is that

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.300 
essentially the way it works is that
before<00:05:00.150> this<00:05:00.270> big<00:05:00.479> update<00:05:00.900> your<00:05:01.470> computer<00:05:02.070> was

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
before this big update your computer was

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.760 
before this big update your computer was
sending<00:05:02.639> 30<00:05:03.060> Hertz<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.479> information<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.380> the

sending 30 Hertz of information to the
server<00:05:05.070> it's<00:05:05.340> been<00:05:05.490> like<00:05:05.639> that<00:05:05.760> for<00:05:05.940> quite

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
server it's been like that for quite

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.940 
server it's been like that for quite
some<00:05:06.300> time<00:05:06.330> but<00:05:07.050> now<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.320> way<00:05:07.680> it's<00:05:07.860> gonna

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
some time but now the way it's gonna

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.710 
some time but now the way it's gonna
work<00:05:08.040> is<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.550> if<00:05:08.700> your<00:05:08.850> computer<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.690> running

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
work is that if your computer is running

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.350 
work is that if your computer is running

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
a battlefield 4 at 30 frames per seconds

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.300 
a battlefield 4 at 30 frames per seconds
then<00:05:12.690> you're<00:05:12.870> going<00:05:13.169> to<00:05:13.290> send<00:05:13.500> 30<00:05:13.950> Hertz<00:05:14.160> of

then you're going to send 30 Hertz of

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.280 
then you're going to send 30 Hertz of
information<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.120> server<00:05:15.389> if<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:16.050> bump<00:05:16.200> it

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
information to the server if you bump it

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.290 
information to the server if you bump it
up<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.500> 60<00:05:16.830> frames<00:05:17.070> per<00:05:17.280> second<00:05:17.789> then<00:05:18.180> it's

up to 60 frames per second then it's

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.750 
up to 60 frames per second then it's

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
gonna be 60 Hertz if you played 120 it's

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.000 
gonna be 60 Hertz if you played 120 it's
gonna<00:05:21.000> send<00:05:21.180> 120<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.200> hope<00:05:22.380> hopefully<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:22.860> guys

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
gonna send 120 I hope hopefully you guys

gonna send 120 I hope hopefully you guys
get<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.400> picture<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:24.000> doesn't<00:05:24.750> change<00:05:24.930> how

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
get the picture it doesn't change how

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.870 
get the picture it doesn't change how
quickly<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.830> server<00:05:26.190> is<00:05:26.520> going<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.760> be

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
quickly the server is going to be

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.129 
quickly the server is going to be
submitting<00:05:27.270> information<00:05:27.389> though<00:05:27.900> that's

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
submitting information though that's

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.890 
submitting information though that's
that's<00:05:28.530> locked<00:05:28.889> right<00:05:29.100> now<00:05:29.310> at<00:05:29.610> 30<00:05:30.210> Hertz<00:05:30.660> so

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
that's locked right now at 30 Hertz so

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.420 
that's locked right now at 30 Hertz so
that<00:05:31.080> that's<00:05:31.350> not<00:05:31.560> changing<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.250> probably

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
that that's not changing and it probably

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.580 
that that's not changing and it probably
won't<00:05:32.610> change<00:05:32.729> for<00:05:33.090> quite<00:05:33.270> some<00:05:33.510> time<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:34.110> so

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
won't change for quite some time and so

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.020 
won't change for quite some time and so
initially<00:05:34.830> when<00:05:35.220> I<00:05:35.250> read<00:05:35.400> these<00:05:35.520> patch<00:05:35.729> notes

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
initially when I read these patch notes

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.670 
initially when I read these patch notes
I<00:05:36.270> didn't<00:05:36.840> think<00:05:36.900> it<00:05:37.050> was<00:05:37.139> really<00:05:37.350> gonna<00:05:37.440> have

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
I didn't think it was really gonna have

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.590 
I didn't think it was really gonna have
that<00:05:37.919> much<00:05:38.130> of<00:05:38.280> impact<00:05:38.669> on<00:05:38.880> at<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.210> netcode

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
that much of impact on at the netcode

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.450 
that much of impact on at the netcode
great<00:05:40.229> I'm<00:05:40.440> sending<00:05:40.740> more<00:05:40.830> information<00:05:41.340> to

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
great I'm sending more information to

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.460 
great I'm sending more information to
the<00:05:41.550> server<00:05:41.789> but<00:05:42.389> if<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.660> server<00:05:42.900> isn't<00:05:43.139> able

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
the server but if the server isn't able

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.529 
the server but if the server isn't able
to<00:05:43.560> send<00:05:43.800> more<00:05:44.130> back<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.669> me<00:05:44.789> then<00:05:45.090> how<00:05:45.240> is<00:05:45.419> that

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
to send more back to me then how is that

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.089 
to send more back to me then how is that
going<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:45.780> have<00:05:45.900> any<00:05:46.169> noticeable<00:05:46.620> difference

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
going to have any noticeable difference

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.370 
going to have any noticeable difference
and<00:05:47.310> improve<00:05:47.700> the<00:05:48.510> experience<00:05:49.020> on<00:05:49.169> the
