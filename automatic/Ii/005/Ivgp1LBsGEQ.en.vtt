00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.000 

hello<00:00:00.659> everyone<00:00:01.079> and<00:00:01.380> welcome<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.800> this

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hello everyone and welcome to this

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.530 
hello everyone and welcome to this
week's<00:00:02.250> video<00:00:02.429> today<00:00:03.179> I'm<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.449> be

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
week's video today I'm going to be

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.730 
week's video today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:03.750> about<00:00:03.959> how<00:00:04.290> you<00:00:04.319> can<00:00:04.560> increase

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
talking about how you can increase

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.070 
talking about how you can increase
horsepower<00:00:05.460> through<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> more<00:00:06.629> efficient

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
horsepower through a more efficient

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.830 
horsepower through a more efficient
better<00:00:07.770> designed<00:00:08.250> exhaust<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.360> basically<00:00:09.660> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
better designed exhaust so basically the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.480 
better designed exhaust so basically the
engineering<00:00:10.440> thought<00:00:10.740> process<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.280> goes

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
engineering thought process that goes

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.640 
engineering thought process that goes
into<00:00:11.820> designing<00:00:12.059> an<00:00:12.480> exhaust<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.110> how

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
into designing an exhaust and how

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.640 
into designing an exhaust and how
possibly<00:00:14.340> switching<00:00:14.790> out<00:00:14.940> your<00:00:15.020> exhaust<00:00:16.020> for

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
possibly switching out your exhaust for

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.200 
possibly switching out your exhaust for
a<00:00:16.710> different<00:00:17.010> one<00:00:17.130> could<00:00:17.730> increase<00:00:18.029> your

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
a different one could increase your

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.380 
a different one could increase your
horsepower<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> there's<00:00:20.699> really<00:00:21.000> three

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
horsepower so there's really three

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.640 
horsepower so there's really three
things<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.960> I'm<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> talk<00:00:22.470> about

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
things that I'm going to talk about

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.849 
things that I'm going to talk about
first<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.910> being<00:00:24.210> removing<00:00:24.630> restrictions<00:00:24.859> so

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
first up being removing restrictions so

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.009 
first up being removing restrictions so
in<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.130> typical<00:00:26.250> exhaust<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.750> may<00:00:27.840> have

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
in a typical exhaust you may have

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.870 
in a typical exhaust you may have
something<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.529> catalytic<00:00:29.039> converter<00:00:29.160> or

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
something like a catalytic converter or

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.179 
something like a catalytic converter or
you'll<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.420> some<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:30.929> kinks<00:00:31.830> where<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you'll have some little kinks where it

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.459 
you'll have some little kinks where it
tapers<00:00:32.610> down<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.630> exhaust<00:00:33.870> gets<00:00:34.170> smaller

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
tapers down on the exhaust gets smaller

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.889 
tapers down on the exhaust gets smaller
or<00:00:34.800> you'll<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> pretty<00:00:36.000> narrow

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
or you'll just have a pretty narrow

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.910 
or you'll just have a pretty narrow
exhaust<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.629> happens<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.469> your

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
exhaust so what happens is when your

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.190 
exhaust so what happens is when your
piston<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.489> pushing<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> you've<00:00:43.020> got

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
piston is pushing up and you've got

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.750 
piston is pushing up and you've got
something<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.920> catalytic<00:00:44.399> converter

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
something like this catalytic converter

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.569 
something like this catalytic converter
or<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.420> kink<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:45.960> something<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.590> you're

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
or a kink or something like that you're

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.310 
or a kink or something like that you're
going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.760> build<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.120> pressure<00:00:48.390> before<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
going to build up pressure before it and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.810 
going to build up pressure before it and
that<00:00:49.710> built<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.070> pressure<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that built up pressure is going to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.729 
that built up pressure is going to
travel<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> way<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.260> cylinder

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
travel all the way back to your cylinder

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.189 
travel all the way back to your cylinder
so<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.489> cylinder<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:53.969> pressing<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
so as your cylinder is pressing up the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
so as your cylinder is pressing up the
only<00:00:55.469> time<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.010> push<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:56.969> exhaust<00:00:57.390> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
only time it can push out exhaust is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.360 
only time it can push out exhaust is
when<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.260> pressure<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.129> greater

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
when the the pressure in here is greater

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.610 
when the the pressure in here is greater
than<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> pressure<00:00:59.730> out<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.379> once

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
than the pressure out here and so once

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
than the pressure out here and so once
that<00:01:01.680> occurs<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.460> push<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:02.969> but

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that occurs then it can push it out but

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.729 
that occurs then it can push it out but
basically<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> minimize<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
basically you want to minimize the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
basically you want to minimize the
pressure<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.600> easy<00:01:06.780> as

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
pressure in here so that it's as easy as

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.039 
pressure in here so that it's as easy as
possible<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.619> push<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.100> those<00:01:08.280> gasses<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
possible to push out those gasses and so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.510 
possible to push out those gasses and so
with<00:01:10.470> something<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.340> narrow

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
with something like a really narrow

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.100 
with something like a really narrow
exhaust<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.420> might<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.869> able<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
exhaust you just might not be able to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.149 
exhaust you just might not be able to
pump<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.740> much

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
pump out very much

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.429 
pump out very much
I<00:01:14.189> mean<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.479> straw

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
I mean think if you just have a straw

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.960 
I mean think if you just have a straw
connected<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.100> exhaust<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.729> has<00:01:17.820> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
connected to your exhaust and it has to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.429 
connected to your exhaust and it has to
pump<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.360> ton<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.720> air<00:01:18.900> through<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.140> tiny

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
pump a ton of air through that tiny

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.140 
pump a ton of air through that tiny
little<00:01:19.560> straw<00:01:19.979> well<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> be

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
little straw well it's not going to be

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.940 
little straw well it's not going to be
able<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.689> there's<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> ton

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
able to do it there's going to be a ton

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.580 
able to do it there's going to be a ton
of<00:01:22.979> back<00:01:23.189> pressure<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.240> by<00:01:24.930> removing<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
of back pressure and so by removing that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
of back pressure and so by removing that
back<00:01:25.799> pressure<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.880> are<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:27.330> allowing<00:01:27.840> your

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
back pressure you are then allowing your

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.130 
back pressure you are then allowing your
car<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:29.299> it's<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.540> more<00:01:30.750> efficient

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
car to it's going to be more efficient

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.149 
car to it's going to be more efficient
and<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.470> gonna<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.829> horsepower

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and it's gonna have more horsepower

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.190 
and it's gonna have more horsepower
because<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.030> doesn't<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> work<00:01:33.659> against

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
because it doesn't have to work against

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.469 
because it doesn't have to work against
itself<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.310> rid<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.240> burnt

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
itself just to get rid of the burnt

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.190 
itself just to get rid of the burnt
burnt<00:01:36.960> gases<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.540> thing<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.990> can

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
burnt gases so that's one thing you can

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.060 
burnt gases so that's one thing you can
do<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.590> basically<00:01:41.159> eliminate<00:01:43.070> restrictions

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
do is basically eliminate restrictions

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.730 
do is basically eliminate restrictions
or<00:01:44.340> simply<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> larger<00:01:45.720> exhaust<00:01:46.049> so

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
or simply have a larger exhaust so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.350 
or simply have a larger exhaust so
you're<00:01:46.860> thinking<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.340> okay<00:01:47.640> well<00:01:47.820> why

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you're thinking now okay well why

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.300 
you're thinking now okay well why
haven't<00:01:48.689> exhausted<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.439> or<00:01:49.770> why<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:49.950> just

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
haven't exhausted all or why not just

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.840 
haven't exhausted all or why not just
put<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> massive<00:01:51.320> six-inch<00:01:52.320> pipe<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.670> whole

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
put a massive six-inch pipe the whole

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120 
put a massive six-inch pipe the whole
way<00:01:54.030> from<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.079> exhaust<00:01:55.380> well<00:01:55.860> there

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
way from from your exhaust well there

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.859 
way from from your exhaust well there
actually<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:56.969> reasons<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
actually is some reasons that you

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.630 
actually is some reasons that you
wouldn't<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.740> part<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
wouldn't want to do that and part of

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.510 
wouldn't want to do that and part of
that<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.909> exhaust<00:02:00.270> scavenging<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> with

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
that is exhaust scavenging so with

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.389 
that is exhaust scavenging so with
exhaust<00:02:02.850> scavenging<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.540> happens<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
exhaust scavenging what happens is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.830 
exhaust scavenging what happens is
you're<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.729> exhaust<00:02:06.149> gases<00:02:06.600> pump

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you're going to have exhaust gases pump

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.149 
you're going to have exhaust gases pump
out

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
out

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.359 
out
car<00:02:07.429> impulses<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.479> once<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.440> piston<00:02:09.830> slams<00:02:10.129> up

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
car impulses so once the piston slams up

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.160 
car impulses so once the piston slams up
its<00:02:10.640> going<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:10.910> send<00:02:11.150> out<00:02:11.269> this<00:02:11.420> pulse<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.959> air

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
its going to send out this pulse of air

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.800 
its going to send out this pulse of air
basically<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.459> pulse<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.970> air<00:02:14.239> since

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
basically and that pulse of air since

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.300 
basically and that pulse of air since
it's<00:02:14.959> travelling<00:02:15.290> very<00:02:15.440> quickly<00:02:15.680> at<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
it's travelling very quickly at the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.619 
it's travelling very quickly at the
front<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:16.940> basically<00:02:17.090> going<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.510> have

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
front of it it's basically going to have

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.990 
front of it it's basically going to have
a<00:02:17.690> high<00:02:17.840> pressure<00:02:18.110> area<00:02:18.470> not<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.220> medium

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
a high pressure area not a medium

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.670 
a high pressure area not a medium
pressure<00:02:20.239> area<00:02:20.629> not<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.110> low<00:02:21.260> pressure<00:02:21.530> area

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
pressure area not a low pressure area

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.250 
pressure area not a low pressure area
and<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.489> low-pressure<00:02:22.970> area<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.780> basically

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and that low-pressure area is basically

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.500 
and that low-pressure area is basically
acting<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.890> vacuum<00:02:25.160> helping<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> pull<00:02:26.330> out

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
acting like a vacuum helping to pull out

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.559 
acting like a vacuum helping to pull out
all<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.440> gases<00:02:27.680> from<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.879> exhaust<00:02:29.269> and

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
all of the gases from the exhaust and

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.150 
all of the gases from the exhaust and
that's<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.080> good<00:02:30.230> thing<00:02:30.470> that's<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.920> want

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
that's a good thing that's what you want

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.020 
that's a good thing that's what you want
so<00:02:32.060> with<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.330> narrower<00:02:32.780> pipe<00:02:33.200> your<00:02:33.860> pulses<00:02:34.730> are

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
so with a narrower pipe your pulses are

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.699 
so with a narrower pipe your pulses are
going<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.269> have<00:02:35.480> much<00:02:35.690> higher<00:02:35.900> velocity<00:02:36.080> and

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
going to have much higher velocity and

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.020 
going to have much higher velocity and
so<00:02:37.069> there's<00:02:37.220> going<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.400> be<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.549> greater

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
so there's going to be a greater

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.729 
so there's going to be a greater
pressure<00:02:38.330> differential<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.260> you're<00:02:39.620> going

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
pressure differential and you're going

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.530 
pressure differential and you're going
to<00:02:39.799> create<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.250> low-pressure<00:02:40.670> area<00:02:41.120> behind<00:02:41.299> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
to create a low-pressure area behind the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.190 
to create a low-pressure area behind the
exhaust<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.650> kind<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.040> draw<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:43.810> those<00:02:44.810> fumes

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
exhaust and kind of draw out those fumes

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.050 
exhaust and kind of draw out those fumes
those<00:02:45.530> gases<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:47.060> when<00:02:47.599> you've<00:02:47.720> got<00:02:47.750> multiple

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
those gases so when you've got multiple

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.059 
those gases so when you've got multiple
cylinders<00:02:50.060> channeling<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.200> one<00:02:51.440> central

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
cylinders channeling to one central

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.369 
cylinders channeling to one central
exhaust<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:53.090> basically<00:02:53.569> got<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> low<00:02:54.019> low

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
exhaust and you basically got a low low

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.530 
exhaust and you basically got a low low
pressure<00:02:54.739> whenever<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:55.849> exhaust<00:02:56.329> valve

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
pressure whenever that exhaust valve

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.869 
pressure whenever that exhaust valve
opens<00:02:56.959> it's<00:02:57.230> very<00:02:57.590> easy<00:02:57.860> for<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.280> gases<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.760> go

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
opens it's very easy for the gases to go

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.210 
opens it's very easy for the gases to go
out<00:02:59.030> very<00:02:59.299> quickly<00:02:59.599> and<00:02:59.900> that's<00:03:00.230> ideal<00:03:00.680> so

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
out very quickly and that's ideal so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.199 
out very quickly and that's ideal so
basically<00:03:01.549> you're<00:03:01.760> going<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:01.940> have<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.120> be

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
basically you're going to have to be

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.470 
basically you're going to have to be
balancing<00:03:02.750> restrictions<00:03:03.489> versus<00:03:04.489> how<00:03:05.180> narrow

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
balancing restrictions versus how narrow

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.970 
balancing restrictions versus how narrow
you<00:03:05.599> want<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:05.930> because<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.290> want<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.829> want

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
you want it because you want you want

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.569 
you want it because you want you want
high<00:03:07.160> velocity<00:03:07.790> no<00:03:08.450> restriction<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.890> it's

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
high velocity no restriction so it's

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.729 
high velocity no restriction so it's
kind<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.849> a<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.450> got<00:03:11.599> to<00:03:11.690> balance<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.139> out<00:03:12.200> to

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
kind of a you got to balance that out to

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.940 
kind of a you got to balance that out to
optimize<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:13.760> get<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.269> most<00:03:14.420> horsepower

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
optimize it get the most horsepower

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.470 
optimize it get the most horsepower
another<00:03:15.950> good<00:03:16.130> thing<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.400> can<00:03:16.579> do<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:17.120> lot

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
another good thing you can do with a lot

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.650 
another good thing you can do with a lot
of<00:03:17.510> exhaust<00:03:18.019> aftermarket<00:03:18.889> kits<00:03:19.209> many<00:03:20.209> times

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
of exhaust aftermarket kits many times

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.000 
of exhaust aftermarket kits many times
you<00:03:20.870> can<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.319> actually<00:03:21.410> reduce<00:03:21.709> some

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
you can you can actually reduce some

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.220 
you can you can actually reduce some
weight<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:22.430> that's<00:03:22.579> a<00:03:22.790> great<00:03:23.239> thing<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.569> do<00:03:23.720> to

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
weight so that's a great thing to do to

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.370 
weight so that's a great thing to do to
further<00:03:24.410> increase<00:03:24.859> how<00:03:25.280> fast<00:03:25.579> you<00:03:25.730> accelerate

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
further increase how fast you accelerate

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.569 
further increase how fast you accelerate
the<00:03:27.380> final<00:03:27.680> thing<00:03:27.829> I<00:03:27.889> want<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.099> talk<00:03:28.220> about<00:03:28.340> is

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
the final thing I want to talk about is

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.809 
the final thing I want to talk about is
anti<00:03:29.000> reversion<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.139> reversion<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.220> when<00:03:31.669> you

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
anti reversion so reversion is when you

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.360 
anti reversion so reversion is when you
have<00:03:31.970> gases<00:03:32.630> in<00:03:32.780> your<00:03:32.900> engine<00:03:33.260> flowing<00:03:34.250> the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
have gases in your engine flowing the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.460 
have gases in your engine flowing the
wrong<00:03:34.579> direction<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.720> you've<00:03:35.930> got<00:03:36.109> exhaust

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
wrong direction so you've got exhaust

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.620 
wrong direction so you've got exhaust
gases<00:03:36.919> flowing<00:03:37.190> back<00:03:37.489> into<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.819> piston<00:03:38.120> or

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
gases flowing back into the piston or

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.949 
gases flowing back into the piston or
you've<00:03:39.079> got<00:03:39.290> your<00:03:39.859> exhaust<00:03:40.160> gases<00:03:40.639> flowing<00:03:41.299> up

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
you've got your exhaust gases flowing up

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.809 
you've got your exhaust gases flowing up
into<00:03:42.169> the<00:03:42.440> intake<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:43.220> don't<00:03:43.400> want<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:43.639> to

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
into the intake you don't want that to

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.879 
into the intake you don't want that to
happen<00:03:43.940> obviously<00:03:44.569> you're<00:03:45.230> just<00:03:45.410> wasting

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
happen obviously you're just wasting

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.409 
happen obviously you're just wasting
power<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.780> what<00:03:49.000> what<00:03:50.000> happens<00:03:50.299> with

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
power and so what what happens with

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.420 
power and so what what happens with
reversion<00:03:50.930> Rabab<00:03:51.200> for<00:03:51.440> example<00:03:51.829> say<00:03:52.250> you've

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
reversion Rabab for example say you've

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.699 
reversion Rabab for example say you've
got<00:03:52.639> this<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.359> your<00:03:53.540> exhaust<00:03:54.049> stroke<00:03:54.349> and<00:03:54.620> you

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
got this is your exhaust stroke and you

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.009 
got this is your exhaust stroke and you
want<00:03:54.889> to<00:03:54.980> pump<00:03:55.160> out<00:03:55.340> all<00:03:55.489> these<00:03:55.609> gases<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.750> your

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
want to pump out all these gases so your

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.800 
want to pump out all these gases so your
piston<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.470> going<00:03:57.769> up<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.250> as<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.120> starts<00:03:59.630> to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
piston is going up and as it starts to

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.229 
piston is going up and as it starts to
come<00:03:59.989> down<00:04:00.319> you<00:04:00.709> open<00:04:01.160> up<00:04:01.370> your<00:04:01.519> intake<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.060> you

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
come down you open up your intake so you

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.690 
come down you open up your intake so you
can<00:04:02.389> pull<00:04:02.690> in<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.889> fresh<00:04:04.220> air<00:04:04.459> &amp;<00:04:04.639> fuel

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
can pull in that fresh air &amp; fuel

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.330 
can pull in that fresh air &amp; fuel
mixture<00:04:05.019> well<00:04:06.019> if<00:04:06.260> your<00:04:06.530> pressure<00:04:06.799> inside<00:04:07.190> of

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
mixture well if your pressure inside of

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.309 
mixture well if your pressure inside of
your<00:04:07.459> piston<00:04:07.970> inside<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.660> your<00:04:08.750> cylinder<00:04:09.139> is

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
your piston inside of your cylinder is

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.930 
your piston inside of your cylinder is
greater<00:04:09.620> than<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.250> pressure<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.669> the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
greater than the pressure of the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.910 
greater than the pressure of the
take<00:04:11.150> then<00:04:11.840> you're<00:04:12.200> going<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.410> force<00:04:12.710> that

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
take then you're going to force that

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.650 
take then you're going to force that
exhaust<00:04:13.400> guess<00:04:13.700> it's<00:04:13.940> still<00:04:14.180> kind<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.450> left

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
exhaust guess it's still kind of left

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.780 
exhaust guess it's still kind of left
over<00:04:15.020> back<00:04:15.530> up<00:04:15.740> into<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.100> intake<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.700> you

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
over back up into the intake and you

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.300 
over back up into the intake and you
don't<00:04:16.970> want<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.360> happen<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:19.340> so

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
don't want that to happen and so

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.560 
don't want that to happen and so
basically<00:04:22.310> what<00:04:22.520> happens<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:23.030> once<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.450> get

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
basically what happens is once you get

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.790 
basically what happens is once you get
to<00:04:23.720> your<00:04:23.780> index<00:04:24.110> stroke<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.530> you're<00:04:24.590> pulling

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
to your index stroke and you're pulling

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.350 
to your index stroke and you're pulling
in<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.430> have<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.700> wait<00:04:25.850> for<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.120> pressure

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
in you have to wait for the pressure

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.170 
in you have to wait for the pressure
inside<00:04:26.660> of<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.110> piston<00:04:27.620> cylinder<00:04:28.190> inside<00:04:29.060> of

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
inside of the piston cylinder inside of

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.410 
inside of the piston cylinder inside of
the<00:04:29.270> cylinder<00:04:29.630> here<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.650> be<00:04:31.100> less<00:04:31.340> than<00:04:31.730> the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
the cylinder here to be less than the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.510 
the cylinder here to be less than the
pressure<00:04:32.690> inside<00:04:33.050> of<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.410> intake<00:04:33.800> so<00:04:34.250> that<00:04:34.430> it

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
pressure inside of the intake so that it

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.820 
pressure inside of the intake so that it
draws<00:04:34.790> in<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.270> air<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.840> that's<00:04:36.380> pretty<00:04:36.680> much

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
draws in that air and that's pretty much

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.650 
draws in that air and that's pretty much
how<00:04:37.010> it<00:04:37.040> works<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.520> mean<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.790> pressure<00:04:38.240> here<00:04:38.600> is

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
how it works I mean the pressure here is

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.270 
how it works I mean the pressure here is
typically<00:04:38.900> going<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.200> be<00:04:39.260> lower<00:04:39.530> but<00:04:40.070> it

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
typically going to be lower but it

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.920 
typically going to be lower but it
points<00:04:40.730> like<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:41.030> when<00:04:41.330> it's<00:04:41.600> right<00:04:41.810> at<00:04:41.900> the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
points like this when it's right at the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.660 
points like this when it's right at the
top<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.320> coming<00:04:42.560> down<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.370> intakes

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
top and coming down and the intakes

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.970 
top and coming down and the intakes
opens<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.540> could<00:04:44.930> have<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.470> little<00:04:45.620> bit<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.830> a

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
opens it could have a little bit of a

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.190 
opens it could have a little bit of a
reverse<00:04:46.250> if<00:04:47.000> both<00:04:47.240> valves<00:04:47.510> are<00:04:47.660> still<00:04:47.930> open

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
reverse if both valves are still open

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.230 
reverse if both valves are still open
and<00:04:48.320> you've<00:04:48.440> got<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.800> little<00:04:49.700> bit<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.880> overlap

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
and you've got a little bit of overlap

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.570 
and you've got a little bit of overlap
between<00:04:50.420> your<00:04:50.930> intake<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:51.500> exhaust<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:52.550> a

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
between your intake and exhaust so a

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.390 
between your intake and exhaust so a
couple<00:04:52.910> things<00:04:53.030> that<00:04:53.630> engineers<00:04:54.050> do<00:04:54.620> in<00:04:54.860> order

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
couple things that engineers do in order

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.880 
couple things that engineers do in order
to<00:04:55.490> minimize<00:04:55.610> things<00:04:56.150> like<00:04:56.330> this<00:04:56.650> one<00:04:57.650> for

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
to minimize things like this one for

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.070 
to minimize things like this one for
example<00:04:58.690> you're<00:04:59.690> going<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.870> have<00:04:59.960> these

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
example you're going to have these

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.450 
example you're going to have these
tapers<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.860> you're<00:05:00.950> going<00:05:01.100> to<00:05:01.160> put<00:05:01.310> into

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
tapers that you're going to put into

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.090 
tapers that you're going to put into
your<00:05:01.670> intake<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.450> your<00:05:02.600> exhaust<00:05:02.960> so<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:03.620> the

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
your intake and your exhaust so that the

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.160 
your intake and your exhaust so that the
flow<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:05.120> reverse<00:05:05.450> direction<00:05:05.720> is

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
flow and the reverse direction is

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.380 
flow and the reverse direction is
restricted<00:05:06.770> it's<00:05:07.190> easy<00:05:07.490> for<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.790> flow<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.120> go

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
restricted it's easy for a flow to go

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.500 
restricted it's easy for a flow to go
from<00:05:08.600> this<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:09.380> this<00:05:09.620> it<00:05:10.490> doesn't<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:11.030> doesn't

restriction<00:05:14.660> it's<00:05:14.780> not<00:05:14.930> going<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.169> build<00:05:15.380> up

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
restriction it's not going to build up

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.290 
restriction it's not going to build up
pressure<00:05:15.650> on<00:05:15.980> this<00:05:16.130> side<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.610> can<00:05:17.060> flow

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
pressure on this side it can flow

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.909 
pressure on this side it can flow
through<00:05:17.330> it<00:05:18.020> may<00:05:18.260> lose<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.470> little<00:05:18.650> bit<00:05:18.770> of

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
through it may lose a little bit of

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.140 
through it may lose a little bit of
velocity<00:05:19.340> but<00:05:19.460> it's<00:05:19.610> not<00:05:19.700> going<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:19.850> build<00:05:20.030> up

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
velocity but it's not going to build up

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.050 
velocity but it's not going to build up
pressure<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:21.740> same<00:05:21.980> thing<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.520> obviously

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
pressure so same thing and obviously

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.310 
pressure so same thing and obviously
these<00:05:23.210> are<00:05:23.390> exaggerated<00:05:23.990> you're<00:05:24.110> not<00:05:24.200> going

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
these are exaggerated you're not going

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.420 
these are exaggerated you're not going
to<00:05:24.380> have<00:05:24.470> something<00:05:24.650> with<00:05:24.890> that<00:05:25.010> big<00:05:25.250> of<00:05:25.370> a

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
to have something with that big of a

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.120 
to have something with that big of a
taper<00:05:25.669> but<00:05:26.180> that's<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.540> point<00:05:26.780> is<00:05:26.960> if<00:05:27.680> gases

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
taper but that's the point is if gases

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.100 
taper but that's the point is if gases
were<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.400> try<00:05:28.700> to<00:05:28.760> go<00:05:28.880> in<00:05:29.000> reverse<00:05:29.120> it's<00:05:29.810> just

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
were to try to go in reverse it's just

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.480 
were to try to go in reverse it's just
like<00:05:30.260> here<00:05:30.680> where<00:05:31.040> they're<00:05:31.190> going<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.370> build

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
like here where they're going to build

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.580 
like here where they're going to build
up<00:05:31.700> pressure<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.360> it's<00:05:32.870> it's<00:05:33.110> going<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.530> be

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
up pressure and it's it's going to be

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.650 
up pressure and it's it's going to be
difficult<00:05:33.890> to<00:05:34.340> pump<00:05:34.760> it<00:05:34.880> in<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.480> direction

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
difficult to pump it in that direction

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.710 
difficult to pump it in that direction
more<00:05:36.080> difficult<00:05:36.500> than<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.740> other<00:05:36.860> direction

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
more difficult than the other direction

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.000 
more difficult than the other direction
another<00:05:38.720> thing<00:05:38.960> you<00:05:39.050> can<00:05:39.200> do<00:05:39.350> for<00:05:39.560> example<00:05:39.919> if

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
another thing you can do for example if

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.440 
another thing you can do for example if
you've<00:05:40.310> got<00:05:40.490> somewhere<00:05:40.850> in<00:05:41.000> your<00:05:41.150> exhaust

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
you've got somewhere in your exhaust

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.659 
you've got somewhere in your exhaust
pipe<00:05:41.570> where<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:42.590> might<00:05:42.770> have<00:05:42.800> some<00:05:43.010> reversion

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
pipe where you might have some reversion

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.300 
pipe where you might have some reversion
is<00:05:43.820> these<00:05:44.630> little<00:05:44.800> reversion<00:05:45.800> restrictions

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
is these little reversion restrictions

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.280 
is these little reversion restrictions
here<00:05:46.640> so<00:05:47.090> you've<00:05:47.210> got<00:05:47.390> your<00:05:47.480> exhaust<00:05:47.780> pipe<00:05:48.050> and

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
here so you've got your exhaust pipe and

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.380 
here so you've got your exhaust pipe and
if<00:05:49.070> everything<00:05:49.490> is<00:05:49.520> going<00:05:49.820> as<00:05:49.940> normal<00:05:50.270> your

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
if everything is going as normal your

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.240 
if everything is going as normal your
flow<00:05:50.600> just<00:05:50.900> keeps<00:05:51.080> going<00:05:51.410> in<00:05:51.620> this<00:05:52.010> direction

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
flow just keeps going in this direction

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.090 
flow just keeps going in this direction
and<00:05:52.730> it's<00:05:52.910> nice<00:05:53.390> and<00:05:53.419> smooth<00:05:53.960> and<00:05:54.230> works<00:05:54.890> out

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
and it's nice and smooth and works out

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.920 
and it's nice and smooth and works out
great<00:05:55.280> well<00:05:56.120> if<00:05:56.330> it<00:05:56.450> goes<00:05:56.570> in<00:05:56.720> the<00:05:56.810> reverse

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
great well if it goes in the reverse

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.980 
great well if it goes in the reverse
direction<00:05:57.140> if<00:05:57.650> you<00:05:57.680> have<00:05:57.919> some<00:05:58.669> flow<00:05:58.990> back

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
direction if you have some flow back

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.990 
direction if you have some flow back
pressure<00:06:00.260> coming<00:06:00.710> back<00:06:00.890> well<00:06:01.580> it's<00:06:01.820> going<00:06:01.940> to

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
pressure coming back well it's going to

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.730 
pressure coming back well it's going to
hit<00:06:02.120> these<00:06:02.210> pockets<00:06:02.810> and<00:06:03.020> basically<00:06:03.590> it's

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
hit these pockets and basically it's

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.560 
hit these pockets and basically it's
going<00:06:03.770> to<00:06:03.919> be<00:06:03.980> more<00:06:04.100> stricted<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:04.880> it's<00:06:05.450> going

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
going to be more stricted and it's going

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.880 
going to be more stricted and it's going
to<00:06:05.630> have<00:06:05.750> a<00:06:05.810> tougher<00:06:06.080> time<00:06:06.110> going<00:06:06.710> in<00:06:06.830> the

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
to have a tougher time going in the

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.950 
to have a tougher time going in the
reverse<00:06:07.010> direction<00:06:07.160> so<00:06:08.060> that's<00:06:08.270> done<00:06:08.600> in

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
reverse direction so that's done in

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.800 
reverse direction so that's done in
order<00:06:09.500> to<00:06:09.650> prevent<00:06:10.370> reversion<00:06:11.000> which

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
order to prevent reversion which

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.200 
order to prevent reversion which
ultimately<00:06:12.020> causes<00:06:12.830> you<00:06:12.950> to<00:06:12.980> lose<00:06:13.070> power<00:06:13.550> so

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
ultimately causes you to lose power so

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.580 
ultimately causes you to lose power so
there's<00:06:14.390> things<00:06:14.510> like<00:06:14.660> anti<00:06:15.110> reversion

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
there's things like anti reversion

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.520 
there's things like anti reversion
headers<00:06:15.970> and<00:06:16.970> piping<00:06:17.810> and<00:06:17.960> stuff<00:06:18.169> like<00:06:18.290> that

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
headers and piping and stuff like that

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.590 
headers and piping and stuff like that
that<00:06:18.710> you<00:06:19.070> can<00:06:19.370> buy<00:06:19.550> so<00:06:20.150> that<00:06:20.300> that<00:06:20.419> doesn't

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
that you can buy so that that doesn't

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.190 
that you can buy so that that doesn't
happen

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
happen

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.560 
happen
and<00:06:21.710> that<00:06:22.280> can<00:06:22.490> give<00:06:22.730> you<00:06:22.880> an<00:06:23.060> increase<00:06:23.450> in

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
and that can give you an increase in

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.330 
and that can give you an increase in
horsepower<00:06:23.690> if<00:06:24.200> you're<00:06:24.530> having<00:06:24.680> our<00:06:24.980> version

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
horsepower if you're having our version

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.700 
horsepower if you're having our version
problem<00:06:25.810> so<00:06:26.810> those<00:06:26.960> are<00:06:27.110> just<00:06:27.170> several<00:06:27.560> ways

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
problem so those are just several ways

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.940 
problem so those are just several ways
that<00:06:27.740> a<00:06:28.670> better<00:06:29.420> exhaust<00:06:29.870> system<00:06:30.350> can<00:06:30.620> improve

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
that a better exhaust system can improve

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.130 
that a better exhaust system can improve
horsepower<00:06:31.520> increase<00:06:31.760> horsepower<00:06:32.090> and<00:06:32.600> thus

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
horsepower increase horsepower and thus

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.170 
horsepower increase horsepower and thus
give<00:06:33.530> you<00:06:33.650> better<00:06:33.890> acceleration<00:06:34.220> thanks<00:06:35.060> for

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180
