00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 Christian Fundamentalism: Fascinating. 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.000
 These people really believe that the world is 12 thousand years old. 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.500
 I swear to God. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 "Based on what?" I asked. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.450
 "Well, we consider all the people in the Bible 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.200
 and we have added the ages of everyone since Adam and Eve. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.300
 It was 12,000 years old. " 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.700
 Wow, what a scientific method! 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.200
 I did not know you guys had been so busy. That's nice. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.200
 So you believe the world is 12 thousand years old? 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.400
 "Yes" 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 "Okay, I have a question to ask. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
 A one-word question - are you ready? " 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.400
 "Dinosaurs" 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 If the world is 12,000 years old and the dinosaurs existed, 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.500
 and if they existed at that time, they would have been mentioned in the Bible at some point. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.600
 And Jesus and the disciples were walking to Nazareth. 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.000
 But the trail was blocked by a giant brontosaurus ... 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 With a thorn in his paw. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 And the disciples ran out, shouting, "What a giant lizard, Lord!" 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.100
 But Jesus was not afraid. 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.200
 And he removed the thorn from the brontosaurus' paw. And the giant lizard became his friend. 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.500
 And Jesus sent him to Scotland, where he lived on Loch Ness for many, many years, 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.000
 attracting thousands of American tourists and their fat families - and their dollar bills. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:45.000
 And the Scots thanked the Lord, "Thank You, Lord. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.100
 But I actually asked one of these guys: 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.000
 "OK, what about dinosaur fossils? How do they fit into your belief?" 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.500
 I'll sit and gag me here. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 He replies, "God put the fossils here to test our faith." 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.500
 Good thing I'm gagged, man. 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.000
 I think God put you here to test my faith, man. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Do you believe that?
