I'm<00:00:04.140> your<00:00:04.290> host<00:00:04.440> buddy<00:00:04.830> Blackford<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.580> today

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.760 
I'm your host buddy Blackford and today
we're<00:00:06.750> gonna<00:00:06.839> start<00:00:06.990> talking<00:00:07.379> about

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
we're gonna start talking about

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.759 
we're gonna start talking about
animation<00:00:08.280> presets<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.179> how<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.900> can<00:00:10.349> save

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
animation presets and how you can save

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.280 
animation presets and how you can save
them<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.309> create<00:00:11.940> your<00:00:12.120> own<00:00:12.179> presets<00:00:12.900> for<00:00:13.080> use

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
them and create your own presets for use

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.150 
them and create your own presets for use
so<00:00:14.190> what<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> preset<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.320> just<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.890> collection

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
so what a preset is is just a collection

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.660 
so what a preset is is just a collection
of<00:00:17.630> effects<00:00:18.630> or<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.350> could<00:00:19.500> even<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.830> masks<00:00:20.430> or

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
of effects or it could even be masks or

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.929 
of effects or it could even be masks or
anything<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.689> where<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.160> anything

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
anything like that where you anything

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.269 
anything like that where you anything
that<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.330> basically<00:00:24.510> copy<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.920> paste

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
that you can basically copy and paste

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.019 
that you can basically copy and paste
you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:26.970> save<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.510> as<00:00:27.630> an<00:00:27.900> animation<00:00:28.260> preset

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
you can save it as an animation preset

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.959 
you can save it as an animation preset
so<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.449> presets<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.740> generally<00:00:32.340> found<00:00:32.640> over

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
so the presets are generally found over

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
to save animation presets so I'm gonna

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
to save animation presets so I'm gonna
go<00:00:50.760> over<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.300> few<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> those<00:00:52.110> ways<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.829> can

transformation<00:01:37.229> property<00:01:38.030> differences<00:01:39.030> here

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
transformation property differences here

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.700 
transformation property differences here
so<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:39.900> talking<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.500> moving

so what I'm talking about just moving
these<00:01:40.979> properties<00:01:41.400> around<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.979> I've<00:01:43.979> got

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
these properties around so I've got

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.300 
these properties around so I've got
these<00:01:44.430> two<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.710> use<00:01:47.070> these

that<00:03:04.390> right<00:03:04.690> down<00:03:04.780> there<00:03:05.020> again<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.650> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
same exact preset that I had so there

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.090 
same exact preset that I had so there
are<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.980> few<00:03:09.250> other<00:03:09.459> ways<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.060> can<00:03:11.100> save

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
are a few other ways that you can save

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.850 
are a few other ways that you can save
presets<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.940> think<00:03:13.209> there's<00:03:13.360> four<00:03:13.420> ways<00:03:13.989> so

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
presets I think there's four ways so

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.630 
presets I think there's four ways so
I'll<00:03:15.430> go<00:03:15.580> over<00:03:15.610> each<00:03:15.940> one<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.150> those<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:18.040> we've

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
I'll go over each one of those so we've

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.660 
I'll go over each one of those so we've
got<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.530> page<00:03:20.530> button<00:03:20.920> right<00:03:21.130> here<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.400> we

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
got the page button right here that we

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.020 
got the page button right here that we
can<00:03:21.820> click<00:03:22.030> on<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.239> save<00:03:22.830> then<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.640> next<00:03:24.880> one

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
can click on to save then the next one

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.910 
can click on to save then the next one
we<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.360> use<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:26.550> going<00:03:27.550> up<00:03:27.820> here<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.920> animation

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
we can use is going up here to animation

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.500 
we can use is going up here to animation
save<00:03:30.900> animation<00:03:31.900> preset<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:34.000> then<00:03:34.030> it'll

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
