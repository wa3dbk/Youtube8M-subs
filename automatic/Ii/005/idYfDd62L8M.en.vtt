00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
on that couch now

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.330 
on that couch now
the<00:01:06.450> rug<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:09.330> too<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> cat

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the rug on the back is too so the cat

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
the rug on the back is too so the cat
can<00:01:11.369> sit<00:01:11.790> up<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.659> rugs<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> seed

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
can sit up there the rugs are the seed

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
can sit up there the rugs are the seed
so<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> dogs<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.030> sit<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.689> ah<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:17.250> did

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
so the dogs can sit up there ah I did

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.410 
so the dogs can sit up there ah I did
that<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.990> stronger<00:01:19.650> than<00:01:19.680> putting

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
that because it's stronger than putting

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.010 
that because it's stronger than putting
just<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:22.400> quilt<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.820> something<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> bottom

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
just a quilt or something on the bottom

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.310 
just a quilt or something on the bottom
and<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.500> understand<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.369> sell<00:01:26.720> donkey<00:01:27.720> covers

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and I understand they sell donkey covers

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.660 
and I understand they sell donkey covers
and<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:30.200> probably<00:01:31.200> maybe<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:32.070> look<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.640> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and I probably maybe will look but I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.319 
and I probably maybe will look but I
like<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.270> rug<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:34.430> like<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.150> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
like this rug I like to look and I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.880 
like this rug I like to look and I
figured<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.100> will<00:01:38.100> put<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:41.210> by<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.450> door<00:01:42.680> if<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
figured I will put it by my door if I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.920 
figured I will put it by my door if I
ever<00:01:44.100> decide<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.149> as<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> rug<00:01:46.460> but

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
ever decide to use it as a rug but

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.289 
ever decide to use it as a rug but
because<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> Mon<00:01:49.320> chews<00:01:49.649> everything<00:01:50.299> that's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
because the Mon chews everything that's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
because the Mon chews everything that's
probably<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> happen<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:53.340> the
