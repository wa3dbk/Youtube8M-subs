lot of people steered away from this I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.140 
lot of people steered away from this I
think<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:47.890> two<00:02:48.220> essential<00:02:48.670> basically

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
think that it is two essential basically

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150 
think that it is two essential basically
I<00:02:49.300> think<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.260> really<00:02:50.470> need<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.770> play<00:02:51.010> it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
I think that you really need to play it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.360 
I think that you really need to play it
