00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.230

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.439
 weekend so how was the 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.750
 lan 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.980
 today and yesterday well I hope so 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.360
 good atmosphere as usual but the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.739
 n 1 French we see we see the heads 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's really great but I was 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.010
 there as a commentator and players 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.540
 I was with friends and we got 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.340
 good laugh the woman of course we went 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 do we know purple we called them 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 fonts called the cops but but 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 it was cool not anyway by good 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.559
 atmosphere and I loved lalanne and so 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.809
 you have finished that she passes to the final a 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.579
 finished five sixths actually in losers 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.719
 bracket one lost against millennium is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.679
 pretty much looking at him from the tale 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.019
 blast and that's ok so right now the 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.579
 mode is lijn ground and so we 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.190
 wanted to know that was thinking about killing then 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.230
 how to react to this 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.090
 situation the penguins monster environments 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.440
 I think the f1 is boucounta 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.729
 receive either anticipates the care because 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.490
 that one voice over the six miners 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.280
 compared to the pic either try to do 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.660
 a triple die as soon as possible on 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 the player who is alone the only one 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.450
 author who is going to be all alone 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.770
 wrong for me the ideal is to kill him 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.240
 and after preventing him from coming back on the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.600
 turn and anti pex I think it's 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.800
 the best solution to mandali agree 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.370
 what are the points for you 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.240
 negative and positive of the season 3 months 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.560
 it's good to have removed 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.760
 oracles permanently huazhong hours because 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.930
 that my case europe 1 when the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.880
 young people were taking their acquired and well he 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.320
 its tech part than ever but to the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.640
 problem is that it's more + 2/5 of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 pv and I am more I prefer them 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.000
 damage I find that it's coolest is 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.170
 maybe some champions a little bit 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.240
 too fart jean rene guitton I find 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.890
 that too much ah well yes I necessarily 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.630
 plays but I think it's too strong 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.710
 for once and that it limits the hens 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.200
 of champions of kick everyone in 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 So what are you doing 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.470
 the champions for carrie solo ku 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.030
 for for people bah that's for sure 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.170
 team guide loaded story that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.340
 declare I put the champions by role 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.900
 after I find that the myth is the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.190
 more suited with the jungle but jungle 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.690
 any case really nerd it's inevitably 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.860
 my guys well we have reasons that make 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.630
 a lot of damage with a lot of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.800
 tasks the range was to kill all the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.010
 world in fact this is a tutu all the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.120
 world you have won 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.820
 so by the way you have a youtube channel 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.250
 with gerard and so what can we find 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.160

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.780
 tips from game analysis guides 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.150
 young alice d'agde m video guides 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.740
 on title champions a little 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.270
 little in league 1 story of well farting the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.710
 mouth to the guys in the face of fault will aim to 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.740
 defend yourself and so the goal is to 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.930
 give keys well shit and for good 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.060
 abused the game and for that guys who 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.500
 either be good media and here and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.880
 what do you think of this kind of ass for 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.320
 the image of history in France and 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.820
 how do you think he's going to evolve 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.340
 in time in the future cramming 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.690

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.640
 several to damon like that and more 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.360
 then he carries in France to advance 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.290
 and therefore beats for it to continue 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.850
