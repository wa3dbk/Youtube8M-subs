00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:05.939 
I'm going to show you how to prepare and

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.660 
I'm going to show you how to prepare and
cook<00:00:06.120> mussels<00:00:07.040> fortunately<00:00:08.040> for<00:00:08.219> most<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.580> us

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
cook mussels fortunately for most of us

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.400 
cook mussels fortunately for most of us
these<00:00:08.850> days<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.299> mussels<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.809> get<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.020> rope

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
these days the mussels you get a rope

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.650 
these days the mussels you get a rope
grown<00:00:10.830> their<00:00:11.190> farm<00:00:11.459> mussels<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.510> they're

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
grown their farm mussels and they're

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.230 
grown their farm mussels and they're
grown<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.139> ropes<00:00:13.949> under<00:00:14.459> the<00:00:14.580> water<00:00:14.820> and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
grown on ropes under the water and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.269 
grown on ropes under the water and
therefore<00:00:16.080> they<00:00:16.170> don't<00:00:16.379> get<00:00:16.590> encrusted<00:00:17.010> with

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
therefore they don't get encrusted with

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.250 
therefore they don't get encrusted with
barnacles<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.150> they<00:00:18.420> come<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.689> of<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.050> sea

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
barnacles and they come out of the sea

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.100 
barnacles and they come out of the sea
relatively<00:00:19.830> clean<00:00:20.240> this<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> typical<00:00:21.690> rope

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
relatively clean this is a typical rope

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.620 
relatively clean this is a typical rope
grown<00:00:22.380> muscle<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.550> doesn't<00:00:23.940> a<00:00:24.090> lot<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
grown muscle and it doesn't a lot of the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.410 
grown muscle and it doesn't a lot of the
time<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.530> the<00:00:26.070> thing<00:00:26.670> called<00:00:26.880> abysus

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
time have the the thing called abysus

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.840

muscle actually clings to the rope I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.549 
muscle actually clings to the rope I
think<00:00:33.000> when<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.210> pull<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> muscles<00:00:33.750> off<00:00:34.110> the

think when they pull the muscles off the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.889 
think when they pull the muscles off the
business<00:00:34.949> comes<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.430> too<00:00:35.789> but<00:00:36.359> if<00:00:36.569> you're

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
when I squeeze it in my thumb of my

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.289 
when I squeeze it in my thumb of my
finger<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.570> shows<00:01:15.869> signs<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.909> closing<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.030> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
finger it shows signs of closing up that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
finger it shows signs of closing up that
just<00:01:19.109> means<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.530> still<00:01:19.799> alive<00:01:20.039> there's<00:01:20.430> one

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
just means it's still alive there's one

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
just means it's still alive there's one
there<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.329> if<00:01:22.109> I<00:01:22.289> squeeze<00:01:22.649> it<00:01:22.859> like<00:01:23.039> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
there you see if I squeeze it like that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.349 
there you see if I squeeze it like that
it's<00:01:24.299> still<00:01:24.630> opening<00:01:25.109> but<00:01:25.289> you<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.649> it<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
it's still opening but you see it is

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.580 
it's still opening but you see it is
starting<00:01:27.359> to<00:01:27.600> close<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.229> means<00:01:28.439> it's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
starting to close and that means it's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.990 
starting to close and that means it's
still<00:01:28.680> alive<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.130> therefore<00:01:29.609> it<00:01:29.850> would<00:01:29.939> be

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
still alive and therefore it would be

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.510 
still alive and therefore it would be
perfectly<00:01:30.450> okay<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> eat<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.340> go<00:01:32.490> through

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
perfectly okay to eat so just go through

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
perfectly okay to eat so just go through
them<00:01:32.909> all<00:01:33.060> there's<00:01:33.299> another<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
them all there's another one if it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
them all there's another one if it
doesn't<00:01:34.979> stay<00:01:35.219> doesn't<00:01:36.119> show<00:01:36.450> signs<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
doesn't stay doesn't show signs of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.179 
doesn't stay doesn't show signs of
closing<00:01:37.859> up<00:01:37.979> I'll<00:01:38.399> throw<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.770> if<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189

them<00:03:36.650> off<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.920> heat<00:03:36.950> that's<00:03:37.730> all<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.330> takes

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
them off the heat that's all it takes

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.120 
them off the heat that's all it takes
you<00:03:38.840> leave<00:03:39.050> them<00:03:39.260> on<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.650> heat<00:03:39.860> for<00:03:39.890> any

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
you leave them on the heat for any

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.120 
you leave them on the heat for any
longer<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.760> they<00:03:40.910> just<00:03:41.090> start<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.510> overcook

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
longer and they just start to overcook

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.250 
longer and they just start to overcook
before<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.570> muscles<00:03:44.570> through<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.780> colander

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
before the muscles through the colander

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.990 
before the muscles through the colander
to<00:03:46.480> drain<00:03:47.530> off<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.560> juice<00:03:48.920> I'll<00:03:49.160> use<00:03:49.820> the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
to drain off the juice I'll use the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000 
to drain off the juice I'll use the
juice<00:03:50.209> in<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.480> sauce<00:03:50.720> but<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.740> basically

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
juice in the sauce but that is basically

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.220 
juice in the sauce but that is basically
how<00:03:52.459> to<00:03:52.520> steam<00:03:52.850> open<00:03:53.240> mussels<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:53.780> if<00:03:53.990> I<00:03:54.110> was

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
how to steam open mussels that if I was

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.990 
how to steam open mussels that if I was
going<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.380> stuff<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.800> mussels<00:03:55.310> now<00:03:55.520> I'd

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
going to stuff the mussels now I'd

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.640 
going to stuff the mussels now I'd
probably<00:03:56.240> take<00:03:56.570> him<00:03:56.690> into<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.930> half<00:03:57.230> shell

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
probably take him into the half shell

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.710 
probably take him into the half shell
put<00:03:58.310> something<00:03:58.670> like<00:03:58.700> maybe<00:03:59.000> garlic<00:03:59.510> butter

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
put something like maybe garlic butter

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.660 
put something like maybe garlic butter
on<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.020> top<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.380> them<00:04:00.530> or<00:04:00.680> if<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.400> was<00:04:01.550> doing

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
on the top of them or if I was doing

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.090 
on the top of them or if I was doing
something<00:04:01.790> like<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.240> normal<00:04:02.750> year<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.440> would

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
something like a normal year I would

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.360 
something like a normal year I would
actually<00:04:04.610> return<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.770> heat<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.220> add

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
actually return this to the heat and add

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.910 
actually return this to the heat and add
whatever<00:04:07.750> flavorings<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.870> wanted<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.350> warm<00:04:09.680> area
