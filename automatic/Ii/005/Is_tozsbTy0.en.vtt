the<00:01:36.630> game<00:01:39.080> but<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.110> always<00:01:40.380> liked<00:01:40.560> his<00:01:40.710> map<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the game but I always liked his map I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.560 
the game but I always liked his map I
always<00:01:41.340> thought<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.730> map<00:01:41.910> was<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.420> good

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
always thought this map was really good

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.110 
always thought this map was really good
really<00:01:42.600> fast<00:01:43.170> pace<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:44.340> finally<00:01:44.700> put<00:01:45.030> in

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
really fast pace and they finally put in

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.080 
really fast pace and they finally put in
66<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.930> think<00:01:46.290> when<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.620> put<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.370> drop<00:01:47.610> zone<00:01:47.940> if

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
66 I think when they put in drop zone if

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
66 I think when they put in drop zone if
i'm<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.360> mistaken<00:01:48.480> now<00:01:49.320> i<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:49.440> i<00:01:49.620> was<00:01:49.710> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
i'm not mistaken now i think i was a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.040 
i'm not mistaken now i think i was a
little<00:01:49.890> bit<00:01:50.040> before<00:01:50.370> that<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.720> map<00:01:51.900> was

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
little bit before that but this map was

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.380 
little bit before that but this map was
never<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.800> 66<00:01:53.430> rotation<00:01:54.090> which<00:01:54.270> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
never in like the 66 rotation which is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:05.960 
never in like the 66 rotation which is
crazy<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.650> map<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.130> good
