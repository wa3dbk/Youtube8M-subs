 become 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.590
 thanks to its modularity, no one can 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.740
 magic to all structural conditions 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.540
 to adjust 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.250
 The assembly is completely silicone-free 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.540
 place them also facilitate 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.710
 prefabricated components installation 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 Let us now the installation 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.070
