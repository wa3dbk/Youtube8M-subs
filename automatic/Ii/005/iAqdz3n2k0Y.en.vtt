00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.680 

it<00:00:07.939> is<00:00:08.240> july

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
it is july

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.799 
it is july
approximately<00:00:10.620> when<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.889> wake<00:00:11.099> p.m.<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.179> this

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
approximately when I wake p.m. and this

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.350 
approximately when I wake p.m. and this
is<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> marathon<00:00:13.379> key<00:00:13.860> for

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:29.890 

we<00:00:18.360> are<00:00:23.390> shot<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.830> started<00:00:29.340> sprinkling

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
we are shot so just started sprinkling

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.260 
we are shot so just started sprinkling
we<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.710> we're<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.210> take<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
we see here so we're going to take a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
we see here so we're going to take a
sample<00:00:33.809> now<00:00:33.960> we've<00:00:34.110> been<00:00:34.230> taking<00:00:34.410> samples<00:00:34.830> all

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
sample now we've been taking samples all

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.080 
sample now we've been taking samples all
down<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.150> turnpike<00:00:37.309> as<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.520> came<00:00:38.730> through

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
down the turnpike as we came through

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.640 
down the turnpike as we came through
Florida<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:41.480> it<00:00:42.480> has<00:00:42.690> been<00:00:42.930> remarkably<00:00:43.559> cool

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
Florida and it has been remarkably cool

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.100 
Florida and it has been remarkably cool
that<00:00:46.280> means<00:00:46.520> we<00:00:47.000> only<00:00:47.030> had<00:00:47.360> one<00:00:47.570> detection

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
that means we only had one detection

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.840 
that means we only had one detection
that<00:00:48.230> was<00:00:48.350> 2x<00:00:48.560> background<00:00:49.220> everything<00:00:49.670> all

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
that was 2x background everything all

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.670 
that was 2x background everything all
was<00:00:50.090> everything<00:00:50.750> else<00:00:50.900> here<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:51.230> Florida<00:00:51.590> has

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
was everything else here in Florida has

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:01.500 
was everything else here in Florida has
been<00:00:51.800> no<00:00:52.010> detection<00:00:52.750> so<00:00:53.750> it's<00:00:54.740> not<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.040> window

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.649 

burps

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:17.180 

quickly

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:29.220 

it's<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.280> good<00:01:18.430> 30<00:01:18.700> seconds

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:44.639 

so<00:01:29.860> we're<00:01:30.070> two<00:01:30.460> times<00:01:30.700> background

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.929 

so<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:45.740> looks<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:45.979> we're<00:01:46.250> going<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.430> hold<00:01:46.729> it

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
so it looks like we're going to hold it

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.219 
so it looks like we're going to hold it
two<00:01:47.180> times<00:01:47.360> background<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:47.960> actually

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
two times background and actually

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.660 
two times background and actually
background<00:01:48.680> here<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.039> little<00:01:49.250> bit<00:01:49.430> higher

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
background here is a little bit higher

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.069 
background here is a little bit higher
so<00:01:50.619> they're<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:52.340> little<00:01:53.149> bit<00:01:53.390> probably<00:01:53.659> less

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
so they're a little bit probably less

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.850 
so they're a little bit probably less
than<00:01:54.490> two<00:01:55.490> times<00:01:55.700> background<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.590> before

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
than two times background and so before

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.750 
than two times background and so before
we<00:01:57.950> get<00:01:58.070> too<00:01:58.280> wet<00:01:58.460> let's<00:01:59.030> go<00:01:59.240> back<00:01:59.420> on<00:01:59.630> in
