straight selection and we could keep

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670 
straight selection and we could keep
this<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.399> by<00:02:06.119> painting<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.080> happens<00:02:07.410> if

this up by painting but what happens if

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.859 
this up by painting but what happens if
say<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.250> example<00:02:08.759> you're<00:02:09.239> painting<00:02:09.630> along

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
say for example you're painting along

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.630 
say for example you're painting along
and<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.289> oops

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and you go oops

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.420 
and you go oops
you<00:02:11.970> simply<00:02:12.300> subtract<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.019> area<00:02:13.320> now<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.310> can

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
you simply subtract that area now we can

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.270 
you simply subtract that area now we can
come<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.330> click<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> subtract<00:02:16.860> button

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
come here and click the subtract button

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.430 
come here and click the subtract button
I<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.239> use<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.570> Alt<00:02:18.750> key<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.260> just

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
I just like to use the Alt key it's just

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.530 
I just like to use the Alt key it's just
easier<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.920> way<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.090> come<00:02:21.269> over<00:02:21.360> here

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
easier that way and if I come over here

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.140 
easier that way and if I come over here
and<00:02:21.600> begin<00:02:21.900> painting<00:02:22.200> I'm<00:02:22.670> subtracting

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
and begin painting I'm subtracting

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.330 
and begin painting I'm subtracting
we<00:02:25.480> could<00:02:25.659> keep<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.080> process<00:02:26.409> up<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.040> paint

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
we could keep this process up and paint

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.820 
we could keep this process up and paint
out<00:02:27.519> anything<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.480> want<00:02:28.780> all<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.349> requires

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
out anything we want all it requires

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.820 
out anything we want all it requires
like<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.730> lasso<00:02:31.060> tool<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.510> good<00:02:32.140> hand-eye

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
like the lasso tool is good hand-eye

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.640 
like the lasso tool is good hand-eye
coordination<00:02:33.069> it's<00:02:33.940> really<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.500> now<00:02:35.500> it's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
coordination it's really it now it's

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.500 
coordination it's really it now it's
going<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.099> work<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.519> I've<00:02:36.700> done<00:02:36.879> before<00:02:37.060> in

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
going to work like I've done before in

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.940 
going to work like I've done before in
conjunction<00:02:37.959> with<00:02:38.230> other<00:02:38.379> tools<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:38.920> let's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
conjunction with other tools so let's

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.009 
conjunction with other tools so let's
say<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.489> let<00:02:39.760> me<00:02:39.879> get<00:02:40.450> out<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.599> this<00:02:40.810> by

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
say this let me get out of this by

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.949 
say this let me get out of this by
deselecting<00:02:41.409> control<00:02:42.069> D<00:02:42.540> let's<00:02:43.540> start<00:02:43.810> with

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
deselecting control D let's start with

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.289 
deselecting control D let's start with
our<00:02:44.019> rectangular<00:02:44.590> marquee<00:02:44.920> tool<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.299> let's

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
our rectangular marquee tool and let's

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.000 
our rectangular marquee tool and let's
get<00:02:46.450> up<00:02:46.569> here<00:02:46.599> in<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.900> corner<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.349> I'm<00:02:47.890> going

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
get up here in the corner and I'm going

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.130 
get up here in the corner and I'm going
to<00:02:48.099> do<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.400> now<00:02:49.209> for<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.510> sake<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.780> argument

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
to do this now for the sake of argument

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.500 
to do this now for the sake of argument
I<00:02:50.440> need<00:02:51.159> everything<00:02:51.519> below<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.239> bridge

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
I need everything below the bridge

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.559 
I need everything below the bridge
selected<00:02:53.470> now<00:02:54.099> this<00:02:54.310> line<00:02:54.670> makes<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.360> part

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
selected now this line makes that part

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.180 
selected now this line makes that part
easy<00:02:55.780> with<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.140> selection<00:02:56.470> don't<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:57.069> to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
easy with the selection don't have to

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.680 
easy with the selection don't have to
paint<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.519> but<00:02:57.879> of<00:02:57.970> course<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.269> bridge<00:02:58.480> isn't

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
paint it but of course the bridge isn't

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.349 
paint it but of course the bridge isn't
perfectly<00:02:59.140> straight<00:02:59.470> so<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.459> start<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.209> this

after they've learned selection

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.650 
after they've learned selection
techniques<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.910> same<00:03:33.060> selection<00:03:33.540> in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
techniques can do the same selection in

techniques can do the same selection in
30<00:03:33.870> seconds<00:03:34.400> selection<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.580> keystone<00:03:35.910> skill

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
30 seconds selection is a keystone skill

30 seconds selection is a keystone skill
I've<00:03:36.570> already<00:03:36.810> mentioned<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.230> it's<00:03:37.709> very

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
I've already mentioned that it's very

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.050 
I've already mentioned that it's very
important<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.400> understanding<00:03:38.850> how<00:03:39.000> you

important to understanding how you

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.000 
important to understanding how you
control<00:03:39.480> Photoshop<00:03:40.020> because<00:03:40.860> you're

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
control Photoshop because you're

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.449

right now as this title evolves we will

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.160 
right now as this title evolves we will
be<00:03:53.010> using<00:03:53.340> selection<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.810> do<00:03:54.959> color

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170
