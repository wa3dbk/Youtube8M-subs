um moving forth I guess that's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.160 
um moving forth I guess that's
interesting<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:21.869> wanted<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170

interesting but what I really wanted to
talk<00:00:22.380> about<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.980> my<00:00:24.170> struggles<00:00:25.170> with

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
academia and school I guess the fact

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.280 
academia and school I guess the fact
that<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.360> can<00:00:33.360> never<00:00:33.600> focus<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that I like can never focus on the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.819 
that I like can never focus on the
present<00:00:35.149> causes<00:00:36.149> me<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.570> never<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.440> get

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
present causes me to never want to get

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.110 
present causes me to never want to get
down<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.280> anything<00:00:40.370> like<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:41.969> ever

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
there's a test coming up like there is I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
there's a test coming up like there is I
have<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> test<00:01:05.700> tomorrow<00:01:06.060> morning<00:01:06.600> I'm<00:01:06.869> nowhere

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
have a test tomorrow morning I'm nowhere

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.840 
have a test tomorrow morning I'm nowhere
near<00:01:07.830> prepared<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.670> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
near prepared for it and you know it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.140 
near prepared for it and you know it
gets<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.270> point<00:01:12.360> now<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.170> thinking

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
gets to this point now I'm just thinking

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.609 
gets to this point now I'm just thinking
you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.180> well<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.840> don't<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.110> enough<00:01:16.470> time

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you know well you don't have enough time

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.390 
you know well you don't have enough time
so<00:01:17.930> even<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.229> gonna<00:01:19.350> study<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.130> little

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
so even if you're gonna study a little

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.440 
so even if you're gonna study a little
bit<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:20.759> even<00:01:20.970> gonna<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.240> worth

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
bit it's not even gonna be worth

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.280 
bit it's not even gonna be worth
anything<00:01:22.909> you<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.210> gonna<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
anything you know it's gonna be like the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.140 
anything you know it's gonna be like the
difference<00:01:25.619> between<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.570> an<00:01:27.570> F<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> D

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
difference between like a an F and a D

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.649 
difference between like a an F and a D
um<00:01:30.380> which<00:01:31.380> isn't<00:01:31.560> worth<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:36.119> just

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
um which isn't worth much and it just

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.639 
um which isn't worth much and it just
really<00:01:36.900> sucks<00:01:37.670> because<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.920> can't

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
really sucks because I just I can't

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
really sucks because I just I can't
focus<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.950> anything<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.850> try<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.509> do

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
focus on anything and like I try to I do

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.590 
focus on anything and like I try to I do
try<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.619> my<00:01:46.770> reading<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.399> I'm

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
try to do my reading and then I'm

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.940 
try to do my reading and then I'm
switching<00:01:48.600> over<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.200> something<00:01:49.409> else<00:01:49.710> every

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
switching over to something else every

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.499 
switching over to something else every
thirty<00:01:50.909> Seconds<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.659> minute<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:53.060> I<00:01:54.060> don't

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
thirty Seconds to a minute and I don't

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.760 
thirty Seconds to a minute and I don't
know<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:57.020> wish<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.439> didn't<00:01:58.619> have

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
know I just I wish that it didn't have

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.499 
know I just I wish that it didn't have
to<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.759> wish<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.210> didn't

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
to be like this I wish that I didn't

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.429 
to be like this I wish that I didn't
have<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.890> go<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> school<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.399> prove<00:02:02.579> myself<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
have to go to school to prove myself to

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.109 
have to go to school to prove myself to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
be capable of what I'm capable of

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.229 
be capable of what I'm capable of
