00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.080
 there are many things that come through our eyes and food is one of them 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.849
 a group of Basque scientists 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.269
 has invented the menu virtual menu allows to project on the table all 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.189
 the dishes offered by the restaurant see what ingredients to take and choose 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.529
 let's hope that on a touch screen 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.830
 Let's go first with the eyes and then with the mouth so the 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.020
 restaurants the future better said of the present because the less virtual letter 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.120
 it's here 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.280
 lets fill the empty plate with everything that we want and then decide 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.120
 If we want the region is done automatically and written is written 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.339
 bottom left 'of the tablecloth there they have it is not only a plate 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.430
 we have with him some 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.500
 we have firearms 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.370
 for the welfare of our people 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.230
 as a wine partner to offer imagine that to heal we choose deer 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.570
 noodles and mussels but in the end it seems a lot to us so we remove the 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.650
 deer touching the x but how is it possible to do all this 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.330
 we find the answer on that screen next to the table 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.460
 effect we use a simple per cam like this i 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.590
 If a project in this parade ground is nothing electronic and that has 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.890
 some advantages one of them is that for example if water or wine spills 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.979
 absolutely nothing happens 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.880
 Cristina and Jose Angel have been the first to try the virtual letter with 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.020
 venues in serious condition 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.659
 e fisher has been with me in irak without a home to many to little need to know anything 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 they simply have theatrical lan followed that would go this serves to 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.920
 restaurants that carry six dishes on the menu coparÃ¡ mega restaurants by 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.820
 capacity 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.860
 This system can support 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.640
 but what they throw him will have to see if in the last year of the game 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.000
 to the letters 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.290
 traditional 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.570
 we knew what happens thanks for joining us it was more extensive and disgusting
