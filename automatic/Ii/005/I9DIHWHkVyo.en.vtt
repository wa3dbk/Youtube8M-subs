standard under under interface that all

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.579 
standard under under interface that all
the<00:05:12.470> Samsung<00:05:12.800> phones<00:05:13.100> have<00:05:13.250> got

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:18.589 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.249 

so<00:05:19.189> all<00:05:19.519> pretty<00:05:19.759> neat<00:05:19.999> device<00:05:20.149> but<00:05:20.479> we<00:05:21.079> won't

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
so all pretty neat device but we won't

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.319 
so all pretty neat device but we won't
see<00:05:21.439> much<00:05:21.709> of<00:05:21.949> the<00:05:22.069> difference<00:05:22.369> except<00:05:23.239> the

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:23.329 
see much of the difference except the

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:25.869 
see much of the difference except the
processor<00:05:23.779> and<00:05:23.959> this<00:05:24.079> field<00:05:24.549> when<00:05:25.549> compared

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
processor and this field when compared

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.159 
processor and this field when compared
to<00:05:25.939> the<00:05:26.089> earlier<00:05:26.359> versions<00:05:26.689> and<00:05:26.839> that<00:05:26.959> is<00:05:27.079> the

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
to the earlier versions and that is the

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.069 
to the earlier versions and that is the
Samsung<00:05:27.499> Galaxy<00:05:27.529> is<00:05:28.039> and<00:05:28.849> the<00:05:29.599> pricing<00:05:29.959> is

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:30.079 
Samsung Galaxy is and the pricing is

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:32.049 
Samsung Galaxy is and the pricing is
quite<00:05:30.649> a<00:05:30.679> bit<00:05:31.309> higher<00:05:31.489> than<00:05:31.699> that<00:05:31.759> of<00:05:31.939> the

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:32.059 
quite a bit higher than that of the
