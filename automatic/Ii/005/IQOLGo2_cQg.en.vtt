00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
now this year why I don't know whether

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.599 
now this year why I don't know whether
it's<00:00:25.150> because<00:00:25.300> I<00:00:25.390> sowed<00:00:25.689> them<00:00:25.840> earlier<00:00:26.199> or<00:00:26.500> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
it's because I sowed them earlier or the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.160 
it's because I sowed them earlier or the
weather's<00:00:27.609> just<00:00:27.820> been<00:00:28.000> rubbish<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.660> don't<00:00:29.080> know

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
weather's just been rubbish I don't know

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.300 
weather's just been rubbish I don't know
but<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.380> broad<00:00:29.560> beans<00:00:29.769> seem<00:00:30.010> to<00:00:30.099> have<00:00:30.189> done

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
but the broad beans seem to have done

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.310 
but the broad beans seem to have done
fantastically<00:00:31.150> well<00:00:31.480> I<00:00:31.509> don't<00:00:31.990> seem<00:00:32.199> to<00:00:32.230> have

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
fantastically well I don't seem to have

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.920 
fantastically well I don't seem to have
had<00:00:32.529> black<00:00:32.710> fly<00:00:33.100> on<00:00:33.280> them<00:00:33.460> at<00:00:33.550> all<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:33.970> so<00:00:34.900> I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
had black fly on them at all and so I

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.240 
had black fly on them at all and so I
think<00:00:35.050> it's<00:00:35.320> because<00:00:35.559> I<00:00:35.650> did<00:00:35.800> them<00:00:35.920> earlier

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
think it's because I did them earlier

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.869 
think it's because I did them earlier
and<00:00:36.989> enough<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.110> excuse<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:39.100> miss<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.520> this

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
and enough to excuse the miss of this

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.600 
and enough to excuse the miss of this
plot<00:00:40.450> it's<00:00:40.780> it's<00:00:41.110> a<00:00:41.230> bit<00:00:41.379> terrible<00:00:41.890> I'm<00:00:42.010> bit

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
and if some of the beans aren't very

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.449 
and if some of the beans aren't very
good<00:01:52.509> then<00:01:53.050> discard<00:01:53.560> them<00:01:53.830> but<00:01:53.979> if<00:01:54.099> the<00:01:54.250> beans

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
good then discard them but if the beans

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:55.979 
good then discard them but if the beans
inside<00:01:54.910> because<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.179> might<00:01:55.360> find<00:01:55.660> that<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.840> one

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:55.989 
inside because I might find that the one

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.550 
inside because I might find that the one
down<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.289> bottom<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.950> okay<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.560> so

down the bottom here is okay and and so

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.380 
down the bottom here is okay and and so
then<00:01:59.739> you<00:01:59.890> can<00:02:00.099> you<00:02:00.310> can<00:02:00.340> decide<00:02:00.819> when<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.209> get
