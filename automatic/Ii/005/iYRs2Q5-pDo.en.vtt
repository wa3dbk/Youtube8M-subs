00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
blender and what's really cool about

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.350 
blender and what's really cool about
using<00:04:55.599> grape<00:04:55.780> tomatoes<00:04:56.229> as<00:04:56.909> the<00:04:57.909> tomatoes<00:04:58.270> I

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
using grape tomatoes as the tomatoes I

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.089 
using grape tomatoes as the tomatoes I
use<00:04:58.509> for<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.870> sauce<00:04:59.169> or<00:04:59.379> a<00:04:59.440> soup<00:04:59.500> is<00:04:59.860> that

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
use for a sauce or a soup is that

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.719 
use for a sauce or a soup is that
because<00:05:00.759> of<00:05:00.789> how<00:05:01.120> much<00:05:01.300> skin<00:05:01.780> is<00:05:02.280> on<00:05:03.280> the

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
because of how much skin is on the

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.240 
because of how much skin is on the
tomatoes<00:05:04.150> like<00:05:04.479> cuz<00:05:04.780> there's<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.020> many<00:05:05.250> the

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
tomatoes like cuz there's so many the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.270 
tomatoes like cuz there's so many the
skin<00:05:06.520> ratio<00:05:06.879> to<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.120> tomato<00:05:07.469> flesh<00:05:08.469> inside<00:05:08.860> is

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
skin ratio to the tomato flesh inside is

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.459 
skin ratio to the tomato flesh inside is
a<00:05:09.669> lot<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:10.569> it<00:05:10.780> makes<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.050> really<00:05:11.229> thick
