Julian<00:02:50.040> explained<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:53.190> game<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.670> think<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
Julian explained this game I think I

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.140 
Julian explained this game I think I
mean<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.200> term<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.860> scale<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.519> size<00:02:56.790> and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
mean on the term of scale and size and

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.820 
mean on the term of scale and size and
everything<00:02:57.209> its<00:02:57.600> massive<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.500> at<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.650> same

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
everything its massive but at the same

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.550 
everything its massive but at the same
time<00:02:59.100> from<00:02:59.370> what<00:02:59.519> we've<00:02:59.640> seen<00:02:59.670> it's<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.870> varied

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
time from what we've seen it's so varied

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.620 
time from what we've seen it's so varied
so<00:03:02.070> different<00:03:02.610> everywhere<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.180> don't<00:03:03.450> go

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
so different everywhere you don't go

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.210 
so different everywhere you don't go
into<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> same<00:03:04.170> place<00:03:04.440> twice<00:03:04.680> from<00:03:05.010> what

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
into the same place twice from what

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.220 
into the same place twice from what
we've<00:03:05.310> seen<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:06.060> really<00:03:06.570> great<00:03:06.900> they've

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
we've seen it's really great they've

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.509 
we've seen it's really great they've
done<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.560> because<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:07.860> mean<00:03:08.040> usually<00:03:08.190> you'll

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
done that because I mean usually you'll

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.430 
done that because I mean usually you'll
get<00:03:08.700> massive<00:03:09.209> massive<00:03:09.480> massive<00:03:09.840> open<00:03:10.049> worlds

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
get massive massive massive open worlds

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.560 
get massive massive massive open worlds
like<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.830> cause<00:03:11.070> for<00:03:11.100> example<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.390> mean

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
like just cause for example but I mean

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.300 
like just cause for example but I mean
it's<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> same<00:03:13.260> thing<00:03:13.290> repeated<00:03:14.040> over<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
it's the same thing repeated over and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.680 
it's the same thing repeated over and
over<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.640> over<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:14.880> over<00:03:15.000> again<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.570> know

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
over and over and over again you know

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.870 
over and over and over again you know
you<00:03:16.410> see<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.769> same<00:03:16.950> things<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.250> lot<00:03:17.580> whereas

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
you see the same things a lot whereas

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.310 
you see the same things a lot whereas
this<00:03:18.030> game<00:03:18.269> looks<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.630> be<00:03:18.750> very<00:03:18.780> different

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320

down<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.090> description<00:03:45.239> if<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.660> want<00:03:45.720> to

read<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.049> for<00:03:46.170> yourself<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:47.040> more<00:03:47.280> on<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
read it for yourself so more on the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.729 
read it for yourself so more on the
progression<00:03:48.030> here<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:48.750> when<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.019> complete<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
progression here so when you complete a

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.190 
progression here so when you complete a
challenge<00:03:50.130> or<00:03:50.850> whatever<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.720> get<00:03:51.900> bronze

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
challenge or whatever you get bronze

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.470 
challenge or whatever you get bronze
silver<00:03:52.530> or<00:03:52.650> gold<00:03:53.040> from<00:03:53.640> completing<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.330> as

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
silver or gold from completing it as

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.600 
silver or gold from completing it as
you're<00:03:54.660> doing<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:55.110> lot<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.380> other<00:03:55.769> races<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.280> so

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
you're doing a lot of other races and so

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.699 
you're doing a lot of other races and so
on<00:03:56.700> but<00:03:56.910> what<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.570> basically<00:03:57.750> do<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.200> get<00:03:58.680> a

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
on but what you basically do is get a

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.400 
on but what you basically do is get a
part<00:03:59.190> as<00:03:59.489> we<00:03:59.730> said<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.690> part<00:04:00.930> will<00:04:01.169> have

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
part as we said and that part will have

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.129 
part as we said and that part will have
a<00:04:01.590> bronze<00:04:01.980> silver<00:04:02.250> or<00:04:02.489> gold<00:04:02.760> status<00:04:03.359> attached

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
a bronze silver or gold status attached

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.070 
a bronze silver or gold status attached
to<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.769> also<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> level

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
to it and also have a level

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.500 
to it and also have a level
attached<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.740> so<00:04:07.250> if<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:07.850> do<00:04:07.970> really<00:04:08.210> good

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
attached to it so if you do really good

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.480 
attached to it so if you do really good
you'll<00:04:08.930> gold<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.470> event<00:04:09.770> you'll<00:04:09.950> get<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.220> gold

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
you'll gold the event you'll get a gold

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.220 
you'll gold the event you'll get a gold
part<00:04:10.790> if<00:04:10.970> that<00:04:11.180> makes<00:04:11.360> any<00:04:11.480> sense<00:04:11.630> and

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
part if that makes any sense and

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.410 
part if that makes any sense and
obviously<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.220> have<00:04:13.460> a<00:04:13.490> level<00:04:13.730> attached<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.300> it

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
obviously I have a level attached to it

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.030 
obviously I have a level attached to it
now<00:04:14.540> I<00:04:14.570> could<00:04:14.750> pretty<00:04:14.870> much<00:04:14.960> say<00:04:15.320> it's<00:04:15.800> going

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
now I could pretty much say it's going

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.310 
now I could pretty much say it's going
to<00:04:16.100> have<00:04:16.310> your<00:04:16.700> level<00:04:17.060> or<00:04:17.269> below<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.989> hasn't

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
to have your level or below it hasn't

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.770 
to have your level or below it hasn't
been<00:04:18.410> confirmed<00:04:18.470> though<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.910> maybe<00:04:20.330> we'll<00:04:20.510> get

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
been confirmed though so maybe we'll get

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.660 
been confirmed though so maybe we'll get
parts<00:04:21.170> at<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.380> higher<00:04:21.620> level<00:04:21.650> than<00:04:22.040> we<00:04:22.370> actually

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
parts at a higher level than we actually

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.000 
parts at a higher level than we actually
out<00:04:23.090> at<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.300> moment<00:04:23.450> meaning<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.770> know<00:04:24.860> we'll

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
out at the moment meaning you know we'll

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.050 
out at the moment meaning you know we'll
look<00:04:25.130> at<00:04:25.280> them<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.490> will<00:04:25.580> be<00:04:25.670> like<00:04:25.820> oh<00:04:25.910> we're

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
look at them and will be like oh we're

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.730 
look at them and will be like oh we're
gonna<00:04:26.180> get<00:04:26.360> those<00:04:26.540> well<00:04:26.810> love<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.290> try<00:04:27.470> harder

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
gonna get those well love to try harder

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.140 
gonna get those well love to try harder
in<00:04:27.860> actually<00:04:28.130> get<00:04:28.250> those<00:04:28.400> look<00:04:28.730> pretty<00:04:28.850> cool

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
in actually get those look pretty cool

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.480 
in actually get those look pretty cool
but<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:29.930> mean<00:04:30.020> we<00:04:30.500> can<00:04:30.620> easily<00:04:30.950> say<00:04:31.130> we're<00:04:31.340> going

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
but I mean we can easily say we're going

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.940 
but I mean we can easily say we're going
to<00:04:31.550> get<00:04:31.640> ones<00:04:31.820> were<00:04:32.000> out<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.390> below<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:33.080> that's

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
to get ones were out and below so that's

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.560 
to get ones were out and below so that's
a<00:04:34.070> pretty<00:04:34.220> cool<00:04:34.430> progression<00:04:34.970> system<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.450> me

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
a pretty cool progression system to me

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.530 
a pretty cool progression system to me
because<00:04:35.780> if<00:04:36.140> it<00:04:36.710> means<00:04:36.980> that<00:04:37.400> some<00:04:37.730> events<00:04:38.120> you

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
because if it means that some events you

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.730 
because if it means that some events you
know<00:04:38.630> maybe<00:04:38.810> some<00:04:39.080> events<00:04:39.320> will<00:04:39.410> be<00:04:39.500> difficult

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
know maybe some events will be difficult

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.500 
know maybe some events will be difficult
meaning<00:04:40.460> you'd<00:04:40.580> have<00:04:40.700> to<00:04:40.820> go<00:04:40.910> through<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.270> once

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
meaning you'd have to go through it once

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.140 
meaning you'd have to go through it once
you'll<00:04:42.050> get<00:04:42.320> silver<00:04:42.890> and<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.820> don't<00:04:43.970> want<00:04:44.120> to

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
you'll get silver and you don't want to

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.640 
you'll get silver and you don't want to
put<00:04:44.360> even<00:04:44.660> more<00:04:44.690> but<00:04:44.960> any<00:04:45.050> way<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.230> do<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.590> is

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
put even more but any way to do that is

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.470 
put even more but any way to do that is
by<00:04:45.890> equipping<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.430> part<00:04:46.640> you<00:04:46.760> just<00:04:46.790> unlocked

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
by equipping that part you just unlocked

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.330 
by equipping that part you just unlocked
and<00:04:47.780> then<00:04:48.230> doing<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:48.650> again<00:04:48.890> if<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.160> makes

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
and then doing it again if that makes

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.770 
and then doing it again if that makes
sense<00:04:49.490> i<00:04:49.700> think<00:04:49.730> that<00:04:50.000> we're<00:04:50.120> pretty<00:04:50.270> cool<00:04:50.540> i

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
sense i think that we're pretty cool i

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.490 
sense i think that we're pretty cool i
may<00:04:51.500> be<00:04:51.560> using<00:04:51.770> some<00:04:52.160> parts<00:04:52.720> from<00:04:53.720> other<00:04:54.080> races

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
may be using some parts from other races

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.440 
may be using some parts from other races
that<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:54.980> have<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.490> do<00:04:55.670> and<00:04:55.850> you<00:04:55.940> know<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.180> just

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
that you have to do and you know it just

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.650 
that you have to do and you know it just
makes<00:04:56.930> very<00:04:57.850> unlimited<00:04:58.850> opportunities<00:04:59.480> for

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
makes very unlimited opportunities for

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.420 
makes very unlimited opportunities for
the<00:04:59.720> progression<00:05:00.200> in<00:05:00.380> this<00:05:00.590> type<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:00.890> game<00:05:01.250> it

the game I have been waiting for like
seriously<00:05:36.669> so<00:05:37.669> anyway<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.210> in<00:05:38.810> basic<00:05:39.500> you

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
seriously so anyway and in basic you

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.760 
seriously so anyway and in basic you
beat<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:39.860> race<00:05:40.130> you<00:05:40.760> get<00:05:40.940> XP<00:05:41.390> get<00:05:41.990> money<00:05:42.230> you<00:05:42.650> get

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
beat a race you get XP get money you get

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.560 
beat a race you get XP get money you get
apart<00:05:43.100> depending<00:05:43.370> on<00:05:43.669> how<00:05:43.760> well<00:05:43.940> you<00:05:43.970> did<00:05:44.210> if

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
apart depending on how well you did if

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.990 
apart depending on how well you did if
that<00:05:44.720> makes<00:05:44.870> any<00:05:44.960> sense<00:05:45.080> cool<00:05:46.040> progression

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
that makes any sense cool progression

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.450 
that makes any sense cool progression
explained<00:05:48.040> obviously<00:05:49.040> you<00:05:49.100> can<00:05:49.220> use<00:05:49.340> the

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
explained obviously you can use the

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.950 
explained obviously you can use the
money<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.669> them<00:05:49.880> and<00:05:50.030> buy<00:05:50.120> more<00:05:50.390> parts<00:05:50.780> in<00:05:50.870> the

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
money to them and buy more parts in the

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.170 
money to them and buy more parts in the
shop<00:05:51.260> I'm<00:05:51.590> guessing<00:05:52.250> some<00:05:52.580> parts<00:05:52.910> will<00:05:53.150> be

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
shop I'm guessing some parts will be

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.760 
shop I'm guessing some parts will be
because<00:05:53.690> they<00:05:53.780> randomly<00:05:54.110> generated<00:05:54.680> I'm

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
because they randomly generated I'm

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.110 
because they randomly generated I'm
guessing<00:05:55.040> some<00:05:55.220> patch<00:05:55.370> of<00:05:55.520> getting<00:05:55.669> races

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
guessing some patch of getting races

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.150 
guessing some patch of getting races
will<00:05:56.600> be<00:05:56.810> rarer<00:05:57.200> than<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.620> ones<00:05:57.770> you<00:05:57.830> can<00:05:57.979> get

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
will be rarer than the ones you can get

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.280 
will be rarer than the ones you can get
in<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.490> shop<00:05:58.760> or<00:05:58.940> something<00:05:59.090> or<00:05:59.570> maybe<00:05:59.630> it's

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
in the shop or something or maybe it's

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.260 
in the shop or something or maybe it's
obviously<00:06:00.560> to<00:06:00.740> have<00:06:00.830> to<00:06:00.979> pay<00:06:01.160> for<00:06:01.220> it<00:06:01.580> so<00:06:01.910> money

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
obviously to have to pay for it so money

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.700 
obviously to have to pay for it so money
might<00:06:02.450> be<00:06:02.570> a<00:06:02.600> bit<00:06:02.930> harder<00:06:03.200> to<00:06:03.229> come<00:06:03.440> by<00:06:03.470> than

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
might be a bit harder to come by than

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.100 
might be a bit harder to come by than
you<00:06:03.830> think<00:06:04.010> and<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:04.430> don't<00:06:04.940> know<00:06:05.060> we'll<00:06:05.960> have<00:06:06.050> to

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
you think and I don't know we'll have to

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.040 
you think and I don't know we'll have to
wait<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:06.380> see<00:06:06.590> so<00:06:07.390> basically<00:06:08.390> melts

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
wait and see so basically melts

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.080 
wait and see so basically melts
everything<00:06:09.440> for<00:06:09.979> this<00:06:10.250> what<00:06:10.669> to<00:06:10.820> do<00:06:10.910> with<00:06:11.030> the

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
everything for this what to do with the

everything for this what to do with the
