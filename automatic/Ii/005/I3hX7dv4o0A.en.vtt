00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
snare drum this is how you should

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:56.440 
snare drum this is how you should
practice<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.380> very<00:01:44.649> slowly

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.940 

nice<00:01:57.450> ass<00:01:57.690> but<00:01:57.930> humble<00:01:58.140> over<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.590> second

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
nice ass but humble over that second

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.620 
nice ass but humble over that second
time<00:01:59.100> once<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.640> muscle<00:01:59.970> memory<00:02:00.090> kicks<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
time once your muscle memory kicks in

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.620 
time once your muscle memory kicks in
you<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.229> memorized<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.909> becomes<00:02:03.240> easier

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you have it memorized it becomes easier

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.410 
you have it memorized it becomes easier
you<00:02:03.960> know<00:02:04.580> I'm<00:02:05.580> sure<00:02:05.790> you've<00:02:05.940> all<00:02:06.119> noticed

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
off of sheet music and once it's in your

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.990 
off of sheet music and once it's in your
head<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.450> easier<00:02:12.810> than<00:02:12.870> trying<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:14.000> rid

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
head it's way easier than trying to rid

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.190 
head it's way easier than trying to rid
of<00:02:15.090> sheet<00:02:15.270> music<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.750> migos<00:02:16.560> open<00:02:16.860> more<00:02:24.200> now

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
of sheet music so migos open more now

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.460 
of sheet music so migos open more now
the<00:02:25.260> way<00:02:25.500> i<00:02:25.530> wouldst<00:02:26.010> rated<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:27.470> just

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the way i wouldst rated it is just

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.530 
the way i wouldst rated it is just
something<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.250> came<00:02:29.400> up<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.850> them<00:02:30.269> I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
something that I came up with them I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.720 
something that I came up with them I
tried<00:02:31.110> several<00:02:31.470> different<00:02:31.650> ways<00:02:32.100> some<00:02:32.610> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
tried several different ways some of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.130 
tried several different ways some of
them<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.120> some<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.420> them<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.690> didn't<00:02:33.989> like

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
them I like some of them I didn't like

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.250 
them I like some of them I didn't like
and<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.730> way<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.910> did<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.630> video<00:02:36.810> is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
and the way I did it in the video is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.500 
and the way I did it in the video is
just<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.580> ways<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.940> i<00:02:39.060> would<00:02:39.239> like

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
just one of the ways that i would like

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.949 
just one of the ways that i would like
so<00:02:40.500> what<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> did<00:02:40.769> was<00:02:41.660> start<00:02:42.660> with<00:02:42.810> my<00:02:42.930> right

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
so what I did was start with my right
