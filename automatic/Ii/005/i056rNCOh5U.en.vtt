 true he took us around 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.780
 pinches four or five hours that in 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.520
 total not only with schools but it's with 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.200
 which is a bastard to defeat him 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.329

 I'm going to give your keys seriously 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.570
 for the pressure of the elderly for 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.210
 depressions at level 34 and 35 by 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.250
 please keep the air with the hunter 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.659
 the titan are the alternating ones I did not 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.880
 all and with the two characters but 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.590
 well let's start with what would be 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.990
 the titan who is my first character in 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.240
 getting to level 34 cost me a little bit 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.799
 upload it but finally we upload it 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 this was here we are in what would be the 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.110
 level 28 we finished it for the first time 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.130
 it was the first time we finished it 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.049
 because the associated price first 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.270
 once I saw what this camera would be like and 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.950
 I used what would be the tri sergei in 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.409
 this I recommend that you do not 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.970
 seriously do not spend on your treasure key 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.039
 I think there is I believe that without your 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.810
 reward you already see your home your keys in 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.810
 serious here in the level 28 I got 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.520
 the note re plus ultra and the man of 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.920
 wolves that is I believe the the machine gun 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.780
 of the air of the queen and the sniper this 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.240
 the no man's ambition is coming 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.039
 updated that proposed nobody wants to be 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.049
 pinches no loan more ugly than me 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.090
 I think crazy good we play it with 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.159
 that would be now without pressure desires of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.259
 level 32 again with my titan we are 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.909
 back and I think here I went back to 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.950
 use what will be another key me 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.240
 gave my armor core that these 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.560
 they will always give us their reward 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.750
 they are always going to give it to the core of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.880
 armor core of weapon or ethereal light 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.250
 here he used my key and half again 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.200
 strange coin specks of light and his kindness 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.940
 the sniper of the queen's anger that in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.549
 I seriously regret having spent 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.920
 those little coins, then we go with the 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.299
 32 and the pressures in 132 but now with 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.080
 the hunter we bring back what is in 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.540
 our core 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.670
 armor and here nothing more then hold what 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.560
 which are the odd little coins and 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.450
 strange suitcases do not think the monkeys 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.400
 strangers always give them but I do not know 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.890
 now we go with what would be the presidio 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.810
 level 34 with the titan here no longer 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.700
 I was spending keys I was 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.190
 saving for level 35 right now what 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.020
 so for what I was doing the price of 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.000
 actions at level 34 is for light 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.100
 ethereal to be able to climb also and another 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.010
 hunter and all that here gave me light 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.900
 esther already the core of weapon this the s of 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.730
 the real amethyst amethyst that is called 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.720
 which I think is lumen the symbol of 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.280
 identity that is so that what 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.870
 exchanges with marx at the time of 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 get to the level two or three more which 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.680
 very well and can you buy a 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.260
 reward now we go with level 34 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.730
 with the hunter figs and 34 with the hunter 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.650
 I 'm leaving, they gave me ethereal light again 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.330
 weapon profit that I repeat always go 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.130
 to give this at the respective level its 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.780
 respective reward is every week and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.630
 they gave me another identity symbol 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.640
 specks of the filaments of him now yes 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.040
 we go with what would be the pro achieve 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.230
 go up to 34 finishing this get 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.240
 some lights and necessary tasks and then 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.250
 we are going against is with those that 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.020
 He subsidized schools did not take seriously 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.870
 more d 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.850
 54 hours seriously still doing it with 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.560
 trick there is a guy there is a guy with a 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.090
 strategy to kill him fast as in 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.580
 about 30 seconds but seriously not 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.170
 we could not and we could not and we 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.670
 took a lot of time until finally 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.220
 you are seeing what would be the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.110
 gameplay where we achieved it between 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.660
 kill quotes not because this would not be 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.820
 the legal form legal form is pregnant 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.709
 killing or while this wey goes out 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.720
 coming out targets more enemies have 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.250
 that capture the objectives you get something 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.590
 that you put on the green screen like this 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.140
 that is all place antler is very 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.510
 but very cannon in 35 I recommend that 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.880
 his whole squad 74 but finally when 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.459
 we killed him we were worthy to reach 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.590
 our rewards ok I think the 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.870
 reward seriously are very much worth the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.700
 sorry here because finally we just gave 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.829
 very excited and we started rubbing 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.100
 our bodies slowly so with with 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.960
 baby oil oil this cedÃ© that 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.120
 sponsor the wey that of me win true 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.680
 finally we go down here to what will be room 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.870
 of reward after a long time of 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.310
 despair and then we managed to receive 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.229
 our rewards our 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.480
 rewards in zero I recommend to the 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:38.170
 100% that keep a key for the 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.110
 of 35 because they give the leader the emblem 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.560
 the ship and I think that they are going to 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.720
 be seeing cede ship emblem and yes and 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.370
 the ethereal light weapon core weapon and 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.500
 armor core practically give them 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.870
 all seriously have to finish the follow 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.250
 to 34 1 square contention and release 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.320
 that under the comments they can put their 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.880
 gamer touch of those who are 34 so that 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.710
 the win 35 are going to take many 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.900
 horitas and very good if you are seeing what 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.540
 which is the shader the emblem in the least 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.700
 31 the ship is short mother is freedom 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.560
 they are going to see you welcome what would be the 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.480
 sniper of the queen again that of his 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.280
 goodness now yes it was wasted to the 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.380
 Primary visit but good as 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.640
 It can be done until next week 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.470
 right now I'm going up I want to 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.210
 see if I can win other ethereal lights and 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.590
 more keys here are seeing what 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.090
 it would be the ship that seriously looks very 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.850
 ready to cook what would be the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.710
 queen this one is something similar to what 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.360
 is given of the queen and then finally 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.190
 as they came what would be the core of 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.810
 gun and armor core barix bell de 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.760
 what would be the probability of judgment 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.790
 which is how it's like they have a 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.560
 random a random item ok is like something 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.940
 as well as a random box and it's going 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.169
 to give you what you buy for a core of 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.759
 weapon and armor core 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.039
 I passed it to my hunter so that 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.680
 outside April there are chances that he gives me 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.539
 armor but he gave me what would be a 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.370
 weapon or what's here I already have them I'm going with 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.319
 barix bought the probability of 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.879
 judgment I think it's called there what are 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.169
 seeing probability of judgment to see that 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.120
 they give to you I think it's totally 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.729
 wandering there gave me what would be the 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.889
 scum pride the hand cannon of 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.990
 the diego of camera and glass the house 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.999
 of words ok of the new so 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.610
 well, practically this has been all 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:11.110
 eta manuela cannon did not convince me 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.180
 It's very good for the fallen 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.969
 right now this dlc of walking killing fallen 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.069
 but from there on out in this crystal 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.439
 and in all that I do not see it very very useful 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.539
 but it could be improved, let's wait 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:24.729
 see how this little cannon goes 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.979
 lavelanet to the truth the weapon that most 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.089
 I recommend it is this little one that 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.060
 they give everyone when they start the campaign 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:33.879
 dynasty of these weapons a chin monteria 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.129
 better on the top at zero kills very well 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:38.349
 in crucible and in campaÃ±Ã³ that there is in tve and 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.789
 in pvp we do good that has been everything is 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.560
