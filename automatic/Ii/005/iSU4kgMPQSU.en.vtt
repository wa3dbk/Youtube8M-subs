00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.189
 good evening everyone quick video 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.960
 concerning a small recurring concern in 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.570
 speaking of an excess that end there are two 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.710
 little worries that young people will discover 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.279
 that I unfortunately had to solve 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 first of all there is a concern at the level of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 the screen I do not know if some will have it 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 in fact the screen tend to get 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.140
 lift I think it's me it was 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:39.690
 the left or right side I know more 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:42.770
 one of two sides the screen annoying that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.980
 to lift up and sent a lot of gp since 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.340
 he was coming home again but it's not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.469
 it's not a fir tree worry on my part or 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.170
 to drop or anything in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.320
 it was a problem 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 apparently from all the tablets 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.440
 in fact what it takes is everything 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 simply disassemble the hull 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:11.670
 the back shell with me I used 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 for to start to dislodge the open 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.939
 slightly the hull 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.939
 I used a simple author's cutter 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.130
 I will go home when I did 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:40.390
 so we can hull like this me 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:42.910
 I started with the cutter I did 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.860
 more like that and I touched I did 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.820
 lever so that part of the east coast 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.800
 then withdrew with me I have a 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.140
 mediator the mediator as these have 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.760
 ate a tool like his voice too 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.490
 worse than what is being proposed 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.260
 it's because we could divide the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.350
 bigger cutter maybe but for 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.790
 avoid deserting the plastic because 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.610
 that being homo 6.6 or if he returns or that 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.350
 you have under the tablet want to lead 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.120
 a guarantee 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.700
 this one saw the forcing markdowns 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.480
 and around the internet sacem that no 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.970
 takes care of it once the side where 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.220
 what is it about me opened 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.209
 on a small centimeter 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.860
 then you pick pick and you 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.830
 lift tac tac tac tac tac tac and my 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.440
 entourage of the voices the coop of the very woods 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.860
 easily here against once 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.860
 it is done 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.220
 yes it's full of screws so I do not know 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.800
 if all the screws you try to do 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.650
 the extra all the vices correspond to 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.260
 the screen but I took a screwdriver 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.390
 we feel these little towers of worm 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.020
 any tourist and by the way 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.970
 turn of vices all the little screws there 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:07.480
 we have three there then it's so hide them 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:11.080
 so there was no or if you laugh a black 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.300
 that I will try it here too by 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.340
 against that there are holes there that 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.450
 intrigues me 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.530
 it feels like there are no screws 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:27.750
 inside nor in my opinion it's wanted I do not 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:32.140
 know it's strange soc 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.020
 it looks weird my fist is judged 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:40.330
 like that because in fact a few with 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.850
 a screw here we live here the wires here so 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.500
 united this is actually made me I have everything 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.480
 tighten the screws I did all the trick 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.310
 and we felt that she was slightly 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:55.060
 a little bit loose goodnight me I 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.680
 I'm sure they're all tight in 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.740
 hoping it will not come back if that 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.540
 come back also it starts coming 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.870
 I will put a product type I'm called 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.870
 on a product 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.799
 a kind of filet fra it's a product 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.590
 that around the return of the screw and who 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.739
 solidifies and time and avoids 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:24.050
 aviso move we often serve the part 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.460
 mechanical but these two holes there then 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.330
 it's curious that does not have a life 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.919
 there is a screw thread apparently is this 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.780
 that it does not forget the part of factory I 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.960
 do not know so maybe that's why 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.630
 also that the screen its half of 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.780
 collectives so once that's it 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.260
 does ben go fill the box we 're going 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.320
 check if there is no dust in case 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.320
 or 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.330
 so apparently seen inside we can 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.979
 apparently innovative jean who is a 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.720
 connector so me the homeland must be 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.110
 stuck in his youth his batteries 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:11.080
 if he sells parts of course apart from 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.080
 six months I had touch concerns 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.090
 the tactile head and years to not 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.400
 reply 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.050
 so you have to lock unlock 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.130
 puts him invaded lit up in the world 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.960
 tactile returns but apparently it's 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.320
 a recurring defect of all 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.520
 tablets 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.430
 So in my opinion c 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.650
 duo first series first out I 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.039
 think the next outings are going in 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.120
 hoping he will solve the problem 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:40.349
 that I find people would not have 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.349
 else else well I think it's 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:46.770
 go in warranty or just here 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:51.090
 it was just this little worry that there is 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:54.560
 way to repair by avoiding to go into 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.560
 guarantee that's it
