 that he wants to establish on the ground and 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 I will try here what to put 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.360

 either in defense as in attack and 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.920

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.739

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.250
 that you have to ask for these kinds of things 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.880
 - correct staff as I said 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.600
 before, it's really taking over 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.230
 pleasure in the field 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.730
 and that's it's really that's all 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.490
 resumed on the ground I think 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.800

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.970

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.730
 think the team will be able to 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.450
 great things ie I think 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.820
 that we can maintain 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.860
 we have words from good players 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.750
 quality here must be that it is necessary that we 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.280
 believe in us it is necessary that the public 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.780
 believe in sharks pontiff has really 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.780
