00:01:33.420 --> 00:02:03.469 

I<00:02:00.500> started<00:02:01.500> using<00:02:01.710> biodynamic<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> Genesis

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
I started using biodynamic on a Genesis

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.930 
I started using biodynamic on a Genesis
tour<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.780> believe<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.770> would<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.100> been<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
tour I believe it would have been the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.109 
tour I believe it would have been the
mama<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.479> around<00:02:06.840> 84<00:02:07.519> but<00:02:08.519> we<00:02:08.759> started

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
mama to around 84 but we started

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.240 
mama to around 84 but we started
rehearsal<00:02:09.569> came<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.929> rehearsals<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
rehearsal came in rehearsals and I

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.430 
rehearsal came in rehearsals and I
hadn't<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:12.180> seen<00:02:12.360> him<00:02:12.510> before<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.260> have

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
hadn't really seen him before and I have

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.150 
hadn't really seen him before and I have
to<00:02:13.590> admit<00:02:13.709> they<00:02:14.610> sounded<00:02:15.030> amazing<00:02:16.069> by<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
to admit they sounded amazing by the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.460 
to admit they sounded amazing by the
time<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.640> got<00:02:17.790> into<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.360> full<00:02:18.989> production

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
time we got into the full production

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.990 
time we got into the full production
stage<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.100> rehearsal<00:02:20.549> where<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.819> know

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
stage of rehearsal where you know

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.370 
stage of rehearsal where you know
everything<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.600> miked<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.290> you're

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
everything is miked up and you're

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.979 
everything is miked up and you're
hearing<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.799> in<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.220> big<00:02:23.430> system<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.720> was

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
hearing it in the big system it was

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.030 
hearing it in the big system it was
really<00:02:25.470> great<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.830> sounded<00:02:26.160> incredible

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
really great it sounded incredible

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.009 
really great it sounded incredible
they<00:02:29.040> were<00:02:29.160> simple<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.549> was<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:29.790> dynamic<00:02:30.060> mics

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
they were simple it was all dynamic mics

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.630 
they were simple it was all dynamic mics
I<00:02:31.049> think<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> only<00:02:31.799> condensers<00:02:32.400> would<00:02:32.549> have

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
I think the only condensers would have

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.300 
I think the only condensers would have
been<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.180> overheads<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> head<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:35.100> it's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
been the overheads in the head and it's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.890 
been the overheads in the head and it's
really<00:02:35.610> turned<00:02:35.880> around<00:02:36.030> because<00:02:36.269> these<00:02:36.569> days

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
really turned around because these days

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.289 
really turned around because these days
I<00:02:37.350> find<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.890> prefer<00:02:38.250> condensers<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> tones

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
I find I prefer condensers on the tones

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.229 
I find I prefer condensers on the tones
as<00:02:39.600> well<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:40.620> fact<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.549> setup<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:42.060> think

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
as well in fact with this setup I think

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.060 
as well in fact with this setup I think
I'm<00:02:42.329> only<00:02:42.420> using<00:02:42.720> there's<00:02:43.260> only<00:02:43.380> dynamics<00:02:43.950> on

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
I'm only using there's only dynamics on

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.160 
I'm only using there's only dynamics on
the<00:02:44.160> snare<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> bass<00:02:44.970> drum

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
the snare and on the bass drum

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.210 
the snare and on the bass drum
everything<00:02:46.170> else<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.500> condenser<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
everything else is a condenser all the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.250 
everything else is a condenser all the
Tom's<00:02:47.430> overheads<00:02:48.470> and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
Tom's overheads and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.460 
Tom's overheads and
I've<00:02:51.319> just<00:02:51.560> been<00:02:51.709> finding<00:02:52.099> them<00:02:53.470> dependable

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
I've just been finding them dependable

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.320 
I've just been finding them dependable
whether<00:02:55.250> I'm<00:02:55.370> in<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.549> studio<00:02:55.760> with<00:02:56.150> I'm

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
whether I'm in the studio with I'm

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.440 
whether I'm in the studio with I'm
playing<00:02:56.599> live<00:02:56.870> they<00:02:57.530> sound<00:02:57.799> great<00:02:58.180> after<00:02:59.180> 92

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
playing live they sound great after 92

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.089 
playing live they sound great after 92
little<00:02:59.900> more<00:02:59.989> Genesis<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.560> us<00:03:00.709> for<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.950> while

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900

to Frankfurt Musikmesse I ended up back
in<00:03:09.799> touch<00:03:10.160> with<00:03:10.190> biodynamic<00:03:11.180> through<00:03:11.540> a

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
in touch with biodynamic through a

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.190 
in touch with biodynamic through a
mutual<00:03:11.810> friend<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.970> they<00:03:14.569> were<00:03:14.780> interested

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
mutual friend and they were interested

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.410 
mutual friend and they were interested

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
and they had a new line of drum mics and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.240 
and they had a new line of drum mics and
I<00:03:17.690> just<00:03:18.079> you<00:03:18.200> know<00:03:18.260> was<00:03:18.530> very<00:03:18.829> interested<00:03:19.160> in

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
I just you know was very interested in

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.559 
I just you know was very interested in
checking<00:03:19.489> him<00:03:19.730> out<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:19.910> was<00:03:20.120> going<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.420> do<00:03:20.540> a

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
checking him out I was going to do a

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.509 
checking him out I was going to do a
clinic<00:03:20.989> tour<00:03:21.170> with<00:03:21.470> together<00:03:22.040> with<00:03:22.340> Louise

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
clinic tour with together with Louise

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.569 
clinic tour with together with Louise
Conte<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:24.410> heard<00:03:24.620> these<00:03:24.799> new<00:03:25.069> mics<00:03:25.340> that

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
Conte and I heard these new mics that

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.030 
Conte and I heard these new mics that
were<00:03:25.670> all<00:03:25.819> condensers<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:27.500> was<00:03:27.680> really

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
were all condensers and I was really

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.369 
were all condensers and I was really
blown<00:03:28.280> away<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:28.579> we<00:03:29.000> ended<00:03:29.150> up<00:03:29.299> using<00:03:29.780> them<00:03:30.109> for

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
blown away so we ended up using them for

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.330 
blown away so we ended up using them for
the<00:03:30.440> clinic<00:03:30.799> tour<00:03:31.090> then<00:03:32.090> we<00:03:32.390> did<00:03:33.109> Phil<00:03:33.920> Collins

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
the clinic tour then we did Phil Collins

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.099 
the clinic tour then we did Phil Collins
I<00:03:34.549> guess<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.819> was<00:03:34.910> called<00:03:35.239> his<00:03:35.390> first<00:03:35.629> final

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
I guess it was called his first final

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.740 
I guess it was called his first final
farewell<00:03:36.530> tour<00:03:36.829> I<00:03:37.160> showed<00:03:38.000> up<00:03:38.180> with<00:03:38.299> these<00:03:38.450> new

buyer microphones and the Thomas and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.660 
buyer microphones and the Thomas and
Phil<00:03:41.930> heard<00:03:42.200> those<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.220> was<00:03:43.340> just<00:03:43.519> no

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
Phil heard those and it was just no
