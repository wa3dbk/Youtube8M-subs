00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
let's take a look at the scope there's a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
let's take a look at the scope there's a
short-range<00:01:12.450> scope<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:14.010> know<00:01:14.070> if

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
short-range scope on it I don't know if

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.460 
short-range scope on it I don't know if
this<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.400> authentic<00:01:14.790> oh<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.990> guess<00:01:16.290> it's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
this would be authentic oh I guess it's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.310 
this would be authentic oh I guess it's
somewhat<00:01:16.799> authentic<00:01:17.840> all<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.170> don't

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
somewhat authentic all right I don't

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.510 
somewhat authentic all right I don't
know<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> don't<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.250> had<00:01:20.369> two

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
know I don't think that they had two

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.270 
know I don't think that they had two
scopes<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> gun

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.700 

the<00:01:25.090> gun<00:01:25.300> sounds<00:01:25.630> really<00:01:25.840> good<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.140> very<00:01:26.170> loud

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
the gun sounds really good is very loud

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.730 
the gun sounds really good is very loud
as<00:01:27.610> I'm<00:01:27.880> sure<00:01:28.060> most<00:01:28.780> guns<00:01:29.080> were<00:01:29.230> back<00:01:29.440> in<00:01:29.590> that

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
as I'm sure most guns were back in that

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.000 
as I'm sure most guns were back in that
time<00:01:31.050> silencing<00:01:32.050> technology<00:01:32.530> wasn't<00:01:32.710> great

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
time silencing technology wasn't great

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.950 
time silencing technology wasn't great
we'll<00:01:33.640> take<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.820> look<00:01:33.970> at<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.120> last<00:01:34.360> attachment

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
we'll take a look at the last attachment

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.490

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
here really quick so there's a silencer

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.270 
here really quick so there's a silencer
here<00:01:38.740> now<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.310> silences<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:42.940> gun

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280

that<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.680> scope<00:01:51.520> there<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.180> in<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:52.930> most

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110
