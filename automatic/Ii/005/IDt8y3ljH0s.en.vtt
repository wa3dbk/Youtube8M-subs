 that when there is an extension of this no 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.160
 very well we very excited about 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.020
 bring them more news is that lately 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.900
 has brought many news and I have not brought 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.810
 gameplays but well I'm going to replace the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.130
 channel, I'll promise you soon, but 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.070
 what are we going guys out 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.100
 officially images of what it is at 0.9 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.040
 point zero now are two 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.540
 takes or the question and the truth are 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.300
 pretty good so good we're going to 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.040
 take a look 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.420
 good as you can see this the first 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.180
 good image is going to be the first tweet 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.870
 how good is it going to translate that says that 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.519
 it seems that in the nexus 5 that is a 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.899
 pretty pretty good phone to me 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:59.980
 seem can run minecraft and with a 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.409
 Reed distance of 16 junks per se 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.409
 they did not know it in fact in 1.7 of 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:09.610
 minecraft ps the render is no longer handled 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.369
 artists like fire extreme tiny good 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.940
 that is now handled by chung the truth 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.039
 I'm not too sure 4 are 16 unx but 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.720
 well it 's more or less I guess that's what 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.610
 longer since the longest 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.460
 you can as you can see this image that 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.060
 is here already says that is the 0.9 point 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.350
 zero alpha build 1 but officially not 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.420
 has left guys right now I'm going to 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.920
 talk more about that but good more than 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.790
 nothing in this image is supposed to be 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.770
 world is infinite so you can see it 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.990
 Obviously, you can not perceive that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.280
 it's infinite because we can not 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.590
 it seems like a normal world of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.930
 minecraft seen from the best of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.460
 Some edge of the map goes like this and so 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.680
 is all we are going to tell you in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.860
 this image is that unfortunately it says 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.110
 that says tomás or that a nexus 5 with its 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.600
 full battery only playing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.710
 minecraft and the battery lasts 15 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.830
 minutes 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.080
 well it's 15 minutes playing minecraft and 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.090
 with this render distance and more than anything 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 let's say that more than anything what weigh you 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.160
 let's say to the battery what makes it 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.350
 drains those worlds too fast 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.720
 infinite I do not know why this happens but 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.180
 well he says in fact he was came several 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.890
 tomaso tweets and they say that if 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.270
 can fix but not at all or 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.070
 be that both can be left with more 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.680
 game time but no longer at all 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.030
 unless they do not use the vision of 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.010
 so long distance 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.890
 I was seeing that if in fact they are going to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.920
 go down not only so it's too much and that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.959
 so if um 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.000
 a nexus 5 that is the best phones 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.580
 now I can not stand it imagine the others 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.910
 phones the old ones do not 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.010
 another thing that I forgot to tell you is 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.720
 also that in this photo we have several 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.850
 caves already included that is already that is 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.550
 official tomás or he said it in another tweet 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.320
 but well let's see here but in this one 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.140
 in this image that you are seeing there are already 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.660
 caves under the worlds ok just for 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.300
 if they asked him ok so so good 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.450
 let's move on to what is the next 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.780
 image as you can see this tweet says 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.480
 you already get to perceive let's say more 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.010
 what is the infinite world as they can 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.140
 see are very far away 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.330
 according to here the tweet says that they are 512 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.459
 blocks away which you think 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.070
 something amazing because remember if not 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.340
 they knew the worlds are called craft and they 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.200
 supposed to be 251 by 251 at least 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.330
 up to 0.8 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.849
 and well here obviously from the server a 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.050
 little hole which allows us to see what 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.660
 what are things like they can see 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.430
 they see caves where they still do not 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.280
 has loaded the map well that always 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.690
 it usually happens do not worry but as 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.780
 can see being in games which I 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.080
 Excites not quite and here 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.360
 mentioned that also in this in this 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.690
 Distance view elevates to 14 fps 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.190
 frames per second is not that bad but 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.350
 It is not so good to tell ourselves that 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.170
 considerable medium 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.440
 well, to mention Tomás that in five years 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.590
 they are thinking that is when they are going to leave 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.480
 phones or tablets maybe good 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.090
 able to withstand what is going in 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.760
 kraft and already to the fullest 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.820
 let's say that with all its functions at 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.830
 maximum render distance infinite worlds 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.450
 completely because good second more or 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.460
 right now no device is capable of 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.940
 bear minecraft and blue they have 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.830
 complete not even the ipads 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.210
 the new ones I know that maybe the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.400
 good habits of android leave 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.970
 in the comments that of the best 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:43.420
 afternoons no longer I think it's the nexus the 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.420
 as it is called this the of 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.220
 well not only would be better 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.200
 scales but the newest those of 10 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.120
 good inch and you left us 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.600
 the comments on android are not much 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.949
 and then this is all in this image as 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.510
 can see is pretty good can you 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.190
 perceive a more infinite world 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.110
 and here they are great they can see more 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.070
 great since they have been deposed from 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.260
 before to mention is that the the 0.9 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.930
 zero point the wild has not come out here 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.300
 as you can see in this tweet of jb and 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.010
 now they are stopping they are going to remove a 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.430
 google + group where they had put 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.650
 according to the beta of the 0.8 and they are going to create a 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.260
 new group for 0.9 I do not know what 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.880
 it refers to exactly this but it 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.370
 suppose that they are going to make a new group 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.870
 where they will be able to download the 0.9 but 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.960
 remember that it is only for users 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.510
 of android that have bought minecraft 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.630
 unless someone can put it in 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.040
 download let's say pirate does not and another 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.930
 what's here can see in this 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.790
 written is that if unfortunately that 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.230
 still in a couple of months or in a 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.300
 couple of months is not even going to come out the 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.920
 official version I thought I was going to 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:57.920
 leave more or less for then for February 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.980
 or March but not more or less for March 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.810
 more or less will come out what is the beta 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.910
 from the area point rebounded will be the first 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.360
 so there's a lot of time left guys there 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.670
 What can you expect? You have to be patient 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.480
 because they are already saying loading not everything 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.770
 very well 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.260
 also now I will comment something last 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.210
 that biomes already when it's finished 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.660
 let's say you program well what they are 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.780
 the infinite worlds this is going to start 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.580
 work in the new biomes and thus the 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.680
 that our boy uses this little 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.230
 information is something quick more than anything 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.580
 go first images are already giving yes 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.790
 I will bring you new images and 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.800
 well nothing guys us another video
