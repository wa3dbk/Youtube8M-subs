00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.730
 Sicilian defense chess 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.330
 the defense said eliana is one of the choices 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.280
 more reliable against 4 along with 5 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.730
 that we have seen most of the 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.480
 opening of the courses so far 65 is a 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.180
 of the most popular colors among black 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.669
 Sicilian is extremely common in all 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.920
 levels of play because it usually takes 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.640
 complicated tactical positions with 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.739
 opportunities for both sides 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.930
 in the next election we will see others 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.109
 types of aperture not yet covered in the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.180
 but you should already be familiar with 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:53.030
 with the openings of the king pawn and 4 and 5 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.809
 and with the Scandinavian defense and four 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.629
 five already seen in the opening course 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:05.089
 the following scheme and 45 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.460
 65 although not advance pawn 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.830
 shake black to develop no part 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.600
 is a very useful movement 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.250
 with the purpose of counterattacking the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.310
 advancement of the role of 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.369
 without losing the central participant 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.799
 white plays a horse f3 develop the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.799
 horse in the center and preparing the advance 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:30.020
 of 4 planning to recapture with the horse 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:32.869
 and gaining time to center it in 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.610
 church game of 'six black to this 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.820
 already has a wide choice of 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:47.439
 available alternatives movements 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:51.710
 most popular would be a horse 16 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.189
 the e6 both took the game system 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.140
 Completely different 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.920
 the difference between them is a matter of 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.479
 taste 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.780
 many great masters prefer the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.820
 game scheme that appears after being 5 and 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.549
 this flexibility to use pedestrians 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:14.000
 is one of the reasons why this 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:16.550
 year is so popular four fighting game 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.080
 by the central control and opens the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.940
 for the remaining development of their 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.230
 parts 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.019
 this is a standard movement almost all 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.170
 the so-called open variants have opted 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.480
 to move forward 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.670
 at some point the positions that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.670
 result are classified as closed 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.540
 of the church with 64 blacks capture the pawn 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.270
 of 4 fulfilling the purpose of the move 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.630
 if 5 that is the white tek 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.430
 establish the two center pedestrians 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.160
 some arguments that from 4 is an error 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.410
 because white people give up a 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.569
 central dog for one of class 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.390
 however most players choose 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.610
 namely by four open Sicilian 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.830
 due to the winning white activity 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.019
 development of its parts, which 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.150
 most of the time it compensates the concession 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.799
 positional made the game naturally 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.799
 dynamic and full of opportunities 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.920
 white takes a horse a horse take 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.200
 of four is to capture with the horse is more 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.209
 reasonable than with the lady following the 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.700
 principles of opening or 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.480
 never develop your lady in stages 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.480
 game initials 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.340
 Also note the advantage of white 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.489
 development 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.690
 besides the activity of church pieces a 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.290
 horse is six 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.620
 the king's horse is rarely developed 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:51.540
 to another house that is not 6 black now 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:54.810
 attacks the pawn of and four playing 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.070
 horses and 3 naturally white 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.709
 continued with the development of 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.709
 Lady's horse defend the plane of 4 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:13.840
 now black goes with x6 again 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.840
 blacks would have many movement options 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:22.610
 playing for example to 6 would widely 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.390
 variant najdorf variant that has its 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.680
 thanks to cm miguel in georgia and 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.620
 preferred variant of many times 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:36.110
 world champions boxing xvii and gary 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:40.790
 kasparov and 6 would take the variant 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.640
 chevening while horses and 6 is 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.890
 known as classical variant 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.960
 these options are also well known 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.620
 g6 characterizes the variant known as 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.290
 the dragon or sicilian black dragon is 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.570
 chooses to infect the bishop, which places 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.570
 pressure on the newspaper at 1h 18 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.090
 many great masters have a preference 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.919
 by this opening because it provides the 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.790
 great black possibilities against 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.070
 attack 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:19.460
 all related to the bishop located 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:22.100
 in this white diagonal follow with bishop and 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.700
 3 to develop a part in support of 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.700
 four 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.569
 he follows is natural bishop g7 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.580
 remember to always position the bishop 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.680
 after advancing the characteristic pawn of the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.509
 Quiet order to cover the 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.740
 weaknesses caused by spy advancement 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.719
 f3 puppy 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.050
 by this move prevented him from 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:52.590
 can play horse g 4 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.699
 attacking the bishop and 3 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:06:01.569
 The idea of ​​white is to play lady of 2 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:05.729
 the channel of the lady to eventually 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.729
 start a final attack by the king 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.780
 this form of game typical of this 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:14.530
 pedestrian structure is known as 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.810
 attack the washable and is considered the 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:22.479
 more challenging approach with Tatiana 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.690
 black dragon follow with final rock of the 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.690
 King 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:33.849
 braga play lady of 2 preparing for the 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:35.710
 channel of the black lady game end the c6 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.569
 develop the horse toward the 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.810
 center 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:43.150
 white women play bishops and four 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.009
 this kombis variant and four but also 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.879
 would be possible to follow with the 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.770
 big rock with cattle represent 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:53.229
 develop their last minor piece 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:57.219
 the bishop for 17 and prepares to bring 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:59.909
 the tower to be 80 against game on 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:59.909
 colombia to be 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.770
 always remember that your movements in the 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.599
 should be directly connected to the 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.319
 related to your plans in the middle of 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.909
 game 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.490
 even though we are seeing stage 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:14.289
 separate you should employ strategies 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.779
 that connect the way you 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:19.930
 develops its pieces with a strategy that 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:23.770
 Do you intend to follow whites at last? 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.839
 lady channel as you can remember 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.900
 we analyzed similar positions of 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:35.849
 rocks opposed in previous elections 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:39.580
 the white bread advance h4 and then h5 

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:42.839
 play bishop h6 in order to achieve a 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.839
 attack the colony play 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.509
 meanwhile they will try to create 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:08:00.159
 against game in the direction of the white river 

00:07:47.509 --> 00:08:03.590
 through horse and 5 2 and 8 and damar 5 

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:04.490
 this position to one of the most challenging 

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.650
 due to the large number of 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.490
 tactical possibilities that both 

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.490
 sides have
