00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
medium-low freezing temperatures so here

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.760 
medium-low freezing temperatures so here
is<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:55.010> frozen<00:00:56.010> solid

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770

to<00:01:03.660> use<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.899> again<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:06.710> stick<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to use that again is to stick it on the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.660 
to use that again is to stick it on the
old<00:01:09.170> stove<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.540> just

check yep got some loads on the stove
there<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.700> anyway<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.840> should<00:01:22.250> defroster

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
there so anyway that should defroster

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.109 
there so anyway that should defroster
shortly<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> moment<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.770> truth<00:01:26.119> this

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
shortly so it's the moment of truth this

is the eight gigabyte SBS card that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.520 
is the eight gigabyte SBS card that
yesterday<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.990> left<00:01:31.920> outside<00:01:32.630> under<00:01:33.630> water<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
yesterday I left outside under water the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.649 
yesterday I left outside under water the
water<00:01:34.740> froze<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.729> was<00:01:35.939> turned<00:01:36.180> into<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.479> block

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
water froze this was turned into a block

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.310 
water froze this was turned into a block
of<00:01:36.689> ice

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
of ice

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.340 
of ice
I<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:38.130> melted<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> ice<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.689> log<00:01:39.840> fire<00:01:40.140> in

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
I then melted the ice on the log fire in

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.999 
I then melted the ice on the log fire in
the<00:01:40.439> cabin<00:01:40.640> dried<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.909> card<00:01:42.119> off<00:01:42.299> overnight

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
the cabin dried the card off overnight

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.289 
the cabin dried the card off overnight
nothing<00:01:44.009> more<00:01:44.130> sophisticated<00:01:44.759> than<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.119> log

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
nothing more sophisticated than a log

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.630 
nothing more sophisticated than a log
fire<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.950> now<00:01:46.950> I'm<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
fire and now I'm going to see if the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
fire and now I'm going to see if the
card<00:01:47.880> works<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.479> pretty<00:01:48.960> sure<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
card works I'm pretty sure it will I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.880 
card works I'm pretty sure it will I
know<00:01:49.799> these<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.460> very<00:01:50.490> very<00:01:50.939> robust<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> put

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
know these to be very very robust so put

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.200 
know these to be very very robust so put
the<00:01:52.979> card<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> camera<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:55.880> there<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.060> go

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the card in the camera and there you go

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.630 
the card in the camera and there you go
there<00:01:57.719> are<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> thumbnails<00:01:58.320> no<00:01:59.070> problems<00:01:59.520> at

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
there are the thumbnails no problems at

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.530 
there are the thumbnails no problems at
all<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.409> have<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> look<00:02:01.820> just<00:02:02.820> check<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> files

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
all and have a look just check the files

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.620 
all and have a look just check the files
playback<00:02:04.110> correctly<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:05.909> indeed

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
playback correctly and they do indeed

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.839 
playback correctly and they do indeed
that's<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.110> footage<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.619> shot<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.640> card

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that's the footage I shot on the card

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.739 
that's the footage I shot on the card
before<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.479> froze<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.020> into<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> block<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> ice
