Craigslist<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.859> not<00:00:20.070> really<00:00:20.250> important<00:00:20.609> but

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670

through<00:00:47.250> YouTube<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.450> using<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> heat<00:00:49.170> gun

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
through YouTube that using the heat gun

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.740 
through YouTube that using the heat gun
scraping<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.789> pulling<00:00:51.149> using<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> heat<00:00:51.719> gun

scraping and pulling on and on takes

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.600 
scraping and pulling on and on takes
quite<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> while<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.949> works<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
quite a while but it works and then you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.950 
quite a while but it works and then you
leaves<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.239> nasty<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> residue<00:00:59.899> going<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
leaves a nasty kind of residue going to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
leaves a nasty kind of residue going to
get<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.320> somehow<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.640> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
get that off somehow so we got this

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
get that off somehow so we got this
chair<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.420> pick<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> pole<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.680> from<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:04.979> old

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
chair from pick a pole it's from an old

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.510 
chair from pick a pole it's from an old
van<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.680> bolted<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.830> using<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.970> automotive<00:01:09.750> bolts

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
van I bolted it using a automotive bolts

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.100 
van I bolted it using a automotive bolts
into<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> steel<00:01:11.880> subframe<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.659> well<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
into the steel subframe as well as the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.950 
into the steel subframe as well as the
aluminum<00:01:13.530> frame<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.549> that'll<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.960> it's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
aluminum frame I think that'll be it's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.510 
aluminum frame I think that'll be it's
probably<00:01:16.229> even<00:01:16.350> safer<00:01:16.740> than<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> chair<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
probably even safer than the chair that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.230 
probably even safer than the chair that
came<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.420> truck<00:01:20.570> anyway

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.320 

put<00:01:25.240> down<00:01:25.450> some<00:01:27.330> subflooring<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:31.270> you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
put down some subflooring I think you

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.690 
put down some subflooring I think you
can<00:01:31.480> see<00:01:31.660> a<00:01:31.690> pretty<00:01:31.870> well<00:01:32.110> there<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.620> some

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
can see a pretty well there and some

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.570 
can see a pretty well there and some
structural<00:01:36.700> support<00:01:38.040> let's<00:01:39.040> see<00:01:39.280> where's<00:01:39.520> a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
structural support let's see where's a

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:48.210 
structural support let's see where's a
good<00:01:39.700> shot<00:01:45.030> okay<00:01:46.030> well<00:01:46.270> these<00:01:47.110> beams<00:01:47.470> they<00:01:48.070> go

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
good shot okay well these beams they go

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.560 
good shot okay well these beams they go
up<00:01:48.430> through<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.940> ceiling<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:53.850> down<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.450> the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
up through the ceiling and down to the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.700 
up through the ceiling and down to the
floor<00:01:55.780> they<00:01:55.960> don't<00:01:56.110> go<00:01:56.200> through<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.500> floor

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
floor they don't go through the floor

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.260 
floor they don't go through the floor
but<00:01:56.890> they<00:01:56.980> go<00:01:57.100> down<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:57.940> they're

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
but they go down to it and they're

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.560 
but they go down to it and they're
attached<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.470> subfloor<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:01.030> wheel<00:02:01.270> wells

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
attached to the subfloor the wheel wells

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.140 
attached to the subfloor the wheel wells
are<00:02:01.840> covered<00:02:02.170> with<00:02:02.320> wood<00:02:02.500> as<00:02:02.620> well<00:02:03.150> and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
are covered with wood as well and

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.420 
are covered with wood as well and
everything<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.690> screwed<00:02:05.380> together<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:08.430> hope

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
everything is screwed together and hope

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.350 
everything is screwed together and hope
it's<00:02:09.580> going<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.760> be<00:02:09.850> strong<00:02:10.090> enough<00:02:10.119> to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
it's going to be strong enough to

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.910 
it's going to be strong enough to
survive<00:02:10.570> an<00:02:10.869> impact<00:02:11.200> if<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.500> comes<00:02:11.710> down<00:02:11.800> to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
survive an impact if it comes down to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.640 
survive an impact if it comes down to
that<00:02:12.160> but<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.630> feel<00:02:13.630> confident<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.230> my<00:02:14.260> efforts

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
that but I feel confident in my efforts

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.430 
that but I feel confident in my efforts
that<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:14.950> will<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:16.870> didn't<00:02:17.050> want<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.230> use

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
that it will so we didn't want to use

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.580 
that it will so we didn't want to use
fiberglass<00:02:17.970> insulation<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.900> we've<00:02:20.170> used<00:02:20.380> this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
fiberglass insulation so we've used this

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.610 
fiberglass insulation so we've used this
bubble<00:02:21.010> wrap<00:02:21.960> it's<00:02:22.960> a<00:02:23.200> little<00:02:23.470> more

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
bubble wrap it's a little more

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.260 
bubble wrap it's a little more
environmentally<00:02:24.250> friendly<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.640> think<00:02:24.940> as<00:02:25.090> well

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
environmentally friendly I think as well

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.560 
environmentally friendly I think as well
as<00:02:25.420> for<00:02:25.630> our<00:02:25.810> sake<00:02:26.290> as<00:02:26.440> well<00:02:26.470> also<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.570> redwood

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
as for our sake as well also and redwood

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.830 
as for our sake as well also and redwood
slats<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:29.170> top<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.530> wall<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:30.750> got<00:02:31.750> all

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
slats on top of the wall and got all

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.580 
slats on top of the wall and got all
this<00:02:31.959> used<00:02:33.750> flooring<00:02:34.750> from<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:35.020> buddy<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.290> mine

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
this used flooring from a buddy of mine

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.080 
this used flooring from a buddy of mine
