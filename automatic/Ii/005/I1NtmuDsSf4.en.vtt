equivalent ounces today that will go to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.780 
equivalent ounces today that will go to
three<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.590> half<00:03:13.620> if<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.280> pull<00:03:14.430> off<00:03:14.460> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
three and a half if we can pull off the

three and a half if we can pull off the
confirmatory<00:03:15.090> drill<00:03:15.450> program<00:03:15.720> we<00:03:15.810> expect

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
confirmatory drill program we expect

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.870

there's<00:03:16.710> upside<00:03:17.040> beyond<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.760> objective

there's upside beyond that the objective
they<00:03:18.330> are<00:03:18.390> five<00:03:18.630> million<00:03:18.870> ounces<00:03:18.960> and<00:03:19.350> that

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
they are five million ounces and that

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.710 
they are five million ounces and that

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
tough times now but we do the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.600 
tough times now but we do the
exploration<00:03:37.440> work<00:03:37.590> find<00:03:37.830> opportunities<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
exploration work find opportunities and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.280 
exploration work find opportunities and
that<00:03:38.700> could<00:03:38.820> help<00:03:38.910> fund<00:03:39.150> our<00:03:39.270> project<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.140> it's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
that could help fund our project so it's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.770 
that could help fund our project so it's
all<00:03:40.830> options<00:03:41.220> are<00:03:41.340> open<00:03:41.370> yeah<00:03:42.030> we're<00:03:42.570> lucky

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
all options are open yeah we're lucky

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.050 
all options are open yeah we're lucky
that<00:03:42.810> way<00:03:43.050> yes<00:03:43.200> yes<00:03:43.470> great<00:03:43.800> well<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.370> presume<00:03:44.880> if

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
that way yes yes great well I presume if

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.240 
that way yes yes great well I presume if
the<00:03:45.180> 2.8<00:03:45.810> million<00:03:46.050> ounces<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.770> so<00:03:46.980> far

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
the 2.8 million ounces you have so far

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.460 
the 2.8 million ounces you have so far
as<00:03:47.490> I<00:03:47.550> read<00:03:48.000> also<00:03:48.210> that<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.600> want<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.110> update

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
as I read also that you want to update

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.040 
as I read also that you want to update
the<00:03:49.920> resource<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.180> say<00:03:51.420> something<00:03:51.720> about

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
the resource can you say something about

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.690 
the resource can you say something about
for<00:03:52.260> next<00:03:52.470> year<00:03:52.620> what<00:03:52.770> is<00:03:52.860> expected<00:03:53.280> maybe

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
for next year what is expected maybe

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.010 
for next year what is expected maybe
yeah<00:03:54.090> we're<00:03:54.210> going<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.390> be<00:03:54.450> starting<00:03:54.780> any<00:03:54.840> day

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
yeah we're going to be starting any day

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.600 
yeah we're going to be starting any day
now<00:03:55.140> in<00:03:55.230> fact<00:03:55.380> we<00:03:55.500> got<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.620> confirmation<00:03:56.250> drill

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
now in fact we got a confirmation drill

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.060 
now in fact we got a confirmation drill
program<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:57.090> will<00:03:57.150> be<00:03:57.300> getting<00:03:57.630> underway<00:03:57.840> so

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
program that will be getting underway so

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.980 
program that will be getting underway so
if<00:03:59.070> we<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.670> confirm<00:04:00.180> historic<00:04:00.600> data<00:04:00.720> with

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
if we can confirm historic data with

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.780 
if we can confirm historic data with
some<00:04:01.200> current<00:04:01.470> drilling<00:04:01.740> it<00:04:02.250> allows<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:02.700> to

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
some current drilling it allows you to

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.130 
some current drilling it allows you to
be<00:04:02.910> maybe<00:04:03.360> less<00:04:03.570> conservative<00:04:03.900> your

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
be maybe less conservative your

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.780 
be maybe less conservative your
assumptions<00:04:04.470> or<00:04:04.560> more<00:04:04.770> modern<00:04:05.340> day<00:04:05.490> with<00:04:05.670> your

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
assumptions or more modern day with your

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.160 
assumptions or more modern day with your
metallurgical<00:04:06.330> assumptions<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:06.960> forth

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
metallurgical assumptions and so forth

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.290 
metallurgical assumptions and so forth
silver<00:04:08.040> was<00:04:08.070> never<00:04:08.310> included<00:04:08.490> we<00:04:09.030> know<00:04:09.120> it's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
silver was never included we know it's

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.700 
silver was never included we know it's
in<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.450> deposit<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.230> things<00:04:10.410> like<00:04:10.530> that

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
in the deposit so things like that

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.470 
in the deposit so things like that
should<00:04:10.950> allow<00:04:11.160> us<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.460> go<00:04:11.580> from<00:04:11.700> 2.8<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.360> as

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
should allow us to go from 2.8 to as

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.600 
should allow us to go from 2.8 to as
much<00:04:12.690> as<00:04:12.840> 3.7<00:04:13.470> purely<00:04:13.860> on<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> confirmation

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.580 
much as 3.7 purely on a confirmation
basis<00:04:14.970> but<00:04:15.570> we<00:04:15.630> have<00:04:15.660> full<00:04:15.840> Treasury<00:04:16.260> we<00:04:16.440> also

basis but we have full Treasury we also

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.050 
basis but we have full Treasury we also
want<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.950> test<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.220> strike<00:04:17.430> length<00:04:17.640> because

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
want to test the strike length because

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.820 
want to test the strike length because
there's<00:04:18.270> gold<00:04:18.840> mineralization<00:04:19.200> we<00:04:19.620> believe

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
there's gold mineralization we believe

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.530 
there's gold mineralization we believe

rich areas that were never further

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.270 
rich areas that were never further
explored<00:04:27.140> because<00:04:27.410> they<00:04:27.530> were<00:04:27.590> poor<00:04:28.010> in<00:04:28.040> base

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.720 
million i think is a realistic goal if
we<00:04:33.620> can<00:04:33.710> get<00:04:33.800> there<00:04:34.010> next<00:04:34.220> year<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.460> would<00:04:34.640> be

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
we can get there next year that would be

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.430 
we can get there next year that would be
