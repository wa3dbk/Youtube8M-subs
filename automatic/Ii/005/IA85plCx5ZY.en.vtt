00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
condition to record a video to test the

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.040 
condition to record a video to test the
camera<00:00:30.070> performance<00:00:30.820> because<00:00:31.210> in<00:00:31.660> a<00:00:31.779> great

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050

but<00:00:56.889> i<00:00:56.920> think<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.429> cpu<00:00:57.999> on<00:00:58.149> this<00:00:59.010> phone<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.309> a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
but i think the cpu on this phone is a

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.849 
but i think the cpu on this phone is a
little<00:01:00.729> bit<00:01:00.850> underpowered<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:02.530> 1080p
