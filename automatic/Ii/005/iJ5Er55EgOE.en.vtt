00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
up with like we did the last time with

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.360 
up with like we did the last time with
the<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.520> Hollow<00:01:41.730> rares<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.510> our<00:01:42.660> earlier

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
the not Hollow rares with our earlier

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.040 
the not Hollow rares with our earlier
early<00:01:44.370> primal<00:01:44.820> crashes<00:01:45.210> clash<00:01:45.450> opening<00:01:45.960> but

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
early primal crashes clash opening but

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.300 
early primal crashes clash opening but
that<00:01:46.200> doesn't<00:01:46.440> mean<00:01:46.530> anything<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.010> three

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that doesn't mean anything we got three

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.730 
that doesn't mean anything we got three
more<00:01:47.340> packs<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.970> go<00:01:48.150> so<00:01:48.870> I<00:01:48.900> think<00:01:49.410> right<00:01:49.560> now

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
more packs to go so I think right now

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.420 
more packs to go so I think right now
actually<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.940> zero<00:01:51.600> points<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.890> don't

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
actually we have zero points I don't

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.350 
actually we have zero points I don't
know<00:01:53.490> how<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> point<00:01:53.910> system<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.300> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
know how the point system is going to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.580 
know how the point system is going to
work<00:01:54.480> just<00:01:54.510> yet<00:01:54.690> we<00:01:54.840> didn't<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.290> over

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
work just yet we didn't really go over

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800 
work just yet we didn't really go over
that<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.250> usually<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:57.600> one

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that but usually I think that's one

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
that but usually I think that's one
point<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.260> reverse<00:01:58.620> rare<00:01:58.950> two<00:01:59.190> points<00:01:59.490> for

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
point for a reverse rare two points for

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.810 
point for a reverse rare two points for
a<00:01:59.640> hollow<00:01:59.909> three<00:02:00.780> points<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.350> any<00:02:01.440> X<00:02:01.710> 4<00:02:02.280> 4<00:02:02.610> full

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
a hollow three points for any X 4 4 full
