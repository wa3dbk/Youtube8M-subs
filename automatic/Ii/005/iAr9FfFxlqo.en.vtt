00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.840 

so<00:00:05.900> have<00:00:06.230> you<00:00:06.350> ever<00:00:06.529> considered<00:00:06.710> whether<00:00:07.609> you

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
so have you ever considered whether you

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.750 
so have you ever considered whether you
could<00:00:08.029> put<00:00:08.270> an<00:00:08.480> EFS<00:00:09.320> lens<00:00:09.620> on<00:00:09.980> a<00:00:10.040> full<00:00:10.549> frame

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
could put an EFS lens on a full frame

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.359 
could put an EFS lens on a full frame
body<00:00:11.139> why<00:00:12.139> would<00:00:12.320> you<00:00:12.410> want<00:00:12.559> to<00:00:12.590> do<00:00:12.740> this<00:00:12.889> well

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369 
body why would you want to do this well

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.699 
body why would you want to do this well
in<00:00:13.670> most<00:00:13.879> cases<00:00:14.119> you<00:00:14.570> wouldn't<00:00:14.780> there's<00:00:15.590> a

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
in most cases you wouldn't there's a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.000 
in most cases you wouldn't there's a
good<00:00:15.920> reason<00:00:15.949> why<00:00:16.340> EFS<00:00:17.180> lenses<00:00:17.690> do<00:00:18.320> not<00:00:18.529> fit<00:00:18.800> on

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
good reason why EFS lenses do not fit on

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.349 
good reason why EFS lenses do not fit on
full<00:00:19.220> frame<00:00:19.460> bodies<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:20.000> I'll<00:00:20.060> get<00:00:20.210> to<00:00:20.240> that

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
full frame bodies and I'll get to that

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.190 
full frame bodies and I'll get to that
in<00:00:20.540> a<00:00:20.570> minute<00:00:20.690> but<00:00:21.680> there<00:00:22.220> is<00:00:22.430> one<00:00:23.390> or<00:00:23.510> two<00:00:23.660> EFS

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
in a minute but there is one or two EFS

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.680 
in a minute but there is one or two EFS
lenses<00:00:24.560> that<00:00:24.740> do<00:00:25.040> work<00:00:25.370> on<00:00:25.760> a<00:00:25.820> full<00:00:26.210> frame<00:00:26.360> body

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
lenses that do work on a full frame body

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.590 
lenses that do work on a full frame body
and<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.590> this<00:00:28.400> exercise<00:00:28.789> actually<00:00:29.390> works

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
and so this exercise actually works

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.570 
and so this exercise actually works
quite<00:00:29.750> well<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.350> how<00:00:30.920> we're<00:00:31.160> going<00:00:31.280> to<00:00:31.340> do

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
quite well and how we're going to do

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.880 
quite well and how we're going to do
this<00:00:31.820> it's<00:00:32.419> going<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.660> use<00:00:32.809> an<00:00:33.050> extension<00:00:33.469> tube

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
this it's going to use an extension tube

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.390 
this it's going to use an extension tube
to<00:00:34.520> convert<00:00:34.940> an<00:00:35.210> EFS<00:00:36.110> lens<00:00:36.379> into<00:00:36.739> an<00:00:36.920> EF<00:00:37.310> lens

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
to convert an EFS lens into an EF lens

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.740 
to convert an EFS lens into an EF lens
so<00:00:40.400> let's<00:00:40.579> take<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.760> look<00:00:41.030> at<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.420> difference

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
so let's take a look at the difference

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.150 
so let's take a look at the difference
between<00:00:41.810> an<00:00:42.260> EF<00:00:42.890> lens<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:43.489> an<00:00:43.550> EFS<00:00:44.000> lens<00:00:45.160> the

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
between an EF lens and an EFS lens the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.040 
between an EF lens and an EFS lens the
easiest<00:00:46.670> way<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:46.880> recognize<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.660> difference

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
easiest way to recognize the difference

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
easiest way to recognize the difference
is<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:50.149> EF<00:00:50.750> lens<00:00:51.020> has<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.320> red<00:00:51.590> dot<00:00:51.800> and

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
is that the EF lens has a red dot and

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.290 
is that the EF lens has a red dot and
the<00:00:52.940> EFS<00:00:53.600> lens<00:00:53.960> has<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.950> white<00:00:55.130> dot<00:00:55.370> they<00:00:56.149> of

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
the EFS lens has a white dot they of

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.840 
the EFS lens has a white dot they of
course<00:00:56.570> also<00:00:57.110> say<00:00:57.350> on<00:00:57.500> them<00:00:57.680> somewhere<00:00:57.920> EFS<00:00:58.610> or

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
course also say on them somewhere EFS or

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.420 
course also say on them somewhere EFS or
if<00:00:59.079> but<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.380> dots<00:01:00.590> are<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.890> easiest<00:01:01.219> way<00:01:01.399> to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
if but the dots are the easiest way to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.170 
if but the dots are the easiest way to
recognize<00:01:01.850> them<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.800> EFS<00:01:04.280> lens<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.909> designed

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
recognize them the EFS lens is designed

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.429 
recognize them the EFS lens is designed
for<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.259> crop<00:01:06.500> sensor<00:01:07.100> cameras<00:01:07.969> such<00:01:08.149> as<00:01:08.180> the

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
for the crop sensor cameras such as the

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.349 
for the crop sensor cameras such as the
7d<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.969> 60d<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.869> 600<00:01:12.469> or<00:01:12.560> 550<00:01:13.130> D<00:01:13.340> or<00:01:13.819> the<00:01:13.939> rebel

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
7d the 60d the 600 or 550 D or the rebel

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:20.919 
7d the 60d the 600 or 550 D or the rebel
cameras<00:01:15.999> the<00:01:16.999> main<00:01:17.209> difference<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:19.929> the

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
cameras the main difference is that the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.230 
cameras the main difference is that the
lens<00:01:21.170> mount<00:01:21.590> thread<00:01:22.039> is<00:01:22.279> slightly<00:01:22.729> different

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
lens mount thread is slightly different

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.929 
lens mount thread is slightly different
on<00:01:23.389> an<00:01:23.689> EFS<00:01:24.170> lens<00:01:24.469> and<00:01:25.279> the<00:01:25.369> reason<00:01:25.729> for<00:01:25.759> that

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
on an EFS lens and the reason for that

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.529 
on an EFS lens and the reason for that
is<00:01:26.350> EFS<00:01:27.350> lenses<00:01:27.939> protrude<00:01:28.939> a<00:01:29.090> little<00:01:29.329> more

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
is EFS lenses protrude a little more

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.010 
is EFS lenses protrude a little more
than<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.499> EF<00:01:30.740> counterpart<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.479> reason<00:01:32.869> why

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
than the EF counterpart the reason why

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.260 
than the EF counterpart the reason why
they<00:01:33.200> protrude<00:01:33.679> a<00:01:33.799> little<00:01:34.039> more<00:01:34.219> is<00:01:34.609> so<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
they protrude a little more is so the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.209 
they protrude a little more is so the
lens<00:01:35.509> can<00:01:35.719> get<00:01:35.869> closer<00:01:36.139> to<00:01:36.469> their<00:01:36.649> crop<00:01:36.889> frame

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
lens can get closer to their crop frame

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.190 
lens can get closer to their crop frame
in<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:38.659> crop<00:01:39.139> sensor<00:01:39.590> cameras<00:01:40.039> and<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
in the crop sensor cameras and the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.419 
in the crop sensor cameras and the
reason<00:01:42.499> why<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.679> thread<00:01:43.069> is<00:01:43.189> slightly

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
reason why the thread is slightly

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.190 
reason why the thread is slightly
different<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:44.029> so<00:01:44.539> that<00:01:44.719> you<00:01:44.810> cannot<00:01:47.200> force

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
different is so that you cannot force

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.510 
different is so that you cannot force
and<00:01:48.529> EFS<00:01:48.979> lens<00:01:49.279> into<00:01:49.639> a<00:01:50.149> full-frame<00:01:50.569> camera<00:01:51.520> it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
and EFS lens into a full-frame camera it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.650 
and EFS lens into a full-frame camera it
just<00:01:52.759> will<00:01:52.880> not<00:01:53.029> go<00:01:53.209> in

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.250 

that<00:01:58.660> said<00:01:58.960> however<00:02:00.660> with<00:02:01.660> a<00:02:01.690> little<00:02:01.990> bit<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.140> a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
that said however with a little bit of a

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.820 
that said however with a little bit of a
trick<00:02:02.530> we<00:02:03.160> can<00:02:03.190> get<00:02:03.550> an<00:02:03.760> EFS<00:02:04.210> lens<00:02:04.510> onto<00:02:04.930> a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
trick we can get an EFS lens onto a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.400 
trick we can get an EFS lens onto a
full-frame<00:02:06.580> camera<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.930> trick<00:02:08.170> we're<00:02:08.290> going

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
full-frame camera the trick we're going

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.330 
full-frame camera the trick we're going
to<00:02:08.470> use<00:02:08.710> is<00:02:09.930> an<00:02:10.930> extension<00:02:11.290> tube<00:02:11.650> extension

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
to use is an extension tube extension

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.380 
to use is an extension tube extension
tubes<00:02:12.730> generally<00:02:13.360> used<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:14.310> allow<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.700> better

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
tubes generally used to allow a better

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.780 
tubes generally used to allow a better
macro<00:02:16.990> feature<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.560> any<00:02:17.800> lens<00:02:18.100> but<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.700> this

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
macro feature on any lens but in this

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.020 
macro feature on any lens but in this
case<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.360> if<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.320> an<00:02:20.740> extension<00:02:21.130> tube<00:02:21.550> can

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
case and if it an extension tube can

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.990 
case and if it an extension tube can
take<00:02:22.300> both<00:02:22.660> EFS<00:02:23.170> lenses<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.800> EF<00:02:24.070> lenses<00:02:24.460> so

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
take both EFS lenses and EF lenses so

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.850 
take both EFS lenses and EF lenses so
that<00:02:25.150> can<00:02:25.270> also<00:02:25.450> function<00:02:26.020> as<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.230> converter<00:02:26.710> of

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
that can also function as a converter of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.720 
that can also function as a converter of
sorts<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.240> we<00:02:28.360> take<00:02:28.570> this<00:02:29.130> 18<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.280> 35

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.210 
sorts so if we take this 18 to 35
millimeter<00:02:31.240> EFS<00:02:31.720> lens<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:32.920> put<00:02:33.130> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
millimeter EFS lens and we put the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.490 
millimeter EFS lens and we put the

dot up with the white dot turning that
on<00:02:38.200> there<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.640> then<00:02:39.640> taking<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.090> full-frame

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
on there and then taking a full-frame

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.949 
on there and then taking a full-frame
camera<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.110> take<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.709> 5d<00:02:42.220> 3<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:42.790> line<00:02:43.780> the

the full-frame camera we do have a

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.699 
the full-frame camera we do have a
couple<00:02:58.270> of<00:02:58.420> problems<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.380> first<00:02:59.590> problem

couple of problems the first problem

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.040 
couple of problems the first problem
being<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.610> same<00:03:00.880> problem<00:03:01.300> we<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:01.810> any

being the same problem we have with any

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.550 
being the same problem we have with any

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
lens using an extension tube you lose

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.930 
lens using an extension tube you lose
the<00:03:05.830> Infinity<00:03:06.400> end<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.690> focus<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:09.310> gain<00:03:09.580> a

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
the Infinity end of the focus you gain a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.350 
the Infinity end of the focus you gain a
closer<00:03:10.620> macro<00:03:11.620> but<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.489> can<00:03:12.670> no<00:03:12.790> longer<00:03:13.030> take

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
closer macro but you can no longer take

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.949 
closer macro but you can no longer take

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
images of things far away however this

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.870 
images of things far away however this
is<00:03:17.140> not<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.350> major<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.010> real<00:03:18.220> major<00:03:18.430> problem

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
is not the major the real major problem

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.810 
is not the major the real major problem
with<00:03:19.060> EFS<00:03:19.690> lenses<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:20.380> full-frame<00:03:21.280> cameras

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.810 
with EFS lenses on full-frame cameras
the<00:03:22.360> real<00:03:22.600> problem<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.620> take<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.550> photo

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
the real problem is this I take a photo

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:34.010 
the real problem is this I take a photo
of<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.180> keyboard<00:03:30.060> you'll<00:03:31.060> see

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.310 

the<00:03:34.590> catastrophic<00:03:35.150> vignette<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.990> reason

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
the catastrophic vignette and the reason

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.090 
the catastrophic vignette and the reason
for<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:39.090> EFS<00:03:39.510> lens<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:40.080> designed<00:03:40.230> to

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
for that is the EFS lens is designed to

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.790 
for that is the EFS lens is designed to
shed<00:03:41.310> light<00:03:41.520> on<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.210> smaller<00:03:42.600> sensor<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
shed light on the smaller sensor of the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.300 
shed light on the smaller sensor of the
crop<00:03:44.130> frame<00:03:44.900> cameras<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.080> so<00:03:46.560> simply<00:03:47.100> does

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
crop frame cameras and so simply does

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.800 
crop frame cameras and so simply does
not<00:03:47.490> cover<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.000> sensor<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.480> full-frame

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
not cover the sensor of the full-frame

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.740 
not cover the sensor of the full-frame
that<00:03:51.810> said<00:03:52.080> however<00:03:52.910> put<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.030> extension<00:03:54.510> tube

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
that said however put the extension tube

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.740 
that said however put the extension tube
on<00:03:54.930> one<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.110> my<00:03:55.320> favorite<00:03:55.560> EFS<00:03:56.190> lenses<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.270> 60

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
on one of my favorite EFS lenses the 60

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.100 
on one of my favorite EFS lenses the 60
millimeter<00:03:58.170> macro<00:03:58.860> lens<00:03:59.660> which<00:04:00.660> actually<00:04:01.050> I

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
millimeter macro lens which actually I

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.260 
millimeter macro lens which actually I
prefer<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.740> any<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.310> other<00:04:02.460> macro<00:04:02.880> lenses

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
prefer to any of the other macro lenses

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.640 
prefer to any of the other macro lenses
and<00:04:05.210> then<00:04:06.210> place<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.510> on<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> full-frame<00:04:07.230> camera

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
and then place it on a full-frame camera

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:18.710 
and then place it on a full-frame camera
and<00:04:09.710> then<00:04:10.710> take<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.920> photo<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:17.390> you'll<00:04:18.390> see<00:04:18.570> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
and then take a photo and you'll see the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.430 
and then take a photo and you'll see the
results<00:04:19.200> are<00:04:19.489> as<00:04:20.489> if<00:04:20.670> it<00:04:20.970> was<00:04:21.209> using<00:04:21.720> an<00:04:22.049> EF

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
results are as if it was using an EF

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.010 
results are as if it was using an EF
lens<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.280> yes<00:04:23.490> this<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.420> useful<00:04:24.930> application

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
lens so yes this is a useful application

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.440 
lens so yes this is a useful application
for<00:04:25.770> this<00:04:25.890> little<00:04:26.070> trick<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.610> can<00:04:27.000> take<00:04:27.300> this

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
for this little trick you can take this

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.390 
for this little trick you can take this
great<00:04:27.750> lens<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.320> use<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.830> on<00:04:29.010> full-frame

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
great lens and use it on full-frame

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.830 
great lens and use it on full-frame
camera<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.180> there<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:33.360> have<00:04:33.480> it

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
camera and so there you have it

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.900 
camera and so there you have it
take<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:35.670> EFS<00:04:36.120> 60<00:04:36.690> millimeter<00:04:37.080> macro<00:04:37.640> stick<00:04:38.640> a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
take the EFS 60 millimeter macro stick a

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.210 
take the EFS 60 millimeter macro stick a
an<00:04:39.480> extension<00:04:40.230> tube<00:04:40.440> on<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.070> can<00:04:41.190> be

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
an extension tube on it and it can be

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.150 
an extension tube on it and it can be
used<00:04:41.550> on<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.970> full<00:04:42.150> frame<00:04:42.450> body<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.950> works

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
used on the full frame body and it works

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.950 
used on the full frame body and it works
perfectly<00:04:44.580> well<00:04:44.850> it's<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:45.330> of<00:04:45.360> my<00:04:45.540> favorite

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
perfectly well it's one of my favorite

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.650 
perfectly well it's one of my favorite
EFS<00:04:46.320> lenses<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.000> continues<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.180> be<00:04:48.330> able<00:04:48.510> to

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
EFS lenses and continues to be able to

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.300 
EFS lenses and continues to be able to
be<00:04:48.810> used<00:04:49.050> with<00:04:49.290> full<00:04:49.470> frame<00:04:49.650> bodies<00:04:49.980> so

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
be used with full frame bodies so

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.530 
be used with full frame bodies so
something<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:50.970> try<00:04:51.210> with<00:04:51.510> your<00:04:51.660> EFS<00:04:52.140> lenses
