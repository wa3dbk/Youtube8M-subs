00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.120 
tutorials where they do a little dry
hair<00:02:47.739> but<00:02:48.580> I'm<00:02:49.480> rather<00:02:49.870> do<00:02:50.080> whatever<00:02:50.800> because

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
course and it gets pretty puffy at the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.550 
course and it gets pretty puffy at the
root<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.820> I'm<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.120> trying<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.450> get<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.380> a

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560

little<00:02:59.709> bit<00:02:59.920> more<00:03:00.040> manageable<00:03:00.250> at<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.000> roots

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 
I will more than likely put this pomade

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.909 
I will more than likely put this pomade
um<00:07:19.560> or<00:07:20.100> another<00:07:20.880> kind<00:07:21.120> of<00:07:21.270> hair<00:07:21.510> dress<00:07:21.900> on<00:07:22.320> my

dry completely hope it is and and then I

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.230 
dry completely hope it is and and then I
will<00:07:29.520> probably<00:07:29.789> just<00:07:30.720> put<00:07:31.020> some<00:07:31.349> of<00:07:31.530> this<00:07:31.740> um
