00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.960 
field in focus and being that I'm
shooting<00:03:51.500> with<00:03:51.620> an<00:03:51.769> ultra<00:03:52.250> wide<00:03:52.280> angle<00:03:52.790> lens

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
shooting with an ultra wide angle lens

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.900 
shooting with an ultra wide angle lens
it's<00:03:53.389> not<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:54.109> hard<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.560> keep<00:03:54.799> everything<00:03:55.010> in

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
it's not that hard to keep everything in

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.539 
it's not that hard to keep everything in
focus<00:03:56.720> because<00:03:57.590> your<00:03:57.739> depth<00:03:57.950> of<00:03:58.130> field<00:03:58.340> will

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
focus because your depth of field will

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.809 
focus because your depth of field will
expand<00:03:59.120> tremendously<00:03:59.840> at<00:04:00.650> f/8<00:04:01.069> with<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> wide

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
expand tremendously at f/8 with a wide

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.000 
expand tremendously at f/8 with a wide
angle<00:04:02.209> lens<00:04:02.450> because<00:04:03.019> wider<00:04:03.260> angle<00:04:03.620> lens<00:04:03.650> do

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
angle lens because wider angle lens do

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.670 
angle lens because wider angle lens do
not<00:04:04.250> compress<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.569> background<00:04:06.049> as<00:04:06.200> much<00:04:06.500> as

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
not compress the background as much as

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.430 
not compress the background as much as
if<00:04:06.799> you<00:04:06.889> were<00:04:06.980> using<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.370> 300<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.180> 8<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:09.169> more

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
if you were using a 300 to 8 the more

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.400 
if you were using a 300 to 8 the more
the<00:04:10.190> bigger<00:04:10.489> lens<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.030> use<00:04:11.419> the<00:04:12.079> more

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
the bigger lens that you use the more

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.199 
the bigger lens that you use the more
the<00:04:12.709> background<00:04:13.280> is<00:04:13.370> going<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.609> be<00:04:13.700> compressed

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
the background is going to be compressed

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.990 
the background is going to be compressed
the<00:04:14.660> wider<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.919> less<00:04:16.190> compression<00:04:16.700> you're

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
the wider the less compression you're

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.670 
the wider the less compression you're
gonna<00:04:17.120> have<00:04:17.450> in<00:04:17.810> your<00:04:18.169> background<00:04:18.349> you're

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
gonna have in your background you're

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.979 
gonna have in your background you're
gonna<00:04:18.799> have<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.950> more<00:04:19.370> depth<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.419> field<00:04:20.630> showing

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
gonna have a more depth of field showing

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.719 
gonna have a more depth of field showing
up<00:04:21.169> it's<00:04:21.289> harder<00:04:21.560> to<00:04:21.979> blow<00:04:22.159> the<00:04:22.310> background

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
up it's harder to blow the background

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.089 
up it's harder to blow the background
out<00:04:22.880> when<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.150> shoot<00:04:23.330> wider<00:04:23.630> with<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.260> 14<00:04:24.800> or<00:04:25.010> a

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
out when you shoot wider with a 14 or a

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.440 
out when you shoot wider with a 14 or a
16-day

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
16-day

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.230 
16-day
so<00:04:27.540> let's<00:04:27.690> run<00:04:27.900> down<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.400> corrections<00:04:29.400> Nikon

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
so let's run down the corrections Nikon

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.150 
so let's run down the corrections Nikon
d3s<00:04:30.780> by<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.050> way<00:04:31.230> let's<00:04:31.770> run<00:04:31.920> down<00:04:32.040> the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
d3s by the way let's run down the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.680 
d3s by the way let's run down the
corrections<00:04:32.580> this<00:04:32.730> is<00:04:32.880> what<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.060> ended<00:04:33.360> up<00:04:33.480> with

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
corrections this is what I ended up with

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.630 
corrections this is what I ended up with
and<00:04:33.930> this<00:04:34.140> is<00:04:34.260> where<00:04:34.440> we<00:04:34.590> started<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.520> can

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
and this is where we started so you can

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.360 
and this is where we started so you can
see<00:04:35.730> how<00:04:35.820> it's<00:04:35.970> flat<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:36.750> boring<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.830> all<00:04:38.220> of

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
see how it's flat and boring and all of

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.910 
see how it's flat and boring and all of
that<00:04:38.520> good<00:04:38.760> stuff<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:39.540> I<00:04:39.570> pump<00:04:39.930> up<00:04:40.080> my<00:04:40.110> contrast

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
that good stuff so I pump up my contrast

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.700 
that good stuff so I pump up my contrast
I<00:04:41.340> actually<00:04:42.180> added<00:04:42.600> some<00:04:43.050> vibrance<00:04:43.590> and

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
I actually added some vibrance and

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.950 
I actually added some vibrance and
saturation<00:04:43.800> here<00:04:44.730> I<00:04:44.910> didn't<00:04:45.330> really<00:04:45.600> need<00:04:45.900> to

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
saturation here I didn't really need to

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.260 
saturation here I didn't really need to
change<00:04:46.770> my<00:04:46.920> exposure<00:04:47.340> because<00:04:47.670> I<00:04:47.850> liked<00:04:48.090> it

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
change my exposure because I liked it

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.980 
change my exposure because I liked it
pretty<00:04:48.540> much<00:04:49.400> five<00:04:50.400> right<00:04:51.030> here<00:04:51.060> on<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.720> black

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
pretty much five right here on the black

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.230 
pretty much five right here on the black
levels<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.740> recovery<00:04:53.430> as<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.610> slider<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.210> I

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
levels and recovery as a slider that I

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.960 
levels and recovery as a slider that I
tend<00:04:54.600> not<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.960> use<00:04:55.410> but<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.490> case<00:04:56.730> it's

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
tend not to use but in this case it's

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.270 
tend not to use but in this case it's
not<00:04:57.210> really<00:04:57.270> taking<00:04:58.080> away<00:04:58.320> from<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.770> actual

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
not really taking away from the actual

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.580 
not really taking away from the actual
photograph<00:04:59.790> it's<00:05:00.000> enhancing<00:05:00.600> it<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:01.200> I<00:05:01.260> put<00:05:01.500> it

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
photograph it's enhancing it so I put it

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.980 
photograph it's enhancing it so I put it
right<00:05:01.680> back<00:05:01.920> right<00:05:02.280> about<00:05:03.150> here<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:03.540> can<00:05:03.720> see

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
right back right about here you can see

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.170 
right back right about here you can see
what<00:05:04.140> happens<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:04.560> see<00:05:04.710> how<00:05:04.800> it's<00:05:05.460> filling<00:05:05.970> in

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
what happens you see how it's filling in

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.630 
what happens you see how it's filling in
for<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.780> field<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.800> know<00:05:07.890> I<00:05:07.920> could<00:05:08.220> use<00:05:08.250> feel

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
for the field you know I could use feel

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.160 
for the field you know I could use feel
like<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:08.940> make<00:05:09.060> Dave<00:05:09.330> look<00:05:09.600> better<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.020> then

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
like to make Dave look better but then

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.290 
like to make Dave look better but then
it<00:05:10.320> starts<00:05:10.650> to<00:05:10.710> look<00:05:10.920> fake<00:05:11.250> then<00:05:11.880> it's<00:05:12.150> not

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
it starts to look fake then it's not

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.510 
it starts to look fake then it's not
what<00:05:12.480> I<00:05:12.510> want<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:12.870> like<00:05:13.260> this<00:05:13.950> feel<00:05:14.310> because

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
what I want I like this feel because

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.700 
what I want I like this feel because
it's<00:05:14.790> you<00:05:15.510> know<00:05:15.630> he's<00:05:15.780> in<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.020> shadows<00:05:16.500> he's

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
it's you know he's in the shadows he's

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.090 
it's you know he's in the shadows he's
not<00:05:17.010> in<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:18.450> forefront<00:05:18.870> he's<00:05:19.140> on<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.890> radio

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
not in the forefront he's on the radio

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.790 
not in the forefront he's on the radio
so<00:05:20.730> you<00:05:21.000> know<00:05:21.570> it's<00:05:21.780> usually<00:05:21.930> darker<00:05:22.500> so<00:05:22.740> you

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
so you know it's usually darker so you

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.290 
so you know it's usually darker so you
don't<00:05:22.980> ever<00:05:23.130> see<00:05:23.190> people<00:05:23.610> on<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.820> radio<00:05:23.940> I

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
don't ever see people on the radio I

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.820 
don't ever see people on the radio I
mean<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:24.630> could<00:05:24.870> do<00:05:25.050> this<00:05:25.200> with<00:05:25.380> fill<00:05:25.560> light<00:05:25.770> I

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
mean you could do this with fill light I

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.530 
mean you could do this with fill light I
could<00:05:26.040> have<00:05:26.160> popped<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.520> flash<00:05:26.790> and<00:05:27.030> balanced

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
could have popped the flash and balanced

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.910 
could have popped the flash and balanced
the<00:05:27.810> lighting<00:05:28.170> in<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.350> background<00:05:28.500> but<00:05:28.890> I

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
the lighting in the background but I

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.540 
the lighting in the background but I
liked<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.880> feel<00:05:30.150> of<00:05:30.180> this<00:05:30.570> so<00:05:31.170> really<00:05:31.770> I<00:05:32.070> make

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
liked the feel of this so really I make

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.100 
liked the feel of this so really I make
less<00:05:32.760> Corrections<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:33.540> some<00:05:33.750> other<00:05:33.900> people
