this<00:00:35.610> piston<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.090> actually<00:00:36.510> still<00:00:36.809> good<00:00:37.079> but

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this piston is actually still good but

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.630 
this piston is actually still good but
I'm<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.800> ahead<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.160> rebuild<00:00:38.430> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
I'm going to go ahead and rebuild it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.490 
I'm going to go ahead and rebuild it
because<00:00:38.820> I've<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.270> an<00:00:39.390> 8<00:00:39.540> hour<00:00:39.750> race<00:00:40.110> next

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
because I've got an 8 hour race next

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.090 
because I've got an 8 hour race next
weekend<00:00:41.390> ok<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.989> next<00:00:43.290> step<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
weekend ok and the next step is to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.860 
weekend ok and the next step is to
remove<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.399> jug<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> be

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
remove the jug and that's going to be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.130 
remove the jug and that's going to be
these<00:00:46.020> four<00:00:46.320> bolts<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:50.660> next<00:00:51.660> you're<00:00:51.930> going

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
these four bolts here next you're going

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.319 
these four bolts here next you're going
to<00:00:52.289> remove<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.770> jug<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.090> probably

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
to remove the jug and you will probably

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.889 
to remove the jug and you will probably
need<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.170> rubber<00:00:56.039> mallet<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.670> tap<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.210> jug<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
need a rubber mallet to tap the jug to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.180 
need a rubber mallet to tap the jug to
get<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.109> loose<00:00:58.320> because<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.859> held<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.129> place

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
get it loose because it's held in place

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:09.830 
get it loose because it's held in place
with<00:00:59.899> dowel<00:01:00.899> things<00:01:07.430> after<00:01:08.430> you've<00:01:08.840> removed

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
with dowel things after you've removed

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
with dowel things after you've removed
the<00:01:10.080> jug<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> put<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the jug you're going to want to put a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.719 
the jug you're going to want to put a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
towel down here under the piston to keep

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.280 
towel down here under the piston to keep
any<00:01:14.970> little<00:01:15.270> pieces<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.750> metal<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.170> your

any little pieces of metal or your
circlips<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> piston<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.790> I'll<00:01:17.880> show

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
circlips from the piston that I'll show

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
circlips from the piston that I'll show
you<00:01:18.150> later<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.750> falling<00:01:19.170> into<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> motor

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you later from falling into the motor

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
you later from falling into the motor
that's<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> cause<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> big<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> headache

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that's going to cause a big a headache

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.510 
that's going to cause a big a headache
if<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> happens<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.680> make<00:01:22.950> sure<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.280> shove<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
if it happens so make sure you shove a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.050 
if it happens so make sure you shove a
rag<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:25.100> now<00:01:26.100> take<00:01:26.189> some<00:01:26.400> time<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
rag in here now take some time to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
rag in here now take some time to
inspect<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> inside<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.170> cylinder<00:01:28.590> for

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
inspect the inside of your cylinder for

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
inspect the inside of your cylinder for
any<00:01:29.280> wear<00:01:29.640> or<00:01:29.939> damage<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.659> one's<00:01:30.900> pretty

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
any wear or damage this one's pretty

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.380 
any wear or damage this one's pretty
good<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> time<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.299> you're

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
good and now it's the time when you're

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
good and now it's the time when you're
going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> decide<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> need<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.619> actually

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
going to decide if you need to actually

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.950 
going to decide if you need to actually
hone<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> cylinder<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.180> can't<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:36.720> see

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
hone the cylinder you can't actually see

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.499 
hone the cylinder you can't actually see
it<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.470> crappy<00:01:38.340> camera<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.299> one's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
it with my crappy camera but this one's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
it with my crappy camera but this one's
pretty<00:01:39.720> good<00:01:40.280> now<00:01:41.280> we're<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> remove

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
pretty good now we're going to remove

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
pretty good now we're going to remove
the<00:01:42.119> piston<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.750> start<00:01:43.140> by<00:01:43.259> removing<00:01:43.470> this

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the piston and start by removing this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530 
the piston and start by removing this
circle<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:45.030> you're<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> remove

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
circle it then you're going to remove

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.090 
circle it then you're going to remove
the<00:01:45.689> wrist<00:01:45.899> pin<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> piston<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.829> slide

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the wrist pin and the piston will slide

00:01:47.100 --> 00:02:07.529 
the wrist pin and the piston will slide
off

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.400 

you're<00:02:08.539> also<00:02:08.660> going<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.899> want<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.140> replace

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
you're also going to want to replace

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.880 
you're also going to want to replace
this<00:02:09.649> bearing<00:02:10.930> now<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.110> piston<00:02:12.590> now<00:02:12.740> that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
this bearing now that piston now that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.320 
this bearing now that piston now that
you<00:02:13.010> look<00:02:13.190> at<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.730> got<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.910> little<00:02:14.120> bit

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
you look at it so I got a little bit

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.580 
you look at it so I got a little bit
more<00:02:14.540> wear<00:02:14.780> on<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.140> than<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.380> had<00:02:15.500> originally

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
more wear on it than I had originally

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.400 
more wear on it than I had originally
thought<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.640> it's<00:02:16.819> always<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.600> good<00:02:17.870> idea<00:02:17.930> to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
thought so it's always a good idea to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.910 
thought so it's always a good idea to
replace<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:19.130> every<00:02:19.520> eight<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.730> ten<00:02:20.030> hours

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.460 

and<00:02:24.920> that's<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.370> for<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> disassembly<00:02:26.470> now

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
and that's it for the disassembly now

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.300 
and that's it for the disassembly now
we're<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.860> start<00:02:28.130> with<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.370> assembly

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
we're going to start with the assembly

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.290 
we're going to start with the assembly
then<00:02:31.310> you're<00:02:31.430> going<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.580> want<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.819> gap<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
then you're going to want to gap the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.809 
then you're going to want to gap the
ring<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:33.380> this<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.739> an<00:02:33.980> important<00:02:34.400> step<00:02:34.610> it'll

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
ring and this is an important step it'll

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.190 
ring and this is an important step it'll
keep<00:02:34.970> your<00:02:35.180> motor<00:02:35.360> from<00:02:35.540> seizing<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.989> take

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
keep your motor from seizing you take

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.900 
keep your motor from seizing you take
the<00:02:36.350> ring<00:02:37.209> install<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.390> into<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.810> cylinder

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
the ring install it into the cylinder

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.100 
the ring install it into the cylinder
like<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:42.069> you're<00:02:43.069> going<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.340> take<00:02:44.269> your<00:02:44.510> piston

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
like so you're going to take your piston

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.790 
like so you're going to take your piston
and<00:02:45.290> use<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.920> piston<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.519> square<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.030> up<00:02:47.800> shove

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
and use the piston to square it up shove

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.729 
and use the piston to square it up shove
that<00:02:49.010> down<00:02:49.040> into<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:50.060> four<00:02:50.630> into<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.989> good<00:02:51.200> good

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
that down into the four into a good good

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:59.229 
that down into the four into a good good
place<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:56.450> don't<00:02:56.780> know<00:02:56.989> see<00:02:57.380> here<00:02:58.239> there

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
place and I don't know see here there

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.470 
place and I don't know see here there
sure

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.530 

you<00:03:04.140> gap<00:03:04.470> right<00:03:04.890> there<00:03:05.250> you're<00:03:06.209> going<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.360> want

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
you gap right there you're going to want

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:17.210 
you gap right there you're going to want
to<00:03:06.599> measure<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.959> with<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.709> feeler<00:03:08.370> gauge

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.350 

and<00:03:18.220> my<00:03:18.430> gap<00:03:18.670> needs<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.180> be<00:03:19.300> widened<00:03:19.959> some<00:03:21.360> take

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
and my gap needs to be widened some take

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.070 
and my gap needs to be widened some take
the<00:03:22.510> ring<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.080> his<00:03:24.040> flats<00:03:24.760> my<00:03:25.180> file

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
the ring and his flats my file

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.259 
the ring and his flats my file
can't<00:03:26.950> see<00:03:27.129> very<00:03:27.310> well<00:03:27.430> because<00:03:27.760> my<00:03:27.940> camera<00:03:28.239> is

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
can't see very well because my camera is

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.339 
can't see very well because my camera is
focusing<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:28.780> my<00:03:28.900> shirt

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349

press the gap together over the file

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.309 
press the gap together over the file
through<00:03:45.840> then<00:03:46.840> you're<00:03:46.959> going<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.140> want<00:03:47.260> to

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
through then you're going to want to

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.990 
through then you're going to want to
clean<00:03:47.500> up<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.860> edges<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.489> don't<00:03:48.700> score

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
clean up the edges so you don't score

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.539 
clean up the edges so you don't score
your<00:03:49.209> cylinder<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:50.069> shouldn't<00:03:51.069> really<00:03:51.160> be<00:03:51.280> that

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
your cylinder I shouldn't really be that

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.350 
your cylinder I shouldn't really be that
much<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.690> then<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.959> check<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.380> gap<00:03:53.590> again

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
much and then you check the gap again

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.880 
much and then you check the gap again
the<00:03:55.360> ring<00:03:55.510> gap<00:03:55.690> needs<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.079> be<00:03:56.200> between<00:03:56.590> point

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
the ring gap needs to be between point

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.500 
the ring gap needs to be between point
two<00:03:57.099> seven<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.579> point<00:03:57.760> four<00:03:57.940> three<00:03:58.239> I've<00:03:58.360> got

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
two seven and point four three I've got

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.770 
two seven and point four three I've got
my<00:03:58.630> feeler<00:03:58.900> gauge<00:03:59.230> at<00:03:59.560> point<00:03:59.860> two<00:04:00.099> eight<00:04:00.130> and

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
my feeler gauge at point two eight and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.289 
my feeler gauge at point two eight and
it<00:04:01.780> goes<00:04:01.989> through<00:04:02.410> there<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.860> fine<00:04:03.150> now<00:04:04.150> I'm

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
it goes through there just fine now I'm

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.630 
it goes through there just fine now I'm
going<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.810> open<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.950> little<00:04:06.250> bit<00:04:06.430> more

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
going to open it a little bit more

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.920 
going to open it a little bit more
because<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:06.970> like<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.360> be<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.660> middle<00:04:07.870> of

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
because I like to be in the middle of

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.319 
because I like to be in the middle of
the<00:04:08.049> range<00:04:09.780> all<00:04:10.780> right<00:04:10.989> now<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.170> install<00:04:11.709> your

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
the range all right now you install your

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.119 
the range all right now you install your
ring<00:04:13.329> onto<00:04:13.989> your<00:04:14.379> piston<00:04:14.799> there's<00:04:14.950> going<00:04:15.069> to

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
ring onto your piston there's going to

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.689 
ring onto your piston there's going to
be<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.280> little<00:04:15.430> pin<00:04:15.760> put<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.750> end<00:04:17.079> gap<00:04:17.410> on<00:04:18.070> the

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
be a little pin put the end gap on the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.650 
be a little pin put the end gap on the
pin<00:04:19.000> can't<00:04:19.570> really<00:04:19.810> illustrate<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.500> but

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.100 

there<00:04:24.230> we<00:04:24.410> go

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.110 

now<00:04:31.110> we've<00:04:31.290> got<00:04:31.530> two<00:04:31.800> new<00:04:31.950> circlips<00:04:32.550> Honda<00:04:33.060> of

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
now we've got two new circlips Honda of

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.060 
now we've got two new circlips Honda of
course<00:04:33.420> only<00:04:33.840> use<00:04:33.990> Honda<00:04:34.380> Pistons<00:04:34.830> because

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
course only use Honda Pistons because

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.740 
course only use Honda Pistons because
they<00:04:35.190> make<00:04:35.370> more<00:04:35.580> power<00:04:35.820> than<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.150> why<00:04:36.450> scowl

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
they make more power than that why scowl

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.670 
they make more power than that why scowl
stuff<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.710> you're<00:04:37.830> going<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.010> insert<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.580> a
