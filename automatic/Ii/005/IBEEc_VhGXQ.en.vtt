00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.380
 my gosh yes what the hell is that here 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.189
 occurs so exclaims playing 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.279
 saints row 4 same part psychedelic 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.099
 and madness, and gone far ahead because we 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.589
 immersed in the matrix such decorations 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.920
 allowed to neglect any laws 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:39.860
 physics and common sense legs including 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.300
 I thought it was a bust let it 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.680
 banter and parody 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.410
 the framework still needs to be continued 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.949
 subtitled gat out of hell us 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.620
 plunged even further namely to hell and how 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.440
 nor strange excessive madness here 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.359
 diminished hell part not 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.329
 positioning as full 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.660
 the sequel is more like fun 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.450
 waiting for 5 nextgen parts and according to 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.810
 cheerful i mean crazy though 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.850
 does not interfere with one another 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.039
 the scene moved straight to hell 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.740
 with such a move made the game more 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.349
 logical if before we traveled 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.509
 over sleep comaco well or matrix 

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:26.450
 then in the hellish city everything gives way 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.340
 somehow up the rules it all starts with 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.099
 the fact that at the party on the occasion of the day 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.840
 the birth of members of the gang of saints along with 

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:35.720
 their leader who by 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.819
 part-time also the president decide 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.340
 To heighten the fun, play this leg 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.140
 blackboard just now the board it turned out 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.569
 by Satanâ€™s personal example 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.030
 and the prince of darkness in turn is looking 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.640
 worthy groom for his beloved daughter 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.830
 considering that the president during his 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.739
 existence managed to mess a lot 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.340
 mad rinat is not a candidate of him 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.729
 coming out 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.860
 perfect in general bosses water and us 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.580
 to save him on the mountain go 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.270
 johnny get 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.069
 and former fbi calico kinzi kensington 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.129
 create your pitching pimp or 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.200
 half-naked aunt now will not work 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.510
 what will have to play for those who give 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.150
 water we by the way meet and old 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.060
 characters of many of which we ourselves go there 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.190
 and sent if 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.030
 wash and that turn the business beyond the grave 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.770
 world impossible you are deeply mistaken 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.569
 our main task is to enlist 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.819
 supporting powerful people in 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.400
 hell and disrupt the wedding 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.050
 and maybe Satan right now and his position 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.880
 sweep away 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.069
 the allies took a pretty racy of 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.569
 there is only black beard and Vlad 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.480
 dracula well or 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.790
 William Shakespeare eminent playwright 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.370
 turns out to sell the soul to the devil 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.030
 to become talented each of 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.620
 Allies gives us this or that skill 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.319
 the developers decided to further develop 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.989
 idea with all sorts of superpowers from 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.269
 what is already to the usual super run and super 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.819
 jumps added also flight to 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.790
 wings now need machines 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.310
 finally gone though hell themselves 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.470
 auto present to the full game 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.810
 finally got rid of the title 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.630
 gta-clone and that can not but rejoice 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.360
 is it something like in flames or 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.250
 some kind of prototype but only with a bunch 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.859
 humor and total steba 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.280
 combat component of the cardinal 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.840
 they did not change much 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.540
 Cosmetic used to know how enemies 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.299
 freeze now turn to stone 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.269
 used to be telekinesis now blow about 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.060
 the land we throw everyone back in general all 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.910
 the same but in a different shell but 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.760
 can mad missing demons that very 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.790
 fun guns also combed under a new 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.319
 the setting here is you and the grenade launcher 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.019
 exploding frog my 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.510
 and all sorts of weapons of the deadly sins 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.910
 for example, you can ride on a comfortable 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.940
 armchair armed with two rotary 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 machine guns and rocket apparently 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.930
 armchair sofa 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.750
 personifies laziness but with missions 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.060
 somehow very very strange that is them 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.910
 little to us instead 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.459
 offer test everyones there race 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.400
 capture and plant in survival battles and 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.720
 other things and the tests themselves 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.300
 that's good but those full missions 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.920
 they categorically lacks all 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.900
 gameplay ultimately comes down to 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.480
 methodical testing 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.200
 thanks to which we bring Satan to 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.000
 rage and move on to a new plot so 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.210
 indicate us that this cutscene 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.890
 as usual just hilarious 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.620
 Of course the main advantage of Saints Row 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.680
 there was always widespread banter 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.970
 and going on around madness and with that 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.940
 everything is in order 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:05:02.210
 what is the singing devil worth in manners 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:05:04.639
 an opera singer looking for a mojet want both rip out 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.270
 Have a question with a friend if the game can 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.650
 consisting solely of humor and banter 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.319
 keep you at the screen for a long time 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.069
 Apparently therefore gat out of hell such 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.900
 short 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.660
 be gameplay a little more 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.419
 tightened and she would have time to get bored 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.930
 Especially since the city is somehow not impressive. 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.120
 you feel no life in him no I agree 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.520
 that in hell a special life and should not 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.190
 be but if they made a full 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.960
 the city in which the fallen souls in cars 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.090
 go about their business 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.460
 I wonder what they have there for something they can 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.610
 be it would not hurt to fill it all 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.979
 a lot of events in general not 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.560
 worth waiting for some revelations or 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.289
 technical innovations if 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.570
 treat the novelty as an extensive dlc 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.330
 the aftertaste of the game is pretty 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.470
 pleasant at least for funny videos and 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.509
 fun flying through the hellish metropolis but 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.970
 if you delay the purchase to the next 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.889
 discounts it is unlikely to be a loss 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.229
 the loss 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.630
 Well, this is probably all for you 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.340
 tried team time video game 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.070
 Ladimir screen script is not 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.440
 voiceover Dmitry Zubarev not 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.080
 live one life live many 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.060
 play games watch a movie and listen 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.340
 good music and don't forget 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.919
 subscribe to our channel not to 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.919
 skip new videos to new meetings
