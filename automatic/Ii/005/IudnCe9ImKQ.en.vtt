00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
somebody using a call now let's just get

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.479 
somebody using a call now let's just get
into<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.840> mechanics<00:00:40.410> behind<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.890> box<00:00:41.190> call

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
into the mechanics behind this box call

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.630 
into the mechanics behind this box call
well<00:00:42.030> first<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> all<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:44.100> run

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
well first of all it's really a run

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.049 
well first of all it's really a run
itself<00:00:45.230> by<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.590> taking<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.850> more

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
itself by just taking and this is more

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.450 
itself by just taking and this is more
or<00:00:48.149> less<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.570> call<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> striker<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.920> if

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
or less what we call the striker here if

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
or less what we call the striker here if
will<00:00:50.730> move<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.270> striker<00:00:51.690> off<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> side

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
will move that striker off to the side

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920 
will move that striker off to the side
when<00:00:53.430> you're<00:00:53.579> moving<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> off<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> side

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
when you're moving it off to the side

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.740 
when you're moving it off to the side
and<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.829> make<00:00:56.039> any<00:00:56.100> noise<00:00:56.399> only<00:00:56.969> bringing

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and don't make any noise only bringing

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
and don't make any noise only bringing
it<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> you<00:01:00.260> most<00:01:01.260> guys<00:01:01.980> running<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.550> box

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it to you most guys running the box

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
it to you most guys running the box
caught<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.390> pick<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
caught one will pick it up but that's a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.830 
caught one will pick it up but that's a
mistake<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.670> let<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> weight<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> lid

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
mistake just let the weight of the lid

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.270 
mistake just let the weight of the lid
slide<00:01:07.350> straight<00:01:07.740> across<00:01:12.710> back<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.070> forth

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
slide straight across back and forth

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
slide straight across back and forth
what's<00:01:14.760> neat<00:01:14.970> about<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.390> jacked<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:15.960> box

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
what's neat about this jacked up box

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.170 
what's neat about this jacked up box
call<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.400> got<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.820> hand<00:01:18.090> sides<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
call here just got to hand sides on it

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.520 
call here just got to hand sides on it
that<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> right<00:01:21.720> hand<00:01:21.990> side<00:01:22.229> now<00:01:22.259> let's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that was the right hand side now let's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
that was the right hand side now let's
go<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.189> left<00:01:23.400> hand<00:01:23.670> side<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:29.659> left<00:01:30.659> hand

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
go to the left hand side just left hand

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.499 
go to the left hand side just left hand
sides<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.470> higher<00:01:31.740> pitch<00:01:32.180> sound<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.390> we

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
sides is a higher pitch sound so we

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
sides is a higher pitch sound so we
really<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.110> sound<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.409> multiple<00:01:35.040> hands

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really you can sound like multiple hands

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.510 
really you can sound like multiple hands
with<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:36.329> call<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.979> I'm<00:01:41.159> doing<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
with the same call and I'm doing the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
with the same call and I'm doing the
same<00:01:41.820> motion<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.600> actually<00:01:42.869> taking<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
same motion I'm actually taking it and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280 
same motion I'm actually taking it and
turning<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.479> dragging<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:45.990> lid

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
turning it up and I'm dragging that lid

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.800 
turning it up and I'm dragging that lid
back<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.250> forth<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:50.970> you'll<00:01:51.180> notice<00:01:51.479> I'm

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
back and forth and if you'll notice I'm

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.740 
back and forth and if you'll notice I'm
making<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.350> pretty<00:01:52.619> much<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.130> full<00:01:53.850> stroke<00:01:54.420> with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
making a pretty much a full stroke with

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
making a pretty much a full stroke with
it<00:01:55.159> I'm<00:01:56.159> running<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:56.909> probably<00:01:57.390> an

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it I'm running out there probably an

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810 
it I'm running out there probably an
inch<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.380> bringing<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.890> back<00:01:58.950> almost

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
inch and I'm bringing it back almost

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.179 
inch and I'm bringing it back almost
touch<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> other<00:02:00.719> side<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.500> will<00:02:01.950> give

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
touch the other side and that will give

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.850 
touch the other side and that will give
you<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.399> true<00:02:02.909> Wow<00:02:03.689> roll<00:02:04.110> over<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.710> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you that true Wow roll over that you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.610 
you that true Wow roll over that you
