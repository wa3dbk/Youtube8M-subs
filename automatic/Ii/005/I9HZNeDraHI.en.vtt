close<00:00:19.490> all<00:00:19.700> week<00:00:19.910> and<00:00:19.939> I<00:00:20.300> think<00:00:20.480> pretty<00:00:21.080> tight

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
close all week and I think pretty tight

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.339 
close all week and I think pretty tight
importance<00:00:21.800> for<00:00:21.980> third<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:22.550> then<00:00:23.150> Tom's<00:00:23.720> big

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
importance for third and then Tom's big

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.749 
importance for third and then Tom's big
clearing<00:00:24.710> first<00:00:25.009> and<00:00:25.250> I'm<00:00:25.310> sort<00:00:25.520> of<00:00:25.579> sitting

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
clearing first and I'm sort of sitting

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.429 
clearing first and I'm sort of sitting
in<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:25.939> middle<00:00:26.029> in<00:00:26.210> seconds<00:00:26.599> yeah<00:00:27.200> are<00:00:27.349> you

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
in the middle in seconds yeah are you

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.749 
in the middle in seconds yeah are you
happy<00:00:27.590> yeah<00:00:28.220> well<00:00:28.369> it<00:00:28.430> looks<00:00:28.550> like<00:00:28.579> we've<00:00:28.730> got

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
happy yeah well it looks like we've got

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.400 
happy yeah well it looks like we've got
a<00:00:28.849> good<00:00:28.970> Bri<00:00:29.149> so<00:00:29.450> I<00:00:29.810> think<00:00:30.079> probably

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
a good Bri so I think probably

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.770 
a good Bri so I think probably
particular<00:00:31.009> lasers<00:00:31.340> for<00:00:31.579> 10<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:31.910> 15<00:00:32.029> knots<00:00:32.270> and

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
particular lasers for 10 to 15 knots and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.170 
particular lasers for 10 to 15 knots and
just<00:00:33.350> extremely<00:00:33.739> close<00:00:33.980> racing<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.640> lot<00:00:35.059> of

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
just extremely close racing a lot of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.910 
just extremely close racing a lot of
position<00:00:35.540> changes<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.350> all<00:00:36.620> that<00:00:36.710> sort<00:00:36.829> of

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
position changes and all that sort of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.800 
position changes and all that sort of
stuff<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:37.370> think<00:00:37.489> mathematically<00:00:38.180> you<00:00:38.690> can

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
stuff so I think mathematically you can

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.420 
stuff so I think mathematically you can
have<00:00:38.900> to<00:00:38.960> be<00:00:39.020> on<00:00:39.080> top<00:00:39.140> of<00:00:39.260> your<00:00:39.380> game<00:00:39.560> and<00:00:39.830> both

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
have to be on top of your game and both

00:00:40.430 --> 00:01:24.790 
have to be on top of your game and both
both<00:00:40.820> speed<00:00:41.060> and<00:00:41.090> mentally

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.120 

it<00:01:25.700> was<00:01:25.850> really<00:01:26.330> interesting<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:27.680> launched<00:01:28.040> in

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
it was really interesting we launched in

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.610 
it was really interesting we launched in
about<00:01:28.310> 20<00:01:28.700> knots<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.750> got<00:01:29.960> out<00:01:30.080> there<00:01:30.230> big<00:01:30.410> waves

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
about 20 knots I got out there big waves

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.860 
about 20 knots I got out there big waves
you<00:01:31.250> know<00:01:31.370> big<00:01:31.580> wind<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.090> we're<00:01:32.180> all<00:01:32.330> going

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
you know big wind and we're all going

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.390 
you know big wind and we're all going
upwind<00:01:33.110> watching<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.530> fins<00:01:33.770> kind<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:34.220> check

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
upwind watching the fins kind of check

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.340 
upwind watching the fins kind of check
it<00:01:34.490> out<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.270> then<00:01:35.480> we're<00:01:35.720> all<00:01:35.810> hiking<00:01:36.230> and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
it out and then we're all hiking and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.500 
it out and then we're all hiking and
then<00:01:36.470> we<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:37.040> wind<00:01:37.340> shifted<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:37.940> pretty

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
then we the wind shifted just pretty

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.450 
then we the wind shifted just pretty
much<00:01:38.630> as<00:01:38.810> our<00:01:38.960> start<00:01:39.260> time<00:01:39.620> was<00:01:39.860> scheduled<00:01:40.280> and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
much as our start time was scheduled and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.270 
much as our start time was scheduled and
and<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.810> died<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.380> pretty<00:01:42.830> much<00:01:42.920> raised

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
and and it died so we pretty much raised

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.310 
and and it died so we pretty much raised
in<00:01:43.430> about<00:01:43.640> five<00:01:44.030> knots<00:01:44.330> or<00:01:44.510> even<00:01:44.840> lesser<00:01:45.020> comms

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
in about five knots or even lesser comms

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.440 
in about five knots or even lesser comms
yeah<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:46.280> better<00:01:46.430> being<00:01:46.760> here<00:01:47.000> in<00:01:47.090> Melbourne

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
yeah it's better being here in Melbourne

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.660
