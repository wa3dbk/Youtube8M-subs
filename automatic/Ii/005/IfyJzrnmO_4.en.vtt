00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
a couple of years ago when earthbound

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.549 
a couple of years ago when earthbound

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
Game Boy Advance in Japan and I believe

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.630 
Game Boy Advance in Japan and I believe
that<00:00:53.020> they<00:00:53.230> put<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.440> together<00:00:53.590> for<00:00:53.860> egm<00:00:54.430> and

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
that they put this together for egm and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.950 
that they put this together for egm and
several<00:00:54.880> other<00:00:55.030> magazines<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.630> sent<00:00:55.899> out

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
several other magazines that sent out

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.700 
several other magazines that sent out
this<00:00:56.110> huge<00:00:56.440> book<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:57.340> fan<00:00:57.670> art<00:00:57.880> and<00:00:58.260> music<00:00:59.260> and

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
this huge book to fan art and music and

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.430 
this huge book to fan art and music and
I<00:00:59.920> don't<00:01:00.190> know<00:01:00.430> it's<00:01:00.670> like<00:01:01.290> fanfiction<00:01:02.290> and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
I don't know it's like fanfiction and

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.770 
I don't know it's like fanfiction and
comics<00:01:02.950> it's<00:01:03.760> it's<00:01:04.210> kind<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.449> an<00:01:04.570> impressive

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
comics it's it's kind of an impressive

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.600 
comics it's it's kind of an impressive
effort<00:01:05.020> and<00:01:05.320> I<00:01:05.380> think<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.710> idea<00:01:05.979> was<00:01:06.040> that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
effort and I think the idea was that

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.639 
effort and I think the idea was that
they'd<00:01:07.300> send<00:01:07.509> it<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.720> magazines<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.590> the

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
they'd send it to magazines and the

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.400 
they'd send it to magazines and the
magazines<00:01:09.100> would<00:01:09.280> be<00:01:09.399> so<00:01:09.790> impressed<00:01:10.390> by<00:01:11.229> their

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
magazines would be so impressed by their

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.900 
magazines would be so impressed by their
by<00:01:11.740> their<00:01:11.890> loyalty<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.550> they<00:01:12.729> would

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
by their loyalty that they would

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.270 
by their loyalty that they would
encourage<00:01:13.270> Nintendo<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.100> publish<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.250> game

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
encourage Nintendo to publish the game

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.650 
encourage Nintendo to publish the game
in<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.580> US<00:01:15.790> which<00:01:16.000> actually<00:01:16.300> didn't<00:01:16.509> happen

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
in the US which actually didn't happen

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.830 
in the US which actually didn't happen
but<00:01:17.080> I<00:01:17.410> think<00:01:17.560> it<00:01:17.920> is<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.310> is<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.509> is<00:01:19.570> nice

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
but I think it is it is it is it is nice

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.999 
but I think it is it is it is it is nice
that<00:01:19.869> there<00:01:20.259> is<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.500> know<00:01:20.530> this<00:01:20.740> community

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
that there is you know this community

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.730 
that there is you know this community
out<00:01:21.430> there<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.910> I<00:01:22.390> know<00:01:22.630> Nintendo's<00:01:23.259> aware<00:01:23.590> of

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
out there and I know Nintendo's aware of

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.640 
out there and I know Nintendo's aware of
it<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.130> question<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.610> whether<00:01:24.820> or<00:01:25.030> not<00:01:25.650> they

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
it the question is whether or not they

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.200 
it the question is whether or not they
think<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:27.010> anyone<00:01:27.340> outside<00:01:27.369> of<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.150> group

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
think that anyone outside of that group

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.330 
think that anyone outside of that group
would<00:01:28.510> actually<00:01:28.810> by<00:01:28.960> earthbound<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.979> mother3

would actually by earthbound to mother3

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.649 
would actually by earthbound to mother3
if<00:01:30.670> they<00:01:30.790> brought<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:31.299> yeah<00:01:31.450> it's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
really fast the earthbound was probably

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.710

earthbound<00:02:19.650> series<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.310> think<00:02:20.370> yeah<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:20.910> think

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
earthbound series I think yeah I think

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.170 
earthbound series I think yeah I think
so<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.629> probably<00:02:21.840> dung<00:02:22.170> beetles<00:02:22.500> too<00:02:22.709> yeah<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.759 

think<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.360> best<00:02:27.569> part<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.870> mother<00:02:28.049> 3<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
think the best part of mother 3 is the

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.100 
think the best part of mother 3 is the
the<00:02:29.250> battle<00:02:29.580> system<00:02:29.970> which<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.480> wasn't<00:02:30.989> really

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the battle system which I wasn't really

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.539 
the battle system which I wasn't really
expecting<00:02:31.319> much<00:02:31.709> from<00:02:31.739> because<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.430> know

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
expecting much from because you know

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.569 
expecting much from because you know
mother<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.720> earthbound<00:02:34.470> were<00:02:34.709> both<00:02:34.980> just

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
mother and earthbound were both just

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.850 
mother and earthbound were both just
like<00:02:35.970> Dragon<00:02:36.450> Warrior<00:02:36.780> yeah<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.620> wasn't

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
like Dragon Warrior yeah and it wasn't

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.620 
like Dragon Warrior yeah and it wasn't
anything<00:02:38.010> exciting<00:02:38.579> have<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.329> rolling

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
anything exciting have the rolling

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
anything exciting have the rolling
counters<00:02:39.959> but<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.230> was<00:02:40.319> about<00:02:40.410> it

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
counters but that was about it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.009 
counters but that was about it
but<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.730> music<00:02:42.030> element<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.750> battle

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
but the the music element in the battle

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.250 
but the the music element in the battle
system<00:02:43.319> really<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.760> adds<00:02:44.910> an<00:02:45.060> extra<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.720> don't

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
system really it adds an extra I don't

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.699 
system really it adds an extra I don't
know<00:02:46.319> an<00:02:46.440> element<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.920> interactivity

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.289 

it's<00:02:55.129> still<00:02:55.340> not<00:02:55.430> perfect<00:02:55.489> though<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.060> mean

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
it's still not perfect though I mean

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.199 
it's still not perfect though I mean
it's<00:02:56.629> still<00:02:56.900> like<00:02:57.110> there's<00:02:57.439> not<00:02:57.590> enough<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:58.010> a

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
it's still like there's not enough of a

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.759 
it's still like there's not enough of a
guide<00:02:59.209> for<00:02:59.599> you<00:02:59.720> really<00:03:00.019> like<00:03:00.319> there<00:03:00.590> could<00:03:00.739> be

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
guide for you really like there could be

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.229 
guide for you really like there could be
like<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> little<00:03:01.310> line<00:03:01.459> or<00:03:01.819> something<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.180> a

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
like a little line or something like a

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.789 
like a little line or something like a
rhythm<00:03:02.480> well<00:03:02.930> actually<00:03:03.200> one<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
rhythm well actually one of the

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.369 
rhythm well actually one of the
characters<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.909> you<00:03:05.780> may<00:03:05.959> not<00:03:06.110> have<00:03:06.170> gotten

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
characters that you may not have gotten

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.640 
characters that you may not have gotten
to<00:03:06.650> his<00:03:07.370> he<00:03:07.849> has<00:03:07.939> a<00:03:07.970> special<00:03:08.329> ability<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:09.079> let

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
to his he has a special ability to let

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.920 
to his he has a special ability to let
you<00:03:09.799> change<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.909> sound<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.390> music<00:03:11.510> so

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
you change the sound of the music so

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.809 
you change the sound of the music so
that<00:03:12.049> it<00:03:12.140> amplifies<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.859> beat<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.280> drops<00:03:13.549> the

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
that it amplifies the beat and drops the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.809 
that it amplifies the beat and drops the
harmony<00:03:14.239> back<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.260> or<00:03:15.409> the<00:03:15.500> melody<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.370> it's

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
harmony back so or the melody so it's

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.759 
harmony back so or the melody so it's
really<00:03:17.030> easy<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.689> can<00:03:17.720> just<00:03:18.290> listen<00:03:18.500> to

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
really easy that you can just listen to

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:27.759 
really easy that you can just listen to
the<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:19.909> rhythm<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:26.780> uh<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:27.170> also<00:03:27.409> find

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
the to the rhythm but uh I also find

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.319 
the to the rhythm but uh I also find
that<00:03:27.920> if<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.129> just<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:28.549> pop<00:03:28.849> your<00:03:29.060> head<00:03:29.150> like

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
that if you just like pop your head like

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.330 
that if you just like pop your head like
a<00:03:29.359> retard<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.109> yeah<00:03:30.409> it<00:03:30.620> works<00:03:30.739> really<00:03:30.859> well

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
a retard then yeah it works really well

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.059 
a retard then yeah it works really well
so<00:03:31.489> Lee<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.760> hope<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.329> here<00:03:32.510> I'm<00:03:32.599> in<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.959> battle<00:03:33.349> so

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
so Lee I hope so here I'm in a battle so

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:43.509 
so Lee I hope so here I'm in a battle so
I'll<00:03:34.190> just<00:03:34.310> kind<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.519> demonstrate<00:03:42.459> okay<00:03:43.459> so

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
I'll just kind of demonstrate okay so

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.509 
I'll just kind of demonstrate okay so
that<00:03:43.760> was<00:03:43.849> 11<00:03:44.180> hits<00:03:44.359> so<00:03:45.200> he<00:03:45.290> was<00:03:45.829> kind<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.040> worth

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
that was 11 hits so he was kind of worth

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.610 
that was 11 hits so he was kind of worth
looking<00:03:46.819> like<00:03:46.970> anything<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.359> think

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.440 

you<00:03:52.430> know<00:03:52.519> I'd<00:03:52.670> say<00:03:52.849> what<00:03:53.030> really<00:03:53.180> makes

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
you know I'd say what really makes

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.589 
you know I'd say what really makes
mother<00:03:54.200> different<00:03:54.890> than<00:03:55.010> anything<00:03:55.190> just

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
mother different than anything just

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.229 
mother different than anything just
story<00:03:56.599> really<00:03:57.019> is<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.349> it's<00:03:57.620> just<00:03:58.030> it's<00:03:59.030> so

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
story really is that it's just it's so

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.720 
story really is that it's just it's so
different<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.870> yet<00:04:00.049> it's<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.890> more<00:04:01.220> involved

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
different and yet it's so more involved

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.039 
different and yet it's so more involved
than<00:04:01.879> anything<00:04:02.090> else<00:04:02.299> because<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:02.690> know<00:04:02.720> they

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
than anything else because you know they

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.229 
than anything else because you know they
have<00:04:03.170> like<00:04:03.409> the<00:04:04.010> modern-day<00:04:04.459> aspects<00:04:04.970> from

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
have like the modern-day aspects from

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.119 
have like the modern-day aspects from
from<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.629> first<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.110> mean<00:04:06.290> from<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.680> first

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
from the first I mean from the first

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.949 
from the first I mean from the first
couple<00:04:07.400> ones<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.360> was<00:04:08.540> really<00:04:08.750> like

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
couple ones and that was really like

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.720 
couple ones and that was really like
it's<00:04:09.140> such<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.319> huge<00:04:09.530> change<00:04:09.950> from<00:04:10.129> at<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.519> time

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
it's such a huge change from at the time

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.729 
it's such a huge change from at the time
you<00:04:11.450> know<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.690> was<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.989> was<00:04:12.110> pretty<00:04:12.260> much<00:04:12.470> set

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
you know it was it was pretty much set

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.979 
you know it was it was pretty much set
in<00:04:12.769> a<00:04:13.060> slightly<00:04:14.060> skewed<00:04:14.209> version<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
in a slightly skewed version of the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.370 
in a slightly skewed version of the
modern<00:04:15.260> world<00:04:15.470> kind<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.220> Japanese

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
modern world kind of a Japanese

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.680 
modern world kind of a Japanese
impression<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.470> what<00:04:18.620> America<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.250> like<00:04:19.459> so<00:04:20.299> it

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
impression of what America is like so it

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.659 
impression of what America is like so it
kind<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.410> was<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:21.590> surreal<00:04:22.070> fantasy<00:04:22.550> in<00:04:22.639> that

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
kind of was a surreal fantasy in that

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.120 
kind of was a surreal fantasy in that
way<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.020> stories<00:04:24.380> dealt<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:24.800> much<00:04:24.949> with

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
way and the stories dealt so much with

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.100 
way and the stories dealt so much with

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
the the story from other three kind of

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.710 
the the story from other three kind of
surprised<00:04:37.460> me<00:04:37.610> because<00:04:37.639> it's<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.090> lot<00:04:38.270> more<00:04:38.510> of

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
surprised me because it's a lot more of

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.439 
surprised me because it's a lot more of
a<00:04:38.840> traditional<00:04:39.530> RPG<00:04:39.949> story<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.699> that<00:04:41.270> it's

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
a traditional RPG story and that it's

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.909 
a traditional RPG story and that it's
kind<00:04:41.690> of<00:04:41.780> linear<00:04:41.990> it's<00:04:42.320> kind<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.530> chapter

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
kind of linear it's kind of chapter

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.170 
kind of linear it's kind of chapter
based<00:04:43.100> there<00:04:43.310> are<00:04:43.370> more<00:04:43.490> adults<00:04:43.910> but<00:04:44.060> my

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
based there are more adults but my

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.840 
based there are more adults but my
understanding<00:04:44.360> is<00:04:44.810> that<00:04:44.870> later<00:04:45.139> in<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.410> game

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
understanding is that later in the game

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.100 
understanding is that later in the game
ultimately<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.300> kids<00:04:47.539> are<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.960> main

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
ultimately the kids are the main

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.290 
ultimately the kids are the main
characters<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:51.820> was<00:04:52.820> really<00:04:53.030> impressed<00:04:53.150> the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
characters I was really impressed the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.090 
characters I was really impressed the
animation<00:04:53.840> honestly<00:04:54.289> animation<00:04:54.949> is<00:04:55.010> pretty

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
animation honestly animation is pretty

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.440 
animation honestly animation is pretty
good<00:04:55.310> compared<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.789> like<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.030> older<00:04:56.240> games

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
good compared to like the older games

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.390 
good compared to like the older games
because<00:04:56.840> now<00:04:56.960> it's<00:04:57.139> like<00:04:57.229> they<00:04:57.590> used<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.919> look

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
because now it's like they used to look

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.490 
because now it's like they used to look
just<00:04:58.760> like<00:04:58.849> you<00:04:59.030> know<00:04:59.120> regular<00:04:59.419> 16-bit<00:05:00.349> RPGs

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
just like you know regular 16-bit RPGs

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.770 
just like you know regular 16-bit RPGs
and<00:05:01.070> now<00:05:01.160> they<00:05:01.310> look<00:05:01.430> more<00:05:01.639> like<00:05:01.789> a<00:05:01.820> 32-bit<00:05:02.419> I

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
and now they look more like a 32-bit I

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.940 
and now they look more like a 32-bit I
think<00:05:03.020> I<00:05:03.169> think<00:05:03.320> that's<00:05:03.440> something<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.680> can't

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
think I think that's something you can't

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.500 
think I think that's something you can't
really<00:05:04.070> tell<00:05:04.280> from<00:05:04.430> just<00:05:04.669> plain<00:05:04.940> screenshots

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
really tell from just plain screenshots

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.170 
really tell from just plain screenshots
is<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:05.930> despite<00:05:06.289> the<00:05:06.560> simple<00:05:07.099> almost<00:05:07.310> 8-bit

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
is that despite the simple almost 8-bit

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.659 
is that despite the simple almost 8-bit
look<00:05:08.389> of<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.630> graphics<00:05:09.560> it's<00:05:10.099> really<00:05:10.430> really

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
look of the graphics it's really really

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.040 
look of the graphics it's really really
well<00:05:10.849> animated<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:11.389> think<00:05:11.570> that's<00:05:11.720> brownie

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
well animated and I think that's brownie

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.890 
well animated and I think that's brownie

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
is really good too especially

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.320 
is really good too especially
considering<00:05:34.430> its<00:05:34.580> you<00:05:35.060> know<00:05:35.180> GBA<00:05:35.510> game

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.520 

the<00:05:39.330> music<00:05:39.660> style<00:05:39.840> is<00:05:39.990> different<00:05:40.350> there's

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
the music style is different there's

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.260 
the music style is different there's
more<00:05:40.680> of<00:05:40.740> a<00:05:40.830> driving<00:05:41.100> beat<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:41.760> music<00:05:42.120> than

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
more of a driving beat to the music than

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.850 
more of a driving beat to the music than
a<00:05:42.360> previous<00:05:42.840> games<00:05:43.050> because<00:05:43.440> you<00:05:43.650> know<00:05:43.770> that

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
a previous games because you know that

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.470 
a previous games because you know that
it<00:05:43.980> has<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.310> have<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.520> video<00:05:44.730> element<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.330> it

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
it has to have the video element to it

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.330 
it has to have the video element to it
although<00:05:45.990> actually<00:05:46.500> some<00:05:46.680> of<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.890> some<00:05:47.310> of

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
although actually some of the some of

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.860 
although actually some of the some of
the<00:05:47.460> trickier<00:05:47.850> battles<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:48.360> you<00:05:48.390> get<00:05:48.570> into

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
the trickier battles that you get into

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.950 
the trickier battles that you get into
have<00:05:49.490> music<00:05:50.490> with<00:05:50.610> no<00:05:50.880> clear<00:05:51.270> beads<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:51.930> that

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
have music with no clear beads so that

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.810 
have music with no clear beads so that
it's<00:05:52.590> really<00:05:52.920> hard<00:05:53.100> to<00:05:53.220> tell<00:05:53.340> what<00:05:53.490> the<00:05:53.520> timing

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
it's really hard to tell what the timing

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.100 
it's really hard to tell what the timing
is<00:05:54.030> on<00:05:54.180> those<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.600> I<00:05:54.660> think<00:05:54.690> that's<00:05:54.990> actually

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
is on those and I think that's actually

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.260 
is on those and I think that's actually
part<00:05:56.010> of<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.160> challenge<00:05:56.190> for<00:05:56.580> those<00:05:56.850> battles

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
part of the challenge for those battles

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.640 
part of the challenge for those battles
this<00:05:57.510> two<00:05:57.690> bag<00:05:57.870> sounds<00:05:58.140> getting<00:05:58.320> thrown<00:05:58.560> off

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
this two bag sounds getting thrown off

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.620 
this two bag sounds getting thrown off
early<00:05:58.980> on<00:05:59.010> already<00:06:02.300> Nintendo<00:06:03.300> hasn't
