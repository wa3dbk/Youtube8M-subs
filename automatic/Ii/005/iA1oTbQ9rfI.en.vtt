00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.690 

we<00:00:03.750> talk<00:00:03.959> about<00:00:04.110> plant<00:00:04.529> nutrients<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.370> look

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
we talk about plant nutrients and look

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.760 
we talk about plant nutrients and look
at<00:00:05.819> soil<00:00:06.120> test<00:00:06.509> there's<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.990> lot<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.410> confusion

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
at soil test there's a lot of confusion

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.110 
at soil test there's a lot of confusion
there<00:00:08.099> especially<00:00:08.370> as<00:00:08.639> something<00:00:08.970> like

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
there especially as something like

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.629 
there especially as something like
potassium<00:00:09.540> where<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.320> shows<00:00:10.559> up<00:00:10.769> twice<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.490> our

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
potassium where it shows up twice on our

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.970 
potassium where it shows up twice on our
soil<00:00:11.849> test<00:00:11.969> which<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.440> really<00:00:13.740> want

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
soil test which one do we really want

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.430 
soil test which one do we really want
okay<00:00:14.370> but<00:00:15.000> here's<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.509> most<00:00:15.750> important<00:00:16.260> thing

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
okay but here's the most important thing

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.859 
okay but here's the most important thing
to<00:00:16.590> mention<00:00:17.010> today<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.670> you're<00:00:18.270> not<00:00:18.480> doing

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
to mention today if you're not doing

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.170 
to mention today if you're not doing
some<00:00:19.020> soil<00:00:19.260> testing<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.890> your<00:00:19.920> farm<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:20.939> let

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
some soil testing on your farm just let

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.150 
some soil testing on your farm just let
me<00:00:21.270> ask<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.810> question<00:00:21.990> think<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.890> how

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
me ask you this question think about how

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.060 
me ask you this question think about how
many<00:00:23.220> dollars<00:00:24.180> you're<00:00:24.449> spending<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.140> terms<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
many dollars you're spending in terms of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830 
many dollars you're spending in terms of
overall<00:00:26.519> fertility<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> farm<00:00:27.599> I'm

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
overall fertility on the farm I'm

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.599 
overall fertility on the farm I'm
assuming<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.680> thousands<00:00:29.369> probably

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
assuming it's thousands probably

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.089 
assuming it's thousands probably
hundreds<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> thousands<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.199> many<00:00:31.439> farms<00:00:31.650> if

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
hundreds of thousands on many farms if

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
hundreds of thousands on many farms if
you<00:00:32.460> knew<00:00:32.669> how<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> read<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> soil<00:00:33.840> test<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
you knew how to read a soil test and you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.260 
you knew how to read a soil test and you
did<00:00:34.950> some<00:00:35.190> soil<00:00:35.430> testing<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.059> think

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
did some soil testing do you think

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.060 
did some soil testing do you think
there's<00:00:36.450> maybe<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.840> chance<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.829> might<00:00:38.010> be

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
there's maybe a chance that you might be

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
there's maybe a chance that you might be
able<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.520> higher<00:00:38.700> yields<00:00:39.390> maybe<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.899> little

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
able to get higher yields maybe a little

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780 
able to get higher yields maybe a little
bit<00:00:40.230> better<00:00:40.350> profitability<00:00:40.950> maybe<00:00:41.340> even<00:00:41.610> save

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
bit better profitability maybe even save

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
bit better profitability maybe even save
a<00:00:41.820> few<00:00:42.030> dollars<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.450> fertilizer<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.200> think

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
a few dollars on fertilizer I think

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.430 
a few dollars on fertilizer I think
absolutely<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.030> true<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> one<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
absolutely that is true and one of the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.290 
absolutely that is true and one of the
most<00:00:46.649> misunderstood<00:00:47.579> nutrients<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
most misunderstood nutrients is

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.260 
most misunderstood nutrients is
potassium<00:00:49.020> we'll<00:00:49.770> tell<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.100> why<00:00:50.460> today<00:00:50.879> like

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
potassium we'll tell you why today like

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
potassium we'll tell you why today like
I<00:00:51.390> said<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> soil<00:00:52.260> test<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.739> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
I said with that soil test if you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
I said with that soil test if you
understand<00:00:53.250> how<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> read<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> shows<00:00:54.270> up

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
understand how to read it it shows up

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.959 
understand how to read it it shows up
twice<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.250> confusing<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
twice on there and that is confusing to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.240 
twice on there and that is confusing to
a<00:00:57.059> lot<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> let's<00:00:57.750> take<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.289> field<00:00:58.770> for

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
a lot of let's take this field for

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.920 
a lot of let's take this field for
example<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> parts<00:01:00.719> per

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
example you look at the parts per

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.540 
example you look at the parts per
million<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.379> potassium<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.039> shows<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.399> on

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
million of potassium that shows up on

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.729 
million of potassium that shows up on
this<00:01:02.730> field<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.329> over<00:01:03.600> 300<00:01:04.320> parts<00:01:04.589> per

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
this field and it's over 300 parts per

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
this field and it's over 300 parts per
million<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.250> parts<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.760> field<00:01:06.060> well<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
million in parts of this field well that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
million in parts of this field well that
looks<00:01:06.810> fantastic<00:01:07.189> because<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.640> you're

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
looks fantastic because if you're

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.910 
looks fantastic because if you're
looking<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> six-inch<00:01:09.810> soil<00:01:10.110> test<00:01:10.439> parts

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
looking at a six-inch soil test parts

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
looking at a six-inch soil test parts
per<00:01:11.130> million<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.580> 300<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.659> take<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.110> number

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
per million of 300 you take that number

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.370 
per million of 300 you take that number
times<00:01:13.680> two<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.939> roughly<00:01:15.299> 600<00:01:15.990> pounds

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
times two and to get roughly 600 pounds

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
times two and to get roughly 600 pounds
of<00:01:16.500> potassium<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.549> per<00:01:17.850> acre<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of potassium that are out per acre in

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.999 
of potassium that are out per acre in
the<00:01:18.450> soil<00:01:18.720> that's<00:01:19.020> enough<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> raise<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> lot<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the soil that's enough to raise a lot of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
the soil that's enough to raise a lot of
crap<00:01:20.189> right<00:01:20.520> yep<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> whole

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
crap right yep it is but the whole

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.660 
crap right yep it is but the whole
problem<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.619> you've<00:01:22.890> got<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> take<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> look<00:01:23.520> at

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
problem is you've got to take a look at

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.910 
problem is you've got to take a look at
base<00:01:23.939> saturation<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.140> farm<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> what

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
base saturation on your farm and what

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.090 
base saturation on your farm and what
that<00:01:26.159> means<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:27.090> base<00:01:27.630> setting<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> ratio<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that means is base setting is a ratio of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
that means is base setting is a ratio of
five<00:01:29.610> different<00:01:29.939> nutrients<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.110> each<00:01:31.290> other

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
five different nutrients to each other

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
five different nutrients to each other
so<00:01:32.009> you've<00:01:32.130> got<00:01:32.310> calcium<00:01:32.640> magnesium

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so you've got calcium magnesium

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.289 
so you've got calcium magnesium
potassium<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.829> well<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.250> sodium<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.820> hydrogen

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
potassium as well as sodium and hydrogen

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.600 
potassium as well as sodium and hydrogen
well<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:36.900> potassium<00:01:37.340> percentage<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
well if your potassium percentage is

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.249 
well if your potassium percentage is
less<00:01:39.150> than<00:01:39.390> four<00:01:39.659> percent

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
less than four percent

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.200 
less than four percent
you've<00:01:40.740> got<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> problem<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.060> that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you've got a problem we want that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
you've got a problem we want that
potassium<00:01:42.540> percentage<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> four

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
potassium percentage to be in the four

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039 
potassium percentage to be in the four
to<00:01:44.100> eight<00:01:44.250> percent<00:01:44.490> range<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.689> care

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to eight percent range so I don't care

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.389 
to eight percent range so I don't care
how<00:01:46.290> many<00:01:46.350> parts<00:01:46.710> per<00:01:46.829> million<00:01:47.040> you've<00:01:47.250> got

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
how many parts per million you've got

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
how many parts per million you've got
out<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> don't<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.540> enough<00:01:48.869> in

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
out here if you don't have enough in

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.889 
out here if you don't have enough in
ratio<00:01:49.409> you're<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.670> plain<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.450> gonna<00:01:51.659> get

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
ratio you're just plain not gonna get

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.840 
ratio you're just plain not gonna get
enough<00:01:52.140> potassium<00:01:52.530> into<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> plant<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
enough potassium into the plant to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
enough potassium into the plant to
maximize<00:01:54.570> yield<00:01:54.930> does<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.290> mean<00:01:55.439> you're<00:01:55.530> gonna

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
maximize yield does it mean you're gonna

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
maximize yield does it mean you're gonna
have<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> complete<00:01:56.250> disaster<00:01:56.549> no<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
have a complete disaster no but you

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.990 
have a complete disaster no but you
can't<00:01:58.079> maximize<00:01:58.380> yield<00:01:59.189> unless<00:01:59.790> you're

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
can't maximize yield unless you're

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.429 
can't maximize yield unless you're
getting<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.420> potassium<00:02:00.719> number<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.409> there

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
getting that potassium number up there

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.200 
getting that potassium number up there
and<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.189> plant<00:02:02.430> tissue<00:02:02.640> analysis

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and when you do plant tissue analysis

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.120 
and when you do plant tissue analysis
you're<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> find<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.619> you've<00:02:04.890> got

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
you're going to find that you've got

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.310 
you're going to find that you've got
plant<00:02:05.670> nutrient<00:02:06.149> deficiencies<00:02:06.719> with

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
plant nutrient deficiencies with

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.440 
plant nutrient deficiencies with
potassium<00:02:07.740> well<00:02:08.310> when<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.970> comes<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
potassium well when it comes to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.420 
potassium well when it comes to
potassium<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.170> you're<00:02:10.349> looking<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
potassium and you're looking at that it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.610 
potassium and you're looking at that it
varies<00:02:12.000> depending<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.720> types<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.140> soil

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
varies depending on the types of soil

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.289 
varies depending on the types of soil
you're<00:02:13.769> in<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.280> soil<00:02:14.519> for<00:02:14.819> example<00:02:15.239> is

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
you're in like this soil for example is

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.270 
you're in like this soil for example is
a<00:02:15.390> very<00:02:15.420> heavy<00:02:15.930> soil<00:02:16.349> where<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.769> happen<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.129> be

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
a very heavy soil where we happen to be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.940 
a very heavy soil where we happen to be
and<00:02:17.519> it's<00:02:17.760> very<00:02:18.150> high<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.599> magnesium<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
and it's very high in magnesium and that

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.610 
and it's very high in magnesium and that
really<00:02:20.519> really<00:02:20.940> heavy<00:02:21.180> soil<00:02:21.599> makes<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.379> tough

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
really really heavy soil makes it tough

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.259 
really really heavy soil makes it tough
for<00:02:22.650> your<00:02:22.890> plant<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.220> find<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.879> potassium

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
for your plant to find that potassium

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.479 
for your plant to find that potassium
that's<00:02:24.840> out<00:02:25.019> there<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.349> often<00:02:25.709> tied<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
that's out there it's often tied up and

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.580 
that's out there it's often tied up and
unavailable<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:27.959> important<00:02:28.500> to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
unavailable so it's important to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.710 
unavailable so it's important to
understand<00:02:29.159> with<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.400> soil<00:02:29.940> test<00:02:30.180> that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
understand with that soil test that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.089 
understand with that soil test that
you're<00:02:30.870> gonna<00:02:30.989> learn<00:02:31.230> some<00:02:31.560> things<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.980> if

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
you're gonna learn some things like if

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.520 
you're gonna learn some things like if
bass<00:02:32.280> saturation<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> low<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.810> say<00:02:34.019> well<00:02:34.260> I've

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
bass saturation is low you say well I've

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.559 
bass saturation is low you say well I've
got<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.739> good<00:02:35.010> chance<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:36.209> adding

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
got a good chance here that adding

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.509 
got a good chance here that adding
potassium<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.349> be<00:02:37.470> good<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:38.190> what's

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
potassium is going to be good but what's

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.339 
potassium is going to be good but what's
the<00:02:38.700> best<00:02:38.909> way<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.329> it<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.659> can<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.959> for<00:02:40.200> sure

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
the best way to do it and can I for sure

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.289 
the best way to do it and can I for sure
get<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.709> into<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.220> plant<00:02:41.459> how<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.819> know<00:02:41.909> for

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
get it into the plant how do I know for

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.910 
get it into the plant how do I know for
sure<00:02:42.329> that<00:02:42.659> it<00:02:42.780> did<00:02:42.989> well<00:02:43.230> one<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.860> things

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
sure that it did well one of the things

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.170 
sure that it did well one of the things
is<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.519> culture<00:02:44.819> it's<00:02:44.940> really

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
is that your culture it's really

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.580 
is that your culture it's really
unpredictable<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.870> just<00:02:46.049> like<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.319> rain

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
unpredictable it's just like this rain

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.699 
unpredictable it's just like this rain
right<00:02:46.829> now<00:02:46.890> when<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.519> been<00:02:47.640> sunny<00:02:47.940> all<00:02:48.239> day

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
right now when it's been sunny all day

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.780 
right now when it's been sunny all day
you<00:02:49.709> never<00:02:49.829> know<00:02:50.099> what's<00:02:50.370> gonna<00:02:50.549> happen

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
you never know what's gonna happen

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.610 
you never know what's gonna happen
nothing's<00:02:51.329> gonna<00:02:51.510> dampen<00:02:51.810> our<00:02:52.079> party<00:02:52.440> bread

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
nothing's gonna dampen our party bread

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.130 
nothing's gonna dampen our party bread
the<00:02:52.859> thing<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.579> if<00:02:53.879> you've<00:02:54.299> got<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.569> soil<00:02:54.959> test

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the thing is if you've got a soil test

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.559 
the thing is if you've got a soil test
you<00:02:55.560> have<00:02:55.799> an<00:02:55.980> idea<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.370> exactly<00:02:56.670> what's

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
you have an idea of exactly what's

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.449 
you have an idea of exactly what's
really<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.260> soil<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.799> once<00:02:59.310> you

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
really in the soil and once you

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.309 
really in the soil and once you
understand<00:03:00.030> how<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.269> read<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.989> we're

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
understand how to read that and we're

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.229 
understand how to read that and we're
gonna<00:03:01.440> talk<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.709> lot<00:03:02.010> more<00:03:02.040> about<00:03:02.280> soil<00:03:02.730> testing

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
gonna talk a lot more about soil testing

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.940 
gonna talk a lot more about soil testing
here<00:03:03.420> over<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.690> next<00:03:03.870> few<00:03:04.079> months<00:03:04.230> once<00:03:04.769> you

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
here over the next few months once you

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.399 
here over the next few months once you
do<00:03:05.400> your<00:03:05.700> soil<00:03:05.970> testing<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.900> know<00:03:07.170> how<00:03:07.349> to

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
do your soil testing you know how to

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.770 
do your soil testing you know how to
read<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.829> soil<00:03:08.099> sample<00:03:08.670> you've<00:03:09.060> got<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.329> lot

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
read the soil sample you've got a lot

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.110 
read the soil sample you've got a lot
better<00:03:10.049> shot<00:03:10.349> at<00:03:10.379> gaining<00:03:11.129> high<00:03:11.400> yield<00:03:11.849> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
better shot at gaining high yield and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.449 
better shot at gaining high yield and
doing<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.870> profitably<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:13.769> your<00:03:13.950> farm<00:03:14.220> well

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
doing it profitably on your farm well

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.039 
doing it profitably on your farm well
what<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.670> was<00:03:14.819> getting<00:03:15.180> at<00:03:15.329> too<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.840> could

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
what I was getting at too is you could

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.960 
what I was getting at too is you could
do<00:03:16.200> some<00:03:16.379> plant<00:03:16.620> tissue<00:03:16.829> sampling<00:03:17.400> during<00:03:17.849> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
do some plant tissue sampling during the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.940 
do some plant tissue sampling during the
summer<00:03:18.269> next<00:03:18.660> season<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.680> see<00:03:19.799> if<00:03:19.829> you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
summer next season and just see if you

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.800 
summer next season and just see if you
got<00:03:20.190> things<00:03:20.549> just<00:03:20.880> right<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.299> could<00:03:21.510> add<00:03:21.780> a

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
got things just right you could add a

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.390 
got things just right you could add a
little<00:03:22.169> bit<00:03:22.349> more<00:03:22.380> later<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:22.950> if<00:03:23.250> you're<00:03:23.370> a

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
little bit more later on if you're a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.009 
little bit more later on if you're a
little<00:03:23.609> bit<00:03:23.819> short<00:03:24.180> or<00:03:24.450> if<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.720> see<00:03:24.870> that

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
little bit short or if you see that

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.390 
little bit short or if you see that
you're<00:03:25.169> putting<00:03:25.349> a<00:03:25.470> little<00:03:25.620> bit<00:03:25.829> too<00:03:26.010> much<00:03:26.160> on

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you're putting a little bit too much on

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.190 
you're putting a little bit too much on
with<00:03:26.790> potassium<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.540> not<00:03:27.810> one<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.049> those

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
with potassium it's not one of those

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.409 
with potassium it's not one of those
nutrients<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.950> leeches<00:03:29.430> away<00:03:29.700> if<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.209> put<00:03:30.389> a

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
nutrients that leeches away if you put a

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.449 
nutrients that leeches away if you put a
few<00:03:30.690> extra<00:03:31.049> pounds<00:03:31.230> on<00:03:31.620> yeah<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.099> paid<00:03:32.430> a

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
few extra pounds on yeah you paid a

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.069 
few extra pounds on yeah you paid a
little<00:03:32.669> bit<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.970> extra<00:03:33.239> money<00:03:33.389> but<00:03:33.750> that's<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
little bit of extra money but that's the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.690 
little bit of extra money but that's the
worst<00:03:34.260> penalty<00:03:34.739> you're<00:03:34.950> gonna<00:03:35.069> have<00:03:35.370> you're

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
worst penalty you're gonna have you're

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.190 
worst penalty you're gonna have you're
gonna<00:03:35.760> have<00:03:35.879> some<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.359> that<00:03:36.389> potassium<00:03:37.019> for

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
gonna have some of that potassium for

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.780 
gonna have some of that potassium for
next<00:03:37.470> year's<00:03:37.680> crop<00:03:37.919> maybe<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.400> cut<00:03:38.609> back

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
next year's crop maybe you can cut back

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.280 
next year's crop maybe you can cut back
a<00:03:38.849> little<00:03:39.000> bit<00:03:39.299> next<00:03:39.510> year<00:03:39.750> if<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.930> happen<00:03:40.260> to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
a little bit next year if you happen to

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.990 
a little bit next year if you happen to
overdo<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:40.980> time<00:03:41.250> okay<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:41.579> we've<00:03:41.760> talked

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
overdo it this time okay so we've talked

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.479 
overdo it this time okay so we've talked
about<00:03:42.120> how<00:03:42.269> potassium<00:03:43.139> is<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:43.829> important<00:03:44.400> to

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
about how potassium is so important to

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.030 
about how potassium is so important to
the<00:03:44.579> plant<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.120> how<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:46.109> often<00:03:46.319> misread<00:03:46.859> on

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
the plant and how it's often misread on

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.470 
the plant and how it's often misread on
the<00:03:47.129> soil<00:03:47.370> test<00:03:47.669> well<00:03:48.030> once<00:03:48.329> you've

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
the soil test well once you've

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.240 
the soil test well once you've
determined<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.139> you<00:03:49.319> need<00:03:49.500> potassium<00:03:49.829> how

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
determined that you need potassium how

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.920 
determined that you need potassium how
should<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:50.790> put<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.120> out<00:03:51.239> there<00:03:51.269> one<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
should you put it out there one of the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.479 
should you put it out there one of the
things<00:03:52.139> we've<00:03:52.319> done<00:03:52.349> on<00:03:52.620> our<00:03:52.650> own<00:03:52.919> farm<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.459> to

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
things we've done on our own farm is to

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.879 
things we've done on our own farm is to
really<00:03:54.209> load<00:03:54.599> some<00:03:54.870> soils<00:03:55.230> up<00:03:55.410> with<00:03:55.590> potassium

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
really load some soils up with potassium

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.129 
really load some soils up with potassium
and<00:03:56.459> that's<00:03:56.639> great<00:03:56.970> except<00:03:57.720> for<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.959> fact

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
and that's great except for the fact

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.900 
and that's great except for the fact
that<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.440> costs<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:58.889> lot<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.069> money<00:03:59.340> well<00:03:59.699> you

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
that it costs a lot of money well you

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.129 
that it costs a lot of money well you
know<00:04:00.000> some<00:04:00.180> people<00:04:00.299> like<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.690> spend<00:04:00.959> that

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
know some people like to spend that

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.750 
know some people like to spend that
extra<00:04:01.169> money<00:04:01.530> out<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.980> vacation<00:04:02.099> or<00:04:02.609> something

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
extra money out of vacation or something

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.580 
extra money out of vacation or something
brand<00:04:03.150> would<00:04:03.329> prefer<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.690> spend<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.079> on<00:04:04.199> bath

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
brand would prefer to spend it on bath

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.939 
brand would prefer to spend it on bath
um<00:04:04.980> it's<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.220> long-term<00:04:05.430> enough<00:04:06.199> well<00:04:07.199> okay

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
um it's a long-term enough well okay

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.110 
um it's a long-term enough well okay
there's<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.220> couple<00:04:08.400> different<00:04:08.519> ways<00:04:08.790> and

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
there's a couple different ways and

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.369 
there's a couple different ways and
really<00:04:09.449> and<00:04:09.660> our<00:04:09.780> from<00:04:09.989> there<00:04:10.169> are<00:04:10.230> two

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
really and our from there are two

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.569 
really and our from there are two
different<00:04:10.709> ways<00:04:10.799> we'll<00:04:11.040> put<00:04:11.190> on<00:04:11.280> potassium

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
different ways we'll put on potassium

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.210 
different ways we'll put on potassium
some<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.389> we'll<00:04:12.540> put<00:04:12.750> on<00:04:12.870> dry<00:04:13.319> potash<00:04:13.980> and

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
some of it we'll put on dry potash and

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.860 
some of it we'll put on dry potash and
you<00:04:14.340> know<00:04:14.430> what<00:04:14.639> if<00:04:14.790> you've<00:04:14.940> got<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> crop<00:04:15.540> that

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
you know what if you've got a crop that

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.140 
you know what if you've got a crop that
really<00:04:16.139> needs<00:04:16.320> chlorine<00:04:16.889> for<00:04:17.160> example<00:04:17.669> potash

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
really needs chlorine for example potash

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.699 
really needs chlorine for example potash
has<00:04:18.419> chlorine<00:04:18.840> in<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.260> that's<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.500> good<00:04:19.650> way

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
has chlorine in it and that's a good way

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.409 
has chlorine in it and that's a good way
to<00:04:19.859> get<00:04:20.039> that<00:04:20.220> chlorine<00:04:20.549> out<00:04:20.820> there<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.269> do

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
to get that chlorine out there and do

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.870 
to get that chlorine out there and do
your<00:04:21.449> potassium<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.229> broadcast<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.430> or<00:04:23.580> strip

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
your potassium to broadcast it or strip

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.210 
your potassium to broadcast it or strip
till<00:04:24.120> we<00:04:24.330> do<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.479> lot<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.719> strip<00:04:25.050> till<00:04:25.260> now<00:04:25.440> deep

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
till we do a lot of strip till now deep

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.770 
till we do a lot of strip till now deep
right<00:04:26.460> over<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.850> row<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.360> then<00:04:27.510> we<00:04:27.660> can

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
right over the row and then we can

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.690 
right over the row and then we can
reduce<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.380> amount<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.710> fertilizer<00:04:28.890> reusing

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
reduce the amount of fertilizer reusing

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.370 
reduce the amount of fertilizer reusing
well<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.240> reduce<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.780> amount<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.080> tie<00:04:31.230> up

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
well and reduce the amount of tie up

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.810 
well and reduce the amount of tie up
that<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.590> get<00:04:31.710> on<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:31.860> potassium<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:32.700> the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
that you get on that potassium but the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.070 
that you get on that potassium but the
other<00:04:32.970> way<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.180> we're<00:04:33.450> doing<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:33.930> we're

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
other way that we're doing it is we're

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.810 
other way that we're doing it is we're
using<00:04:34.110> liquid<00:04:34.740> sure<00:04:34.980> cane<00:04:35.220> like<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.670> some

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
using liquid sure cane like and some

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.400 
using liquid sure cane like and some
ground<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:36.510> bought<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.930> went<00:04:37.200> all

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
ground that I just bought I went all

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.380 
ground that I just bought I went all
shirk'<00:04:37.920> that's<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.280> only<00:04:38.610> potassium<00:04:39.150> source

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
shirk' that's the only potassium source

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.000 
shirk' that's the only potassium source
I'm<00:04:39.540> using<00:04:39.750> because<00:04:40.080> it's<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:40.740> highly

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
I'm using because it's so highly

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.190 
I'm using because it's so highly
available<00:04:41.670> it<00:04:41.790> gets<00:04:41.940> right<00:04:42.270> into<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.720> crap<00:04:42.990> I

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
available it gets right into the crap I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.500 
available it gets right into the crap I
get<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.770> best<00:04:44.010> bang<00:04:44.220> for<00:04:44.250> my<00:04:44.550> buck<00:04:44.670> using<00:04:45.450> a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
get the best bang for my buck using a

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.790 
get the best bang for my buck using a
liquid<00:04:45.870> like<00:04:46.050> sure<00:04:46.260> kay<00:04:46.410> right<00:04:46.590> with<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
liquid like sure kay right with the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.440 
liquid like sure kay right with the
planner<00:04:47.040> yep<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.550> anyway<00:04:47.850> there<00:04:48.060> are<00:04:48.090> some

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
planner yep so anyway there are some

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.120 
planner yep so anyway there are some
options<00:04:48.870> certainly<00:04:49.410> if<00:04:49.650> you're<00:04:49.860> renting

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
options certainly if you're renting

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.610 
options certainly if you're renting
ground<00:04:50.640> we<00:04:50.880> would<00:04:51.030> advise<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.600> not<00:04:51.960> overdo

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
ground we would advise you to not overdo

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.590 
ground we would advise you to not overdo
it<00:04:52.890> on<00:04:53.190> fertilizer<00:04:53.670> if<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.120> don't<00:04:54.390> know

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
it on fertilizer if you don't know

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.120 
it on fertilizer if you don't know
you're<00:04:54.840> gonna<00:04:54.960> have<00:04:55.320> that<00:04:55.560> in<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.800> future<00:04:55.980> year

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
you're gonna have that in a future year

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.520 
you're gonna have that in a future year
because<00:04:56.850> remember<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.780> when<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.140> put<00:04:58.350> that

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
because remember that when you put that

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.170 
because remember that when you put that
potassium<00:04:58.890> out<00:04:59.340> there<00:04:59.550> in<00:04:59.640> a<00:04:59.700> lot<00:04:59.880> of<00:04:59.910> cases

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
potassium out there in a lot of cases

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.540 
potassium out there in a lot of cases
like<00:05:00.570> potash<00:05:01.320> you're<00:05:01.620> basically<00:05:02.010> spreading<00:05:02.370> a

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
like potash you're basically spreading a

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.760 
like potash you're basically spreading a
rock<00:05:02.790> okay<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.420> does<00:05:03.630> not<00:05:03.930> break<00:05:04.230> down<00:05:04.290> very

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
rock okay it does not break down very

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.560 
rock okay it does not break down very
quickly<00:05:04.980> we<00:05:05.310> can<00:05:05.400> go<00:05:05.520> out<00:05:05.640> in<00:05:05.790> rip<00:05:06.060> pits<00:05:06.330> the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
quickly we can go out in rip pits the

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.810 
quickly we can go out in rip pits the
following<00:05:07.050> summer<00:05:07.290> after<00:05:07.680> we<00:05:07.800> put<00:05:08.040> on<00:05:08.220> strip

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
following summer after we put on strip

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.390 
following summer after we put on strip
tilled<00:05:09.120> potash<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.320> fall<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:10.890> we<00:05:11.220> can

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
tilled potash in the fall and we can

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.580 
tilled potash in the fall and we can
very<00:05:11.670> often<00:05:12.150> find<00:05:12.390> some<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.840> that<00:05:12.930> potash<00:05:13.350> out

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
very often find some of that potash out

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.500 
very often find some of that potash out
there<00:05:13.830> yet<00:05:14.040> there's<00:05:14.430> no<00:05:14.610> doubt<00:05:14.790> potassium<00:05:15.420> is

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
there yet there's no doubt potassium is

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.910 
there yet there's no doubt potassium is
very<00:05:15.750> important<00:05:16.200> it's<00:05:16.320> one<00:05:16.470> of<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.650> three

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
very important it's one of the three

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.980 
very important it's one of the three
primary<00:05:17.190> nutrients<00:05:17.940> so<00:05:18.330> make<00:05:18.480> sure<00:05:18.510> you're

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
primary nutrients so make sure you're

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.360 
primary nutrients so make sure you're
getting<00:05:19.140> your<00:05:19.320> fertility<00:05:19.680> program<00:05:20.040> with

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
getting your fertility program with

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.550 
getting your fertility program with
potassium<00:05:20.669> just<00:05:21.300> right<00:05:21.540> on<00:05:21.750> your<00:05:21.930> farm<00:05:22.230> one

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
potassium just right on your farm one

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.810 
potassium just right on your farm one
other<00:05:22.710> thing<00:05:22.890> you<00:05:22.919> want<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.250> make<00:05:23.370> sure<00:05:23.400> it's

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
other thing you want to make sure it's

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.210 
other thing you want to make sure it's
just<00:05:24.180> right<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:24.900> weed<00:05:25.290> control<00:05:25.500> when<00:05:25.919> it<00:05:26.010> comes

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
just right is weed control when it comes

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.590 
just right is weed control when it comes
