hi<00:00:00.359> I'm<00:00:00.690> James<00:00:00.989> and<00:00:01.260> I'm<00:00:01.380> gonna<00:00:01.530> show<00:00:01.740> you<00:00:01.770> how

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hi I'm James and I'm gonna show you how

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.309 
hi I'm James and I'm gonna show you how
we<00:00:02.070> find<00:00:02.399> exoplanets<00:00:02.850> those<00:00:03.780> are<00:00:03.990> planets

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
we find exoplanets those are planets

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.800 
we find exoplanets those are planets
around<00:00:04.770> other<00:00:04.920> stars

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.080 

so<00:00:08.470> we're<00:00:08.650> on<00:00:08.770> the<00:00:08.890> island<00:00:09.010> of<00:00:09.340> la<00:00:09.670> palma<00:00:10.000> at

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
so we're on the island of la palma at

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.820 
so we're on the island of la palma at
the<00:00:10.180> minute<00:00:10.420> which<00:00:11.200> is<00:00:11.320> in<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.530> Canary

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
the minute which is in the Canary

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.460 
the minute which is in the Canary
Islands<00:00:12.190> and<00:00:12.550> here<00:00:13.030> we<00:00:13.120> have<00:00:13.300> a<00:00:13.470> transiting

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.470 
Islands and here we have a transiting

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.040 
Islands and here we have a transiting
exoplanet<00:00:15.220> instrument<00:00:15.790> that<00:00:16.720> surveys<00:00:17.020> a

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
exoplanet instrument that surveys a

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.540 
exoplanet instrument that surveys a
large<00:00:17.290> area<00:00:17.470> of<00:00:17.530> the<00:00:17.620> sky<00:00:17.830> so<00:00:18.160> this<00:00:18.280> is<00:00:18.430> super

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
large area of the sky so this is super

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.730 
large area of the sky so this is super
wasp<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:19.150> this<00:00:19.600> is<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.900> Northern<00:00:20.260> Hemisphere

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
wasp and this is the Northern Hemisphere

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.590 
wasp and this is the Northern Hemisphere
insulation<00:00:21.280> all<00:00:21.970> right<00:00:22.120> you're<00:00:22.330> gonna<00:00:22.420> show

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
insulation all right you're gonna show

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.270 
insulation all right you're gonna show
me<00:00:22.720> how<00:00:22.810> you<00:00:22.900> find<00:00:23.080> these<00:00:23.200> planets<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:23.950> this<00:00:24.100> is

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
me how you find these planets so this is

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.090 
me how you find these planets so this is
super<00:00:24.970> wasps<00:00:25.420> enclosure<00:00:25.780> and<00:00:26.110> in<00:00:26.770> this<00:00:26.920> part

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
super wasps enclosure and in this part

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.220 
super wasps enclosure and in this part
is<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.450> computer<00:00:28.450> room<00:00:28.600> where<00:00:28.810> we<00:00:28.900> have<00:00:29.080> all

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
is the computer room where we have all

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.720 
is the computer room where we have all
of<00:00:29.440> the<00:00:29.560> computers<00:00:30.070> that<00:00:30.100> control<00:00:30.340> the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
of the computers that control the

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.940 
of the computers that control the
telescope<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.510> push<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.960> data<00:00:32.140> back<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.439> the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
telescope and push the data back to the

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.790 
telescope and push the data back to the
universities<00:00:33.489> in<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.700> UK<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.210> in<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.559> other

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
universities in the UK and in the other

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.760 
universities in the UK and in the other
room<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.399> actual<00:00:36.640> telescope<00:00:37.000> itself<00:00:37.770> so

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
room is the actual telescope itself so

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.340 
room is the actual telescope itself so
this<00:00:38.920> is<00:00:39.100> superwash<00:00:39.489> itself<00:00:40.179> it<00:00:40.480> is<00:00:40.749> a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
this is superwash itself it is a

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.060 
this is superwash itself it is a
collection<00:00:41.710> of<00:00:41.920> eight<00:00:42.160> cameras<00:00:43.649> issues<00:00:44.649> in<00:00:44.829> a

survey a large area sky looking for

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.040 
survey a large area sky looking for
planets<00:00:52.539> which<00:00:53.039> transit<00:00:54.039> their<00:00:54.190> star<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.050> as

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
planets which transit their star and as

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.439 
planets which transit their star and as
the<00:00:56.199> planet<00:00:56.499> transits<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.069> star<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.999> causes<00:00:58.420> a

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
the planet transits the star it causes a

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.299 
the planet transits the star it causes a
slight<00:00:58.749> dip<00:00:59.019> in<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.559> brightness<00:00:59.649> of<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.069> star

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
slight dip in the brightness of the star

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.369 
slight dip in the brightness of the star
and<00:01:00.519> this<00:01:01.179> is<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.420> signature<00:01:01.839> we<00:01:01.989> look<00:01:02.170> for

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
and this is the signature we look for

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.619 
and this is the signature we look for
each<00:01:02.800> camera<00:01:03.370> looks<00:01:03.550> at<00:01:03.729> several<00:01:04.300> hundred

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
each camera looks at several hundred

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.550 
each camera looks at several hundred
thousand<00:01:05.170> stars<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:07.090> then<00:01:07.210> we<00:01:07.330> have<00:01:07.450> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
thousand stars and but then we have a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.930 
thousand stars and but then we have a
large<00:01:08.560> cluster<00:01:08.830> of<00:01:08.979> computers<00:01:09.400> back<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.729> the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
large cluster of computers back in the

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.080 
large cluster of computers back in the
UK<00:01:10.240> which<00:01:11.050> reduces<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.740> data<00:01:11.969> monitors<00:01:12.969> the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
UK which reduces the data monitors the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.450 
UK which reduces the data monitors the
brightness<00:01:13.420> of<00:01:13.570> each<00:01:13.659> star<00:01:13.930> individually<00:01:14.500> and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
brightness of each star individually and

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.359 
brightness of each star individually and
I'm<00:01:16.000> overtime<00:01:16.899> you'll<00:01:17.079> see<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.439> depth<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.189> the

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
I'm overtime you'll see the depth in the

we<00:01:45.850> when<00:01:46.840> we<00:01:46.930> want<00:01:47.109> very<00:01:47.320> accurate<00:01:47.799> photometry

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
we when we want very accurate photometry

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.910 
we when we want very accurate photometry
we<00:01:49.119> make<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.539> observe<00:01:50.020> one<00:01:50.289> field<00:01:50.619> all<00:01:50.859> night

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
we make it observe one field all night

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.099 
we make it observe one field all night
so<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:51.880> stays<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.420> just<00:01:52.659> follows<00:01:52.929> one

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
so it stays on it just follows one

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.440 
so it stays on it just follows one
position<00:01:53.530> all<00:01:53.649> night<00:01:53.850> taking<00:01:54.850> lots<00:01:55.179> and<00:01:55.329> lots

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
position all night taking lots and lots

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.719 
position all night taking lots and lots
of<00:01:55.539> images<00:01:55.929> so<00:01:56.200> if<00:01:56.829> we<00:01:56.979> can<00:01:57.100> go<00:01:57.189> we<00:01:57.369> can<00:01:57.490> go<00:01:57.520> in

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
of images so if we can go we can go in

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.830 
of images so if we can go we can go in
here<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:57.909> I<00:01:58.000> can<00:01:58.149> show<00:01:58.179> you<00:01:58.329> what<00:01:58.600> what

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
here and I can show you what what

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.469 
here and I can show you what what
actually<00:01:59.200> we<00:01:59.289> see<00:01:59.500> this<00:02:00.250> is<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.490> one<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.270> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
actually we see this is a one of the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.090 
actually we see this is a one of the
planets<00:02:01.810> discovered<00:02:02.289> by<00:02:02.380> Super<00:02:02.679> Wars

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
planets discovered by Super Wars

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.739 
planets discovered by Super Wars
this<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.429> was<00:02:03.670> twelve<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:04.479> what<00:02:04.600> we've<00:02:04.719> got

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
this is was twelve so what we've got

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.410 
this is was twelve so what we've got
here<00:02:04.929> is<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.289> plot<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:06.090> light<00:02:07.090> from<00:02:07.299> the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
here is a plot of the light from the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.930 
here is a plot of the light from the
star<00:02:07.659> over<00:02:07.869> over<00:02:08.470> time<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.429> can<00:02:09.550> see<00:02:09.700> here

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
star over over time and you can see here

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.820 
star over over time and you can see here
that<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.660> light<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.929> fairly<00:02:11.170> constant<00:02:11.440> and

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
that the light is fairly constant and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.310 
that the light is fairly constant and
then<00:02:12.400> as<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.760> planet<00:02:13.240> moves<00:02:13.420> in<00:02:13.900> front<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.230> the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
then as the planet moves in front of the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.530 
then as the planet moves in front of the
star<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.800> blocks<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.250> portion<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.360> light

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
star it blocks a portion of the light

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.899 
star it blocks a portion of the light
just<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:17.769> can<00:02:17.920> see<00:02:18.069> less<00:02:18.250> light<00:02:18.519> as<00:02:18.760> my

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
just like you can see less light as my

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.320 
just like you can see less light as my
hand<00:02:19.150> passes<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.629> front<00:02:19.659> of<00:02:19.900> the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
hand passes in front of the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.300 
hand passes in front of the
the<00:02:20.510> lamp<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.840> front<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.200> us<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.860> signal<00:02:22.070> can

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
the lamp in front of us this signal can

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.430 
the lamp in front of us this signal can
be<00:02:22.460> caused<00:02:22.910> by<00:02:23.120> lots<00:02:23.570> of<00:02:23.690> different<00:02:23.750> objects

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
be caused by lots of different objects

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.200 
be caused by lots of different objects
not<00:02:24.650> always<00:02:24.950> planets<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.610> can<00:02:25.790> be<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.910> small

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
not always planets it can be a small

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.930 
not always planets it can be a small
star<00:02:26.510> or<00:02:27.040> three<00:02:28.040> stars<00:02:28.340> moving<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
star or three stars moving in a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.230 
star or three stars moving in a
different<00:02:29.060> orbit<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.980> first<00:02:31.430> moved<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.820> a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
different orbit so we first moved to a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.290 
different orbit so we first moved to a
small<00:02:32.810> telescope<00:02:33.560> which<00:02:33.920> can<00:02:34.130> follow<00:02:34.370> up<00:02:34.580> this

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
small telescope which can follow up this

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.220 
small telescope which can follow up this
single<00:02:35.720> star<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.260> tell<00:02:37.040> us<00:02:37.160> whether<00:02:37.340> it's<00:02:37.640> a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
single star and tell us whether it's a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.480 
single star and tell us whether it's a
planet<00:02:39.230> or<00:02:39.350> not<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:40.070> can<00:02:40.220> show<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.400> that

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
planet or not and I can show you that

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.640 
planet or not and I can show you that
type<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:40.940> telescope<00:02:41.600> now<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.900> here<00:02:42.380> I'm<00:02:42.470> going

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
type of telescope now I here I'm going

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.860 
type of telescope now I here I'm going
to<00:02:42.740> open<00:02:42.920> up<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.340> dome<00:02:43.520> for<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.180> for<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
to open up the dome for the for the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.940 
to open up the dome for the for the
telescope<00:02:45.260> next<00:02:45.500> door<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:48.350> next<00:02:48.560> step<00:02:48.710> in<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
telescope next door the next step in the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.440 
telescope next door the next step in the
process<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.810> take<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.830> better<00:02:52.550> light<00:02:53.180> curve

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
process is to take a better light curve

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.370 
process is to take a better light curve
of<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.750> object<00:02:54.200> um<00:02:54.500> now<00:02:55.250> we<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:57.260> a

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
of the object um now we have this it's a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.200 
of the object um now we have this it's a
slightly<00:02:57.620> larger<00:02:57.800> telescope<00:02:58.430> which<00:02:58.880> looks<00:02:59.090> at

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
slightly larger telescope which looks at

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.390 
slightly larger telescope which looks at
a<00:02:59.240> smaller<00:02:59.510> patch<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.900> sky<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.860> do<00:03:01.100> much

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
a smaller patch of sky and you do much

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.000 
a smaller patch of sky and you do much
better<00:03:01.610> photometry<00:03:02.120> after<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.200> stage<00:03:03.440> if<00:03:03.740> it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
better photometry after this stage if it

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.640 
better photometry after this stage if it
still<00:03:04.220> looks<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.460> a<00:03:04.550> planetary<00:03:05.090> signal<00:03:06.080> we

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
still looks like a planetary signal we

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.680 
still looks like a planetary signal we
can<00:03:06.680> go<00:03:06.980> again<00:03:07.250> then<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.700> something<00:03:08.060> slightly

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
can go again then to something slightly

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.730 
can go again then to something slightly
larger<00:03:09.260> again

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
larger again

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.440 
larger again
so<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:10.430> small<00:03:10.670> telescope<00:03:10.850> has<00:03:11.300> only

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
so this this small telescope has only

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.810 
so this this small telescope has only
been<00:03:12.050> installed<00:03:12.470> last<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.460> was<00:03:13.610> only

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
been installed last it was only

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.990 
been installed last it was only
installed<00:03:13.940> last<00:03:14.390> year<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.920> our<00:03:16.370> new<00:03:16.820> 1

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
installed last year and this our new 1

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.390 
installed last year and this our new 1
meter<00:03:17.150> telescope<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:18.250> still<00:03:19.250> being

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
meter telescope is still being

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.700 
meter telescope is still being
commissioned<00:03:19.850> at<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.060> minute<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:21.110> they<00:03:21.560> will

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
commissioned at the minute and they will

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.120 
commissioned at the minute and they will
run<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.250> an<00:03:22.850> SEM<00:03:23.270> mode<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.320> operation<00:03:24.800> a<00:03:24.860> super

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
run in an SEM mode of operation a super

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.240 
run in an SEM mode of operation a super
wasp<00:03:25.310> where<00:03:26.110> no<00:03:27.110> one<00:03:27.260> will<00:03:27.380> be<00:03:27.500> here<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:27.890> it

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
wasp where no one will be here and it

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.850 
wasp where no one will be here and it
will<00:03:28.370> robotically<00:03:29.239> observe<00:03:29.600> all<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.560> targets

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
will robotically observe all the targets

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:42.760 
will robotically observe all the targets
the<00:03:31.010> super<00:03:31.250> boss<00:03:31.400> gives<00:03:31.640> it

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.970 

so<00:03:43.340> with<00:03:44.090> this<00:03:44.300> telescope<00:03:44.780> we<00:03:44.930> plan<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.470> do

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
so with this telescope we plan to do

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.280 
so with this telescope we plan to do
really<00:03:46.400> really<00:03:46.580> high<00:03:46.910> precision<00:03:47.690> photometry

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
really really high precision photometry

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.760 
really really high precision photometry
in<00:03:48.470> two<00:03:48.860> colors<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:49.910> we<00:03:50.000> can<00:03:50.180> get<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.770> light

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
other telescopes like the knot and do

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.830 
other telescopes like the knot and do
spectroscopy<00:04:09.530> where<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.490> look<00:04:10.640> for<00:04:10.840> the

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
spectroscopy where you look for the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.260 
spectroscopy where you look for the
wobble<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:12.590> planet<00:04:13.280> puts<00:04:13.760> on<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.030> star

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
wobble that this planet puts on the star
