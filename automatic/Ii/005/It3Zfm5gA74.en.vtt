 so I'm going to drain 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 and I rinse them with cold water 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.780
 stop the degrees of the snow peas 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.520

 cooking time as the rest of the ingredients 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 for this stir-fry dish 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.300
 for the salmon I am already going to the oven 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.300
 turn on at 220 degrees 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.730
 I put the salmon in liquid spheres 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.730
 margarine 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.890
 squeezes some margarine into one 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.340
 bowl smooth it just a little easier 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.340
 in 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.600
 with such a pass you can easily get the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.400
 provide salmon with margarine 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 do this on both sides and tightly 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.780
 I am going to put the salmon on this baking sheet 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.880
 put it down and start grilling in the oven 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 I think that is really super easy 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.390
 Thinking way will still flavor him with 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.390
 some pepper and salt 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.659
 I first put them in the baking tray 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.060
 because I have already provided the fish with 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.750
 Margarine does have the baking sheet 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.039
 not to be anointed and I can do it 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.039
 put in the oven under the grill 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.530
 The wok is hot add the liquid 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.700
 margarine just wait until the big one 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.700
 bellevue have disappeared 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.900
 I am now going to fry the onion 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:30.819
 set the heat with the ginger and garlic 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.069
 equal slightly softer and put this on 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.060
 fry for two minutes 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.730
 long enough the onions are nice glassy that 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.170
 means that they are well- fruited 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.170
 I angle the bell pepper 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.550
 spring onions there 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:59.170
 then raise the fire again and 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.170
 stirring for 2 minutes while stirring 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.620
 add the poles 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.260
 add the rice 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.269
 and then carefully make it again 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.709
 finish the dish with some soy sauce 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.709
 add this to taste 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.640
 the largest with the sesame seeds 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.650
 I put the stir-fry dish in the middle 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.910
 I make exactly the plate and the salmon 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.950
 on top of 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.660
 well looks very festive like me 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.830
