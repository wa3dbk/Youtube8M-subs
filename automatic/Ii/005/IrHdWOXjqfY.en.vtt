00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.560
 Good day to you, Andrei Shalygin 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.150
 interloper unclean hard drive 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.799
 no need to submit because it 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.610
 one of the most famous manufacturers 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.720
 hunting gunshot and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.810
 civil also military weapons 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.970
 network their distribution 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.820
 winchester is best known of course 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.970
 in the united states known 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.850
 historical to all of us in terms of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.090
 different westerns also model on 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.770
 weapon 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.600
 such as god fren she goes her 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.920
 as a matter of fact 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.410
 descent primarily on behalf of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.940
 own brand name identity in 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.110
 lately the hard drive started 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.750
 let out also not crossbows 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.940
 sore and winchester designed to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.550
 same purposes the peregrine falcon grief and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.910
 the rest of them spread from a point 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.290
 Distribution view first 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.890
 goes to australia 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.900
 between america after no he states and and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.479
 now we present 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.960
 Crossbows are not involved in Russia in this 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.210
 case in front of the model table option on 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.070
 how do they differ from everyone else 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.990
 models of hunting crossbow well first 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.210
 noticeable differences in color 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.960
 so it tried the battleship coloring 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.090
 notable difference from all a ballets by 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.380
 tactical plumb and equipment 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.630
 applied lot and appreciating 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.110
 see goal hollow there 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.450
 I appreciate the possibility of a crossbow sign 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.659
 rubber pads on the handle on the price 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.299
 on the fifth part 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.539
 clearly defined swivels for shoulder 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.539
 belt 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.369
 optical system presented before 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.720
 I didnâ€™t clean it with a firm sight 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.090
 have appropriate protective 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.030
 lining that naturally opens 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.430
 before using two position them 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.040
 traces to the regulation of the optical system 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.030
 up and horizontally for under thin 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:24.250
 optical system tuning 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:28.459
 two-tone lights with six degrees 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.930
 dimming up and down 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.549
 depending on reaching the surface 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:38.739
 you can tune you need to sit light 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:42.799
 one of the characteristic testers is 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.380
 special power hanger for mounted 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.630
 devices are fixed and not with 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.019
 panoramic castle so it's easy 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.660
 removed easily installed therefore 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.569
 the hunter does not have to do many things 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.389
 the manipulation of the dive on and the device has 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.850
 rubber fastening 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:06.250
 ballet bolts are bold so they are very 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.900
 securely fastened in different diameter 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.720
 block system is fairly stable 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.410
 effectively 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.890
 therefore its operation is enough 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:21.560
 just on the shoulders has dampers 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.360
 that reduce shoe vibration 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.190
 secured with a stream on a special 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.260
 film which can be installed in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.230
 besides stirrup 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.060
 various built from solo device 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.100
 semi-phishing grenade nozzles 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.850
 lanterns 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.810
 video cameras and so on data arbolit and 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.830
 among other things constructively 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.500
 also distinguishes the castle part of the scheme 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.220
 location as you see the castle 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.820
 parts of the bullpup ie the castle is located behind 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.550
 The tail of the trigger here is very 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.800
 Powerful 3 degree locking and system 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.550
 security inserted 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:10.290
 bolt after anger he her bowstrings can be 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.500
 deleted and yet it will result 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.220
 lock shot without bolt do 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.570
 corresponding descent is impossible here 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:27.080
 fuse fire up and down 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.110
 position of compliance and pain and sister 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.490
 in this case of steel he is 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.080
 sufficiently optimal for Russia 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.099
 because this system is enough 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.120
 reliably 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.689
 it generally weighs appropriate 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.680
 way 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.889
 but due to the fact that everything is not 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.189
 presented in no light material 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:52.550
 reliable approximately with triple protection 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:55.729
 from damage it is evil and all the details on 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.580
 arbolita with various troubles and 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.949
 it is characteristic seen in general then on 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:05.719
 reference edit conductive went to 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.860
 who quench after a shot in general 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.849
 throughout the design 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:15.310
 it can be seen that it is quite reliable in addition to 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:19.330
 This in the kit to the crossbow is necessary 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:23.800
 purchase a tensioner appropriate 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:27.669
 also wax for power lubrication 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.949
 sneakers as well as measures for clinics 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.680
 matching the calibration of whole and saved 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.190
 scorch the hard drive as well as all weapons 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.930
 Winchester is reliable enough 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.780
 practical hunting arno 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.789
 so it is although by classification 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.620
 Russian Federation they go as 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.389
 field arbolit and sports for 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.590
 entertainment is actually by 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.169
 American classification from 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.970
 normal hunting very good reliable 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.889
 crossbows which is used throughout 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.169
 the world 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.289
 cheering for her tester more than a hundred years 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.500
 innovation is mouth and clean andrew 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.500
