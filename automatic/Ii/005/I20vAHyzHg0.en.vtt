don't see any any time's going on for me
personally<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:30.160> might<00:02:30.670> be<00:02:30.819> because<00:02:31.030> it's

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
personally it might be because it's

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.309 
personally it might be because it's
getting<00:02:31.600> any<00:02:31.690> pace<00:02:31.930> with<00:02:32.110> muscle<00:02:33.569> but<00:02:34.569> I<00:02:34.870> would

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
getting any pace with muscle but I would

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.000 
getting any pace with muscle but I would
say<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.940> keep<00:02:37.269> trying<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.470> I've<00:02:38.590> taken<00:02:38.860> them

for<00:02:39.190> about<00:02:39.400> 16<00:02:39.880> weeks<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.110> would<00:02:41.560> say<00:02:41.799> keep

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
for about 16 weeks so I would say keep

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.870 
for about 16 weeks so I would say keep
trying<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:43.830> either<00:02:44.830> with<00:02:45.100> exercise<00:02:45.670> or

whatever but keep stay on it and give it
a<00:02:48.790> chance<00:02:48.819> for<00:02:49.299> it<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.510> work<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:50.049> I'll<00:02:50.920> be

here my body shape is like I look like

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.630 
here my body shape is like I look like
if<00:03:22.450> I'm<00:03:22.569> pregnant<00:03:22.780> now<00:03:23.530> there's<00:03:23.769> actually<00:03:23.980> a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
if I'm pregnant now there's actually a

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.059 
if I'm pregnant now there's actually a
spot<00:03:25.239> here<00:03:25.660> where<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.930> touch<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.620> it's<00:03:26.739> flat

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
spot here where you touch and it's flat

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.220 
spot here where you touch and it's flat
so<00:03:27.400> it's<00:03:28.030> not<00:03:28.269> it's<00:03:28.690> still<00:03:29.190> chunky<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:30.579> not

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
so it's not it's still chunky but not

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.500 
so it's not it's still chunky but not
out<00:03:32.230> like<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.890> way<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.130> was

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
out like the way it was

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.530 
out like the way it was
so<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.319> fat<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:36.209> melting<00:03:37.349> but<00:03:38.349> like<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:38.890> said

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
so the fat is melting but like I said

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.720 
so the fat is melting but like I said

regarding pounds I haven't lost any but

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.220 
regarding pounds I haven't lost any but
it's<00:03:43.060> probably<00:03:43.420> because<00:03:43.569> I'm<00:03:43.690> replacing<00:03:43.959> a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
it's probably because I'm replacing a

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.860 
it's probably because I'm replacing a
muscle<00:03:44.769> but<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.730> would<00:03:46.060> encourage<00:03:46.360> you<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.690> keep
