stormtrooper<00:01:58.229> commander<00:01:58.799> first<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:01.159> here's<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
stormtrooper commander first so here's a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.889 
stormtrooper commander first so here's a
stormtrooper<00:02:02.610> commander<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.299> believe<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.750> is

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
stormtrooper commander I believe this is

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.340 
stormtrooper commander I believe this is
just<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> basic<00:02:04.740> stormtrooper<00:02:05.430> mold<00:02:06.350> just

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
just the basic stormtrooper mold just

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.249 
just the basic stormtrooper mold just
with<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.770> pauldron<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.840> exactly<00:02:10.080> sure

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
with a pauldron I'm not exactly sure

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.750 
with a pauldron I'm not exactly sure
what<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> difference<00:02:10.679> between<00:02:11.280> these<00:02:11.489> San

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
what the difference between these San

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.130 
what the difference between these San
troopers<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.209> stormtrooper<00:02:12.750> command

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
troopers and stormtrooper command

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.930 
troopers and stormtrooper command
are<00:02:13.440> other<00:02:13.740> than<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.130> obvious<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.760> these

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
are other than the obvious that these

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.230 
are other than the obvious that these
guys<00:02:15.210> aren't<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.020> sand<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:17.730> they're<00:02:18.000> very

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
guys aren't in the sand but they're very

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.440 
guys aren't in the sand but they're very
similar<00:02:18.709> actually<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.920> would<00:02:20.760> say<00:02:20.790> they're<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
similar actually I would say they're the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.910 
similar actually I would say they're the
exact<00:02:21.720> same<00:02:21.959> thing<00:02:22.260> except<00:02:22.590> for<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.770> fact

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
exact same thing except for the fact

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.059 
exact same thing except for the fact
that<00:02:22.980> they<00:02:23.100> don't<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> giant<00:02:23.760> backpack

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
that they don't have a giant backpack

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.170 
that they don't have a giant backpack
but<00:02:26.069> I'm<00:02:26.190> sure<00:02:26.340> that'll<00:02:26.490> be<00:02:26.580> explained<00:02:27.030> at

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
but I'm sure that'll be explained at

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.080 
but I'm sure that'll be explained at
some<00:02:27.390> point<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.890> pauldron<00:02:29.370> it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
some point I really like the pauldron it

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.640 
some point I really like the pauldron it
adds<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.630> again<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.350> stormtrooper

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
adds like again it's a stormtrooper

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.020 
adds like again it's a stormtrooper
commander<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.400> kind<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.610> cool<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.820> get

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
commander so it's kind of cool to get

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.190 
commander so it's kind of cool to get
somebody<00:02:33.330> superior<00:02:33.810> than<00:02:33.959> just<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
somebody superior than just the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.550 
somebody superior than just the
stormtroopers<00:02:35.780> he's<00:02:36.780> paying<00:02:37.050> very<00:02:37.290> well

stormtroopers he's paying very well

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.650 
stormtroopers he's paying very well
again<00:02:37.890> he's<00:02:38.070> just<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> same<00:02:38.580> sculpt<00:02:39.120> as<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
again he's just the same sculpt as the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.160 
again he's just the same sculpt as the
first<00:02:40.430> stormtrooper<00:02:41.450> no<00:02:42.450> paint<00:02:42.720> flaws<00:02:42.959> on

let's<00:03:48.420> start<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> head<00:03:49.019> sculpt<00:03:49.380> i<00:03:51.590> think

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
let's start with the head sculpt i think

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.710 
let's start with the head sculpt i think
the<00:03:52.680> head<00:03:52.829> sculpt<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.670> definitely<00:03:54.120> decent<00:03:54.600> i

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
the head sculpt is definitely decent i

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.420 
the head sculpt is definitely decent i
don't<00:03:54.870> think<00:03:55.049> it's<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.350> best<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:56.010> hazard<00:03:56.310> was

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
don't think it's the best the hazard was

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.680 
don't think it's the best the hazard was
ever<00:03:56.579> done<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.000> definitely<00:03:57.209> think<00:03:57.480> they've

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
ever done but I definitely think they've

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.500 
ever done but I definitely think they've
captured<00:03:57.959> Hera's<00:03:58.380> likeness<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.310> bit

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
captured Hera's likeness a little bit

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.819 
captured Hera's likeness a little bit
which<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.660> cool<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.079> from<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> side<00:04:01.590> there

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.449 
which is cool like from the side there
it<00:04:01.920> looks<00:04:02.070> like<00:04:02.220> Hera<00:04:03.829> really<00:04:04.829> really<00:04:05.100> happy

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
it looks like Hera really really happy

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.830 
it looks like Hera really really happy
again<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.790> have<00:04:05.880> Hera<00:04:06.180> in<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.420> collection

that's<00:04:28.020> awesome<00:04:28.710> only<00:04:29.520> major<00:04:29.820> fly<00:04:30.270> would<00:04:30.330> say

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
that's awesome only major fly would say

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.450 
that's awesome only major fly would say
is<00:04:31.110> where<00:04:31.620> these<00:04:34.400> buckles<00:04:35.400> are<00:04:37.460> unfortunately

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
is where these buckles are unfortunately

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.100 
is where these buckles are unfortunately
they're<00:04:38.700> not<00:04:38.730> painted<00:04:39.300> in<00:04:39.830> they<00:04:40.830> should<00:04:40.889> be

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
they're not painted in they should be

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.570 
they're not painted in they should be
painted<00:04:43.110> brown<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.740> it's<00:04:43.950> just<00:04:44.130> a<00:04:44.220> complete

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
painted brown and it's just a complete

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.909 
painted brown and it's just a complete
orange<00:04:44.970> so<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.780> mean<00:04:46.080> it's<00:04:46.350> it's<00:04:46.560> an<00:04:46.740> easy

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
orange so I mean it's it's an easy

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.409 
orange so I mean it's it's an easy
customization<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.700> can<00:04:47.910> do<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.210> that's

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
customization you can do but that's

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.810 
customization you can do but that's
pretty<00:04:48.660> important<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.440> character<00:04:49.790> well<00:04:50.790> I

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
pretty important to the character well I

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.240 
pretty important to the character well I
mean<00:04:51.180> it's<00:04:51.419> it's<00:04:52.139> not<00:04:52.260> hugely<00:04:52.560> important<00:04:53.070> but

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
mean it's it's not hugely important but

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.770 
mean it's it's not hugely important but
I<00:04:53.280> mean<00:04:53.580> if<00:04:53.700> you're<00:04:53.850> gonna<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.389> know<00:04:54.450> make<00:04:54.750> a

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
I mean if you're gonna you know make a

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.600 
I mean if you're gonna you know make a
Hera<00:04:55.080> figure<00:04:55.440> go<00:04:55.980> all<00:04:56.100> out

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
Hera figure go all out

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.200 
Hera figure go all out
so<00:04:57.360> she<00:04:57.419> comes<00:04:57.720> with<00:04:57.930> her<00:04:58.139> blaster<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:59.210> we've

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
so she comes with her blaster that we've

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.750 
so she comes with her blaster that we've
seen<00:05:00.540> in<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.780> show<00:05:00.990> so<00:05:01.460> that's<00:05:02.460> cool<00:05:02.669> I

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
seen in the show so that's cool I

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.909 
seen in the show so that's cool I
believe<00:05:03.090> her<00:05:03.240> blaster<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.260> show<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.740> an

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
believe her blaster in the show is an

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.370 
believe her blaster in the show is an
orange<00:05:05.310> color<00:05:05.640> so<00:05:06.050> obviously<00:05:07.050> this<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.260> not

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
orange color so obviously this is not

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.790 
orange color so obviously this is not
painted<00:05:08.270> that<00:05:09.270> great<00:05:09.660> if<00:05:09.930> I'm<00:05:10.350> correct<00:05:10.530> I

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
painted that great if I'm correct I

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.960 
painted that great if I'm correct I
could<00:05:10.980> be<00:05:11.100> wrong

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
could be wrong

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.150 
could be wrong
it<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.480> fragile<00:05:12.840> figure<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.590> feels<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.100> little

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
it is a fragile figure it feels a little

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.159 
it is a fragile figure it feels a little
bit<00:05:14.280> fragile<00:05:14.580> kind<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.060> like<00:05:15.150> Sabine<00:05:15.540> it's<00:05:15.960> a

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
bit fragile kind of like Sabine it's a

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.270 
bit fragile kind of like Sabine it's a
smaller<00:05:16.500> figure<00:05:18.290> and<00:05:19.290> obviously<00:05:19.860> as<00:05:20.010> far<00:05:20.190> as

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
smaller figure and obviously as far as

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.830 
smaller figure and obviously as far as
articulation<00:05:20.910> she's<00:05:21.090> got<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.390> same<00:05:21.570> five

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
articulation she's got the same five

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.500 
articulation she's got the same five
points<00:05:22.550> so<00:05:23.550> not<00:05:23.729> too<00:05:23.850> much<00:05:24.000> going<00:05:24.240> on<00:05:24.300> there

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
points so not too much going on there

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.030 
points so not too much going on there
which<00:05:24.630> is<00:05:24.780> fine<00:05:24.990> I'm<00:05:25.229> okay<00:05:25.710> with<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.889> five

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
which is fine I'm okay with the five

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.320 
which is fine I'm okay with the five
points<00:05:26.400> line<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:26.790> I<00:05:26.880> know<00:05:26.970> there's<00:05:27.150> been<00:05:27.270> a

obviously we're still getting the Vader
and<00:05:41.550> ahsoka<00:05:41.820> packs<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:42.570> I<00:05:42.950> would<00:05:43.950> imagine

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
and ahsoka packs so I would imagine

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.680 
and ahsoka packs so I would imagine
we're<00:05:44.490> gonna<00:05:44.580> get<00:05:44.760> some<00:05:44.970> more<00:05:45.120> rebels<00:05:45.419> figures
