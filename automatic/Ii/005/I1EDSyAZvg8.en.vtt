 Hi everybody, I'm going to teach today to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.259
 How do you do an American game of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.570
 sewing fabrics then we go to the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.759
 We are going to need a game. 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.759
 American for Fabric Mold 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.470
 the scissors 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.330
 school for panic if you do not have 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.950
 An American game you can use tape 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.080
 metric to make the marking let's 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.240
 start by marking the fabric 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.920
 for every American game I'm going to need 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.630
 of two equal parts 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.630
 so just mark and cut 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.030
 now we're going to turn the two 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.920
 parts in one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.070
 for this we will use the glue to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.840
 circular remember fabric with side 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 backward outward 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.930
 this will cause it to the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.930
 finishing and the sewing aid 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 it is only putting on all the sides but 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.899
 leaves a piece without glue in one of the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 sides so that we can turn 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.159
 but it's turning around 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.619
 Let's let our fabric dry then 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.000
 package goes dry we'll turn the plane 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.000
 to the seven side of them 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.110
 you can also use scissors or 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 something a little more with everything to go 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.630
 adjusting the tips so that our 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.300
 plan well 7 after turning is just 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.950
 we make the final closing that is 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.380
 shaping the corner where people 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.640
 left open to turn and pass the glue 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.640
 and paste in the moment 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.219
 now be the American line will be 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.770
 ready to use the way you 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.899
