but I'm really loving it so far

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.420

I<00:02:13.239> left<00:02:13.689> the<00:02:13.810> world<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.260> love<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.530> characters<00:02:15.010> I

I left the world I love the characters I
love<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.000> writing<00:02:16.239> but<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.709> one<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.010> those

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
love the writing but it's one of those

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.830 
love the writing but it's one of those
books<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.459> because<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:19.000> pages<00:02:19.480> are<00:02:19.599> really

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
books that because the pages are really

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.750 
books that because the pages are really
big<00:02:20.049> it<00:02:20.319> just<00:02:20.379> feels<00:02:20.859> like<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.250> taking<00:02:21.459> me

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
big it just feels like it's taking me

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.959 
big it just feels like it's taking me
like<00:02:21.939> five<00:02:22.209> hours<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:23.079> read<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.620> page<00:02:23.890> like<00:02:24.819> I

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
like five hours to read one page like I

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.149 
like five hours to read one page like I
don't<00:02:25.030> know<00:02:25.209> if<00:02:25.450> I'm<00:02:25.689> the<00:02:25.719> only<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.260> who<00:02:26.739> gets

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
don't know if I'm the only one who gets

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.190 
don't know if I'm the only one who gets
like<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.549> but<00:02:27.790> just<00:02:27.939> when<00:02:28.390> books<00:02:28.959> have

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
like that but just when books have

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.959 
like that but just when books have
bigger<00:02:29.439> pages<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.040> just<00:02:30.069> feel<00:02:30.459> like<00:02:30.609> they<00:02:30.760> take

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
bigger pages I just feel like they take

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.869 
bigger pages I just feel like they take
like<00:02:31.420> I'm<00:02:31.569> spending<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.230> long<00:02:32.469> on<00:02:32.650> one<00:02:32.829> page<00:02:33.099> so

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
like I'm spending so long on one page so

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.940 
like I'm spending so long on one page so
yeah<00:02:34.120> it's<00:02:34.389> kind<00:02:34.599> of<00:02:34.780> taking<00:02:35.230> me<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.409> little<00:02:35.680> bit

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
yeah it's kind of taking me a little bit

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.949 
yeah it's kind of taking me a little bit
to<00:02:36.129> get<00:02:36.310> through<00:02:36.639> not<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.209> I'm<00:02:37.299> not<00:02:37.480> loving

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
to get through not that I'm not loving

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.140 
to get through not that I'm not loving
it<00:02:38.079> I'm<00:02:38.319> just<00:02:38.889> I'm<00:02:39.159> having<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.579> lot<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.760> trouble

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
it I'm just I'm having a lot of trouble

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.789 
it I'm just I'm having a lot of trouble
concentrating<00:02:40.389> too<00:02:41.200> since<00:02:41.560> I've<00:02:41.709> been

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
concentrating too since I've been

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.250 
concentrating too since I've been
writing<00:02:42.099> so<00:02:42.430> much<00:02:42.609> lately<00:02:42.849> but<00:02:43.629> I<00:02:43.689> do<00:02:43.900> really

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
writing so much lately but I do really

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.559 
writing so much lately but I do really
want<00:02:44.379> to<00:02:44.590> finish<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:45.159> but<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.269> being<00:02:46.480> said

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
want to finish this but that being said

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.449 
want to finish this but that being said
since<00:02:47.049> this<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.409> a<00:02:47.439> read-a-thon<00:02:47.739> if<00:02:48.189> this<00:02:48.340> is

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
since this is a read-a-thon if this is

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.309 
since this is a read-a-thon if this is
taking<00:02:48.760> me<00:02:48.790> too<00:02:49.060> long<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.419> read<00:02:49.629> I'm<00:02:49.959> going<00:02:50.230> to

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
taking me too long to read I'm going to

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.809 
taking me too long to read I'm going to
put<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.590> down<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:50.980> pick<00:02:51.159> up<00:02:51.250> something<00:02:51.489> else

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
put it down and pick up something else

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.369 
put it down and pick up something else
that<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> little<00:02:52.480> bit<00:02:52.599> quicker<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.079> like<00:02:53.349> I

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
that is a little bit quicker but like I

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.750 
that is a little bit quicker but like I
will<00:02:53.680> still<00:02:53.919> be<00:02:54.040> reading<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.370> I'll<00:02:54.459> just<00:02:54.489> pick

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
will still be reading it I'll just pick

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.300 
will still be reading it I'll just pick
it<00:02:54.790> up<00:02:54.909> after<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.780> readathons<00:02:56.230> are<00:02:56.470> over<00:02:56.769> but

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
it up after the readathons are over but

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.440 
it up after the readathons are over but
hopefully<00:02:57.609> that<00:02:57.760> won't<00:02:57.849> happen<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:58.269> I

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
hopefully that won't happen because I

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.580 
hopefully that won't happen because I
really<00:02:58.719> want<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.930> read<00:02:59.079> this<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.260> get<00:02:59.560> a

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
really want to read this and get a

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.580 
really want to read this and get a
review<00:02:59.950> up<00:03:00.189> and<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.909> all<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.150> those<00:03:01.450> fun<00:03:01.870> funky

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
review up and do all of those fun funky

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.920 
review up and do all of those fun funky
things<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:03.280> don't<00:03:04.060> know<00:03:04.239> what<00:03:04.389> just<00:03:04.540> happened

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
things I don't know what just happened

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.240 
things I don't know what just happened
but<00:03:05.139> we'll<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.769> go<00:03:05.889> with<00:03:05.919> it

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
but we'll just go with it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.619 
but we'll just go with it
the<00:03:06.609> next<00:03:06.819> book<00:03:06.939> that<00:03:06.969> I'm<00:03:07.150> hoping<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.540> read

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
the next book that I'm hoping to read

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
devon a keyblade

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.740 
devon a keyblade
so<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.799> book<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.099> only<00:03:12.280> like<00:03:12.579> 300<00:03:12.879> pages<00:03:13.389> so

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
readathon so the read your bookshelf

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.750 
readathon so the read your bookshelf
Athan<00:05:42.740> is<00:05:42.919> basically<00:05:43.310> where<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.520> pick<00:05:43.729> a

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
Athan is basically where you pick a

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.190 
Athan is basically where you pick a
point<00:05:44.090> on<00:05:44.270> your<00:05:44.390> bookshelf<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:44.930> you<00:05:45.020> just

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
point on your bookshelf and you just

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.320

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
read all the books from that point on so

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.390 
read all the books from that point on so
what<00:05:47.450> I'm<00:05:47.570> doing<00:05:47.900> is<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.350> noticed<00:05:48.860> on<00:05:49.039> my<00:05:49.070> may

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
what I'm doing is I noticed on my may

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.640 
what I'm doing is I noticed on my may
TBR<00:05:49.430> I<00:05:49.880> had<00:05:50.180> a<00:05:50.210> lot<00:05:50.390> of<00:05:50.419> blue<00:05:50.780> books<00:05:51.050> so<00:05:51.560> I'm

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
TBR I had a lot of blue books so I'm

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.170 
TBR I had a lot of blue books so I'm
just<00:05:51.830> choosing<00:05:52.070> a<00:05:52.280> bunch<00:05:52.430> of<00:05:52.550> blue<00:05:52.789> books<00:05:53.000> that

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
just choosing a bunch of blue books that

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.820 
just choosing a bunch of blue books that
are<00:05:53.270> not<00:05:53.390> necessarily<00:05:53.870> like<00:05:54.140> in<00:05:54.289> order<00:05:54.590> on<00:05:54.710> my

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
are not necessarily like in order on my

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.159 
are not necessarily like in order on my
shelf<00:05:55.100> but<00:05:55.669> they<00:05:56.090> are<00:05:56.300> all<00:05:56.600> on<00:05:56.780> my<00:05:56.930> shelf

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
shelf but they are all on my shelf

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.140 
shelf but they are all on my shelf
together<00:05:57.500> just<00:05:57.890> not<00:05:58.010> necessarily<00:05:58.669> like<00:05:58.820> one

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
together just not necessarily like one

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.790 
together just not necessarily like one
after<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.690> other<00:05:59.720> so<00:06:00.229> the<00:06:00.320> one<00:06:00.470> that<00:06:00.590> it<00:06:00.680> will

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
after the other so the one that it will

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.070 
after the other so the one that it will
probably<00:06:01.010> be<00:06:01.400> picking<00:06:01.760> up<00:06:01.940> if<00:06:02.510> I<00:06:02.660> finish<00:06:02.870> the

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
think this one will definitely be a very

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.460 
think this one will definitely be a very
quick<00:06:14.150> one<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.479> a<00:06:14.600> really<00:06:14.900> good<00:06:15.050> pick<00:06:15.260> for

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
quick one and a really good pick for

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.500 
quick one and a really good pick for
something<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.580> I<00:06:16.610> will<00:06:16.880> just<00:06:16.910> breeze

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
something that I will just breeze

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.150 
something that I will just breeze
through<00:06:17.539> and<00:06:18.320> this<00:06:18.560> is<00:06:18.710> where<00:06:18.860> it<00:06:18.950> becomes

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
through and this is where it becomes

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.250 
through and this is where it becomes
kind<00:06:19.490> of<00:06:19.610> a<00:06:19.729> toss-up<00:06:20.150> between<00:06:20.210> all<00:06:20.810> of<00:06:21.110> the

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
kind of a toss-up between all of the

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.870 
kind of a toss-up between all of the
blue<00:06:21.440> books<00:06:21.680> that<00:06:21.890> I<00:06:21.919> have<00:06:22.100> on<00:06:22.250> my<00:06:22.280> shelf<00:06:22.430> and

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
blue books that I have on my shelf and

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.090 
blue books that I have on my shelf and
then<00:06:23.030> there's<00:06:23.240> also<00:06:23.479> some<00:06:23.630> that<00:06:24.350> I<00:06:24.470> have<00:06:24.500> that

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
then there's also some that I have that

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.980 
then there's also some that I have that
should<00:06:25.370> be<00:06:25.550> coming<00:06:25.850> in<00:06:26.030> that<00:06:26.300> week<00:06:26.630> that<00:06:26.960> I

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
should be coming in that week that I

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.140 
should be coming in that week that I
really<00:06:27.410> want<00:06:27.590> to<00:06:27.650> read<00:06:27.800> so<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.580> first<00:06:28.850> one<00:06:29.030> is

that<00:06:32.360> the<00:06:32.570> spine<00:06:32.780> of<00:06:32.900> this<00:06:33.020> one<00:06:33.200> is<00:06:33.320> going<00:06:33.440> to

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
that the spine of this one is going to

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.320 
that the spine of this one is going to
be<00:06:33.620> blue<00:06:33.890> I'm<00:06:34.159> not<00:06:34.520> sure<00:06:34.820> but<00:06:35.060> Colleen

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
be blue I'm not sure but Colleen

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.630 
be blue I'm not sure but Colleen
Hoover's<00:06:35.750> books<00:06:35.990> are<00:06:36.169> always<00:06:36.440> super<00:06:37.220> quick

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
Hoover's books are always super quick

and I was

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.540 
and I was
so<00:06:38.419> excited<00:06:38.990> for<00:06:39.139> this<00:06:39.379> one<00:06:39.650> so<00:06:40.009> I<00:06:40.039> really<00:06:40.400> want

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.409 
to read it and then the other one is
maybe<00:06:42.680> someday<00:06:43.069> by<00:06:43.370> Colleen<00:06:43.729> Hoover<00:06:43.970> these

are<00:06:44.569> coming<00:06:44.750> in<00:06:44.930> from<00:06:45.110> book<00:06:45.259> outlet<00:06:45.379> I<00:06:45.740> just

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
are coming in from book outlet I just

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.550 
are coming in from book outlet I just
ordered<00:06:46.460> them<00:06:46.729> but<00:06:47.539> they<00:06:47.629> should<00:06:47.810> be<00:06:47.930> in<00:06:48.139> on

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
ordered them but they should be in on

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.170 
ordered them but they should be in on
time<00:06:49.009> for<00:06:49.129> the<00:06:49.250> read-a-thon<00:06:49.460> if<00:06:49.849> they're<00:06:50.000> not

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
time for the read-a-thon if they're not

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.879 
time for the read-a-thon if they're not
then<00:06:50.479> I'll<00:06:50.569> just<00:06:50.750> pick<00:06:50.900> something<00:06:51.110> else<00:06:51.439> but

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
then I'll just pick something else but

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.980 
then I'll just pick something else but
if<00:06:52.039> they<00:06:52.189> are<00:06:52.400> I<00:06:52.430> might<00:06:52.849> pick<00:06:53.060> up<00:06:53.090> those<00:06:53.539> and

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
if they are I might pick up those and

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.540 
if they are I might pick up those and
then<00:06:54.199> the<00:06:54.289> other<00:06:54.530> ones<00:06:54.830> that<00:06:54.979> I<00:06:55.039> might<00:06:55.280> pick<00:06:55.490> up

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
then the other ones that I might pick up

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.959 
then the other ones that I might pick up
are<00:06:55.879> the<00:06:56.659> the<00:06:57.500> archives<00:06:58.039> by<00:06:58.370> Victoria<00:06:58.909> Schwab

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:58.969 
are the the archives by Victoria Schwab

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.719 
are the the archives by Victoria Schwab
which<00:06:59.840> I'm<00:06:59.990> not<00:07:00.199> sure<00:07:00.500> how<00:07:00.770> quick<00:07:01.159> this<00:07:01.340> one<00:07:01.550> is

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
which I'm not sure how quick this one is

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.200 
which I'm not sure how quick this one is
I<00:07:02.000> think<00:07:02.569> it's<00:07:03.020> like<00:07:03.289> it's<00:07:03.560> only<00:07:03.860> 300<00:07:04.849> ish

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
I think it's like it's only 300 ish

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.890 
I think it's like it's only 300 ish
pages<00:07:05.900> so<00:07:06.080> it's<00:07:06.229> not<00:07:06.349> too<00:07:06.650> long<00:07:07.060> so<00:07:08.060> this<00:07:08.629> is<00:07:08.870> a

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
pages so it's not too long so this is a

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.860 
pages so it's not too long so this is a
very<00:07:09.379> strong<00:07:09.979> contender<00:07:10.280> for<00:07:10.729> that<00:07:10.969> and<00:07:11.449> the

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
very strong contender for that and the

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.540 
very strong contender for that and the
other<00:07:12.080> option<00:07:12.650> is<00:07:12.800> the<00:07:12.889> beginning<00:07:13.490> of

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
other option is the beginning of

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.100 
other option is the beginning of
everything<00:07:13.729> by<00:07:14.240> Robin<00:07:14.599> Schneider

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
everything by Robin Schneider

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.020 
everything by Robin Schneider
it's<00:07:15.620> a<00:07:15.770> contemporary<00:07:16.069> so<00:07:16.520> I'm<00:07:16.639> just<00:07:16.879> assuming

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.030 
it's a contemporary so I'm just assuming

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.149 
it's a contemporary so I'm just assuming
that<00:07:17.449> it's<00:07:17.599> gonna<00:07:17.690> be<00:07:17.870> cute<00:07:18.229> fun<00:07:18.650> and<00:07:18.860> quick

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:19.159 
that it's gonna be cute fun and quick

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:21.670 
that it's gonna be cute fun and quick
and<00:07:19.400> if<00:07:19.729> it<00:07:20.330> is<00:07:20.479> then<00:07:20.780> I'll<00:07:20.900> pick<00:07:21.050> it<00:07:21.169> up<00:07:21.289> if<00:07:21.469> not

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
and if it is then I'll pick it up if not

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.890 
and if it is then I'll pick it up if not
and<00:07:22.069> Men<00:07:22.310> and<00:07:22.520> then<00:07:22.909> probably<00:07:23.240> at<00:07:23.599> the<00:07:23.719> bottom

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
and Men and then probably at the bottom

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.930 
and Men and then probably at the bottom
of<00:07:24.199> this<00:07:24.349> read-a-thon<00:07:24.620> TV<00:07:25.219> art<00:07:25.400> just<00:07:25.729> because

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
of this read-a-thon TV art just because

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.200 
of this read-a-thon TV art just because
of<00:07:26.060> its<00:07:26.210> length<00:07:26.539> and<00:07:27.050> all<00:07:27.440> that<00:07:27.919> jazz<00:07:28.400> I<00:07:28.849> want

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.210 
of its length and all that jazz I want

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.610 
of its length and all that jazz I want

to be able to take my time with it so I

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.990 
to be able to take my time with it so I
don't<00:07:31.039> really<00:07:31.159> want<00:07:31.430> to<00:07:31.520> read<00:07:31.639> it<00:07:31.759> for<00:07:31.940> a

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 
don't really want to read it for a

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.209 
don't really want to read it for a
read-a-thon<00:07:32.360> but<00:07:33.080> if<00:07:33.259> I<00:07:33.440> do<00:07:33.500> choose<00:07:33.889> to<00:07:34.069> pick

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:34.219

I'll be picking this up for a

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.899 
I'll be picking this up for a
read-a-thon<00:07:47.240> but<00:07:48.080> if<00:07:48.440> I<00:07:48.590> do<00:07:48.650> it<00:07:49.190> is<00:07:49.340> here<00:07:49.669> and

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:49.909 
read-a-thon but if I do it is here and

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:53.140 
read-a-thon but if I do it is here and
it's<00:07:50.449> a<00:07:50.779> possibility<00:07:51.259> just<00:07:51.800> not<00:07:51.979> very<00:07:52.310> big
