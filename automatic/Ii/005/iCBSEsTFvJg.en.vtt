00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
Hesh headphones from Sena do calm or

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.330 
Hesh headphones from Sena do calm or
they<00:00:09.300> change<00:00:09.570> your<00:00:09.690> name<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.900> make<00:00:10.410> Falco<00:00:10.889> calm

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
they change your name to make Falco calm

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.820 
they change your name to make Falco calm
so<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.240> guess<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.620> would<00:00:13.799> call<00:00:13.830> them<00:00:14.070> Bob<00:00:14.880> calm

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
so I guess you would call them Bob calm

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.380 
so I guess you would call them Bob calm
and<00:00:17.270> these<00:00:18.270> cost<00:00:18.869> right<00:00:19.320> now<00:00:19.350> they're<00:00:20.359> 1559<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and these cost right now they're 1559 I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.920 
and these cost right now they're 1559 I
think<00:00:21.779> which<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.619> cheaper<00:00:23.609> than<00:00:23.640> uh

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
think which is actually cheaper than uh

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
think which is actually cheaper than uh
