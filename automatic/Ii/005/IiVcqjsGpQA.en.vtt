00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
of its higher hipfire spread as well as

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.700 
of its higher hipfire spread as well as

its slower rate of fire now that we have
an<00:01:32.890> understanding<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.729> how<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.910> mtar<00:01:34.390> works

attachments and perks in order to

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.020 
attachments and perks in order to
bolster<00:01:37.660> its<00:01:38.050> effectiveness<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.790> first

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
bolster its effectiveness the first

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.730 
bolster its effectiveness the first
attachment<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.660> I<00:01:40.690> recommend<00:01:41.020> for<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.410> mtar

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
attachment that I recommend for the mtar

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.490 
attachment that I recommend for the mtar
is<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.160> laser<00:01:42.460> sight<00:01:42.960> remember<00:01:43.960> how<00:01:44.080> earlier

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
is the laser sight remember how earlier

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.410 
is the laser sight remember how earlier
I<00:01:44.590> said<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.160> mtar<00:01:45.550> usually<00:01:46.000> loses<00:01:46.210> in

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
I said that the mtar usually loses in

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.420 
I said that the mtar usually loses in
close<00:01:46.630> quarters<00:01:46.960> combat<00:01:46.990> well<00:01:47.830> this<00:01:48.160> laser

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
close quarters combat well this laser

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.859 
close quarters combat well this laser
sight<00:01:48.759> will<00:01:48.910> turn<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.240> tables<00:01:49.600> on<00:01:49.750> the

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
sight will turn the tables on the
