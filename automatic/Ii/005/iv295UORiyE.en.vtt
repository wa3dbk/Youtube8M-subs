nanometers<00:02:32.630> which<00:02:33.320> basically<00:02:33.800> just<00:02:33.950> means

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
nanometers which basically just means

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
it's green there are five green lasers

in<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.410> executive<00:02:36.710> series<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.400> are<00:02:37.520> less

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
in the executive series that are less

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.460 
in the executive series that are less
than<00:02:37.880> 100<00:02:38.210> milliwatts<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.780> guess<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.260> could

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
than 100 milliwatts so I guess it could

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
be one of the others whichever model it

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.390 
be one of the others whichever model it
is<00:02:41.420> it's<00:02:41.930> fun<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.440> it's<00:02:42.650> turned<00:02:42.920> nail<00:02:43.100> into<00:02:43.310> a
