00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.571
 Cool! 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.300
 And what are the cool things to play in Barça's first team? 

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:12.667
 He is half Italian 

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:13.533
 half of the Brazilian 

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.533
 and half Spaniard. 

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.933
 A help game (halfway) 

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.033
 And whenever he can, he gets up at noon (mid-day) 

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:20.933
 As you say, it's cool (bé). 

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.067
 Like B from a burger at Christmas dinner. 

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:25.900
 He is an extremist and is extremely thin. 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.133
 His centers usually do not go to Cuenka * 

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:36.467
 As I am not playing in Barça B anymore, I will sit next to Puyol, as I will be his successor. 

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:38.867
 He is a defender, 

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:41.900
 though, at the moment, he is only defending his place on the bench. 

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.733
 Where are you? You sit there. 

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.333
 The young are what? 

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.233
 And what are you happy about? You are still small. Well, now. 

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.267
 And what are you happy about? You are still small. Well, now. 

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.300
 What is it supposed to be? 

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:23.167
 Children's menu, boys: pasta! 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.567
 You know that carbohydrates are perfect for athletes. 

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.933
 Better than grandma. 

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:33.167
 Well, better than my grandmother. 

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.467
 No, no, I mean my grandma. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.567
 Me too. 

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:46.030
 Guys, a moment of attention. 

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.970
 I would like to toast this season, which is so wonderful. 

00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:53.330
 Yes and for the match at Bernabéu and for the World Cup! 

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:57.600
 Hey, we do not have champagne. 

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.530
 You are making a toast with lemonade, you have not had so many years. 

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:10.030
 And now the moment we were waiting for ... Christmas poem. 

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.530
 Come on, Thiago, do not be ashamed. 

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.530
 Come on, Thiago, do not be ashamed. 

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:26.000
 They're Christmas ... 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.870
 No, you have to do it in a chair. 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.200
 Enter the chair, enter the chair! 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.040
 I am a player of the first team and I do not think about stepping into a chair. 

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:42.800
 It's Christmas, it's Christmas, a holiday of joy. 

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:48.370
 Jesus was born in Bethlehem in a stable. 

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:57.070
 Come on, now we're going to a party! Everyone to Llum de Gas! 

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:03.400
 Where are you? They will not let us in. 

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.130
 I think we are still too small for some things. 

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:10.670
 You were right: it's great to be in the first team. 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.670
 And when did you eat my grandma's pasta? 

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:20.470
 Hey guys, we're waiting! 

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:23.600
 Seriously? Should not we go to sleep? 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.400
 What are you talking about! We're going to ball! 

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:33.870
 You see how cool, the kids will not drink and drive us away! 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.870
 And the pasta came out cheaper than a taxi! 

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.300
 I love Christmas dinners. 

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:42.070
 We should do it yourself, you and me. 

00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:43.770
 And an invisible visitor. 

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:46.630
 As soon as two do not make sense. 

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:46.630
 As soon as two do not make sense. 

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:49.470
 And with this invisible visitor, it is not known what gift will bring. 

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:52.130
 Besides, a year ago, we did it and did not receive a gift. 

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:52.130
 Besides, a year ago, we did it and did not receive a gift. 

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:52.130
 Besides, a year ago, we did it and did not receive a gift. 

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.330
 But what are you saying, Charlio, this is a lie! 

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.900
 The point is that my gift was invisible just like this guy. 

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:04.130
 Listen, Johan, how are you celebrating Christmas? 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.500
 Well, as each year we get together with family ... 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.100
 we dress a Christmas tree, we put a crib ... 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.000
 Santa Clauses ... 

00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:19.090
 Posrany is this guy! You can not babble on Nicholas. 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:24.480
 Sure! That's why he got so pissed off when we gave him a rod ... 

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:30.980
 Okay, never mind, give me another skit.
