00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
this is the Kessel 160s the newest model

of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> Kessel<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:56.460> don't<00:00:56.610> make<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> 150

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
of the Kessel they don't make the 150

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.189 
of the Kessel they don't make the 150
anymore<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.050> got<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> 150<00:00:59.600> over<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> year<00:01:00.960> ago

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
anymore I got the 150 over a year ago

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.200 
anymore I got the 150 over a year ago
and<00:01:01.469> what<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.129> did<00:01:02.399> was<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> 150<00:01:03.090> was

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and what I did was the 150 was

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.520 
and what I did was the 150 was
originally<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.930> 29<00:01:04.409> gallon<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.689> I<00:01:06.689> moved

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
originally on this 29 gallon and I moved

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.789 
originally on this 29 gallon and I moved
the<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.799> 52<00:01:08.189> by<00:01:08.280> 14<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.330> bought<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> 160<00:01:10.650> this

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the one 52 by 14 and bought the 160 this

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.630 
the one 52 by 14 and bought the 160 this
year<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.100> Boxing<00:01:11.490> Day<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.810> my<00:01:12.930> 29

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
year on Boxing Day and put it on my 29

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
year on Boxing Day and put it on my 29
so<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.420> 160<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:17.479> pretty<00:01:18.479> much<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> same<00:01:19.080> as

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
so the 160 is pretty much the same as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.969 
so the 160 is pretty much the same as
the<00:01:19.500> 150<00:01:20.570> except<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.049> light<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.830> be

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the 150 except that the light can be

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.810 
the 150 except that the light can be
adjusted<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.159> amount<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.640> blue<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
adjusted now to the the amount of blue I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
adjusted now to the the amount of blue I
want<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.630> turn<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> actinic<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
want I can turn on the actinic I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.670 
want I can turn on the actinic I
couldn't<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.310> 150<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
couldn't do that what do 150 so with the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069 
couldn't do that what do 150 so with the
knob<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:33.299> squish<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.869> lights

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
knob up here I can squish the lights

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.810 
knob up here I can squish the lights
down<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.060> right<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:37.310> as<00:01:38.310> white<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.640> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.680 
came out but now it is with these these
castles<00:02:22.270> are<00:02:22.360> quite<00:02:22.720> affordable<00:02:23.020> compared<00:02:23.920> to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
castles are quite affordable compared to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.440 
castles are quite affordable compared to
some<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.810> LED<00:02:26.080> set<00:02:26.320> up<00:02:26.440> stiff<00:02:27.240> they've<00:02:28.240> had

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
some of the LED set up stiff they've had

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.140 
some of the LED set up stiff they've had
so<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> decided<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.680> go<00:02:29.800> for<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.940> long

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
so I decided to go for it in the long

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.730 
so I decided to go for it in the long
run<00:02:31.360> it'll<00:02:31.510> be<00:02:31.630> cheaper<00:02:32.020> electricity<00:02:32.140> wise

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
run it'll be cheaper electricity wise

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.000 
run it'll be cheaper electricity wise
and<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.600> cheaper<00:02:34.600> than<00:02:34.720> buying<00:02:34.870> new<00:02:35.200> bulbs

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
and I cheaper than buying new bulbs

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.670 
and I cheaper than buying new bulbs
every<00:02:36.280> year<00:02:36.490> for<00:02:36.730> my<00:02:37.140> compact<00:02:38.140> fluorescents

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
every year for my compact fluorescents

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
every year for my compact fluorescents
which<00:02:38.800> aren't<00:02:39.040> bright<00:02:39.280> enough<00:02:39.340> anyway<00:02:41.459> but

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
which aren't bright enough anyway but

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.340 
which aren't bright enough anyway but
there<00:02:43.840> we<00:02:43.959> go<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.340> my<00:02:48.520> 14<00:02:49.209> which<00:02:49.900> has<00:02:50.140> my

how much the same tackle for same guys I
lost<00:03:01.820> one<00:03:02.150> cloud<00:03:04.060> over<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.090> year<00:03:05.330> ago<00:03:08.710> honestly

your<00:03:37.610> pistol<00:03:37.880> shrimp<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:39.170> Gobi<00:03:39.530> attacked

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
it and drove it away so now I'm

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.620 
it and drove it away so now I'm
wondering<00:03:42.400> if<00:03:43.400> my<00:03:43.730> last<00:03:43.970> pistol<00:03:44.360> shrimp<00:03:44.540> was

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
wondering if my last pistol shrimp was

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.040 
wondering if my last pistol shrimp was
actually<00:03:44.959> killed<00:03:45.260> by<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.440> Gobi<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:47.900> not

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
actually killed by the Gobi this is not

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.840 
actually killed by the Gobi this is not
the<00:03:48.200> original<00:03:48.290> pink<00:03:49.010> spotted<00:03:49.340> Gobi<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.610> got

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
the original pink spotted Gobi I got

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.220 
the original pink spotted Gobi I got
this<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.300> replacement<00:03:50.600> being<00:03:51.050> spotted

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
this is the replacement being spotted

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.020 
this is the replacement being spotted
Gobi<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.590> got<00:03:51.830> but<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.100> other<00:03:52.220> one<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.520> died<00:03:52.730> a

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
Gobi I got but the other one that died a

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.720 
Gobi I got but the other one that died a
while<00:03:53.810> back<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.739> guess<00:03:55.070> maybe<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.580> guy

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
while back and I I guess maybe this guy

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.460 
while back and I I guess maybe this guy
just<00:03:55.940> does<00:03:56.060> not<00:03:56.239> want<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.570> live<00:03:56.690> with<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.870> shrimp

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.250 

so<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:01.190> light<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.670> here<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.600> original<00:04:02.810> a

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
so the light in here is the original a

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.650 
so the light in here is the original a
150<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:03.739> got<00:04:04.010> last<00:04:04.310> year<00:04:07.209> looks<00:04:08.209> very<00:04:08.420> similar

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
150 I got last year looks very similar

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.479 
150 I got last year looks very similar
just<00:04:08.959> doesn't<00:04:09.200> have<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.530> control<00:04:10.130> knob<00:04:10.310> this

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
just doesn't have the control knob this

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.470 
just doesn't have the control knob this
is<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.670> older<00:04:10.910> model<00:04:11.180> they're<00:04:11.299> just

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
is the older model they're just

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.729 
is the older model they're just
discontinued<00:04:12.049> now<00:04:14.410> LED<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:15.980> much<00:04:16.400> better

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
discontinued now LED is so much better

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.620 
discontinued now LED is so much better
than<00:04:18.739> compact<00:04:19.250> fluorescent<00:04:19.820> but<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.209> colors

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
than compact fluorescent but the colors

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.630 
than compact fluorescent but the colors
that<00:04:21.080> come<00:04:21.260> out<00:04:21.440> everything<00:04:22.310> looks<00:04:22.490> great<00:04:22.810> and

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
that come out everything looks great and

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.360 
that come out everything looks great and
the<00:04:25.640> coral<00:04:26.090> grows<00:04:26.620> way<00:04:27.620> better<00:04:27.919> under<00:04:28.220> these

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
the coral grows way better under these

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.020 
the coral grows way better under these
lights<00:04:28.610> than<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.330> old<00:04:29.450> compact<00:04:30.410> fluorescents

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
lights than the old compact fluorescents

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.600 
lights than the old compact fluorescents
which<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.150> guess<00:04:32.330> is<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.479> pretty<00:04:32.900> obvious

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
which I guess is a pretty obvious

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.390 
which I guess is a pretty obvious

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
clam I don't know if it came with it or

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.510 
clam I don't know if it came with it or
not<00:04:48.960> but<00:04:49.960> I've<00:04:50.199> been<00:04:50.410> fighting<00:04:50.710> off<00:04:50.949> pyramid

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520

snails<00:04:51.820> on<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.259> clam<00:04:54.840> every<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:55.990> often

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
snails on the the clam every so often

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.140 
snails on the the clam every so often
I'll<00:04:56.740> see<00:04:57.160> that<00:04:57.190> it's<00:04:57.460> covered<00:04:57.789> in<00:04:57.850> them<00:04:57.970> about

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
I'll see that it's covered in them about

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.159 
I'll see that it's covered in them about
that<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.360> clean<00:04:58.539> them<00:04:58.660> all<00:04:58.750> off<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.080> they'll

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
that to clean them all off and they'll

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.779 
that to clean them all off and they'll
be<00:04:59.259> gone<00:04:59.410> for<00:04:59.740> about<00:04:59.830> three<00:05:00.370> or<00:05:00.400> four<00:05:00.759> weeks

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:01.920 
be gone for about three or four weeks
and<00:05:01.240> all<00:05:01.389> of<00:05:01.449> a<00:05:01.479> sudden<00:05:01.720> they'll<00:05:01.810> just

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
and all of a sudden they'll just

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.629 
and all of a sudden they'll just
reappear<00:05:02.500> again<00:05:02.740> because<00:05:03.220> when<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.430> thought<00:05:03.580> I

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
reappear again because when I thought I

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.560 
reappear again because when I thought I
got<00:05:03.820> rid<00:05:04.000> of<00:05:04.030> them<00:05:05.220> but<00:05:06.220> he<00:05:06.520> is<00:05:06.639> growing<00:05:06.880> quite

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
got rid of them but he is growing quite

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.810 
got rid of them but he is growing quite
a<00:05:07.600> bit
