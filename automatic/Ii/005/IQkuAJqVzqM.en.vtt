00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:27.129
 that yes was the possibility you know of 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:29.229
 take off the nape of the neck but I had to 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.599
 play too much and now play will be a lot 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.240
 with a sniper and the truth that 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:37.389
 it was complicated there he can get me out 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.520

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.879
 changing a pim pam I had separated 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.319
 the truth may continue with the streak but 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.939
 they have already caught me for trying to play 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.740

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.560
