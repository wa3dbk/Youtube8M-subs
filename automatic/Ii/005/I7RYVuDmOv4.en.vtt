00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
at first glance it looks nearly

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.589 
at first glance it looks nearly
identical<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.890> galaxy<00:00:08.340> s3<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.120> as<00:00:09.360> far<00:00:09.540> as

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
identical to the galaxy s3 and as far as

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.240 
identical to the galaxy s3 and as far as
the<00:00:09.780> hardware<00:00:10.170> goes<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.740> changes<00:00:11.099> are
