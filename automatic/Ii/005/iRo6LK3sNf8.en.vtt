 point 9.5 which is called camera 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.930
 vigilance good guys in this mode is 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.600
 Very simple to use and very easy in 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.850
 reality very easy to remove this here 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.520
 let's put what is in the first 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.770
 person so they can see you better ok 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 what we are going to do now is good 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.059
 I'm going to put something more elegant of say 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.940
 LEDs could be said like that and we'll put 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.650
 our camera that there will appear a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.050
 command that we will have to put to 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.290
 continuation that is the name to our 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.130
 camera ok what we have to do is what 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.450
 next is the 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.330
 v 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.760
 we put you name 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.280
 we put this the name of our 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.960
 camera that in this case I'm going to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.920
 put what is a r can say so 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.870
 ok it says that our camera r is 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.930
 willing or is working could be 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.240
 say that we're going we're going towards our 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.910
 let's say it's in our house and 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.020
 we want to see the crops we make 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.270
 nothing else we put here what is the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.060
 command is islands 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.610
 cc of v 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.980
 we put on show 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.680
 and we put in our name our 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.660
 camera that is r we put the name of 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.370
 our camera and automatically not 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.830
 you will transport him to what is 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.410
 our camera as teaching this clip 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.770
 but it seems that he does not see me in reality 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.780
 I see the clipper ok and well we do not 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.300
 we can move more than from this site 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.880
 where is the glass we can not 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 move so we are very good 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.330
 because if we have 50 cameras the 50 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.700
 we can see the cameras 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.950
 with great ease we swim putting the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.040
 name and show to leave the camera 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.180
 nothing else you have to do is lar we put 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.549
 in cctv we put the leaf 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.370
 and automatically we will be where 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.010
 we were before 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.560
 as we are also moving to 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.340
