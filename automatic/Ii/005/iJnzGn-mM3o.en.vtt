00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello like this on youtube is the day 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.450
 today I hope that I am superbly come 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.120
 gómez mont and chilevisión dotcom and the 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.580
 today we are going to learn that it is a 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.770
 good storyboard I will not tell you about 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.660
 past what it was before what it is 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.700
 now and all those things I will give them all 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.230
 a very general idea of ​​what it is 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.180
 certainly you came to this 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.070
 video because they do not know it or know very 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.770
 little then then I will give them a 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.320
 granite more than sand for your head no 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.700
 look at the storyboard basically a guide 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.430
 so that the production team 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.830
 understand how the movie is going we know 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.010
 many people who work in a 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.450
 movie or in a short film 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.980
 depending on the circumstances 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.630
 depending on budget money 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.840
 everything is good if we for example 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.070
 we have about 300 people to our 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.740
 which will be the ones that are going to 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.380
 work in the movie for the same and if 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.110
 we could do the storyboard about 40 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.300
 50 people I do not see the case make a 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.980
 storyboard is enough with a technical script a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.390
 technical script like this if you guys 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.640
 they want to know about the script 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.960
 technical and how to do it because this in another 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.550
 video here on the channel but hey the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 storyboard first of all let's see 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.460
 what is 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.770
 storyboard is the entire technical script 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.810
 the movie in cartoons in are good 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.880
 be bad they show you where the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.590
 camera that the actors are going to be how 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.659
 are going to make the actors pretty much 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.850
 even with balloons what are your phrases 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.040
 your texts what are they going to say more 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.020
 or less is up to that I show you libor 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.390
 but as I mentioned them I do not see the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.820
 need if we are going to work for something 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.820
 50 people the storyboard is used 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.000
 much in the big productions the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.550
 huge huge productions that is 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.950
 as in those in the Lord of the Rings' 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.569
 sure I do not know in the mockingjay movie in 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.220
 that of the exodus in any of these 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.530
 things in fact the productions 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.020
 hollywoodenses hire people apart 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.539
 to make the storyboards no longer 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.000
 both in drawings but in animations 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.700
 then do an account no no no so 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.619
 well done but almost almost with sticks 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.140
 but in pure animation the whole movie 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.000
 so you call the whole team 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.880
 production all the actors all the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.400
 who are going to be and see that, see the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.560
 animation and watch the camera changes 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.110
 see how it will be for everyone to put 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.150
 attention and see how you are going to work 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.790
 and a lot for the organization of these 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.620
 people so that everyone is with the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.210
 stare at a single point so that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.190
 understand what it is that he wants 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.020
 director and what do you want 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.880
 good the scriptwriter or the producers is 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.430
 what you want to achieve in the end is not 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.230
 is for it in itself but for a 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.270
 girl production as we say my 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.450
 movie because it would be something coarse something 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.250
 absurd to make a storyboard because then 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.959
 I already have the technical script so if I 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.940
 I understand , I'm telling you all 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.310
 the people who do as a director 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.170
 assistant director handles the script 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.150
 technician and he's telling you he's saying 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.310
 to the cameraman how the scenes will go 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.040
 and I'm driving the actors, yes and 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.709
 it would also take quite a long time 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.780
 because if I want to do one in one this 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.330
 let's say in the technical script I took 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.220
 like a week doing it structuring 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.590
 what since it has almost almost the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.390
 technical script is edited edit the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.730
 movie in your head before this one 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.410
 no and the storyboard is to show you 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.120
 all how is going to be the 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.880
 movie but then if something was done to me 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.380
 something silly to do but basically 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.330
 that's what the storyboard is 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.760
 film in drawings 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.950
 other works in which you have 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.300
 budget and you want to do this from 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.980
 billing and still has money left 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.680
 then they hire cartoonists 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.450
 other types of people hire artists 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.850
 to make the storyboard then 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.560
 they do the storyboard and with that already 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.070
 they say they had it but that's it 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.560
 very weird because I do not think that in many 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.020
 sides in many places about money 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.640
 it does not stop to make a movie but 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.550
 well, that's basically what it is 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.740
 the storyboard is what I was going to 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.870
 teach later I will make another video 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.630
 in which I teach you that is the 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.030
 storyboard but from its origins 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.459
 because he was born because he was born who created him 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.200
 and all those things then but that's what 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.360
 I'll do in another in another video so 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.160
 while they already have this 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.380
 notion of my vision that if they go to 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.470
 make a short or a long without 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.940
 money do not make a better storyboard 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.320
 use the technical self and with that is more 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.690
 that enough very well I'm fine 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.640
 gomez mont and weak and fields dotcom 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.770
 remember to visit vi different point 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.240
 com remember to watch my trailer 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.139
 movie that should be showing up 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.240
 right now 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.639
 on screen and see you in the next 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.270
 video tutorial or short film 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.270
 feature film
