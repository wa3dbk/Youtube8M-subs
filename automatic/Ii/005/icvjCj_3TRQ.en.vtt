as<00:02:15.900> every<00:02:16.170> battle<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.800> war<00:02:16.980> has<00:02:17.220> been

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
as every battle of the war has been

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.280 
as every battle of the war has been
recreated<00:02:17.850> at<00:02:18.210> least<00:02:18.420> once<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.080> some
