pedals<00:00:06.380> from<00:00:06.470> black<00:00:06.770> star<00:00:07.040> I've<00:00:07.460> got<00:00:08.090> five<00:00:08.570> of

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
pedals from black star I've got five of

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.810 
pedals from black star I've got five of
them<00:00:08.840> up<00:00:08.930> here<00:00:09.110> ranging<00:00:09.530> from<00:00:09.770> a<00:00:09.950> boost<00:00:10.219> Drive

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
them up here ranging from a boost Drive

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.840 
them up here ranging from a boost Drive
distortion<00:00:11.809> metal<00:00:12.139> and<00:00:12.289> the<00:00:12.709> dual<00:00:12.889> they<00:00:13.730> all

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
distortion metal and the dual they all

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.850 
distortion metal and the dual they all
feature<00:00:14.059> sounded<00:00:14.480> switching<00:00:14.930> very<00:00:15.680> very

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
feature sounded switching very very

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.240 
feature sounded switching very very
quiet<00:00:16.129> and<00:00:16.400> I'll<00:00:17.270> go<00:00:17.449> from<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:18.380> boost<00:00:18.710> down<00:00:19.010> to

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
quiet and I'll go from the boost down to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.160 
quiet and I'll go from the boost down to
the<00:00:19.370> the<00:00:19.610> higher<00:00:19.790> gain<00:00:20.060> ranges<00:00:20.810> here<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.080> I'll

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
the the higher gain ranges here so I'll

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.540 
the the higher gain ranges here so I'll
play<00:00:21.290> the<00:00:21.380> same<00:00:21.530> kind<00:00:21.950> of<00:00:22.070> thing<00:00:22.280> basically

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
play the same kind of thing basically

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.120 
play the same kind of thing basically
and<00:00:23.060> go<00:00:23.630> through<00:00:23.780> the<00:00:23.870> gain<00:00:23.990> ranges<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.890> boost

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
and go through the gain ranges the boost

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.790 
and go through the gain ranges the boost
is<00:00:25.250> just<00:00:25.400> a<00:00:25.490> straight<00:00:25.790> volume<00:00:26.620> based<00:00:27.620> in

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
is just a straight volume based in

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.070 
is just a straight volume based in
trouble<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.880> drive<00:00:29.120> is<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.510> same<00:00:29.690> kind<00:00:30.050> of

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
trouble the drive is the same kind of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.679 
trouble the drive is the same kind of
thing<00:00:30.260> but<00:00:30.289> it<00:00:30.500> has<00:00:30.530> of<00:00:31.010> course<00:00:31.070> gain<00:00:31.670> and<00:00:32.000> and

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
thing but it has of course gain and and

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.290 
thing but it has of course gain and and
tone<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.829> distortion<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.909> metal<00:00:35.179> and

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
tone the distortion and the metal and

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.119 
tone the distortion and the metal and
the<00:00:35.359> dual<00:00:35.539> all<00:00:35.809> feature<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.289> ISF<00:00:36.800> control

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
the dual all feature the ISF control

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.130 
the dual all feature the ISF control
which<00:00:37.249> is<00:00:37.399> actually<00:00:37.730> our<00:00:37.850> tone<00:00:38.089> stack<00:00:38.420> shifter

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
which is actually our tone stack shifter

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.439 
which is actually our tone stack shifter
it<00:00:39.499> goes<00:00:39.679> from<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.039> youth<00:00:40.219> s<00:00:40.429> style<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:41.149> a<00:00:41.179> UK

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
it goes from a youth s style to a UK

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.169 
it goes from a youth s style to a UK
style<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:42.379> anywhere<00:00:43.159> in<00:00:43.219> between<00:00:43.339> so<00:00:43.969> let<00:00:44.089> me

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179 
style and anywhere in between so let me

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.360 
style and anywhere in between so let me
start<00:00:44.719> at<00:00:44.929> the<00:00:44.960> boost<00:00:45.319> this<00:00:45.829> is<00:00:45.890> going<00:00:46.190> through

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
start at the boost this is going through

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.579 
start at the boost this is going through
an<00:00:46.730> ID<00:00:46.909> sixty<00:00:47.390> behind<00:00:47.659> me<00:00:47.749> here<00:00:47.929> set<00:00:48.409> four

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
an ID sixty behind me here set four

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.349 
an ID sixty behind me here set four
clean

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.860 

we'll<00:00:52.019> bring<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> boost<00:00:53.269> flat<00:00:54.269> response<00:00:54.659> on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
we'll bring the boost flat response on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.950 
we'll bring the boost flat response on
the<00:00:54.929> boost<00:00:56.449> kicks<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.780> bit<00:00:57.929> harder

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.000 

nice<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.860> solo<00:01:02.040> boost<00:01:02.370> here's<00:01:03.240> the<00:01:03.390> drive

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:20.860 

Storen

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:30.420 

the<00:01:21.770> metal

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.969 

here's<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.550> dual<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:32.180> green<00:01:32.420> Channel

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:47.230 

and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:38.880> read

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.050 

so<00:01:47.990> switching<00:01:48.320> again<00:01:48.409> from<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.340> drive<00:01:49.640> to

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
so switching again from the drive to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.550 
so switching again from the drive to
distortion<00:01:50.540> to<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.690> metal<00:01:50.990> on<00:01:51.080> guys<00:01:51.260> doing

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
distortion to the metal on guys doing

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:22.070 
distortion to the metal on guys doing
right<00:01:51.740> in<00:01:51.799> a<00:01:51.860> rav4<00:01:52.040> you

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.120 

again<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> LT<00:02:23.739> series<00:02:24.160> from<00:02:24.580> Black<00:02:24.819> Star
