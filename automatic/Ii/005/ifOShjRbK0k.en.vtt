I mean they're literally all over the
place<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> quite<00:01:15.659> friendly<00:01:15.810> there's<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.350> two

right next to the police station which
is<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> odd<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.520> get

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
is kind of odd because it's like you get

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280 
is kind of odd because it's like you get
caught<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.450> weapons<00:01:21.780> taken<00:01:22.110> away

with<00:01:45.600> our<00:01:46.579> C<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.729> got<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> pick<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.270> guy<00:01:48.479> up

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
with our C we got to pick this guy up

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.670 
with our C we got to pick this guy up
now<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.280> him<00:01:50.759> over<00:01:51.680> somewhere

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
now we got to get him over somewhere

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.900 
now we got to get him over somewhere
without<00:01:53.549> where<00:01:53.850> he<00:01:53.939> said<00:01:54.229> over<00:01:55.229> there

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.550 

so<00:01:58.910> let's<00:01:59.090> do<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.300> probably<00:02:00.140> would<00:02:00.260> help<00:02:00.380> to

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
so let's do that probably would help to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.450 
so let's do that probably would help to
have<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.680> better<00:02:00.950> car<00:02:01.250> for<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:03.460> anyway

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
have a better car for this but anyway

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.060 
have a better car for this but anyway
the<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.570> overworld<00:02:06.020> as<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.410> can<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.920> the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
the the overworld as you can see on the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.950 
the the overworld as you can see on the
bottom<00:02:07.250> screen<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.880> actually<00:02:08.270> not<00:02:08.390> very<00:02:08.690> big

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
bottom screen is actually not very big

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.320

yeah<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.330> mean<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.660> sounds<00:02:26.959> about<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:28.690> there

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
yeah I mean it sounds about right there

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.810 
yeah I mean it sounds about right there
are<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.110> bunch<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.530> missions<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:31.160> get<00:02:31.489> but

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
are a bunch of missions you can get but

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.310 
are a bunch of missions you can get but
after<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.150> while<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.510> begin<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.959> notice<00:02:33.110> that

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
after a while you begin to notice that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.199 
after a while you begin to notice that
it's<00:02:33.590> pretty<00:02:33.709> much<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> same<00:02:34.370> missions<00:02:34.820> every

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
it's pretty much the same missions every

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.400 
it's pretty much the same missions every
time<00:02:36.130> see<00:02:37.130> I'm<00:02:37.280> about<00:02:37.660> did<00:02:38.660> we<00:02:38.780> miss<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.380> turn

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
time see I'm about did we miss the turn

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.470 
time see I'm about did we miss the turn
anyway<00:02:39.980> I'm<00:02:40.100> about<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:40.550> 10<00:02:40.820> percent<00:02:41.000> done

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
anyway I'm about like 10 percent done

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.410 
anyway I'm about like 10 percent done
with<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.900> game<00:02:42.280> because<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.670> know<00:02:43.970> paid<00:02:44.270> off

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
with the game because you know paid off

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.020 
with the game because you know paid off
about<00:02:44.660> 10<00:02:44.900> percent<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.380> debt<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.040> since

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
about 10 percent of the debt and since

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.000 
about 10 percent of the debt and since
I'm<00:02:47.209> already<00:02:47.420> seeing<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.170> repetition<00:02:48.440> and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
I'm already seeing like repetition and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.610 
I'm already seeing like repetition and
getting<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.310> bit<00:02:49.459> bored<00:02:49.790> that's<00:02:50.630> probably<00:02:51.380> not

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
getting a bit bored that's probably not

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.090 
getting a bit bored that's probably not
a<00:02:51.680> very<00:02:52.010> good<00:02:52.250> sign<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:53.350> mean<00:02:54.350> this<00:02:54.770> game

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
a very good sign I mean this game

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.180 
a very good sign I mean this game
overall<00:02:55.820> is<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.540> good<00:02:56.989> game<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.560> there<00:02:58.100> are

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
overall is a good game but there are

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.650 
overall is a good game but there are
definitely<00:02:58.610> better<00:02:59.000> ones

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
definitely better ones

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.070 
definitely better ones
the<00:03:00.020> graphics<00:03:00.530> are<00:03:00.739> okay<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:01.580> they're<00:03:02.390> better

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
the graphics are okay but they're better

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.710 
the graphics are okay but they're better
to<00:03:03.950> be<00:03:04.070> honest<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.549> think<00:03:04.610> if<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.269> want<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.540> game

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
to be honest I think if you want a game

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.150 
to be honest I think if you want a game
like<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.350> should<00:03:06.530> just<00:03:06.709> go<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.010> get

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
like this you should just go and get

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.850 
like this you should just go and get
grand<00:03:07.640> theft<00:03:07.760> auto<00:03:08.350> chinatown<00:03:09.350> wars<00:03:09.650> or

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
something oh and there we go we get

because chinatown wars it'll cost you
more<00:03:18.950> but<00:03:19.700> it's<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.239> better<00:03:20.510> that's<00:03:21.140> for

something it's usually crime related but
like<00:03:50.600> for<00:03:50.780> example<00:03:50.900> if<00:03:51.590> one<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.489> them<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:52.820> like

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
like for example if one of them is like

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.240 
like for example if one of them is like
if<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.120> play<00:03:53.360> for<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.410> certain<00:03:54.799> amount<00:03:54.860> of<00:03:55.100> days

you'll<00:03:58.040> get<00:03:58.220> some<00:03:58.400> Bonus<00:03:58.730> Cash<00:03:58.820> they're<00:03:59.269> also

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
you'll get some Bonus Cash they're also

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.390 
you'll get some Bonus Cash they're also
these<00:03:59.630> hidden<00:03:59.959> packages<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.650> do<00:04:00.890> something

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
these hidden packages that do something

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.740 
these hidden packages that do something
I<00:04:01.790> don't<00:04:02.329> know

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
I don't know

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.420 
I don't know
I'm<00:04:03.049> guessing<00:04:03.560> they<00:04:03.680> do<00:04:03.829> something<00:04:04.280> when<00:04:04.400> you

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
I'm guessing they do something when you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.860 
I'm guessing they do something when you
unlock<00:04:04.760> them<00:04:04.910> all<00:04:05.060> but<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.269> haven't<00:04:05.480> unlocked

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
unlock them all but I haven't unlocked

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.050 
unlock them all but I haven't unlocked
them<00:04:06.109> all<00:04:06.260> yet

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
them all yet

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.250 
them all yet
I've<00:04:08.020> gotten<00:04:08.350> maybe<00:04:09.060> 30<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.270> them<00:04:10.390> ourself<00:04:10.810> and

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
I've gotten maybe 30 of them ourself and

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
there's fifty and all I've gotten a good

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.039 
there's fifty and all I've gotten a good
bunch<00:04:14.319> of<00:04:14.500> them<00:04:14.880> anyways<00:04:15.880> like<00:04:16.299> there's<00:04:16.780> not

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
bunch of them anyways like there's not

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.960 
bunch of them anyways like there's not
and<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.799> whole<00:04:18.070> lot<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.519> do<00:04:18.700> here<00:04:18.870> unfortunately

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
and a whole lot to do here unfortunately

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.070 
and a whole lot to do here unfortunately
it<00:04:21.970> does<00:04:22.630> get<00:04:23.080> boring<00:04:23.290> after<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.830> while<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:25.080> oh

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
it does get boring after a while and oh

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.320 
it does get boring after a while and oh
I<00:04:26.260> guess<00:04:26.560> I've<00:04:26.710> gotten<00:04:27.010> 48<00:04:27.790> of<00:04:27.970> these<00:04:28.090> hidden

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
I guess I've gotten 48 of these hidden

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.840 
I guess I've gotten 48 of these hidden
packages<00:04:29.040> two<00:04:30.040> more<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.370> go

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
packages two more to go

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.030 
packages two more to go
I'm<00:04:31.690> assuming<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.139> means<00:04:32.380> how<00:04:32.620> many<00:04:32.800> more<00:04:33.010> I

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
I'm assuming that means how many more I

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.710 
I'm assuming that means how many more I
have<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.460> go<00:04:33.639> because<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.090> know<00:04:34.210> I've<00:04:34.419> gotten

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
have to go because I know I've gotten

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.600 
have to go because I know I've gotten
more<00:04:34.840> than<00:04:35.020> two<00:04:35.200> of<00:04:35.230> them<00:04:38.250> there<00:04:39.250> we<00:04:39.340> go<00:04:39.460> these

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
more than two of them there we go these

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.150 
more than two of them there we go these
are<00:04:39.790> like<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.030> felonies<00:04:40.480> and<00:04:40.660> stuff<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:41.710> lists

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
are like the felonies and stuff it lists

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.409 
are like the felonies and stuff it lists
them<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.490> doesn't<00:04:42.640> really<00:04:42.850> tell<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.240> what

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
them but it doesn't really tell you what

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.380 
them but it doesn't really tell you what
they<00:04:43.600> are<00:04:44.160> which<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:46.120> kind<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.630> annoying

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
they are which is kind of annoying

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.920 
they are which is kind of annoying
so<00:04:49.390> overall<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:50.620> graphics<00:04:51.040> are<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:52.510> graphics

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
so overall the graphics are the graphics

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.300 
so overall the graphics are the graphics
are<00:04:53.050> pretty<00:04:53.260> good<00:04:53.350> they<00:04:53.560> could<00:04:53.830> be<00:04:54.100> better

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
are pretty good they could be better

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.940 
are pretty good they could be better
though<00:04:54.580> they<00:04:54.850> definitely<00:04:55.090> could<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:56.590> actual

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
though they definitely could the actual

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.300 
though they definitely could the actual
gameplay<00:04:57.220> itself<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:58.210> good<00:04:59.169> for<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.440> while<00:04:59.680> but

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
gameplay itself is good for a while but

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.180 
gameplay itself is good for a while but
it<00:05:00.400> kind<00:05:00.610> of<00:05:00.669> gets<00:05:00.790> stale<00:05:01.320> rather<00:05:02.320> quickly

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
it kind of gets stale rather quickly

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.040 
it kind of gets stale rather quickly
actually<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.889> sounds<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.610> music

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
actually the sounds the music

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.000 
actually the sounds the music
musics<00:05:08.050> probably<00:05:08.350> going<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.650> get<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:08.860> your

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
musics probably going to get on your

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.390 
musics probably going to get on your
nerves<00:05:09.130> after<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.639> while<00:05:10.860> it's<00:05:11.860> okay

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
nerves after a while it's okay

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.360 
nerves after a while it's okay
and<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:13.270> don't<00:05:14.050> really<00:05:14.200> know<00:05:14.710> what<00:05:14.890> else<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.130> say

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
and I don't really know what else to say

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.909 
and I don't really know what else to say
about<00:05:15.490> it<00:05:15.760> it's<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.900> good<00:05:17.110> game<00:05:17.290> but<00:05:17.350> like<00:05:17.800> I
