of tubing to just go around the tires or
wheels<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:35.560> came<00:01:35.859> up<00:01:35.890> with<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:37.859> it's<00:01:38.859> a

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
wheels and I came up with this it's a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.919 
wheels and I came up with this it's a
knee<00:01:39.850> piece<00:01:40.240> for<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.920> drainage<00:01:41.920> pipe<00:01:42.659> 110<00:01:43.659> we

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
knee piece for a drainage pipe 110 we

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.499 
knee piece for a drainage pipe 110 we
measures<00:01:44.609> drainage<00:01:45.609> pipe<00:01:45.999> and<00:01:46.960> then<00:01:48.509> well

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
measures drainage pipe and then well

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.800

I've<00:01:50.049> got<00:01:50.259> another<00:01:50.409> buggy<00:01:51.340> wheel<00:01:52.119> it's<00:01:52.509> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
I've got another buggy wheel it's the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.010 
I've got another buggy wheel it's the
same<00:01:53.139> diameter<00:01:53.530> as<00:01:53.799> you<00:01:54.069> can<00:01:54.189> see<00:01:54.429> and<00:01:55.020> these

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
same diameter as you can see and these

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.639 
same diameter as you can see and these
fit<00:01:56.560> right<00:01:57.189> in<00:01:57.399> there<00:01:57.609> quite<00:01:58.299> snugly<00:01:58.899> I<00:02:01.649> think

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
fit right in there quite snugly I think

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.489 
fit right in there quite snugly I think
this<00:02:03.039> should<00:02:03.369> have<00:02:03.670> more<00:02:04.600> than<00:02:04.719> enough<00:02:04.869> grip

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
this should have more than enough grip

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:08.490 
this should have more than enough grip
like<00:02:05.889> this<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:07.420> course<00:02:07.479> there<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.020> wheel

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
like this of course there the wheel

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.949 
like this of course there the wheel
wield<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.729> plastic<00:02:10.179> itself<00:02:10.420> won't<00:02:10.660> have<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
wield the plastic itself won't have a

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.050 
wield the plastic itself won't have a
lot<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> grip<00:02:11.860> on<00:02:12.100> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
lot of grip on the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.170 
lot of grip on the
servus<00:02:13.540> you're<00:02:13.690> driving<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.940> should

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
servus you're driving on so this should

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:25.250 
servus you're driving on so this should
do<00:02:16.630> just<00:02:17.050> fine<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:20.610> well<00:02:22.950> also<00:02:23.950> be<00:02:24.099> left<00:02:24.459> with

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
do just fine and well also be left with

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.790 
do just fine and well also be left with
having<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.190> Sean<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:28.480> off<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.170> then

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
having to so Sean this off and then

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.890 
having to so Sean this off and then
you're<00:02:30.099> left<00:02:30.430> with<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:31.800> ring<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:34.780> a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
you're left with a ring like this it's a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.620 
you're left with a ring like this it's a
little<00:02:35.140> wider

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
little wider

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.750 
little wider
if<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.780> press<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> tire<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.069> should<00:02:39.220> see<00:02:39.459> some

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
if I press in the tire I should see some

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.680 
if I press in the tire I should see some
little<00:02:39.910> wider<00:02:40.209> that's<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:41.080> fine<00:02:41.349> nothing

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
little wider that's just fine nothing

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.110
