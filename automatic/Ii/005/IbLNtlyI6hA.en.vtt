Tunes<00:00:58.699> what<00:00:59.269> I<00:00:59.299> want<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.659> do<00:00:59.809> is<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.049> key<00:01:00.379> of

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
Tunes what I want you to do is a key of

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.399 
Tunes what I want you to do is a key of
is<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.890> chord<00:01:01.219> rather<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.640> E<00:01:02.239> minor<00:01:02.629> we're<00:01:03.260> going

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
is a chord rather of E minor we're going

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.049 
is a chord rather of E minor we're going
to<00:01:03.469> do<00:01:03.559> it<00:01:03.649> in<00:01:03.739> what<00:01:03.890> they<00:01:04.009> call<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.339> second

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
to do it in what they call the second

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.580 
to do it in what they call the second
inversion<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:05.780> there's<00:01:05.990> an<00:01:06.110> E<00:01:06.200> minor<00:01:06.440> chord

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
inversion so there's an E minor chord

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.540 
inversion so there's an E minor chord
remember<00:01:07.159> how<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.310> work<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.640> out

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
remember how to work it out

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.620 
remember how to work it out
we're<00:01:10.550> going<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.759> take<00:01:10.940> it<00:01:11.119> while<00:01:11.300> that's<00:01:11.450> it

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
we're going to take it while that's it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.919 
we're going to take it while that's it
one<00:01:11.950> inversion<00:01:12.950> up<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:14.090> then<00:01:14.210> take<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.569> G<00:01:14.780> to

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
one inversion up and then take that G to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.990 
one inversion up and then take that G to
the<00:01:15.050> top<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:15.470> we're<00:01:15.619> starting<00:01:15.830> with<00:01:16.069> E<00:01:16.460> minor

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
the top so we're starting with E minor

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.230 
the top so we're starting with E minor
with<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.509> G<00:01:17.720> at<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.960> top<00:01:18.170> like<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.500> B<00:01:18.950> E<00:01:19.250> G

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
with the G at the top like that B E G

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.740 
with the G at the top like that B E G
big<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:21.229> bill<00:01:21.440> so<00:01:21.679> how<00:01:21.860> be<00:01:22.069> a<00:01:22.100> G<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.729> beg<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.600> to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
big it's bill so how be a G I beg you to

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.270 
big it's bill so how be a G I beg you to
have<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.929> go<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.289> intro<00:01:24.679> a<00:01:25.069> minor<00:01:25.479> there<00:01:27.280> and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
have a go this intro a minor there and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.889 
have a go this intro a minor there and
then<00:01:28.429> what<00:01:28.549> we<00:01:28.670> do<00:01:28.819> is<00:01:28.850> we<00:01:29.030> set<00:01:29.240> our<00:01:29.390> hand<00:01:29.569> into

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
then what we do is we set our hand into

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.660 
then what we do is we set our hand into
a<00:01:29.929> hard<00:01:30.319> pattern<00:01:30.860> that's<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.399> little<00:01:31.549> trick

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
a hard pattern that's the little trick

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.059 
a hard pattern that's the little trick
with<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.390> introduction<00:01:33.110> set<00:01:33.709> your<00:01:33.890> hand

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
with this introduction set your hand

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.100 
with this introduction set your hand
into<00:01:34.190> an<00:01:34.369> odd<00:01:34.490> pattern<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.479> we're<00:01:35.630> going<00:01:35.840> down

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
into an odd pattern and we're going down

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.690 
into an odd pattern and we're going down
onto<00:01:36.530> all<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.799> black<00:01:36.950> notes<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.430> we're<00:01:37.579> going

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
onto all the black notes so we're going

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.929 
onto all the black notes so we're going
to<00:01:37.850> from<00:01:38.180> E<00:01:38.390> minor<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.930> E<00:01:39.170> flat<00:01:39.590> minor<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.490> then

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
to from E minor to E flat minor and then

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.789 
to from E minor to E flat minor and then
we're<00:01:41.060> going<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.270> hop<00:01:41.450> down<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.689> D<00:01:42.020> minor<00:01:42.289> so

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
we're going to hop down to D minor so

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.440 
we're going to hop down to D minor so
all<00:01:42.950> we're<00:01:43.100> doing<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.430> we<00:01:43.549> crossing<00:01:43.939> over<00:01:44.090> from

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
all we're doing is we crossing over from

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.520 
all we're doing is we crossing over from
one<00:01:44.930> white<00:01:45.170> note<00:01:45.409> chord<00:01:45.770> from<00:01:45.950> there<00:01:46.219> to<00:01:47.060> there

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
one white note chord from there to there

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.069 
one white note chord from there to there
but<00:01:48.530> we're<00:01:48.710> putting<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:50.180> black<00:01:50.390> notes<00:01:50.570> in<00:01:50.840> in

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
but we're putting the black notes in in

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.399 
but we're putting the black notes in in
the<00:01:51.289> middle<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:51.829> go<00:01:52.009> over<00:01:52.039> from<00:01:52.549> E<00:01:52.670> minor

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
the middle so we go over from E minor

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.080 
the middle so we go over from E minor
move<00:01:54.409> your<00:01:54.590> hand<00:01:54.770> up<00:01:54.920> drop<00:01:55.460> down<00:01:55.670> keep<00:01:55.969> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
move your hand up drop down keep the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.319 
move your hand up drop down keep the
pattern<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.479> same<00:01:56.829> down<00:01:57.829> again<00:01:58.149> back<00:01:59.149> up

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
pattern the same down again back up

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.450 
pattern the same down again back up
again<00:02:00.969> then<00:02:01.969> we're<00:02:02.060> gonna<00:02:02.179> hit<00:02:02.359> a<00:02:02.420> G<00:02:02.719> note<00:02:03.460> with

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
again then we're gonna hit a G note with

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.149 
again then we're gonna hit a G note with
the<00:02:04.579> left<00:02:04.759> town<00:02:04.969> just<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.329> give<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.509> pompom<00:02:06.159> to

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
the left town just to give a pompom to

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.710 
the left town just to give a pompom to
emphasize<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.820> fact<00:02:07.969> that<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.239> are<00:02:08.450> going

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
emphasize the fact that we are going

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.330 
emphasize the fact that we are going
into<00:02:08.899> C<00:02:09.679> major

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
into C major

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.580 
into C major
eventually<00:02:10.940> for<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.600> key<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.260> let's<00:02:12.440> just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
eventually for the key so let's just

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.560 
eventually for the key so let's just
have<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.739> go<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.160> with<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> right<00:02:13.910> hand<00:02:14.180> first

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
have a go that with the right hand first

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.780 
have a go that with the right hand first
II<00:02:14.630> -<00:02:15.100> drop<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.250> down<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:17.109> D<00:02:18.109> minor<00:02:18.370> back<00:02:19.370> again

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.050 

and<00:02:22.790> again

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.520 

Tom<00:02:28.420> now<00:02:29.420> here's<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.900> thing<00:02:30.049> that<00:02:30.110> makes<00:02:30.379> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
Tom now here's the thing that makes the
