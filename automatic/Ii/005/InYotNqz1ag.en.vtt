00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
update to the video that I posted a

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.629 
update to the video that I posted a
couple<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.290> days<00:00:07.379> ago<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.280> minecraft

couple of days ago on this minecraft

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.299 
couple of days ago on this minecraft
bingo<00:00:09.120> seed<00:00:09.510> if<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.559> haven't<00:00:10.920> seen<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.130> one

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
bingo seed if you haven't seen that one

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.759 
bingo seed if you haven't seen that one
then<00:00:11.790> i<00:00:11.910> recommend<00:00:12.179> watching<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.809> first<00:00:13.019> just

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
then i recommend watching it first just

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.550 
then i recommend watching it first just
click<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.070> annotation<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.030> screen<00:00:15.560> so

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
click the annotation on the screen so

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.290 
click the annotation on the screen so
this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.830> really<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.279> an<00:00:17.400> optimization<00:00:18.150> off

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
this is really just an optimization off

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.800 
this is really just an optimization off
the<00:00:18.480> route<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.460> made<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> few<00:00:20.699> tweaks<00:00:21.000> did<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the route and made a few tweaks did a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.900 
the route and made a few tweaks did a
few<00:00:21.990> extra<00:00:22.109> runs<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> best<00:00:23.670> possible

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
few extra runs to get the best possible

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.349 
few extra runs to get the best possible
time<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.539> could<00:00:26.000> so<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> first<00:00:27.300> thing

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
time that I could so the first thing

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
time that I could so the first thing
you'll<00:00:27.570> notice<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.320> I'm<00:00:28.800> making<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
you'll notice is that I'm making the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.580 
you'll notice is that I'm making the
crafting<00:00:29.880> bench<00:00:30.060> around<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:31.170> instead<00:00:31.529> of

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
crafting bench around here instead of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.920 
crafting bench around here instead of
back<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> beginning<00:00:32.360> that's<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.809> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
back at the beginning that's just so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.660 
back at the beginning that's just so
that<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.200> leave<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.340> instead<00:00:35.610> of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
that I can leave it here instead of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.270 
that I can leave it here instead of
failing<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> break<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.010> pop<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.040> down

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
failing to break it and pop it down

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340 
failing to break it and pop it down
again<00:00:38.550> later<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.030> saves<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> little<00:00:40.170> bit<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
again later which saves a little bit of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.250 
again later which saves a little bit of
time<00:00:41.480> also<00:00:42.480> I'm<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.550> making<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> shovel<00:00:45.170> just<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
time also I'm not making a shovel just a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.209 
time also I'm not making a shovel just a
pic<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:48.050> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.170> another<00:00:49.379> change<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
pic and this is another change to the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.069 
pic and this is another change to the
original<00:00:50.730> route<00:00:50.969> I'm<00:00:51.239> getting<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.690> piece<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
original route I'm getting one piece of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
original route I'm getting one piece of
coal<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.280> has<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> few<00:00:54.120> benefits

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
coal there and that has a few benefits

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.049 
coal there and that has a few benefits
actually<00:00:55.469> first<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.579> meant<00:00:56.730> i<00:00:56.879> only

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
actually first of all it meant i only

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
actually first of all it meant i only
needed<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.390> get<00:00:57.570> three<00:00:58.050> logs<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
needed to get three logs at the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.580 
needed to get three logs at the
beginning<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> set<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> four<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.260> also<00:01:01.260> i

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
beginning of set of four and also i

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.080 
beginning of set of four and also i
don't<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> grab<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> extra<00:01:02.760> piece<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
don't have to grab the extra piece of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.000 
don't have to grab the extra piece of
stone<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.629> did<00:01:03.780> before<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.650> i<00:01:04.860> can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
stone that i did before because i can

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.310 
stone that i did before because i can
actually<00:01:05.129> use<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> step<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.000> i<00:01:06.270> created<00:01:06.600> by

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
actually use the step that i created by

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.740 
actually use the step that i created by
grabbing<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.920> call<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.970> step<00:01:09.210> out<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
grabbing that call to step out of the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.719 
grabbing that call to step out of the
out<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> pillar<00:01:11.150> one<00:01:12.150> block<00:01:12.360> earlier<00:01:12.780> i

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
out of the pillar one block earlier i

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.160 
out of the pillar one block earlier i
understand<00:01:14.729> these<00:01:14.880> are<00:01:15.060> fairly<00:01:15.509> minor<00:01:15.840> things

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
understand these are fairly minor things

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.980 
understand these are fairly minor things
but<00:01:16.500> they<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
but they do actually all that up to to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.630 
but they do actually all that up to to
save<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.890> i'm<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> peel<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
save time so i'm just going to peel it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
save time so i'm just going to peel it
back<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:27.170> now<00:01:28.170> i<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.560> jump<00:01:28.770> out

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
back up here and now i can just jump out

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.499 
back up here and now i can just jump out
using<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.490> step

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.450 

so<00:01:35.509> I<00:01:35.540> want<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:35.750> get<00:01:35.899> a<00:01:36.110> furnace<00:01:36.710> going<00:01:37.009> as<00:01:37.189> soon

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
so I want to get a furnace going as soon

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.609 
so I want to get a furnace going as soon
as<00:01:37.610> possible<00:01:38.060> here<00:01:38.329> because<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.290> limiting

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
as possible here because the limiting

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.249 
as possible here because the limiting
factor<00:01:40.040> on<00:01:40.070> this<00:01:40.399> at<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:40.909> point<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.450> getting

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
factor on this at this point is getting

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.609 
factor on this at this point is getting
everything<00:01:42.500> smelted<00:01:43.930> so<00:01:44.930> I'm<00:01:45.259> just<00:01:45.439> going<00:01:45.560> to

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
everything smelted so I'm just going to

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.130 
everything smelted so I'm just going to
grab<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.829> single<00:01:46.250> piece<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:46.460> sand<00:01:47.240> start<00:01:47.990> its

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
grab a single piece of sand start its

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.320 
grab a single piece of sand start its
melting<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.649> then<00:01:49.039> get<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:49.970> rest<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
melting and then get the rest of the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.090 
melting and then get the rest of the
stuff<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.689> smell<00:01:52.240> now<00:01:53.740> basically<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.920> main

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
stuff to smell now basically the main

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.660 
stuff to smell now basically the main
ing<00:01:55.640> part<00:01:55.939> of<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:56.240> run<00:01:56.869> is<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.229> fishing<00:01:57.670> you

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
ing part of this run is the fishing you

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
before the furnaces run out otherwise

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.570 
before the furnaces run out otherwise
you're<00:02:03.259> just<00:02:03.289> wasting<00:02:03.799> time<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:06.369> had<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.399> bit

you're just wasting time and had a bit

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.330 
you're just wasting time and had a bit
of<00:02:07.670> good<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.119> bad<00:02:08.209> like<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.780> with<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.989> fish

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
of good and bad like you with the fish

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.620 
of good and bad like you with the fish
it<00:02:10.340> happened<00:02:10.819> right<00:02:10.970> there<00:02:11.030> which<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.360> good

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
it happened right there which is good

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.110 
it happened right there which is good
that's<00:02:11.750> fast<00:02:12.110> but<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.920> flew<00:02:13.220> past<00:02:13.430> me<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:13.970> had

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
that's fast but it flew past me so I had

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.640 
that's fast but it flew past me so I had
to<00:02:14.150> waste<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.600> second<00:02:14.900> or<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.319> go<00:02:15.410> back<00:02:15.440> and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
to waste a second or so to go back and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.550 
to waste a second or so to go back and
get<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.600> not<00:02:17.600> too<00:02:17.780> bad<00:02:17.959> overall<00:02:18.290> though

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
get it not too bad overall though

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.630 
get it not too bad overall though
because<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.920> rest<00:02:19.099> of<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.280> run<00:02:19.430> actually

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
because the rest of the run actually

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.750 
because the rest of the run actually
went<00:02:20.030> pretty<00:02:20.090> smoothly<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.400> now<00:02:25.430> I'm<00:02:25.670> just

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
went pretty smoothly so now I'm just

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.030 
went pretty smoothly so now I'm just
waiting<00:02:25.880> for<00:02:26.299> that<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.900> cook<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.890> will<00:02:27.980> be

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
waiting for that to cook and it will be

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.259 
waiting for that to cook and it will be
bingo<00:02:31.420> bigger<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:33.769> two<00:02:34.130> minutes<00:02:34.430> 28<00:02:34.849> seconds

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
bingo bigger in two minutes 28 seconds

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.990 
bingo bigger in two minutes 28 seconds
I'm<00:02:35.989> sure<00:02:36.319> there<00:02:36.769> could<00:02:36.799> be<00:02:37.069> a<00:02:37.190> couple<00:02:37.819> of

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
I'm sure there could be a couple of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.729 
I'm sure there could be a couple of
seconds<00:02:38.329> shaved<00:02:38.540> off<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:38.989> if<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.380> kept<00:02:39.590> trying

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
seconds shaved off that if I kept trying

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.970 
seconds shaved off that if I kept trying
but<00:02:40.100> I'm<00:02:40.250> going<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.489> call<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.670> good<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.090> think

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
but I'm going to call that good I think

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.800 
but I'm going to call that good I think
