00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 they are currently and dominate sales 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.980
 within the industry of 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.960
 videogames thanks to its playstation 4 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.580
 but not everything has been honey on ojuelas 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
 we answer a bit of the difficult road 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.509
 that had to go through the company in 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.219
 all these years to get to this high 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.440
 since I am neo and I give them the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.210
 welcome to this new video from tgn in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.590
 Spanish where we will take a trip through 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.590
 the history of playstation 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.910
 I am in control for several months 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 a real gold mine with the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.960
 playstation 4 a console that has sold 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.699
 millions around the world and that has 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.260
 positioned as the current leader in the 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.120
 industry however they have also 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.710
 made mistakes and here we will remember 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.699
 some that have been so big that they do not 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.699
 they can be forgotten 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.550
 a rather big mistake was made in 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.890
 the last generation of consoles 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.589
 playstation3 was released in 2006 with 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.409
 an exaggerated price of 600 dollars 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.479
 compared to the xbox 360 competition and 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.030
 the wii that were cheaper and accessible 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.949
 nobody wanted in playstation3 to zone and you 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.539
 it took six years to recover to reach a 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.130
 good sales position this elevated 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.600
 price is due to the blu-ray player 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.369
 with which the console had 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.710
 fortunately afterwards it became a 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.710
 trend and dropped into oblivion HD DVD 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.119
 and not 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.560
 no one 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.240
 playstation3 had the worst campaign of 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.710
 story marketing all the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.420
 television was full of ads 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.369
 disgusting dark and somewhat 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.929
 disturbing you we can not imagine that 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.549
 went through the minds of the people of 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.619
 advertising department in that 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.549
 this damaged the reputation a lot 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.549
 of the playstation3 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.610
 once we dream of the revolution of 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.470
 mobile games thanks to xperia 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.120
 Unfortunately play was never done 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.520
 actually this phone was mediocre 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.260
 very limited hardware and minimal inconvenience 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.420
 library of games in addition to prices 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.100
 very high the phone that would combine 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.020
 the power and fun of a console in 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.820
 a cellphone never triumphed and left the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.820
 path open to apple and samsung 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.459
 beyond 2006 it was launched at 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.019
 market one foot speak white color all 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.819
 was going well until his department of 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.859
 marketing did things wrong again 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.420
 this time they were announcements somewhat 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.010
 aggressive ones that showed a strong 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.689
 contrast between a woman dressed in 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.519
 white and one of black people what 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.200
 misunderstood and cost him several lawsuits 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.579
 to the company we hope they have 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.579
 learned from all this 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.100
 sony liked to live in the past 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.410
 when the speed foot was released already 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.330
 there were sd memories unfortunately 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.160
 they forgot them and decided to launch games 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.680
 for your console on mini discs called 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.450
 md were expensive fragile and a little 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.040
 complicated to transport the worst 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.930
 I was in charge screens 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.820
 games took too long to start and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.000
 this stole a lot of life time to some 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.000
 players 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.200
 with the playstation 3 the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.060
 six axis dual shock controls themselves 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.470
 they had motion sensors but 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.480
 in their first generation they did not have 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.709
 vibration system went crazy people 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.569
 and began to compare them with the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.430
 wii controls that had both 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.930
 characteristics are and put hands to the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.730
 work and then launched controls 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.890
 playstation3 with vibration system and 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.060
 of movement a safe step but that 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.060
 It took a long time to give 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.720
 Playstation should stay out of 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.400
 everything that has to do with systems 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.620
 of movement and focus on games 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.629
 with the massive success of wilson and decided 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.640
 enter the market with the psm a 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.980
 uncomfortable non-responsive device 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.780
 unnecessary very expensive and unreliable 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.580
 fortunately he never triumphed and the 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.379
 company better left it in oblivion with 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.709
 a relief for everyone's pockets 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.709
 Players 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.980
 following the trend imposed by 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.810
 apple tv and amazon devices 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.420
 recently sony launched his own 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.250
 device the pspv a device that gives 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.530
 access to users applications like 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.360
 netflix and youtube something that is already in 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.239
 everywhere the worst is that it would allow 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.380
 stream playstation 3 games 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.120
 unfortunately it is extremely expensive 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.070
 so much that you will not even find it in 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.070
 the shelves of stores a shame 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.710
 playstation vita house and the console 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.570
 sony laptop one of the worst 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.670
 Company failures after 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.950
 domain and popularity of pp seems that 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.930
 they are and only the last console was entrusted 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.850
 laptop that they throw is a nuisance 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.340
 compared to its direct competition the 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.340
 3ds sony could not even put his hands 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.410
 the black episode of the company's 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.480
 head this count the attack and hack of 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.460
 the playstation network sony suffers one of 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.260
 the worst cyber attacks of the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.120
 history his line game system was 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.370
 broken and was exposed to a group of 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.680
 hackers for 23 days at this time 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.110
 data of more than 77 were extracted 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.300
 millions of users including accounts 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.070
 of bank and credit cards the worst 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.160
 is that they are and could not solve it and 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.080
 besides losing almost 177 billion of 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.970
 dollars lost the trust of many 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.800
 fanatics what marked completely the 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.300
 company history these are just 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.950
 some of the mistakes that the company 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.930
 has committed throughout its history 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.850
 but for sure remember more tell me that 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.530
 another error should be added to this 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.360
