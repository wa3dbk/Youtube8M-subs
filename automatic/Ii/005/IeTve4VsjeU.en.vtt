demonstrate to you a brand new product
from<00:00:10.380> sugar<00:00:10.860> bytes<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.969> name<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.179> this

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
from sugar bytes and the name of this

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720 
from sugar bytes and the name of this
new<00:00:12.420> device<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.139> called<00:00:13.380> egoist<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.429> let's

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
new device is called egoist so let's

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.849 
new device is called egoist so let's
take<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> look<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.590> may<00:00:16.830> be

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
take a look at it so you may be

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.310 
take a look at it so you may be
wondering<00:00:17.010> exactly<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.390> egoist<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
wondering exactly what is egoist and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.859 
wondering exactly what is egoist and
what<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.980> well<00:00:20.789> egoist<00:00:21.150> combines<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
what can it do well egoist combines a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.929 
what can it do well egoist combines a
slicer<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> beat<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.490> bass<00:00:23.670> section

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
slicer with a beat and a bass section

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.000 
slicer with a beat and a bass section
and<00:00:24.330> each<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.779> these<00:00:24.869> three<00:00:25.140> engines<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.980> be

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and each of these three engines can be

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.120 
and each of these three engines can be
routed<00:00:26.279> through<00:00:26.730> an<00:00:27.000> effect<00:00:27.720> sequencer<00:00:28.320> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
routed through an effect sequencer so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.429 
routed through an effect sequencer so
you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.400> load<00:00:29.609> up<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.880> sample<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.170> slice

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
you can load up a sample you can slice

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.500 
you can load up a sample you can slice
it<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.859> arrange<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.309> pick<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> beat<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.329> add

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it up and arrange it pick a beat and add

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.299 
it up and arrange it pick a beat and add
some<00:00:33.719> bass<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.260> then<00:00:34.380> use<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> seven

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
some bass and then use up to seven

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.209 
some bass and then use up to seven
different<00:00:35.460> effects<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.090> finish<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> off

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
different effects to finish it off

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.110 
different effects to finish it off
simplicity<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> limitations<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
simplicity and the limitations of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.520 
simplicity and the limitations of
egoists<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> channel<00:00:40.379> your

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
egoists are really going to channel your

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
egoists are really going to channel your
creativity<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.420> anything<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.750> within

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
creativity and anything you do within

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
creativity and anything you do within
egoist<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.739> absolutely<00:00:44.280> immediate<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.300> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
egoist is absolutely immediate so you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.790 
egoist is absolutely immediate so you
can<00:00:45.539> change<00:00:45.750> things<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.469> while<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
can change things on the go while the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
can change things on the go while the
loop<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> running<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> there's<00:00:48.420> plenty<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
loop is running and there's plenty of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410 
loop is running and there's plenty of
intelligent<00:00:49.530> random<00:00:49.920> buttons<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> your<00:00:51.270> ear

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
intelligent random buttons and your ear

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.819 
intelligent random buttons and your ear
will<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> sounds<00:00:52.230> good<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:52.680> you're

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
will know when it sounds good if you're

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
will know when it sounds good if you're
not<00:00:52.860> happy<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.270> keep

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
not happy with it then you can just keep

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
not happy with it then you can just keep
playing<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.050> adjusting<00:00:55.530> parameters<00:00:55.820> until

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
playing and adjusting parameters until

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
playing and adjusting parameters until
you<00:00:56.910> find<00:00:57.180> something<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.570> sounds<00:00:57.960> really

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
you find something that sounds really

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
you find something that sounds really
good<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> play<00:00:59.430> button<00:00:59.820> on<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.969> top<00:01:00.239> left

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
good so the play button on the top left

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.479 
good so the play button on the top left
corner<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> start<00:01:01.500> egressed

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.350 

if<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.640> click<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.170> there's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> drop<00:01:07.439> down<00:01:07.470> menu

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
if I click here there's a drop down menu

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.750 
if I click here there's a drop down menu
and<00:01:09.360> let's<00:01:09.840> go<00:01:10.049> into<00:01:11.119> Rico<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:14.640> going

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and let's go into Rico and we're going

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760 
and let's go into Rico and we're going
to<00:01:14.820> start<00:01:15.090> off<00:01:15.240> by<00:01:15.270> selecting<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:16.259> random

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to start off by selecting a random

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.120 
to start off by selecting a random
preset<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.700> let's<00:01:17.880> choose<00:01:18.119> pattern<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
preset so let's choose pattern and we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.160 
preset so let's choose pattern and we
can<00:01:23.310> cycle<00:01:23.580> between<00:01:24.259> pre-loaded<00:01:25.430> loops

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.170 

you<00:01:30.070> can<00:01:30.189> hear<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.670> drums<00:01:30.970> sound

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
you can hear that the drums sound

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.450 
you can hear that the drums sound
completely<00:01:31.570> different<00:01:31.869> now<00:01:32.320> using<00:01:33.130> different

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
completely different now using different

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.859 
completely different now using different
samples<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.310> let's<00:01:39.490> keep<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.299> petted<00:01:40.689> for

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
samples so let's keep it on petted for

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.800 
samples so let's keep it on petted for
now<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:42.159> we<00:01:42.310> have<00:01:42.340> this<00:01:42.610> tempo<00:01:43.119> control<00:01:43.540> here

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
now so we have this tempo control here

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.410 
now so we have this tempo control here
and<00:01:43.990> by<00:01:44.290> default<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:44.979> set<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.250> 1/16<00:01:46.030> for<00:01:46.270> this

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
and by default it's set to 1/16 for this

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.310 
and by default it's set to 1/16 for this
particular<00:01:46.750> loop<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:48.060> change<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.320> one

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
particular loop I change it to one

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.480 
particular loop I change it to one
eighths<00:01:50.590> in<00:01:50.920> thirds<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.770> back<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.220> one

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
eighths in thirds or back to one

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.520 
eighths in thirds or back to one
sixteenths<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.750> can<00:01:55.869> also<00:01:55.990> control<00:01:56.470> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
sixteenths you can also control the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.100 
sixteenths you can also control the
swing<00:01:56.950> amount<00:01:57.280> as<00:01:57.789> a<00:01:57.850> percentage<00:01:58.450> here<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.960> at

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
swing amount as a percentage here so at

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.139 
swing amount as a percentage here so at
28%<00:02:02.500> string<00:02:03.069> you<00:02:03.220> can<00:02:03.250> really<00:02:03.640> hear<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:04.000> less

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
28% string you can really hear that less

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.770 
28% string you can really hear that less
got<00:02:04.330> some<00:02:04.539> groove<00:02:04.869> in<00:02:05.050> it<00:02:05.170> now<00:02:06.420> they're<00:02:07.420> moving

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
got some groove in it now they're moving

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.449 
got some groove in it now they're moving
to<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:07.960> right<00:02:08.200> from<00:02:08.440> there<00:02:08.649> we<00:02:08.799> have<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
to the right from there we have the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.630 
to the right from there we have the
slicer<00:02:10.799> basic<00:02:11.799> controls<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.370> we<00:02:12.489> can

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
slicer basic controls so we can

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.610 
slicer basic controls so we can
deactivate<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.239> slicer<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.170> all<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.500> can

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
deactivate the slicer so all you can

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.729 
deactivate the slicer so all you can
hear<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.130> beat<00:02:15.519> currently<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:17.620> I

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
hear is the beat currently if I

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.050 
hear is the beat currently if I
reactivate<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> slicer<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:21.400> can<00:02:21.580> control<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
reactivate a slicer we can control the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.100 
reactivate a slicer we can control the
level<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.569> here<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:28.510> should<00:02:28.690> also<00:02:28.810> add

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
level of it here and I should also add

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.130 
level of it here and I should also add
that<00:02:29.140> I'm<00:02:29.380> using<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:29.860> as<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.610> standalone

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
that I'm using this as a standalone

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.349 
that I'm using this as a standalone
device<00:02:32.140> but<00:02:33.010> if<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.250> loaded<00:02:33.519> this<00:02:33.670> up<00:02:33.850> inside

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
device but if you loaded this up inside

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.680 
device but if you loaded this up inside
your<00:02:34.930> digital<00:02:35.410> audio<00:02:35.680> workstation<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.820> VST

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
your digital audio workstation as a VST

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.310 
your digital audio workstation as a VST
plug-in<00:02:38.079> then<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:39.340> could<00:02:39.549> draw<00:02:40.540> automations

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
plug-in then you could draw automations

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.849 
plug-in then you could draw automations
within<00:02:41.650> your<00:02:41.799> door<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.790> control<00:02:43.859> parameters

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
within your door to control parameters

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.520 
within your door to control parameters
any<00:02:45.130> parameter<00:02:45.700> such<00:02:46.060> as<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.480> level<00:02:46.810> fading

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
any parameter such as the level fading

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.220 
any parameter such as the level fading
up<00:02:47.680> fading<00:02:48.430> out<00:02:50.070> we<00:02:51.070> also<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:52.120> base<00:02:52.329> and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
up fading out we also have the base and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.259 
up fading out we also have the base and
then<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.410> beat<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:54.519> can<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.820> turn<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.120> beat

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
then the beat you can just turn the beat

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.199 
then the beat you can just turn the beat
off<00:02:57.359> control<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.480> level<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.959> and<00:03:00.090> then<00:03:01.090> you

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
off control the level of it and then you

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.229 
off control the level of it and then you
can<00:03:01.359> control<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.870> overall<00:03:02.350> volume<00:03:02.500> here<00:03:06.239> to

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
can control the overall volume here to

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.000 
can control the overall volume here to
the<00:03:07.359> left<00:03:07.570> we<00:03:07.989> can<00:03:08.109> see<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.530> we<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.799> these

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
the left we can see that we have these

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.580 
the left we can see that we have these
different<00:03:09.400> tabs<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.840> let's<00:03:11.019> walk<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.260> through

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
different tabs so let's walk you through

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.520 
different tabs so let's walk you through
those<00:03:11.769> before<00:03:12.370> we<00:03:12.459> look<00:03:12.609> at<00:03:12.670> them<00:03:12.850> in<00:03:12.880> depth<00:03:13.180> in

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
those before we look at them in depth in

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.860 
those before we look at them in depth in
further<00:03:14.530> videos<00:03:14.760> first<00:03:15.760> we<00:03:16.030> have<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.329> slicer

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
further videos first we have the slicer

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.130 
further videos first we have the slicer
window<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:19.090> slicer<00:03:19.329> window<00:03:19.660> controls

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
window and the slicer window controls

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.130 
window and the slicer window controls
the<00:03:20.470> sample<00:03:21.069> you<00:03:22.030> can<00:03:22.150> choose<00:03:22.390> samples<00:03:22.870> from

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
the sample you can choose samples from

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.960 
the sample you can choose samples from
the<00:03:23.380> menu<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:23.980> showed<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.250> here<00:03:24.549> or<00:03:24.850> we

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
the menu that I showed you here or we

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.970 
the menu that I showed you here or we
can<00:03:25.000> actually<00:03:25.450> load<00:03:25.690> up<00:03:25.870> our<00:03:26.019> own<00:03:26.139> samples<00:03:26.680> and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
can actually load up our own samples and

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.710 
can actually load up our own samples and
slice<00:03:27.579> them<00:03:27.819> up<00:03:27.910> which<00:03:28.329> I'll<00:03:28.510> demonstrate

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
slice them up which I'll demonstrate

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.740 
slice them up which I'll demonstrate
later<00:03:29.430> next<00:03:30.430> we<00:03:30.609> have<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.910> base<00:03:31.090> slash<00:03:31.420> beat

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
later next we have the base slash beat

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.559 
later next we have the base slash beat
window<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.220> can<00:03:33.459> program<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.910> baseline<00:03:34.420> you

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
window so you can program a baseline you

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.020 
window so you can program a baseline you
can<00:03:34.720> program<00:03:34.959> beats<00:03:35.350> here<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.370> really<00:03:36.700> dial

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
can program beats here you really dial

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.370 
can program beats here you really dial
in<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.510> sound

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
in the sound

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.370 
in the sound
of<00:03:38.590> your<00:03:38.830> base<00:03:39.090> tones<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.450> also<00:03:40.900> your

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
of your base tones and also your

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.860 
of your base tones and also your
individual<00:03:41.950> drums<00:03:42.340> get<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.210> lot<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.660> control

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
individual drums get a lot of control

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.980 
individual drums get a lot of control
over<00:03:44.200> them<00:03:44.320> here<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:45.600> then<00:03:46.600> we<00:03:46.690> have<00:03:46.840> the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
over them here and then we have the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.690 
over them here and then we have the
effects<00:03:47.320> tab<00:03:47.530> where<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:47.860> have<00:03:48.010> seven

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
effects tab where you have seven

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.180 
effects tab where you have seven
different<00:03:49.000> effects<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.710> you<00:03:50.710> can<00:03:50.860> see<00:03:51.040> that

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
different effects and you can see that

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.390 
different effects and you can see that
as<00:03:51.310> we<00:03:51.460> move<00:03:51.700> these<00:03:52.000> different<00:03:52.420> parameters

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
as we move these different parameters

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.970 
as we move these different parameters
visually<00:03:54.400> we<00:03:54.580> see<00:03:54.790> things<00:03:55.060> moving<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:56.770> is

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
visually we see things moving so this is

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.010 
visually we see things moving so this is
really<00:03:57.580> really<00:03:58.030> easy<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:59.280> intuitive<00:04:02.220> and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
really really easy and intuitive and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.510 
really really easy and intuitive and
these<00:04:05.020> effects<00:04:05.410> sound<00:04:05.680> absolutely<00:04:05.950> great

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
these effects sound absolutely great

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.920 
these effects sound absolutely great
they're<00:04:06.760> very<00:04:06.790> very<00:04:07.210> high<00:04:07.420> grade<00:04:07.630> very

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
they're very very high grade very

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.440 
they're very very high grade very
professional<00:04:08.560> sounding<00:04:09.210> finally<00:04:10.210> we<00:04:10.330> have

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
professional sounding finally we have

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.510 
professional sounding finally we have
the<00:04:10.630> egoist<00:04:11.170> window<00:04:11.560> where<00:04:11.860> you<00:04:11.950> get<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.160> lot

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
button that says pattern and this is

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.750 
button that says pattern and this is
where<00:04:31.840> we<00:04:31.960> would<00:04:32.080> program<00:04:32.350> our<00:04:32.890> patterns

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
where we would program our patterns

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.330 
where we would program our patterns
whether<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.300> be<00:04:34.480> effects<00:04:35.230> patterns<00:04:35.650> based<00:04:36.130> on

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
whether it be effects patterns based on

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.240 
whether it be effects patterns based on
beat<00:04:36.550> patterns<00:04:37.000> or<00:04:37.330> slicer<00:04:37.720> patterns<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:39.100> can

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
beat patterns or slicer patterns you can

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.460 
beat patterns or slicer patterns you can
then<00:04:39.430> create<00:04:39.580> parts<00:04:40.240> which<00:04:40.660> are<00:04:40.870> made<00:04:41.050> up<00:04:41.290> of

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
then create parts which are made up of

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.980 
then create parts which are made up of
different<00:04:41.890> patterns<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:42.760> one<00:04:43.510> part<00:04:43.780> may

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
different patterns so one part may

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.470 
different patterns so one part may
consist<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.530> four<00:04:45.070> patterns<00:04:45.520> or<00:04:45.760> six<00:04:46.030> patterns

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
consist of four patterns or six patterns

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.690 
consist of four patterns or six patterns
or<00:04:46.690> however<00:04:46.840> many<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.260> choose<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:47.800> then<00:04:48.520> we

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
or however many you choose and then we

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.730 
or however many you choose and then we
can<00:04:48.850> go<00:04:48.970> into<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.420> song<00:04:49.720> tab<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.260> we<00:04:50.560> can

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
can go into this song tab and we can

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.310 
can go into this song tab and we can
program<00:04:50.980> an<00:04:51.280> entire<00:04:51.670> song<00:04:52.090> made<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.170> from

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
program an entire song made up from

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.310 
program an entire song made up from
parts<00:04:53.830> so<00:04:54.790> you<00:04:54.820> could<00:04:55.120> actually<00:04:55.270> write<00:04:55.720> an

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
parts so you could actually write an

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.250 
parts so you could actually write an
entire<00:04:56.800> track<00:04:57.220> using<00:04:58.180> just<00:04:58.450> the<00:04:58.660> egoist<00:04:58.960> and

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
entire track using just the egoist and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.410 
entire track using just the egoist and
you<00:04:59.890> can<00:05:00.070> really<00:05:00.280> get<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.580> lot<00:05:00.760> of<00:05:00.880> control<00:05:01.180> over

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
you can really get a lot of control over

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.120 
you can really get a lot of control over
it<00:05:01.570> if<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:01.870> want<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.200> to<00:05:02.620> make<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.950> sound

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
it if you want to to make it sound

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.040 
it if you want to to make it sound
exactly<00:05:03.670> how<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.850> want<00:05:04.090> or<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:04.870> could<00:05:05.020> just

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
exactly how you want or you could just

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.500 
exactly how you want or you could just
play<00:05:05.380> with<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.620> randomly<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.280> in<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.060> lot<00:05:07.300> more

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
play with it randomly and in a lot more

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.010 
play with it randomly and in a lot more
of<00:05:07.630> an<00:05:08.170> open<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:08.890> experimental<00:05:09.670> way<00:05:09.870> so<00:05:10.870> this

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
of an open and experimental way so this

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.410 
of an open and experimental way so this
has<00:05:11.140> been<00:05:11.290> an<00:05:11.410> overview<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.950> the<00:05:12.790> interface

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
has been an overview of the interface

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.660 
has been an overview of the interface
and<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.650> next<00:05:14.890> video<00:05:15.130> we're<00:05:15.340> going<00:05:15.430> to<00:05:15.490> get

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
and in the next video we're going to get

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.430 
and in the next video we're going to get
more<00:05:15.910> in-depth<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.540> start<00:05:16.780> looking<00:05:17.140> at<00:05:17.290> the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
more in-depth and start looking at the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.980 
more in-depth and start looking at the
slicer<00:05:18.150> window<00:05:19.150> so<00:05:19.510> I'll<00:05:19.630> see<00:05:19.780> you<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:19.930> the

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
slicer window so I'll see you in the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.410 
slicer window so I'll see you in the
next<00:05:20.200> video
