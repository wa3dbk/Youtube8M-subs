00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
issues with this handset when I'm making

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.740 
issues with this handset when I'm making
a<00:00:10.290> phone<00:00:10.500> call<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:11.099> example<00:00:11.190> if<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.389> screen

a phone call for example if the screen
does<00:00:13.019> go<00:00:13.200> black<00:00:13.610> it's<00:00:14.610> almost<00:00:15.509> impossible<00:00:15.900> to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
does go black it's almost impossible to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.599 
does go black it's almost impossible to
end<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.619> call<00:00:16.859> you'd<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.310> basically

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
end the call you'd have to basically

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.730 
end the call you'd have to basically
turn<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> screen<00:00:18.210> back<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.720> which<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.710> a

turn the screen back on which is a
slight<00:00:20.340> annoyance<00:00:21.710> also<00:00:22.710> found<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
slight annoyance also found that the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.200 
slight annoyance also found that the
tilt<00:00:24.960> mechanism<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.789> fight<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
tilt mechanism here you can fight you

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
tilt mechanism here you can fight you
can<00:00:27.390> turn<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> phone<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.529> find<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
can turn the phone on and find that the

phone<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.199> which<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> little

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
phone is is like that which is a little

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.250 
phone is is like that which is a little
bit<00:00:32.340> tricky<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.820> making<00:00:33.120> phone<00:00:33.329> calls<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
bit tricky for making phone calls you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.229 
bit tricky for making phone calls you
know<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.530> basically<00:00:35.010> turn<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
know we basically turn it on and you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.119 
know we basically turn it on and you
find<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.899> landscape<00:00:37.770> mode<00:00:37.800> like

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
find that it's in landscape mode like

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.190 
find that it's in landscape mode like
that<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.180> trying<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> phone<00:00:39.899> call

and<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> wait<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> rotate

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and you have to wait for it to rotate

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.869 
and you have to wait for it to rotate
back<00:00:42.000> around<00:00:42.300> realize<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.379> actually

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
back around realize that it's actually

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.340 
back around realize that it's actually
in<00:00:44.879> portrait<00:00:45.480> mode<00:00:45.510> or<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> should<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
in portrait mode or it should be in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410 
in portrait mode or it should be in
portrait<00:00:46.770> mode<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.030> little<00:00:48.149> bit

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
portrait mode and it's a little bit

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
portrait mode and it's a little bit
annoying<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
