any vehicles heavier than that up to
tootin<00:01:56.590> we<00:01:57.250> have<00:01:57.400> these<00:01:57.520> two<00:01:57.760> brackets<00:01:58.000> here

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
tootin we have these two brackets here

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.990 
tootin we have these two brackets here
oh<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:59.320> they<00:01:59.440> go<00:01:59.680> either<00:01:59.950> side<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.790> shack

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
oh and they go either side of the shack

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.219 
oh and they go either side of the shack
either<00:02:01.240> side<00:02:01.510> of<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.690> chassis<00:02:01.869> member

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
either side of the chassis member

either side of the chassis member
clamped<00:02:02.590> together<00:02:02.680> by<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.100> bolts<00:02:03.430> right

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
clamped together by the bolts right

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.999 
clamped together by the bolts right
we've<00:02:04.300> got<00:02:04.330> here<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.750> bow<00:02:05.020> dr<00:02:05.200> ryan<00:02:05.440> up<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:05.860> the

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
we've got here a bow dr ryan up on the

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.940 
we've got here a bow dr ryan up on the
ramp<00:02:06.390> which<00:02:07.390> bracket<00:02:07.810> would<00:02:07.960> this<00:02:08.110> take<00:02:08.410> so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
ramp which bracket would this take so

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.290 
ramp which bracket would this take so
for<00:02:09.190> this<00:02:09.280> one<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:09.700> would<00:02:09.789> have<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.030> smaller

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
for this one you would have the smaller

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.730 
for this one you would have the smaller
of<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.509> two<00:02:10.660> brackets<00:02:10.899> because<00:02:11.290> it's<00:02:11.590> less

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
of the two brackets because it's less

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.770 
of the two brackets because it's less
than<00:02:11.770> sixteen<00:02:12.220> hundred<00:02:12.490> kilos<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:13.660> would

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
than sixteen hundred kilos so you would

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.690 
than sixteen hundred kilos so you would
have<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.990> brackets<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.620> two<00:02:14.950> bolts<00:02:15.250> per<00:02:15.430> side

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
have the brackets and two bolts per side

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.390 
have the brackets and two bolts per side
all<00:02:16.240> right<00:02:16.600> now<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.320> permanently<00:02:17.920> stays<00:02:18.220> in

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
all right now this permanently stays in

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.300 
all right now this permanently stays in
place<00:02:18.670> does<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.090> absolutely<00:02:19.690> yes<00:02:19.870> but<00:02:20.320> wait<00:02:20.530> as

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
place does it absolutely yes but wait as

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.040 
place does it absolutely yes but wait as
you're<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.850> along<00:02:22.000> over<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.600> years<00:02:22.840> of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
you're going along over the years of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.590 
you're going along over the years of
ownership<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.709> bumpy<00:02:24.130> roads<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.970> could<00:02:25.239> really

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
ownership on bumpy roads it could really

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.830 
ownership on bumpy roads it could really
shake<00:02:25.900> loose<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> possibility<00:02:27.940> no<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
shake loose is that a possibility no the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.170 
shake loose is that a possibility no the
vaults<00:02:29.080> themselves<00:02:29.650> are<00:02:29.890> tilt<00:02:30.310> up<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.580> 86<00:02:30.970> new

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
vaults themselves are tilt up to 86 new

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.970 
vaults themselves are tilt up to 86 new
meters<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.200> molt<00:02:32.380> passes<00:02:32.709> through<00:02:32.860> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
meters so the molt passes through the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
meters so the molt passes through the
bracket<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.459> then<00:02:33.550> there<00:02:33.700> will<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.940> nut

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
bracket and then there will be a nut

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.050 
bracket and then there will be a nut
which<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.380> timed<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> far<00:02:36.100> side<00:02:36.340> well<00:02:36.820> you

what<00:02:40.600> 86<00:02:41.140> newton<00:02:41.590> metres<00:02:41.950> talked<00:02:42.250> means<00:02:43.380> could

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
what 86 newton metres talked means could

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.890 
what 86 newton metres talked means could
you<00:02:44.470> explain<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:44.950> though<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.430> simple<00:02:45.820> terms

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
you explain that though in simple terms

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.940 
you explain that though in simple terms
normally<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.050> would<00:02:47.200> tie<00:02:47.350> nail<00:02:47.530> with<00:02:47.709> its<00:02:47.830> all

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
normally you would tie nail with its all

normally you would tie nail with its all
wrench<00:02:48.160> which<00:02:48.459> is<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.660> would<00:02:49.780> set

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
wrench which is this and you would set

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.870 
wrench which is this and you would set
this<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.230> 86<00:02:50.620> newton<00:02:50.980> metres<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.730> will

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
this to 86 newton metres and that will

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.900 
this to 86 newton metres and that will
tell<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.180> how<00:02:52.360> tight<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.900> malt<00:02:53.080> was<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:54.100> if<00:02:54.459> a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
tell you how tight the malt was so if a

reasonable dealership and they'll fit it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.240 
reasonable dealership and they'll fit it
in<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.480> over<00:03:07.600> 15<00:03:08.049> minutes<00:03:08.200> now<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:08.920> talk

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
in just over 15 minutes now you talk

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.789 
in just over 15 minutes now you talk
about<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.700> brackets<00:03:10.200> where<00:03:11.200> does<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.650> actual

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
about the brackets where does the actual

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.610 
about the brackets where does the actual
jack<00:03:12.310> fit<00:03:12.790> on<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.239> bracket<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.290> bracket

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
jack fit on the bracket so the bracket

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.390 
jack fit on the bracket so the bracket
is<00:03:14.709> mounted<00:03:15.100> in<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:16.720> position<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.350> then<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
is mounted in this position and then the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.640 
is mounted in this position and then the
actual<00:03:18.519> jack<00:03:18.940> itself<00:03:19.360> will<00:03:20.200> slot<00:03:20.470> in<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
actual jack itself will slot in the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.539 
actual jack itself will slot in the
bottom<00:03:21.299> OIC<00:03:22.299> let's<00:03:22.570> just<00:03:22.780> say<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.470> thought<00:03:24.340> it

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
bottom OIC let's just say I thought it

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.150 
bottom OIC let's just say I thought it
just<00:03:24.760> matches<00:03:25.030> perfectly

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
just matches perfectly

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.220 
just matches perfectly
