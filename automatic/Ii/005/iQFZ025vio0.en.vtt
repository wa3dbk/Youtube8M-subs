to tell you a little bit about the d-4s

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.919 
to tell you a little bit about the d-4s
that<00:00:10.500> we've<00:00:10.620> just<00:00:10.830> announced<00:00:11.190> yesterday<00:00:11.929> so

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
this is our latest Pro Series DSLR and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.960 
this is our latest Pro Series DSLR and
some<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> advanced<00:00:17.100> features<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.670> takes

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
some of the advanced features this takes

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.929 
some of the advanced features this takes
on<00:00:18.180> from<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> videographers<00:00:19.439> point<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> view<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
on from a videographers point of view is

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.580 
on from a videographers point of view is
it<00:00:21.150> moves<00:00:21.359> things<00:00:21.660> further<00:00:21.990> forward<00:00:22.439> from

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it moves things further forward from

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.730 
it moves things further forward from
what<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.769> had<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> d4<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.939> Nick<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.240> d4

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
what we had in the d4 so Nick on d4

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.650 
what we had in the d4 so Nick on d4
allowed<00:00:25.740> full<00:00:26.039> HD<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.390> three

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
allowed full HD and it had three

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660 
allowed full HD and it had three
different<00:00:27.900> crop<00:00:28.289> modes<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.220> not<00:00:29.340> only<00:00:29.429> could

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
different crop modes so not only could

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.510 
different crop modes so not only could
you<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.970> full<00:00:30.300> 35<00:00:31.109> mil<00:00:31.349> full<00:00:31.560> frame<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.460> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you have full 35 mil full frame but you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370 
you have full 35 mil full frame but you
could<00:00:32.640> also<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:32.940> down<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> another<00:00:34.170> crop

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
could also go down to a another crop

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
could also go down to a another crop
mode<00:00:34.590> which<00:00:34.860> took<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> smaller<00:00:35.670> size<00:00:35.910> one

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
mode which took it to a smaller size one

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.350 
mode which took it to a smaller size one
that's<00:00:36.870> more<00:00:37.050> actually<00:00:38.000> normal<00:00:39.000> foot<00:00:39.180> for

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that's more actually normal foot for

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
that's more actually normal foot for
most<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.570> our<00:00:39.660> video<00:00:40.020> cameras<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.559> then<00:00:41.010> we

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
most of our video cameras and then we

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.729 
most of our video cameras and then we
had<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.460> 2.7<00:00:42.000> times<00:00:42.270> crops<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.290> d-4s

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
had a one at 2.7 times crops so the d-4s

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.000 
had a one at 2.7 times crops so the d-4s
has<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.789> same<00:00:45.059> features<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> also

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
has the same features but it is also

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.709 
has the same features but it is also
improved<00:00:47.520> further<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.539> have

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
improved further so you actually have

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.709 
improved further so you actually have
now<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> 60<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.620> 50<00:00:49.920> p<00:00:50.129> instead<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
now a 60 and 50 p instead of I in the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630 
now a 60 and 50 p instead of I in the
output<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:53.010> also<00:00:53.129> able<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
output and you're also able to do a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.850 
output and you're also able to do a
clean<00:00:53.910> HDMI<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.079> could<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.379> d4

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
clean HDMI out like you could on the d4

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
clean HDMI out like you could on the d4
but<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.550> d-4s<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> full<00:00:57.510> HD

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
but with the d-4s you can do a full HD

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
but with the d-4s you can do a full HD
recording<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.739> well<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> clean<00:00:59.399> HDMI<00:00:59.850> out

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
recording as well as the clean HDMI out

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.740 
recording as well as the clean HDMI out
without<00:01:00.539> losing<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> live<00:01:03.210> view<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> back

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
without losing the live view on the back

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
without losing the live view on the back
of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.960> camera<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:04.880> the<00:01:05.880> thing<00:01:06.119> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
of the camera as well the thing that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.420 
of the camera as well the thing that
this<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.600> camera<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.049> famed<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.430> mostly

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
this this camera is famed for mostly

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.390 
this this camera is famed for mostly
mostly<00:01:09.060> informally<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> its<00:01:10.530> dynamic<00:01:11.189> range

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
mostly informally is its dynamic range

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
mostly informally is its dynamic range
and<00:01:11.640> its<00:01:11.820> ability<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.360> handle<00:01:12.720> very<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.409> low

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and its ability to handle very very low

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
and its ability to handle very very low
light<00:01:13.799> levels<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.880> camera<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.270> shoot

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
light levels so this camera can shoot

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.510 
light levels so this camera can shoot
videos<00:01:15.960> now<00:01:16.200> equivalent<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.009> four<00:01:17.189> hundred

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
videos now equivalent of four hundred

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.330 
videos now equivalent of four hundred
and<00:01:17.610> eight<00:01:17.960> thousand<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.439> 0<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and eight thousand is 0 which is the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
and eight thousand is 0 which is the
high<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.520> setting<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.990> really

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
high for setting but what that really

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
high for setting but what that really
means<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.860> when<00:01:23.100> you're<00:01:23.250> using<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> in

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
means is that when you're using it in

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.670 
means is that when you're using it in
low<00:01:23.880> light<00:01:24.090> conditions<00:01:24.570> let's<00:01:25.229> say<00:01:25.380> twenty

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
low light conditions let's say twenty

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.649 
low light conditions let's say twenty
five<00:01:25.799> thousand<00:01:26.280> six<00:01:26.460> hundred<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.150> you're

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
five thousand six hundred is so you're

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
five thousand six hundred is so you're
getting<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:28.140> clear<00:01:28.500> crisp<00:01:29.070> still<00:01:29.490> images

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
getting really clear crisp still images

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.640 
getting really clear crisp still images
or<00:01:30.119> video<00:01:30.360> images<00:01:30.750> because<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.259> using

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
or video images because it's all using

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
or video images because it's all using
the<00:01:31.680> same<00:01:31.790> processing<00:01:32.790> engine<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the same processing engine which is the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
the same processing engine which is the
new<00:01:35.090> expedia<00:01:36.090> fits<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.689> system<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
new expedia fits that this system has is

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.710 
new expedia fits that this system has is
that<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.549> microphone<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.329> controlled

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
that the microphone can be controlled

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.889 
that the microphone can be controlled
there<00:01:39.930> you've<00:01:40.140> got<00:01:40.170> audio<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.750> on<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
there you've got audio in and out on the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.690 
there you've got audio in and out on the
side<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> cameras<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> we'll<00:01:44.340> also<00:01:44.460> have

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
side of the cameras and we'll also have

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090 
side of the cameras and we'll also have
control<00:01:45.149> over<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.750> network<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.649> well<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.009> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
control over the network as well so you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.319 
control over the network as well so you
actually<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.369> control<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:48.030> video

by the video journalists is on da
hundreds<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.970> at<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.570> heart<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.080> they

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
hundreds and at the heart of that they

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.900 
hundreds and at the heart of that they
will<00:02:32.350> have<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> studio<00:02:32.830> bot<00:02:33.130> which<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.490> this<00:02:33.700> one

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
will have a studio bot which is this one

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.570 
will have a studio bot which is this one
here<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:35.140> that's<00:02:35.320> basically<00:02:35.650> controlling

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
here and that's basically controlling

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.150 
here and that's basically controlling
within<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.270> studio<00:02:37.600> environment<00:02:38.070> moving<00:02:39.070> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
within the studio environment moving the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.490 
within the studio environment moving the
d4<00:02:39.550> into<00:02:39.760> position<00:02:40.240> so<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.780> have<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:40.990> completely

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
d4 into position so we have a completely

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.360 
d4 into position so we have a completely
smart<00:02:42.070> autonomous<00:02:42.940> solution<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:44.980> small

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
smart autonomous solution that is small

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.740 
smart autonomous solution that is small
and<00:02:45.610> neat<00:02:45.820> because<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.300> studio<00:02:46.570> doesn't

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
and neat because the studio doesn't

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.840 
and neat because the studio doesn't
afford<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.200> much<00:02:47.350> space<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.400> stated<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
afford that much space and it stated the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.340 
afford that much space and it stated the
art<00:02:49.000> offering<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.630> ability<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:50.080> have<00:02:50.200> very

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
art offering the ability to have very
