00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.670
 Welcome to the automax channel 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:17.130
 project Marx d 124 already from sandblasting 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.270
 yesterday there was nothing in the video because 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.100
 extinguished the sand began to build sand 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.039
 the porch there was sandblasted and today 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.900
 I finished the body myself, I'll show you how 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.900
 it turned out sandblast metal 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.280
 can see shells sauce very 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.840
 serious very serious hard sand 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.760
 was built because something else is alive well 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.219
 Of course khlipenky normal such 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320
 the doors 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.250
 to throw out because there you feel 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.489
 what difference but we will do already 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.350
 they will restore to do it but 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.760
 pack we will cover everything 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.590
 aluminum putty to give 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.380
 strength of the metal from the inside too 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.340
 processed here near the pens reflect 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340
 not really visible 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:29.700
 there are not enough of such places were small 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:33.240
 all built here on the roof less often 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 girl this paint 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.280
 ass here still found a hole too 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:54.170
 I'll brew it now. 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:54.170
 I also sandblasted the arch 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.770
 there is no hole freak on this strong here everything 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.840
 factory sealant just in case 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:13.520
 decided to strip and inspect not to 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.920
 it was rust all clearly for this 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.239
 side too new of sore spots 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.980
 these are the foliage here 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.480
 mole winger 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:31.220
 inside she is also sandblasting on what 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 so local here in places here on 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.830
 video is not so good 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.170
 individual elements here hood too 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.680
 you will immediately process 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:03:00.850
 epoxy in the list frame was built too 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:09.020
 TV will sandblast 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:11.660
 So much so that wave still was so 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.260
 Sydney com process to metal is not 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.840
 was standing 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:25.310
 did not hap lags and was not formed from this 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:28.940
 brewed place also a couple more for two 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.850
 revol here changed a piece and so all 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.380
 beginners, in principle, not bad 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:40.700
 living nothing anywhere walks all good 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:45.740
 here, too, sand blasting on in general so 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.540
 sandblasting process is over now 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:53.090
 all run low fat cut poxy pancake 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.060
 I will cover it with primer and poxy 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.040
 I think until tomorrow it will dry 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.380
 see tomorrow dry and tomorrow 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.060
 let's start already putty 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.070
 it will be seen that it is very important that the pack 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:10.670
 Sydney primer dried out so that later there was no 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:14.269
 drawdowns so we will look and you 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.600
 watch the channel watch now process 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.030
 epoxy will still photos to 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:29.600
 it was better to see how the shell knocks out 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:31.820
 sandblast take a photo and throw it out 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.460
 then I 'll take off after the pack strong 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.460
 Soil show further 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:29.390
 Here are treated with maksid ground immediately 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:33.020
 protected metal here 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:36.160
 where, where the disk flowed 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.160
 all processed 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.540
 and so in a circle everywhere 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:54.950
 around and worked here on the icons you 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:58.190
 worked to prevent rust 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.510
 because if you put the metal already 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.600
 can be formed 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:08.200
 they will not be visible but will 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:16.730
 to form in general everything 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:18.950
 follow the project will follow 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:23.919
 show how further what we have 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:27.200
 happens we wait until the soil dries and 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:32.870
 so tomorrow is probably at least until tomorrow 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:38.210
 wait still tomorrow dry in general everything 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:41.720
 so we are moving things soon 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:45.980
 will begin putty will expel 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:50.210
 to putty stuff weâ€™ll shoot everything 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:53.510
 show all watched the project 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.870
 subscribe to the channel machine all 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.870
 good luck
