I don't think you're gonna find anything

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.980 
I don't think you're gonna find anything
better<00:05:52.199> than<00:05:52.380> this<00:05:52.729> as<00:05:53.729> far<00:05:54.389> as<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.719> high

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
better than this as far as the high

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.640 
better than this as far as the high
quality<00:05:55.500> of<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.710> goes<00:05:57.080> you<00:05:58.080> pretty<00:05:58.560> much

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
quality of it goes you pretty much

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.010 
quality of it goes you pretty much
picture<00:05:59.069> speaks<00:05:59.190> for<00:05:59.520> itself<00:05:59.789> again<00:06:00.659> I<00:06:00.690> give

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
picture speaks for itself again I give

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.839 
picture speaks for itself again I give
it<00:06:01.110> two<00:06:01.229> thumbs<00:06:01.259> up<00:06:01.650> four<00:06:02.400> out<00:06:02.520> of<00:06:02.580> five<00:06:02.789> stars

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
it two thumbs up four out of five stars

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.589 
it two thumbs up four out of five stars
for<00:06:03.509> the<00:06:03.599> sony<00:06:03.840> ps3<00:06:04.289> eye<00:06:04.860> webcam<00:06:05.699> the<00:06:06.389> only

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
for the sony ps3 eye webcam the only

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.390 
for the sony ps3 eye webcam the only
reason<00:06:06.870> I'm<00:06:06.960> not<00:06:07.110> giving<00:06:07.440> it<00:06:07.529> five<00:06:07.800> stars<00:06:08.009> is

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
reason I'm not giving it five stars is

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.920 
reason I'm not giving it five stars is
because<00:06:08.729> I<00:06:08.909> think<00:06:08.969> it<00:06:09.180> could<00:06:09.330> be<00:06:09.419> a<00:06:09.449> little<00:06:09.719> bit

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
because I think it could be a little bit

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.680 
because I think it could be a little bit
better<00:06:10.440> in<00:06:10.800> low<00:06:11.099> light<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:12.330> think<00:06:12.569> it

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
better in low light and I think it

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.680 
better in low light and I think it
probably<00:06:13.229> can<00:06:13.440> be<00:06:13.560> a<00:06:13.590> little<00:06:13.830> bit<00:06:14.090> higher<00:06:15.090> mic

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
probably can be a little bit higher mic

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.269 
probably can be a little bit higher mic
volume<00:06:16.169> on<00:06:16.409> the<00:06:16.590> output<00:06:17.870> but<00:06:19.279> everybody's

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.279 
volume on the output but everybody's

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.070 
volume on the output but everybody's
gonna<00:06:20.400> post-process<00:06:21.120> their<00:06:21.300> videos<00:06:21.630> you're

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
gonna post-process their videos you're

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.110 
gonna post-process their videos you're
gonna<00:06:22.199> raise<00:06:22.469> that<00:06:22.680> volume<00:06:22.889> up<00:06:23.250> you're<00:06:24.000> gonna

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
gonna raise that volume up you're gonna

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.700 
gonna raise that volume up you're gonna
do<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.360> little<00:06:24.599> bit<00:06:24.779> to<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.020> image<00:06:25.289> to<00:06:25.469> get<00:06:25.590> it

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
do a little bit to the image to get it

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.409 
do a little bit to the image to get it
to<00:06:25.889> be<00:06:26.069> probably<00:06:26.610> a<00:06:26.699> little<00:06:26.819> bit<00:06:27.029> better<00:06:27.180> to

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
to be probably a little bit better to

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.749 
to be probably a little bit better to
get<00:06:27.539> rid<00:06:27.690> of<00:06:27.750> some<00:06:27.930> of<00:06:27.960> the<00:06:28.080> noise<00:06:28.520> you<00:06:29.520> can't

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
get rid of some of the noise you can't

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:30.110 
get rid of some of the noise you can't
beat<00:06:29.940> it

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
beat it

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.740 
beat it
