it's<00:00:48.740> that<00:00:48.890> brake<00:00:49.160> caliper<00:00:49.700> it's<00:00:49.850> not<00:00:50.090> cutting

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450

the mustard so we're going to show that
some<00:00:52.100> love<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:52.490> dress<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:52.760> up<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.940> little<00:00:53.030> bit

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
with this

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.630 
with this
it's<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.230> dupli-color<00:00:54.500> caliper<00:00:55.160> paint<00:00:55.340> kit

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
it's the dupli-color caliper paint kit

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.830 
it's the dupli-color caliper paint kit
it's<00:00:58.640> easy<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.060> tell<00:00:59.240> when<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.480> roll<00:00:59.660> that

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
it's easy to tell when you roll that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.660 
it's easy to tell when you roll that
tire<00:01:00.050> out<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.380> way<00:01:00.440> that<00:01:00.740> this<00:01:00.950> thing<00:01:01.010> is

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
tire out of the way that this thing is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.160 
tire out of the way that this thing is
dirty<00:01:02.060> so<00:01:02.329> we've<00:01:02.450> got<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.660> get<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.840> cleaned<00:01:03.050> up

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
dirty so we've got to get it cleaned up

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.299 
dirty so we've got to get it cleaned up
and<00:01:03.350> that's<00:01:03.470> where<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.680> kit<00:01:03.860> comes<00:01:04.100> in

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
and that's where the kit comes in

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.740 
and that's where the kit comes in
because<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.610> kit<00:01:04.879> has<00:01:05.030> everything<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.659> we

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
because the kit has everything that we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.090 
because the kit has everything that we
need<00:01:05.930> we'll<00:01:06.320> start<00:01:06.590> right<00:01:06.680> here<00:01:06.860> with<00:01:07.009> the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
need we'll start right here with the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.260 
need we'll start right here with the
caliper<00:01:07.460> cleaner<00:01:07.670> we're<00:01:07.820> going<00:01:07.939> to<00:01:08.000> hit<00:01:08.090> that

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
caliper cleaner we're going to hit that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.149 
caliper cleaner we're going to hit that
first<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.619> know<00:01:09.650> odds<00:01:09.890> are<00:01:10.070> pretty

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
first and then you know odds are pretty

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.319 
first and then you know odds are pretty
good<00:01:10.280> there's<00:01:10.520> going<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.670> be<00:01:10.759> some<00:01:10.970> rust<00:01:11.180> on

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
good there's going to be some rust on

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:11.770 
good there's going to be some rust on
there<00:01:11.479> too

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
there too

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.420 
there too
so<00:01:12.049> if<00:01:12.229> there<00:01:12.409> is<00:01:12.439> we'll<00:01:12.740> take<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.920> wire<00:01:13.159> brush

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
so if there is we'll take the wire brush

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.740 
so if there is we'll take the wire brush
to<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.880> knock<00:01:14.000> all<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.329> off<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.630> then

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
to that and knock all that off and then

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.120 
to that and knock all that off and then
hit<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:14.899> again<00:01:15.200> with<00:01:15.590> some<00:01:15.619> more<00:01:15.740> caliper

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
hit it again with some more caliper

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.160 
hit it again with some more caliper
cleaner<00:01:19.210> we<00:01:20.210> got<00:01:20.390> all<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.630> loose<00:01:20.810> rust

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
cleaner we got all the loose rust

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.840 
cleaner we got all the loose rust
knocked<00:01:21.560> off<00:01:21.770> we<00:01:22.040> can<00:01:22.190> hit<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.310> one<00:01:22.490> more<00:01:22.520> time

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
knocked off we can hit it one more time

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.399 
knocked off we can hit it one more time
with<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.120> caliper<00:01:23.479> cleaner<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.080> then<00:01:24.290> it'll

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
with the caliper cleaner and then it'll

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.510 
with the caliper cleaner and then it'll
be<00:01:24.500> ready<00:01:24.560> for<00:01:24.890> paint

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.740 

one<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.579> the<00:01:33.640> nice<00:01:33.789> things<00:01:33.820> about<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.360> caliper

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
one of the nice things about the caliper

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.810 
one of the nice things about the caliper
paint<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.560> it's<00:01:35.770> self<00:01:36.189> leveling<00:01:36.610> so

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
paint is that it's self leveling so

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.399 
paint is that it's self leveling so
it'll<00:01:37.090> fill<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.420> little<00:01:37.539> pits<00:01:37.869> here<00:01:38.140> or<00:01:38.259> there

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
it'll fill in little pits here or there

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.139 
it'll fill in little pits here or there
and<00:01:38.619> it<00:01:38.920> will<00:01:38.979> make<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.280> finish<00:01:39.579> a<00:01:39.789> lot

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
and it will make the finish a lot

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.800 
and it will make the finish a lot
smoother

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
smoother

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.149 
smoother
