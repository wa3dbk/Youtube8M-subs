00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.410
 Hi all, Swami Romka and today we 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.910
 play mt 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:19.660
 on a new server called you team 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:21.369
 i left the server b pan he just 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.630
 tired of 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.960
 due to the fact that he is now starting all 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.089
 garbage do server crashes often lags 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:35.120
 some on the same server we have 100 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:36.950
 FPS FPS now show here the same 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.090
 the most that on that server but a little bit 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:46.070
 better but not more comfortable let us 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:50.680
 take the car today to we ride 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.680
 yes of course the choice was a little different 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.700
 let's get the Prior 100 helmet and 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.240
 Today I will explain how to set up 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.370
 car in something 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:08.170
 the server will be in the description as you see here 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:12.940
 new move all such a car now 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.890
 is without modification without any 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.620
 here it was as it was so worth it 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.500
 there is 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.860
 let us not start doing the present. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.740
 all i'm here again we arrived at the new 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.330
 place where now a little bit of us grass 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.290
 the graphics let's start from the very 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.050
 unpretentious start with fix if she 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:44.480
 broke down and choose the color of our car 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.480
 let's choose let's say red so 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.179
 so here it looks cool so 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.329
 that's all super car just looks 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.079
 cool stay on the settings only speaker 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.899
 for this we press the b key 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.970
 Russian and the number of 6 belts for fast 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:17.080
 races 5 acceleration 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.599
 reserve all the time we put 8 and 8 to 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.640
 We have not experienced problems front-wheel drive 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.420
 according to this disk the car shelter 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.400
 they have a debate go to the body choose 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.400
 right level of cutting start 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.079
 1.7 steel 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:40.440
 suspension we will choose later and we brake 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.090
 put the top five 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.010
 we all now see our car 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.160
 shake a little bit to us put on 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.160
 handbrake 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.640
 2 thin and rises and falls when 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.220
 gas brake now we turn on 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.850
 setting flags on setting flags to us 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.260
 need to plant here here and opposite 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:10.510
 here here ticks here 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:17.800
 all proceed to the setting itself 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:21.460
 drives and so to speak pendants on these 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:28.560
 turn off the pair go into the pumping 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:33.190
 choose the disks we need the same disks 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:37.030
 Now let's say that such disks remain 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:43.930
 we just tune the suspension to 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:46.250
 cars behaved well this 13 advise 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.160
 to put 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.200
 that's all our car is ready to drive 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.330
 front 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.730
 spirin 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.730
 more or less looks like real 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.940
 rear brake works 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.890
 everyone looks like a realistic y and now we 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.349
 it only remains to adjust the graphics to 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.569
 to play small 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:18.450
 for those who have a compost register and a replacement for 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:22.430
 me for video inhibition here is the setting 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.460
 play on ruin like water like real 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.220
 the sun could be like that 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:34.990
 it is impossible to convey this feeling 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:40.390
 let's we try to set up we 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:44.340
 click on you tf2 here we have no 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.170
 ticks should not stand standard 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.620
 Here we have a standard drive to 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.630
 is located let's get down to 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.190
 at the construction site 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:00.400
 shaders auto stand here and here tick 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:04.390
 older water core in this color we need 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.980
 remove all red as well leave 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:12.960
 can you put any 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:17.070
 want to click apply and so we do 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.900
 next we can put the road shaders 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.930
 road one can supply and road 2 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.610
 Well, as you can see with our cars 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.480
 happens so the road shaders we 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:32.560
 remove further we go setting the screen 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:37.419
 choose brightness and contrast after which 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:42.520
 click apply that's all you can customize 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:48.270
 the level of graphics we want at least 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.270
 red which made it better to soften 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:57.190
 do here so that we bring something not 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.759
 was so and so here we have a beautiful 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.160
 sunset 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:04.600
 car looks nice 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.710
 wheels do not get out of the cabin 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:12.210
 Well, as the cabin of the cut for him did 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.280
 that's all 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.729
 those who want to win go to the server 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.419

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:27.810
 you came what he said and calmly in 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.509
 basically you can play on others 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:37.220
 servers almost exactly configure also 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:42.240
 just slightly changed the car kits 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:47.460
