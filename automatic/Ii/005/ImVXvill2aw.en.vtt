okay so then to start with you just want
to<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:12.480> want<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.690> mark<00:00:12.959> your<00:00:13.320> place<00:00:13.919> your

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
to you want to mark your place your

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.430 
to you want to mark your place your
marker<00:00:14.370> zone<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:14.910> shown<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.209> the<00:00:15.389> diagram<00:00:15.440> so

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
marker zone as shown in the diagram so

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.440 
marker zone as shown in the diagram so
the<00:00:16.530> distance<00:00:16.920> between<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.820> market<00:00:18.210> here<00:00:18.360> in

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
the distance between this market here in

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.540 
the distance between this market here in
this<00:00:18.630> marker<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.170> team<00:00:19.590> goal<00:00:19.890> line<00:00:20.130> is

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
this marker the team goal line is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
this marker the team goal line is
probably<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.360> about<00:00:21.450> 15<00:00:22.140> meters<00:00:22.530> but

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
probably going to be about 15 meters but

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.110 
probably going to be about 15 meters but
it<00:00:22.770> obviously<00:00:22.860> that's<00:00:23.250> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.520> depend<00:00:23.820> on

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 
it obviously that's going to depend on

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.330 
it obviously that's going to depend on
the<00:00:24.720> amount<00:00:25.200> of<00:00:25.380> players<00:00:25.770> that<00:00:26.010> you've<00:00:26.160> got

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the amount of players that you've got

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.860 
the amount of players that you've got
spread<00:00:26.670> across<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.360> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.750> I've

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
spread across here as you can see I've

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.320 
spread across here as you can see I've
got<00:00:28.020> ten<00:00:28.290> sometimes<00:00:29.130> I've<00:00:29.250> got<00:00:29.280> 20<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.090> that'll

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
got ten sometimes I've got 20 so that'll

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.299 
got ten sometimes I've got 20 so that'll
all<00:00:30.480> depend<00:00:30.840> okay<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:31.710> distance<00:00:32.129> between

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
all depend okay the distance between

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.090 
all depend okay the distance between
both<00:00:32.550> teams<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.330> usually<00:00:33.960> roughly<00:00:34.290> 15<00:00:34.680> meters

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
both teams is usually roughly 15 meters

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.310 
both teams is usually roughly 15 meters
okay<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.210> anything<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:36.540> 15<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
okay but it can be anything from 15 to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.450 
okay but it can be anything from 15 to
30<00:00:38.190> meters<00:00:38.700> depending<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.240> how<00:00:40.310> obviously<00:00:41.310> how

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
30 meters depending on how obviously how

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
30 meters depending on how obviously how
long<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.030> game<00:00:42.240> to<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.630> for<00:00:42.840> so

again pick up the marker jump forward so
it's<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.469> a<00:01:25.590> continuous<00:01:25.770> process<00:01:26.759> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it's just a continuous process of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.669 
it's just a continuous process of
completing<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.569> three<00:01:27.810> exercises<00:01:28.289> and

completing the three exercises and
jumping<00:01:29.520> forward<00:01:29.789> obviously<00:01:30.600> eventually<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
jumping forward obviously eventually the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.679 
jumping forward obviously eventually the
play<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.069> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.789> point<00:01:33.060> where

marker past the team goal and so here
we've<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.369> team<00:01:44.549> 1<00:01:44.819> if<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.689> finish<00:01:45.990> before

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
we've got team 1 if they finish before

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.649 
we've got team 1 if they finish before
team<00:01:46.709> 2<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.369> we've<00:01:47.459> all<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.639> markers<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.420> pass

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
team 2 so we've all the markers a pass

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.139 
team 2 so we've all the markers a pass
the<00:01:48.810> team<00:01:49.020> goal<00:01:49.289> line<00:01:49.560> before<00:01:50.399> team<00:01:50.639> to<00:01:50.819> get<00:01:50.999> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the team goal line before team to get to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.760 
the team goal line before team to get to
do<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.659> obviously<00:01:51.749> team<00:01:52.289> 1<00:01:52.590> win<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.139 

what<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> tend<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.609> is<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.000> beginners

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
what I tend to do is for the beginners

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.630 
what I tend to do is for the beginners
I'll<00:01:57.570> probably<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:58.020> five<00:01:58.320> reps<00:01:58.619> each<00:01:58.829> for

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
I'll probably have five reps each for

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.399 
I'll probably have five reps each for
the<00:01:59.729> intermediate<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.420> might<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.899> seven<00:02:01.289> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the intermediate I might have seven to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
the intermediate I might have seven to
eight<00:02:01.590> reps<00:02:01.890> each<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.640> you've<00:02:02.850> got<00:02:03.000> any<00:02:03.149> sort

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
eight reps each if you've got any sort

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.240 
eight reps each if you've got any sort
of<00:02:03.509> super<00:02:03.869> advanced<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.710> might<00:02:04.890> want<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> give

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
of super advanced you might want to give

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.730 
of super advanced you might want to give
them<00:02:05.399> maybe<00:02:05.549> ten<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.149> fifteen<00:02:06.600> reps<00:02:06.899> each<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
them maybe ten to fifteen reps each and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.680 
them maybe ten to fifteen reps each and
what<00:02:07.950> happens<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> player

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
what happens in so when the player

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.420 
what happens in so when the player
actually<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.739> obviously<00:02:11.129> they're<00:02:11.310> going

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
actually because obviously they're going

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.039 
actually because obviously they're going
to<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.670> working<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.209> individuals<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.900> they're

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
to be working as individuals so they're

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.530 
to be working as individuals so they're
all<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.379> finish<00:02:13.590> at<00:02:13.769> different<00:02:14.099> times

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
all going to finish at different times

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.839 
all going to finish at different times
once<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.720> player<00:02:15.959> finishes<00:02:16.290> again<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:17.700> is

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
once a player finishes again and this is

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.030 
once a player finishes again and this is
really<00:02:18.000> important<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.629> know<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.049> player<00:02:19.799> can

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
really important to know that player can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.369 
really important to know that player can
run<00:02:20.310> back<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.330> team<00:02:21.629> members<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
run back to one of the team members and

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.559 
run back to one of the team members and

like say it's quite a simple one and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.089 
like say it's quite a simple one and
like<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.910> usually<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.720> used<00:02:57.959> about<00:02:58.200> 15<00:02:58.470> meters

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
like I usually it's used about 15 meters

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.910 
like I usually it's used about 15 meters
maybe<00:02:59.310> 20<00:02:59.880> all<00:03:00.060> depends<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.600> mean<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> have<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
maybe 20 all depends I mean I have a a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.069 
maybe 20 all depends I mean I have a a
lower<00:03:02.519> ability<00:03:02.790> group<00:03:03.269> who<00:03:03.540> are<00:03:03.569> trained<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:04.049> a

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
lower ability group who are trained on a

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.410 
lower ability group who are trained on a
different<00:03:04.410> date<00:03:04.650> or<00:03:04.859> two<00:03:05.549> my<00:03:05.730> high<00:03:06.000> intensity

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
different date or two my high intensity

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.449 
different date or two my high intensity
group<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.260> lower<00:03:07.470> intensity<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.130> might<00:03:08.310> be

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
group so the lower intensity it might be

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.150 
group so the lower intensity it might be
five<00:03:08.760> reps<00:03:09.090> each<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:10.230> high<00:03:10.410> intensity<00:03:10.470> might

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
five reps each the high intensity might

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.650 
five reps each the high intensity might
be<00:03:11.340> maybe<00:03:11.639> seven<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.180> eight<00:03:12.329> but<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
be maybe seven to eight but the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.930 
be maybe seven to eight but the
exercises<00:03:13.500> are<00:03:13.620> much<00:03:13.739> harder<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.760> great

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
exercises are much harder but the great

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.400 
exercises are much harder but the great
thing<00:03:15.150> about<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.049> use

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
thing about this is you can use

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.620 
thing about this is you can use
kettlebells<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.459> use<00:03:17.730> sandbags<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.510> can

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
kettlebells you can use sandbags you can

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.360 
kettlebells you can use sandbags you can
use<00:03:18.750> all<00:03:18.930> kinds<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.290> different<00:03:19.350> things<00:03:19.590> as

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
use all kinds of different things as

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.789 
use all kinds of different things as
long<00:03:20.489> as<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.760> pick<00:03:20.970> three<00:03:21.239> exercises<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.650> can

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
long as you pick three exercises you can

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.650 
long as you pick three exercises you can
pick<00:03:23.010> two<00:03:23.040> exercises<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.120> want<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.480> can

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
pick two exercises if you want you can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.740 
pick two exercises if you want you can
mix<00:03:24.900> them<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:26.340> know<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.609> use<00:03:26.730> four<00:03:27.030> exercises

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
mix them you know and use four exercises
