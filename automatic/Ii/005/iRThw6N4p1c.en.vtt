00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
easy to do with a food processor because

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.580 
easy to do with a food processor because
they<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.350> fast<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.580> careful<00:01:18.409> mix<00:01:19.409> the

dough only until it binds together then
remove<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.189> food<00:01:23.430> processor<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
remove it from the food processor and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.749 
remove it from the food processor and
finish<00:01:24.990> developing<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> by<00:01:25.920> hand<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.549> your

work that flour in until your dough gets
to<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> right<00:01:37.860> consistency<00:01:38.790> note<00:01:39.659> that

the<00:01:39.990> dough<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> made<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.400> about

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the dough I made here with just about

what I like and I did not have to do

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.149 
what I like and I did not have to do
much<00:01:43.950> neat<00:01:44.430> kneading<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.090> add<00:01:45.360> much<00:01:45.630> flour<00:01:46.159> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
much neat kneading or add much flour the

much neat kneading or add much flour the
little<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.729> had<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.659> finish<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
little that I had to do to finish it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.800 
little that I had to do to finish it
however<00:01:49.740> shows<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> technique<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
however shows you the technique that you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.649 
however shows you the technique that you
would<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.409> use<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.460> repeatedly<00:01:54.149> fold

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
would have to use just repeatedly fold

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.800 
would have to use just repeatedly fold
and<00:01:54.960> turn<00:01:55.290> until<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> dough<00:01:56.189> feels<00:01:57.180> satiny

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
and turn until the dough feels satiny

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.039 
and turn until the dough feels satiny
