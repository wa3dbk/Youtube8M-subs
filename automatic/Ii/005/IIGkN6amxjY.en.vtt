00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that's what I think these are really

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
that's what I think these are really
easy<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.140> once<00:00:37.500> again<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.860> look<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.160> much

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
easy to once again you look at that much

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.200 
easy to once again you look at that much
money<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:40.219> assets<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.610> apiece<00:00:41.879> defense

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
money and assets or apiece defense

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
money and assets or apiece defense
rookies<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:42.989> these<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.559> really<00:00:43.680> easy

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
rookies and all these are really easy

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.650 
rookies and all these are really easy
but<00:00:44.219> reason<00:00:44.969> why<00:00:45.059> i<00:00:45.090> don't<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> notre
