point<00:01:09.900> having<00:01:10.049> them<00:01:10.290> um<00:01:10.409> because<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> would

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
point having them um because you would

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160

not<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.670> head<00:01:11.850> shots<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.240> doing<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
not get a head shots for doing that so

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.510 
not get a head shots for doing that so
there's<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.470> no<00:01:13.740> point<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.130> doing<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> out

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
there's really no point in doing it out

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.730 
there's really no point in doing it out
so<00:01:14.760> I've<00:01:14.820> got<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.270> UAV<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.470> will

so I've got one UAV on that's all I will

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.219 
so I've got one UAV on that's all I will
be<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:19.049> I'll<00:01:19.200> be

shot sagat's I got ten head shots which
is<00:02:38.330> quite<00:02:38.660> good<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:39.050> know<00:02:39.170> first<00:02:39.440> time<00:02:39.650> using

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
is quite good you know first time using

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.290 
is quite good you know first time using
my<00:02:39.980> assault<00:02:40.280> rifles<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.819> try<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.060> get<00:02:41.150> head

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
my assault rifles to try and get head

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.949 
my assault rifles to try and get head
shots<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.780> quite<00:02:42.019> harder<00:02:42.530> because<00:02:43.569> fire<00:02:44.569> for

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
shots it's quite harder because fire for

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.110 
shots it's quite harder because fire for
distance<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.440> easy<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.800> bought<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.760> it's<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
distance is easy I bought so it's the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.030 
distance is easy I bought so it's the
way<00:02:47.269> if<00:02:47.780> they<00:02:47.959> took<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.349> quickly<00:02:48.709> turn<00:02:48.920> away

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040
