00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.740 
looks better I know for a fact in WMV
looks<00:02:16.650> terrible<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.910> sounds<00:02:18.239> terrible<00:02:18.569> as

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
looks terrible and it sounds terrible as

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.680 
looks terrible and it sounds terrible as
well<00:02:18.959> on<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.410> um<00:02:19.709> when<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:20.640> when<00:02:21.360> it's<00:02:21.510> all

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
well on this um when it's when it's all

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.690 
well on this um when it's when it's all
done<00:02:21.959> encoding<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.799> whatever<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.220> does<00:02:23.430> I'm

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
done encoding it or whatever it does I'm

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.780 
done encoding it or whatever it does I'm
rendering<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.269> guess<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.890> yeah<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.579> gonna

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
rendering I guess so yeah it's gonna

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.360 
rendering I guess so yeah it's gonna
look<00:02:27.000> terrible<00:02:27.299> with<00:02:27.600> WMV<00:02:28.380> but<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.250> to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
look terrible with WMV but it's going to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.539 
look terrible with WMV but it's going to
be<00:02:29.519> one<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.680> smallest<00:02:31.680> files<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.430> can

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
be one of the smallest files you can

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.720 
be one of the smallest files you can
have<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.910> air<00:02:33.440> AVI<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:34.890> going<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.370> one<00:02:35.609> of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
have on air AVI it's going to be one of

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.490 
have on air AVI it's going to be one of
the<00:02:35.820> biggest<00:02:36.090> files<00:02:36.510> you're<00:02:36.989> gonna<00:02:37.200> deal<00:02:37.470> with

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the biggest files you're gonna deal with

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.770 
the biggest files you're gonna deal with
and<00:02:37.950> then<00:02:38.640> again<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.239> going<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.570> come<00:02:39.750> down

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and then again it's going to come down

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.770 
and then again it's going to come down
to<00:02:40.140> how<00:02:40.519> how<00:02:41.519> long<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.940> record<00:02:42.359> but<00:02:42.630> it's

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
to how how long you record but it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.240 
to how how long you record but it's
still<00:02:42.989> gonna<00:02:43.109> be<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.290> really<00:02:43.560> big<00:02:43.739> file<00:02:43.980> bigger

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
still gonna be a really big file bigger

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.650 
still gonna be a really big file bigger
than<00:02:44.489> any<00:02:44.790> one<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.090> these<00:02:46.220> but<00:02:47.220> DVD<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.450> gives

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
than any one of these but DVD it gives

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.220 
than any one of these but DVD it gives
you<00:02:48.750> smooth<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:50.570> good-looking<00:02:51.570> quality<00:02:52.019> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
you smooth and a good-looking quality of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.949 
you smooth and a good-looking quality of
the<00:02:52.650> video<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.790> know<00:02:53.910> even<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.540> source

the video on you know even the source

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.319 
the video on you know even the source
computers<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:56.280> mines<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.760> have<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> very

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
computers like mines I have a very

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.800 
computers like mines I have a very
crappy<00:02:57.690> computer<00:02:57.930> right<00:02:58.320> now<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:59.630> trying<00:03:00.630> to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
crappy computer right now and trying to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.130 
crappy computer right now and trying to
run<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.170> Camtasia<00:03:01.709> Studio<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:03.630> know<00:03:03.750> screen

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
run this Camtasia Studio you know screen

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.140 
run this Camtasia Studio you know screen
recording<00:03:04.530> program<00:03:04.980> go<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.790> um

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
recording program go and this um

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.030 
recording program go and this um
capturing<00:03:06.660> program<00:03:07.140> at<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> same<00:03:07.560> time<00:03:07.799> it

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
capturing program at the same time it

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.610 
capturing program at the same time it
will<00:03:08.190> bottleneck<00:03:08.850> my<00:03:09.630> whole<00:03:09.810> system<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.380> it

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
will bottleneck my whole system and it

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.099 
will bottleneck my whole system and it
will<00:03:10.739> like<00:03:10.980> skip<00:03:11.730> around<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.359> if<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.720> see<00:03:12.930> that

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
will like skip around so if you see that

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.129 
will like skip around so if you see that
in<00:03:13.400> my<00:03:14.400> video<00:03:14.850> right<00:03:15.030> now<00:03:15.120> I'm<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.989> press

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
in my video right now I'm going to press

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.080 
in my video right now I'm going to press
okay<00:03:16.410> right<00:03:16.560> here<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
okay right here if you see this in the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.030 
okay right here if you see this in the
video<00:03:18.299> then<00:03:18.840> it's<00:03:19.109> going<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.380> skip<00:03:19.739> that's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
video then it's going to skip that's

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.069 
video then it's going to skip that's
because<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.639> screen<00:03:21.299> recording<00:03:21.690> program

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
because of the screen recording program

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.400 
because of the screen recording program
so<00:03:22.769> don't<00:03:22.799> think<00:03:23.220> that's<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.049> capturing<00:03:25.049> card

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
so don't think that's the capturing card

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.759 
so don't think that's the capturing card
it's<00:03:25.739> not<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.190> at<00:03:26.310> all<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:27.450> yeah<00:03:28.379> if<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.590> see

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
it's not that at all so yeah if you see

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.920 
it's not that at all so yeah if you see
that<00:03:29.090> disregard<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
that disregard the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.559 
that disregard the
blagging<00:03:31.560> that's<00:03:31.739> my<00:03:31.920> capturing<00:03:32.459> program<00:03:32.879> so

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
blagging that's my capturing program so

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.289 
blagging that's my capturing program so
yeah<00:03:33.750> if<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.079> see<00:03:34.290> any<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:35.189> know<00:03:35.730> like<00:03:35.939> I<00:03:36.030> said

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
yeah if you see any you know like I said

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.979 
yeah if you see any you know like I said
any<00:03:37.310> lagging<00:03:38.310> that's<00:03:38.790> from<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.420> recording

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
any lagging that's from the recording

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.589 
any lagging that's from the recording
program<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.709> not<00:03:40.950> from<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:42.299> know<00:03:42.420> my

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
program and not from the you know my

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.470 
program and not from the you know my
screen<00:03:42.959> recording<00:03:43.439> program<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:45.000> yeah<00:03:45.239> and

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
screen recording program so yeah and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.649 
screen recording program so yeah and
it's<00:03:45.659> not<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.170> capture<00:03:46.829> card<00:03:47.189> at<00:03:47.310> all<00:03:47.659> it's

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
it's not the capture card at all it's

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.990 
it's not the capture card at all it's
clear<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.230> smooth<00:03:49.560> on<00:03:49.709> my<00:03:49.859> end<00:03:50.129> over<00:03:50.670> here<00:03:50.819> but

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
clear and smooth on my end over here but

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.080 
clear and smooth on my end over here but
it<00:03:51.120> might<00:03:51.269> come<00:03:51.510> about<00:03:51.599> glassy<00:03:52.409> or<00:03:52.939> you<00:03:53.939> know

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
