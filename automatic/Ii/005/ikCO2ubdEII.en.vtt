00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710 

okay<00:00:00.359> this<00:00:00.539> is<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.750> typical<00:00:01.740> water<00:00:01.979> pump<00:00:02.720> setup

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
okay this is a typical water pump setup

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.400 
okay this is a typical water pump setup
for<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.230> narrow<00:00:04.770> boat<00:00:05.540> it's<00:00:06.540> really<00:00:07.140> what

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
for a narrow boat it's really what

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.129 
for a narrow boat it's really what
provides<00:00:08.069> your<00:00:08.490> boat<00:00:08.730> with<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.809> water

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
provides your boat with the water

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.150 
provides your boat with the water
pressure<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:11.370> sort<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> boat<00:00:12.420> functions

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
pressure to sort of the boat functions

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.820 
pressure to sort of the boat functions
as<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.549> would<00:00:14.700> expect<00:00:15.049> water<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.320> flow<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
as you would expect water to flow in a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.769 
as you would expect water to flow in a
tap<00:00:17.039> from<00:00:17.220> home<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.850> at<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> front<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
tap from home so at the front of the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.370 
tap from home so at the front of the
boat<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:20.029> bulkhead<00:00:21.029> which<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.170> this

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
boat you have a bulkhead which in this

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
boat you have a bulkhead which in this
case<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.890> where<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.970> water<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.449> stored

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
case is where all the water is stored

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.230 
case is where all the water is stored
and<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.529> water<00:00:25.740> comes<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.490> through<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> pipe

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and the water comes out through a pipe

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.779 
and the water comes out through a pipe
at<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.510> bottom<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> tank<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.890> comes

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
at the bottom of the tank and comes

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.359 
at the bottom of the tank and comes
through<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.689> tap<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.710> which<00:00:31.949> I'll<00:00:32.160> come<00:00:32.340> back

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
through a tap here which I'll come back

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.330 
through a tap here which I'll come back
to<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> second<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.600> through<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.770> tap<00:00:35.070> here

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
to in a second and through this tap here

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.660 
to in a second and through this tap here
into<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> pump<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.719> through<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> diaphragm

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
into a pump and through a diaphragm

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.030 
into a pump and through a diaphragm
which<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.360> which<00:00:39.809> actually<00:00:40.040> pressurizes

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
which is here which actually pressurizes

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.500 
which is here which actually pressurizes
the<00:00:41.070> system<00:00:41.870> basically<00:00:42.870> when<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.530> run<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.640> tap

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the system basically when you run a tap

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
the system basically when you run a tap
which<00:00:45.870> I'll<00:00:46.079> disappear<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.710> switch<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.100> at

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
which I'll disappear and switch on at

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.479 
which I'll disappear and switch on at
the<00:00:47.280> moment<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.780> pressure<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> built<00:00:50.250> up

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the moment the pressure that is built up

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
the moment the pressure that is built up
in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> system<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.420> released<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
in the system is released because the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.619 
in the system is released because the
water<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.190> xscape<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.879> through<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> tap<00:00:54.390> or

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
water is xscape in through the tap or

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.229 
water is xscape in through the tap or
the<00:00:54.780> shower<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.309> happens<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the shower what actually happens then is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.200 
the shower what actually happens then is
the<00:00:57.600> diaphragm<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.850> realizes<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the diaphragm here realizes it's got a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.689 
the diaphragm here realizes it's got a
drop<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.690> pressure<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.469> pressure<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
drop in pressure in pressure and the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
drop in pressure in pressure and the
pump<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> then<00:01:03.570> told<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.320> start<00:01:05.040> pumping<00:01:05.250> water

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
pump is then told to start pumping water

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.760 
pump is then told to start pumping water
into<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.150> system<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.990> maintain<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
into the system to maintain that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950 
into the system to maintain that
pressure<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.970> system<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
pressure in the system so that you get a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.289 
pressure in the system so that you get a
consistent<00:01:10.200> flow<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.920> water<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.180> going

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
consistent flow of water what I'm going

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.440 
consistent flow of water what I'm going
to<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.430> turn<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> tap<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
to do now is going turn on a tap to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
to do now is going turn on a tap to
release<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> pressure<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> system

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
release the pressure out of the system

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.210 
release the pressure out of the system
and<00:01:17.220> you'll<00:01:17.490> hear<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.890> pump<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and you'll hear the pump and the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.580 
and you'll hear the pump and the
diaphragm<00:01:20.549> kicking<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> start<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.350> feed

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
diaphragm kicking in and start to feed

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
diaphragm kicking in and start to feed
the<00:01:22.770> pressure<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> water<00:01:23.729> remains

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the pressure so that the water remains

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:41.860 
the pressure so that the water remains
constant<00:01:25.170> throughout<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.610> boat

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.830 

and<00:01:42.870> here<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.130> pressure<00:01:44.660> started<00:01:45.660> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and here that as the pressure started to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350 
and here that as the pressure started to
drop<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:47.160> you're<00:01:47.460> quite<00:01:48.030> work<00:01:48.330> that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
drop in that you're quite work that

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.180 
drop in that you're quite work that
throwing<00:01:48.840> through<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> boat<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.800> pump<00:01:50.040> has

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
throwing through the boat the pump has

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.340 
throwing through the boat the pump has
kicked<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.910> through<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.690> dropping

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
kicked in and through the dropping

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
kicked in and through the dropping
pressure<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.880> maintaining<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> flow<00:01:54.210> of

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
pressure is maintaining the flow of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.230 
pressure is maintaining the flow of
water<00:01:54.600> through<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:56.190> boat<00:01:56.400> so<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
water through the boat so that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.670 
water through the boat so that
everything<00:01:57.930> when<00:01:58.260> you're<00:01:58.380> having<00:01:58.560> your

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
everything when you're having your

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.950 
everything when you're having your
shower<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.280> doing<00:01:59.490> your<00:01:59.640> washing<00:01:59.820> up<00:02:00.120> remains

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
shower or doing your washing up remains

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.109 
shower or doing your washing up remains
at<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.260> constant<00:02:01.620> pressure<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.820> now<00:02:03.060> turned

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
at a constant pressure it's now turned

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.270 
at a constant pressure it's now turned
off<00:02:03.660> because<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.200> pressure<00:02:04.440> is<00:02:04.650> right<00:02:04.950> he's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
off because the pressure is right he's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.710 
off because the pressure is right he's
built<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.640> right<00:02:05.790> amount<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> pressure<00:02:06.420> up

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
built the right amount of pressure up

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.480 
built the right amount of pressure up
and<00:02:06.900> what<00:02:07.260> what<00:02:07.380> happen<00:02:07.680> again<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:08.040> it's<00:02:08.250> just

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
and what what happen again as it's just

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.340 
and what what happen again as it's just
done<00:02:08.700> once<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.330> pressure<00:02:09.510> drops<00:02:09.899> again<00:02:10.200> it

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
done once that pressure drops again it

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.370 
done once that pressure drops again it
will<00:02:10.470> put<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.890> again<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.400> an<00:02:11.910> operator<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:13.230> get

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
will put in again and an operator to get

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.250 
will put in again and an operator to get
the<00:02:13.500> pressure<00:02:13.740> back<00:02:14.010> up<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:15.270> how<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the pressure back up and that's how the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.020 
the pressure back up and that's how the
systems<00:02:16.590> run<00:02:16.740> on<00:02:16.860> most<00:02:17.040> bows<00:02:17.310> what<00:02:17.550> I'll<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.850> is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
systems run on most bows what I'll do is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.490 
systems run on most bows what I'll do is
I'll<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.390> turn<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> tap<00:02:18.900> off<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.230> I'll<00:02:19.290> pop

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
I'll go in turn the tap off and I'll pop

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.530 
I'll go in turn the tap off and I'll pop
back<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.740> show<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.070> what<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:21.000> taps<00:02:21.270> and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
back and show you what the taps and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:35.520 
back and show you what the taps and
various<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.140> bits<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.440> pieces<00:02:22.530> are<00:02:22.920> for

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.979 

there<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.680> as<00:02:37.579> I<00:02:37.730> mentioned<00:02:38.150> earlier<00:02:38.360> on<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> tap

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
there is as I mentioned earlier on a tap

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.089 
there is as I mentioned earlier on a tap
here<00:02:39.640> there's<00:02:40.640> clearly<00:02:40.909> marked<00:02:41.390> off<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:42.439> tap

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
here there's clearly marked off that tap

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.149 
here there's clearly marked off that tap
is<00:02:43.970> quite<00:02:44.299> important<00:02:44.959> when<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.680> comes<00:02:45.920> to

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
is quite important when it comes to

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.380 
is quite important when it comes to
wintertime<00:02:47.470> most<00:02:48.470> boats<00:02:48.859> have<00:02:49.310> antifreeze<00:02:50.090> in

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
wintertime most boats have antifreeze in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.449 
wintertime most boats have antifreeze in
all<00:02:50.659> their<00:02:50.870> seal<00:02:51.290> systems<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.099> that's<00:02:52.189> their

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
all their seal systems so that's their

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.220 
all their seal systems so that's their
central<00:02:52.879> heating<00:02:53.209> system<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.689> their<00:02:53.870> engine

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
central heating system and their engine

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.440 
central heating system and their engine
system<00:02:54.620> but<00:02:55.159> obviously<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.700> water<00:02:56.209> that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
system but obviously this is water that

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.259 
system but obviously this is water that
you<00:02:57.319> shower<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:57.890> do<00:02:58.280> your<00:02:58.430> washing<00:02:58.700> up<00:02:59.000> with

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
you shower in do your washing up with

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.349 
you shower in do your washing up with
and<00:02:59.569> some<00:03:00.230> people<00:03:00.530> drink<00:03:00.909> so<00:03:01.909> therefore<00:03:02.269> you

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
and some people drink so therefore you

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.479 
and some people drink so therefore you
can't<00:03:02.629> put<00:03:02.810> antifreeze<00:03:03.079> in<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.980> problem

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
can't put antifreeze in it the problem

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.449 
can't put antifreeze in it the problem

there and went when the winter sets in

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.690 
there and went when the winter sets in
and<00:03:14.750> temperatures<00:03:14.989> get<00:03:15.260> down<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.650> -8<00:03:16.189> -10

actually expand and crack to actually

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.509 
actually expand and crack to actually
stop<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.720> happening<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.470> have<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.769> tap<00:03:22.129> here

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
stop that happening you have a tap here

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.699 
stop that happening you have a tap here
which<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.389> can<00:03:23.569> turn<00:03:23.750> off<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:27.079> this<00:03:27.530> will

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
which you can turn off and this will

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.240 
which you can turn off and this will
stop<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.609> flow<00:03:28.849> of<00:03:28.879> water<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:30.109> beyond<00:03:30.470> this

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
stop the flow of water to beyond this

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.339 
stop the flow of water to beyond this
point<00:03:31.609> here<00:03:31.910> there's<00:03:32.480> only<00:03:32.629> a<00:03:32.750> very<00:03:33.079> very

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
point here there's only a very very

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.000 
point here there's only a very very
small<00:03:33.620> section<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.900> piping<00:03:35.919> between<00:03:36.919> the

the side of the pipe where you can

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.080 
the side of the pipe where you can
actually<00:03:42.049> get<00:03:42.349> frost<00:03:42.769> damage<00:03:43.069> and<00:03:43.819> what<00:03:43.970> you

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
actually get frost damage and what you

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.449 
actually get frost damage and what you
can<00:03:44.299> do<00:03:44.510> now<00:03:44.959> is<00:03:45.560> go<00:03:45.829> in<00:03:45.889> turn<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.220> taps

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
can do now is go in turn the taps

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.180 
can do now is go in turn the taps
ongoing<00:03:47.060> turn<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.389> shower<00:03:47.599> on<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.199> drain<00:03:48.859> all

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
ongoing turn the shower on and drain all

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.309 
ongoing turn the shower on and drain all
the<00:03:49.220> water<00:03:49.370> out<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.879> the<00:03:50.060> system<00:03:50.510> from<00:03:51.079> this

the water out of the system from this

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.119 
the water out of the system from this
point<00:03:51.560> on<00:03:51.859> it's<00:03:52.730> part<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.209> winterizing

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
point on it's part of the winterizing

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.009 
point on it's part of the winterizing
winterization<00:03:55.129> process<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.479> will<00:03:56.599> stop

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
winterization process and it will stop

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.729 
winterization process and it will stop
your<00:03:57.739> pipes<00:03:58.069> freezing<00:03:59.440> expanding<00:04:00.440> because

the mass of the art is greater and

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.520 
the mass of the art is greater and
obviously<00:04:02.510> splitting<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.049> pipes<00:04:03.290> and

summer<00:04:07.280> very<00:04:08.120> simple<00:04:08.629> takes<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:09.079> few<00:04:09.260> minutes

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
summer very simple takes a few minutes

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.949 
summer very simple takes a few minutes
to<00:04:09.739> do<00:04:09.979> and<00:04:10.310> it's<00:04:10.879> just<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.209> case<00:04:11.389> of<00:04:11.449> making

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
to do and it's just a case of making

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.839 
to do and it's just a case of making
sure<00:04:12.379> that<00:04:12.409> all<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.979> water<00:04:13.190> is<00:04:13.430> out<00:04:13.609> of<00:04:13.790> the

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
sure that all the water is out of the

sure that all the water is out of the
system<00:04:14.209> once<00:04:14.629> this<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.169> the<00:04:15.290> off<00:04:15.379> position
