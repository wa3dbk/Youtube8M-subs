you've played feed the beast more than a
few<00:00:13.080> minutes<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.710> realize<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.639> when<00:00:15.179> you

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
few minutes you realize that when you

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.410 
few minutes you realize that when you
start<00:00:15.480> querying<00:00:15.719> or<00:00:16.820> working<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:17.850> mining

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
to a chest or whatever and this is going

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.010 
to a chest or whatever and this is going
to<00:00:44.520> feed<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> system<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.600> our<00:00:45.719> feeding

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to feed the system this is our feeding

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
to feed the system this is our feeding
chest<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> start

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
chest and that we are going to start

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540 
chest and that we are going to start
right<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.739> an<00:00:49.950> iron<00:00:50.190> gate<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
right here this is an iron gate that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.279 
right here this is an iron gate that
looks<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:51.000> checking<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.899> see<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
looks at checking to see if the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.860 
looks at checking to see if the
inventory<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.000> case<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> hopper<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
inventory of in this case the hopper is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.420 
inventory of in this case the hopper is
empty<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:55.890> provide<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> red

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
empty and if it is it will provide a red

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.729 
empty and if it is it will provide a red
pipe<00:00:56.670> signal<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> empty<00:00:58.379> it'll

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
pipe signal so if this is empty it'll

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.400 
pipe signal so if this is empty it'll
power<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.190> rest<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.059> pipe<00:01:00.300> wire<00:01:00.570> which<00:01:01.260> will

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
power this rest the pipe wire which will

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
power this rest the pipe wire which will
come<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.949> which<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.969> read<00:01:03.149> by<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
come to here which is read by this the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.630 
come to here which is read by this the
red<00:01:03.809> pipe<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.290> will<00:01:05.070> provide<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> redstone

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
red pipe on will provide a redstone

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.719 
red pipe on will provide a redstone
signal<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.890> there<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.189> items<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
signal and there have to be items in the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.190 
signal and there have to be items in the
inventory<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> chest<00:01:09.659> sitting<00:01:09.930> next<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
inventory of the chest sitting next to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.380 
inventory of the chest sitting next to
it<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:11.100> provide<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> redstone<00:01:11.760> signal<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
it to provide the redstone signal so

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.460 
it to provide the redstone signal so
there<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.080> create<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
there you go and that will create the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.100 
there you go and that will create the
redstone<00:01:13.920> signal<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.790> will<00:01:14.880> power<00:01:15.110> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
redstone signal that will power the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.890 
redstone signal that will power the
engine<00:01:16.759> that<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:17.939> fill<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> hopper<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
engine that will fill the hopper the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
engine that will fill the hopper the
hopper<00:01:19.200> will<00:01:19.409> fill<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.920> reset<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> router

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
hopper will fill the reset the router

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.350 
hopper will fill the reset the router
the<00:01:22.140> router<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.770> fill<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.009> recycler<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the router will fill the recycler and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.719 
the router will fill the recycler and
this<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.320> allows<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
this this allows you to not have to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.410 
this this allows you to not have to
worry<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:28.520> feeding<00:01:29.520> too<00:01:29.790> many<00:01:29.939> items<00:01:30.090> into

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
worry about feeding too many items into

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.210 
worry about feeding too many items into
the<00:01:30.540> system<00:01:30.869> having<00:01:31.170> looping<00:01:31.530> pipe<00:01:31.740> systems

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the system having looping pipe systems

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.730 
the system having looping pipe systems
and<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.759> kind<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> stuff<00:01:33.079> and<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.409> fills

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and all that kind of stuff and it fills

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.569 
and all that kind of stuff and it fills
all<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.040> these<00:01:35.340> recyclers<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.460> see

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
all of these recyclers so you can see

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.100 
all of these recyclers so you can see
they're<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:38.909> running<00:01:39.090> before<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.079> any

will<00:01:51.090> drain<00:01:51.420> these<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.079> won't<00:01:52.200> run

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
will drain these and then it won't run

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.560 
will drain these and then it won't run
anymore<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:52.920> come<00:01:53.579> daytime<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.240> will<00:01:54.450> be

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
anymore but come daytime it will be

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.060 
anymore but come daytime it will be
stable<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.990> actually<00:01:55.229> generates<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.680> little

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
stable it actually generates a little

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.100 
stable it actually generates a little
bit<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.250> power<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> little<00:01:57.990> bit

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
bit of power so if you have a little bit

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.090 
bit of power so if you have a little bit
more<00:01:58.439> than<00:02:00.170> three<00:02:01.170> advanced<00:02:01.469> solar<00:02:01.680> panels

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
more than three advanced solar panels

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670 
more than three advanced solar panels
you'll<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.820> able<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.060> run<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.329> or<00:02:04.020> equivalent

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
you'll be able to run this or equivalent

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.249 
you'll be able to run this or equivalent
power<00:02:04.799> sources<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.509> start<00:02:06.780> filling<00:02:07.110> this

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
power sources so we start filling this

power sources so we start filling this
with<00:02:07.729> Kabul<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:09.360> are<00:02:09.539> running<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:10.050> peak

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
with Kabul these are running at peak

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.290 
with Kabul these are running at peak
capacity<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:11.190> could<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.670> course<00:02:11.819> overclock

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
capacity I could of course overclock

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.640 
capacity I could of course overclock
these<00:02:12.510> I'd<00:02:12.720> need<00:02:12.870> more<00:02:13.080> power

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
these I'd need more power

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.119 
these I'd need more power
and<00:02:13.739> make<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> run<00:02:14.909> faster<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.920> could<00:02:16.920> add<00:02:17.099> more

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
and make it run faster I could add more

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.960 
and make it run faster I could add more
of<00:02:17.579> these<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.829> make<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:19.980> system<00:02:20.159> run<00:02:20.489> faster

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
of these and make the system run faster

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.089 
of these and make the system run faster
I<00:02:21.150> could<00:02:21.930> actually<00:02:22.079> add<00:02:22.379> these<00:02:22.590> recyclers

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
I could actually add these recyclers

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.089 
I could actually add these recyclers
directly<00:02:23.489> on<00:02:23.610> top<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:24.000> here<00:02:24.769> right<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:25.980> then

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
directly on top of here right and then

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.429 
directly on top of here right and then
power<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.730> with<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.060> line<00:02:27.629> this<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:27.989> now<00:02:28.200> in

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
power it with the line this is now in

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.559 
power it with the line this is now in
the<00:02:28.620> system<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.610> will<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:29.819> fed<00:02:30.030> by<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.239> router

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
the system it will be fed by the router

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.960 
the system it will be fed by the router
the<00:02:31.530> joy<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.519> router<00:02:32.760> will

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the joy of this is that that router will

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.970 
the joy of this is that that router will
take<00:02:33.180> care<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.959> don't<00:02:34.439> have<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.680> do<00:02:34.799> any

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
take care of this I don't have to do any

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.740 
take care of this I don't have to do any
more<00:02:35.159> piping<00:02:35.609> I<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.909> just<00:02:36.090> add<00:02:36.239> all<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.480> these

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
more piping I can just add all of these

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.229 
more piping I can just add all of these
power<00:02:37.739> them<00:02:37.980> up<00:02:38.099> of<00:02:38.430> course<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:38.939> I'm<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
power them up of course now I'm going to

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.720 
power them up of course now I'm going to
need<00:02:39.329> more<00:02:39.540> power<00:02:40.189> to<00:02:41.189> run<00:02:41.370> these<00:02:41.489> more

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
need more power to run these more

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.410 
need more power to run these more
recyclers<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:43.879> now<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:44.939> can<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.269> all<00:02:45.299> of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
recyclers and now you can see all of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.240 
recyclers and now you can see all of
those<00:02:45.599> are<00:02:45.780> running<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.680> routers<00:02:46.950> will<00:02:47.099> take

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
those are running the routers will take

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.129 
those are running the routers will take
care<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.459> feeding<00:02:47.879> them<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.659> will<00:02:48.810> take<00:02:48.959> care

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
care of feeding them this will take care

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.500 
care of feeding them this will take care
of<00:02:49.200> extracting<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.190> scrap<00:02:50.459> out<00:02:50.639> which<00:02:51.359> will

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
of extracting the scrap out which will

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.899 
of extracting the scrap out which will
come<00:02:51.659> through<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:53.010> these<00:02:53.670> gate

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
come through here this these gate

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.300 
come through here this these gate
systems<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:55.500> looks<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.950> see<00:02:56.069> if<00:02:56.099> there<00:02:56.280> are

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
systems this looks to see if there are

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.039 
systems this looks to see if there are
items<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.849> routers<00:02:57.120> inventory<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.750> if<00:02:57.840> so

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
items in the routers inventory and if so

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.589 
items in the routers inventory and if so

powers the red pipe signal which goes to
hear<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.650> will<00:03:01.859> look<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.069> see<00:03:02.129> if<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.370> red

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
hear this will look to see if the red

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.420 
hear this will look to see if the red
pipe<00:03:02.700> wire<00:03:03.329> is<00:03:03.569> on<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.079> if<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.409> to<00:03:04.650> send<00:03:05.370> a

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
pipe wire is on and if so to send a

use electrical engines without wasting
electrical<00:03:14.879> power<00:03:16.069> so<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:17.340> will<00:03:18.000> run<00:03:18.299> so

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
electrical power so that will run so

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.439 
electrical power so that will run so
here<00:03:19.169> we<00:03:19.199> got<00:03:19.379> the<00:03:20.340> extract<00:03:20.760> running<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.209> runs

here we got the extract running it runs

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.720 
here we got the extract running it runs
great<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:22.290> those<00:03:22.590> go<00:03:22.829> into<00:03:23.129> this<00:03:23.340> chest

to<00:05:22.270> do<00:05:22.599> it<00:05:22.750> otherwise<00:05:23.050> you'd<00:05:23.469> have<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.680> use<00:05:23.830> a

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
to do it otherwise you'd have to use a

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.100 
to do it otherwise you'd have to use a
running<00:05:24.400> clock<00:05:24.580> or<00:05:24.909> a<00:05:24.940> clock<00:05:25.659> that's<00:05:25.690> running

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
on and off again and there are other

on and off again and there are other
