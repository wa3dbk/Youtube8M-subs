00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:12.500
 Cut off a 10 cm piece of the bottom part of the Chinese cabbage. 

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:27.500
 We apply the knife at a 45-degree angle to the edge of the leaf and cut the first petal. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.780
 We remove the unnecessary pulp and then break the incision. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:54.090
 In this way, we proceed on the other parts of the cabbage. 

00:02:00.347 --> 00:02:12.800
 We cut and spread the rest of the cabbage.
