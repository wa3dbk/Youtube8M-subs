00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.060
 it works a little better as it has less 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.410
 increases because we can model more 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.410
 quickly making it a little more 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.380
 we already have the tank on top giving 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.789
 ass as long as you do not lose 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 back but where are those of our 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.160
 number because I will not be able to look at my 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.800
 homeland is that it does not improve this the same 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.449
 shit three snipers seriously 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.760
 fucking war movies with all the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 whores frank movies materials all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.579
 the world wants to be a fucking sniper in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.769
 all the fucking games all over the world 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.800

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.870
 cool fast and lethal a bullet a dead 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.390
 all those fucking bullshit 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 I'm like legolas fast and I kill you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.930
 Right away before you see me 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.030
 invite to tell him all that shit 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.670
 then those low bullshit and he 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.380
 the accounts to the tank 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.790
 bases in the accounts to fucking tank to 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.259
 see what sherry says to you in your face 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.380
 basically what is doing us the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.560
 part that is giving for ass 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.560
 but 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 to see is that is that seriously that can 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.720
 do against that is the inverse in a 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.720
 activity is that I do not know what 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.869
 wait what you can do with 36 cards 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.690
 in a patrol seriously 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.369
 put on radio beacons is as if it were not 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.720
 the beacon radio is sufficiently useless 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.130
 that you can appear with your classmates 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.540
 of equipment directly is not but 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.729
 we have three here we can listen up 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.259
 the fucking chain cope or that three sensors 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.030
 of movement with one already locates this 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.590
 what you have to locate but with 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.180
 three come on we'll see you until the fucking 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.070
 bones to the soldiers and if it were not 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.200
 above is that you are going to locate the also 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:07.289
 is being in the ass at all times 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.289
 we know where you were I'm seeing 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.910
 on all maps well fine but it's that 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.170
 It's a bit of the bad of the car that has 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.790
 vehicles and how you neglect to start 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.200
 do not enter with tanks as I said 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.570
 in the other videos when they enter you with 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.740
 tanks when they enter you with the anthrax and 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.020
 the whole story you can not do 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.300
 absolutely nothing that you are crushed like 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.070
 extras up to whereabouts is stealing what 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.630
 is stealing is stealing perfect to 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.870
 see if I can climb come come come from 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.100
 pvp is worth less host because it comes 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.140
 this shit you carry this tank 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.760
 giving us ass all the fucking parting 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.140
 see if we can use it against them or at 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.680
 unless they do not have stairs that do not 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.680
 have value 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.730
 I can not believe it in the name of 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.290
 sacred as and above after the bomb 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.180
 great you have fixed us in the same 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.460
 map but they had killed them all or 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.960
 they are not able to catch themselves engineer 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.430
 because the tank is not giving for ass 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.070
 the whole game are not able to catch 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.020
 that engineer and styles we fixed 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.190
 to steal the tank and still kill them 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.530
 to everyone when we get to steal the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.070
 seriously fuck tank I take off are 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.070

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.210
 incredible I can choose between appearing in 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.160
 the base or I can say between appearing two 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.440
 meters a little more to the right you know 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.880
