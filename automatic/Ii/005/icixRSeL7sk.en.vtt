combine it together so moving forward
you're<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> step<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:40.500> left<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.549> up

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you're going to step right left right up

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.850 
you're going to step right left right up
yes<00:01:42.780> right<00:01:43.729> one<00:01:44.729> two<00:01:45.180> three<00:01:45.600> four<00:01:46.079> five<00:01:46.470> one

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.070 
know a little twist in 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
1<00:02:12.450> 2<00:02:12.630> 3<00:02:12.780> 4<00:02:13.380> 5<00:02:13.620> 1<00:02:13.980> 2<00:02:14.130> 3<00:02:14.280> 4<00:02:14.880> 5<00:02:15.150> good

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 good

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.110 
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 good
I<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.340> movement<00:02:17.520> with<00:02:17.819> fingers

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
I like to do this movement with fingers

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.180 
I like to do this movement with fingers
and<00:02:18.150> balls<00:02:18.450> if<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.350> is<00:02:19.470> too<00:02:19.620> much<00:02:19.739> for<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.100> or

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
and balls if this is too much for you or

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.229 
and balls if this is too much for you or
you<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.430> never<00:02:20.640> done<00:02:20.730> finger<00:02:21.090> cymbals

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
you have never done finger cymbals

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.840 
you have never done finger cymbals
before<00:02:21.720> just<00:02:22.380> forget<00:02:22.620> about<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.190> focus<00:02:23.730> on

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
before just forget about it and focus on

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.270 
before just forget about it and focus on
the<00:02:23.940> movement<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.800> my<00:02:25.890> mind<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.190> helps

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
the movement but in my mind it helps

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.770 
the movement but in my mind it helps
punctuate<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.000> movement<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> little<00:02:27.510> bit<00:02:27.600> more

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
punctuate the movement a little bit more

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.870 
punctuate the movement a little bit more
to<00:02:28.380> break<00:02:28.560> down<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.980> pattern<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.459> quickly

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
to break down the pattern really quickly

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.840 
to break down the pattern really quickly
we're<00:02:30.420> gonna<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.780> five<00:02:31.340> alternating<00:02:32.340> with

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
we're gonna do five alternating with

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.430 
we're gonna do five alternating with
this<00:02:32.970> together<00:02:33.269> at<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> end<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.350> going

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
this together at the end so it's going

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:46.220 
this together at the end so it's going
to<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:45.120> goes<00:02:45.330> perfectly<00:02:45.840> with<00:02:46.170> a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
to be and that goes perfectly with a

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.460 
to be and that goes perfectly with a
Samba<00:02:46.800> Sean's<00:02:47.130> track<00:02:48.000> 5<00:02:48.390> I'm<00:02:48.840> dancing<00:02:49.260> drum

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
Samba Sean's track 5 I'm dancing drum

00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:23.010 
Samba Sean's track 5 I'm dancing drum
volume<00:02:49.860> 2<00:02:50.040> let's<00:02:50.700> try<00:02:50.850> it

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:37.830 

I<00:03:34.830> recommend
