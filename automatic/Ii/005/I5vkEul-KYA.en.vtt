00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.130
 My parents emigrated to America in the 1920s 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.589
 and I was born in America 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.830
 When I was six years old, my parents are back in Germany 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.829
 returns to Stuttgart 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.679
 I lived in Stuttgart 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.249
 from the age of one to six 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.679
 that was 22 years old and returned to America 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.420
 Zoo my whole education 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 except first grade in Syracuse New York 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.650
 was in Germany 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.440
 from the first class 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.070
 up to four times a studies at the Academy of Fine Arts 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.530
 I lived in Stuttgart 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
 sprach fits only cried 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 and time of course has me of course 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.140
 tremendously influenced 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 so my education happened in Germany 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 My roots are mainly in Germany 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 through my parents through my culture 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.450
 and although I live in America for over 50 years now 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.350
 and teaching and working a family 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.090
 a german sycamore maple 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.570
 tremendously important 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.110
 as in euros per pair 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.180
 my driver has me 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 Mostly on Saturday mornings for Sunday mornings 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.170
 taken by the hand and me 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.070
 through the woods and meadows and did not pack their r tell how 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.100
 Even titmice and bees caterpillars live and like the fish and frogs themselves 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.340
 develop there 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.280
 and those were always beautiful days of milk and I could be myself 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.650
 remember nowadays 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.840
 and nothing 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.900
 have deeply influenced 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.310
 my 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.350
 Art education in Germany was strongly influenced by two passions 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.790
 Mr. Kraus 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.400
 in the high school of Miro Bernerth then she has time the so-called 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.849
 in the Artothek and showed her the expressionists can spot 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.639
 Impressionists the modern art 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.439
 that was also forbidden to Bowmans 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:28.139
 about when you paint this art from the ground and in galleries and the museum 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.789
 was forbidden to show this art 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.179
 secret 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:36.059
 Mr. Kraus showed me this art at home 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.719
 and did not urge me to talk about it 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.799
 that was my little first 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.399
 that was it for the first time ever 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.399
 Dormers to make modern hero and abstract art 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:51.159
 later 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.229
 then after the war I learned to study with Professor Schneider 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.140
 PEG applied art applied force way 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:04.529
 Harrach Gray had a ca I asked Mr. Kraus 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:11.110
 What one can professionally get sick of may be applicants in the future 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.760
 and he advised me the odd thing about Professor Schneider 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.999
 Strength I study 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.249
 as a young boy 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.689
 Returned to America for 22 years 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.259
 I had the great bluish clique immediately moved to a wonderful job 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.259
 while being a graphic artist at the New York Times 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.679
 Six months later, the EU recovered to the United States 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.099
 Inter is instead on constantly 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.639
 Later I worked on the question of advertising agency focusing on pro forma advertising 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.609
 had specialized 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.419
 In this agency I developed a series of pictures 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.239
 in which I have 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.569
 Kolat rich 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.869
 used 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:59.769
 the 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.019
 Kolat I had originally learned from Schneider in Stuttgart 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.979
 One of these collages fell into the hands of Irma and Junior 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.210
 which does not feel right 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.210
 his brown bear plan b but to illustrate it 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.579
 that was my first contact to 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.310
 Pictures PD come after Brown Bear illustrated me brown bear I asked 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.580
 me something 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.949
 BASF really does make a book if not even a car approached out ahead 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.899
 if I'm not just an illustrator but also a car race 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.849
 and thus developed a hand 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.110
 I'm in one 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.460
 all the eBox 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.340
 on the Warthe 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.340
 the very Hungry Caterpillar 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.340
 was translated into 46 languages 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.729
 Hanover I have no favorite car Urdu favorite illustrator 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
 every author of every illustrator 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.800
 is that up 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.430
 shows another world 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.300
 that is 16 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.650
 very important 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.259
 it would be boring because you only one 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.259
 - are there but he knows only their grief would have 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.259
 that would be a boring world 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.289
 why this 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.069
 the IGC work museum 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.590
 for place industry their 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.089
 children's Books 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.559
 I will now 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.930
 you get older 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.930
 the collection opinion the tour is pretty big 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.099
 have been fortunate enough to be successful 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.529
 and around 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.909
 in the United States 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.490
 is there an expression at home 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.620
 secretly you deep 3 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.879
 it's time 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.740
 to return to the company 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.740
 that was the origin 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.139
 in front of my wife and me 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.979
 to form a museum 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.759
 "That was just one 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.979
 secondly why we do not give APA Nunan Japanese LS 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.330
 over two dozen 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.499
 Kintrup book seen 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:14.539
 also run 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.539
 a kick-off 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.639
 to from on the idea the runway space 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.889
 Executions were about seven years 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:33.220
 and now we have to the museum the child was 4 thousand square meters 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:34.210
 is 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.629
 from 3 galleries 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.089
 a cafe 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:41.059
 a library 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:44.059
 a study 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.110
 a theater 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.580
 That is absurd 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.809
 as for America 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.659
 a Marek 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:53.460
 "We have the name 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.240
 We have calories Heyer but not a museum to that extent for that is 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.470
 is quite unique
