TPU<00:00:23.730> cases<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.539> that's<00:00:25.170> thermal<00:00:25.769> plastic

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
TPU cases so that's thermal plastic

urethane<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.939> believe<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.390> that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
urethane and I believe is what that

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.550 
ultimate level of protection but it will
give<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.420> little<00:03:21.630> bit<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.049> then<00:03:22.230> it's<00:03:22.350> more

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
give you a little bit and then it's more

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.000 
give you a little bit and then it's more
just<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:23.040> add<00:03:23.280> some<00:03:23.580> flair<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.299> your<00:03:24.330> tablet

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
just to add some flair to your tablet

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.680 
just to add some flair to your tablet
what<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.250> about<00:03:26.280> these<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.390> they

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
what I like about these is that they

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.390 
what I like about these is that they
have<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> nice<00:03:28.080> sort<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.500> touch<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:29.040> them<00:03:29.190> when

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
have a nice sort of touch to them when

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
have a nice sort of touch to them when
you<00:03:29.489> grip<00:03:29.760> them<00:03:29.940> they're<00:03:30.090> not<00:03:30.209> really

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
you grip them they're not really

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.840 
you grip them they're not really
slippery<00:03:30.900> they're<00:03:31.680> not<00:03:31.799> super<00:03:32.070> sticky<00:03:32.670> either

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
slippery they're not super sticky either

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.490 
slippery they're not super sticky either
they're<00:03:33.090> kind<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.480> nice<00:03:33.660> balance<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.350> there

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
they're kind of a nice balance in there

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.740 
they're kind of a nice balance in there
but<00:03:35.400> they<00:03:35.489> also<00:03:35.640> don't<00:03:35.880> have<00:03:36.000> much<00:03:36.360> thickness

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
but they also don't have much thickness

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.539 
but they also don't have much thickness
so<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.530> know<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.799> pretty<00:03:37.980> thin<00:03:38.250> case

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
so and you know it's a pretty thin case

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.060 
so and you know it's a pretty thin case
and<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:40.080> giving<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.410> little<00:03:40.830> bit

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
and this is just giving you a little bit

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.800 
and this is just giving you a little bit
of<00:03:41.130> protection<00:03:41.250> for<00:03:41.730> one<00:03:42.180> thing<00:03:42.390> when<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.600> set

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
of protection for one thing when you set

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.630 
of protection for one thing when you set
something<00:03:42.959> face<00:03:43.320> down<00:03:43.560> with<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.830> TPU<00:03:44.130> case<00:03:44.430> on

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
something face down with a TPU case on

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.490 
something face down with a TPU case on
there<00:03:44.880> since<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.239> does<00:03:45.390> come<00:03:45.630> up<00:03:45.780> over<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.200> top

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
there since it does come up over the top

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.890 
there since it does come up over the top
here<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.250> does<00:03:47.430> lift<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.850> display<00:03:48.239> up<00:03:48.480> off<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
here it does lift the display up off the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.539 
here it does lift the display up off the
off<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.170> ground<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:49.830> should<00:03:50.040> avoid<00:03:50.280> some
