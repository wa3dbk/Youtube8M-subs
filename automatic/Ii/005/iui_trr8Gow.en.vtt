00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
first tutorial on how I made an origami

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.170 
first tutorial on how I made an origami
Korean<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.370> telling<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> how<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.850> make<00:00:36.090> this

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
Korean I'm telling you how to make this

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.530 
Korean I'm telling you how to make this
quite<00:00:36.390> escape<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> enable<00:00:37.680> visit<00:00:37.920> later

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
quite escape out of enable visit later

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.470 
quite escape out of enable visit later
anyway<00:00:39.540> aren't<00:00:39.719> wish<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.430> half<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
anyway aren't wish for it in half so the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.040 
anyway aren't wish for it in half so the
corners<00:00:42.840> meet<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:44.190> that's<00:00:44.399> here<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> corner

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
corners meet and that's here the corner

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
corners meet and that's here the corner
so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> thought<00:00:48.620> I'd<00:00:49.620> better<00:00:49.829> check<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> corner

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so I thought I'd better check the corner

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.069 
so I thought I'd better check the corner
and<00:00:51.660> folded<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.129> side<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.850> meet<00:00:54.809> with

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and folded so this side will meet with

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:08.780 
and folded so this side will meet with
his<00:00:55.260> box<00:00:55.530> side

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.270 

they<00:01:09.330> often<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> same

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.610 

right<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.480> little<00:01:18.810> flap<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
right to take this little flap here and

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.840 
right to take this little flap here and
make<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.120> corner<00:01:21.480> me<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.260> corner

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 

crease<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.479> up

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
crease it up

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.180 
crease it up
and<00:01:29.940> then<00:01:30.120> check<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:31.980> bit

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
and then check this this a little bit

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.210 
and then check this this a little bit
not<00:01:32.370> belong<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.610> bit<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.600> bit<00:01:33.660> I<00:01:34.220> bothered

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
not belong a bit this bit I bothered

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.750 
not belong a bit this bit I bothered
over<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.750> bit<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:40.130> follow<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.580> you

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
over the bit you just follow are you

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.350 
over the bit you just follow are you
just<00:01:42.030> folded<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.840> lap<00:01:43.610> there<00:01:44.610> Chris

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.990 

now<00:01:48.360> we've<00:01:48.720> seen<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:51.180> v-shape<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
now we've seen the v-shape and then a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.890 
now we've seen the v-shape and then a
line<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.630> down<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.810> middle<00:01:56.270> as<00:01:57.270> opposed<00:01:57.660> by

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
line going down the middle as opposed by

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.960 
line going down the middle as opposed by
far<00:01:58.230> dependent<00:01:59.040> already<00:02:00.050> so<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.760> first

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
far dependent already so this is first

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.440 
far dependent already so this is first
time<00:02:03.440> then<00:02:07.670> just<00:02:08.670> put<00:02:08.880> your<00:02:08.970> hand<00:02:09.119> underneath

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
time then just put your hand underneath

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.240 
time then just put your hand underneath
this<00:02:09.690> bit<00:02:10.490> like<00:02:11.490> this<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:16.560> side<00:02:16.860> will<00:02:17.220> be

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
this bit like this so this side will be

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.210 
this bit like this so this side will be
under<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> table<00:02:18.530> make<00:02:19.530> sure<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.890> center

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
under on the table make sure this center

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.020 
under on the table make sure this center
line<00:02:20.250> right<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.080> nicely<00:02:23.030> and

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
line right here is for this nicely and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:39.830 
line right here is for this nicely and
then<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:24.870> push<00:02:25.230> this

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.110 

so<00:02:40.840> yeah<00:02:40.990> do<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.530> again<00:02:41.770> just<00:02:42.400> push<00:02:42.940> this

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
so yeah do that again just push this

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.750 
so yeah do that again just push this
down<00:02:46.590> she's<00:02:47.590> not<00:02:47.710> not<00:02:47.860> correctly<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.610> should

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
down she's not not correctly you should

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.340 
down she's not not correctly you should
now<00:02:48.850> have<00:02:48.880> something<00:02:49.270> like<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
now have something like this that's the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.270 
now have something like this that's the
whole<00:02:50.500> 90<00:02:50.740> degree<00:02:51.160> angle<00:02:51.520> right<00:02:51.550> there<00:02:53.280> take

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
whole 90 degree angle right there take

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.330 
whole 90 degree angle right there take
the<00:02:54.520> long<00:02:54.700> bit<00:02:54.940> fine<00:02:55.210> fold<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.920> may<00:02:56.920> collapse

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the long bit fine fold it may collapse

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.230 
the long bit fine fold it may collapse
just<00:03:00.340> now<00:03:00.550> have<00:03:00.990> these<00:03:01.990> two<00:03:02.230> lines<00:03:02.500> parallel

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
just now have these two lines parallel

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.150 
just now have these two lines parallel
whoops<00:03:04.260> used<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.410> learn<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.680> be<00:03:05.770> proud<00:03:05.980> on<00:03:06.130> that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
whoops used to learn to be proud on that

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.770 
whoops used to learn to be proud on that
do<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.220> same<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.430> other<00:03:12.730> way

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.750 

and<00:03:17.320> make<00:03:17.530> sure<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:17.890> parallel<00:03:18.070> when<00:03:18.520> I<00:03:18.580> was

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
and make sure it's parallel when I was

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.350 
and make sure it's parallel when I was
folded<00:03:19.150> back<00:03:19.300> over<00:03:19.540> again

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
folded back over again

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.550 
folded back over again
all<00:03:21.320> right<00:03:21.850> now<00:03:22.850> open<00:03:23.360> all<00:03:23.570> these<00:03:23.780> myself

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.540 

that's<00:03:27.560> probably<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.010> hardest<00:03:28.040> but<00:03:28.400> you've

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
that's probably the hardest but you've

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.590 
that's probably the hardest but you've
got<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.790> try<00:03:28.970> make<00:03:29.240> it<00:03:29.930> up<00:03:30.080> by<00:03:30.440> trying<00:03:30.680> Paul<00:03:31.600> the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
got to try make it up by trying Paul the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:56.030 
got to try make it up by trying Paul the
each<00:03:32.810> line<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:33.920> W<00:03:34.670> right<00:03:35.330> here
