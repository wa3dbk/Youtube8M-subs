okay so we're going to use some

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.209 
okay so we're going to use some
techniques<00:00:07.089> to<00:00:07.389> help<00:00:07.809> with<00:00:07.929> leg<00:00:08.139> cramps<00:00:08.650> these

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
are similar to some of the techniques

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.390 
are similar to some of the techniques
that<00:00:10.930> we've<00:00:11.139> used<00:00:11.320> already<00:00:11.559> some<00:00:12.099> of<00:00:12.160> them<00:00:12.280> are

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
that we've used already some of them are

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.029 
that we've used already some of them are
and<00:00:12.639> some<00:00:12.820> aren't<00:00:13.000> and<00:00:13.270> they're<00:00:14.109> very<00:00:14.559> simple

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
and some aren't and they're very simple

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.970 
and some aren't and they're very simple
and<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:16.630> basic<00:00:17.109> rule<00:00:17.260> of<00:00:17.289> thumb<00:00:17.590> with<00:00:17.769> leg

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
and one basic rule of thumb with leg

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.970 
and one basic rule of thumb with leg
cramps<00:00:18.490> is<00:00:18.840> sometimes<00:00:19.840> just<00:00:20.080> resting<00:00:20.710> is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
cramps is sometimes just resting is

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.820 
cramps is sometimes just resting is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
sufficient and you know if you get in

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.140 
sufficient and you know if you get in
there<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.100> try<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.250> massage<00:00:24.610> somebody<00:00:24.850> too

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
have leg cramps because too much

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.130 
have leg cramps because too much
pressure<00:02:19.040> may<00:02:19.489> make<00:02:19.670> them<00:02:19.819> cause<00:02:20.000> make<00:02:20.959> them

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
pressure may make them cause make them

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.650 
pressure may make them cause make them
cramp<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:22.160> little<00:02:22.519> bit<00:02:22.610> more<00:02:23.769> okay<00:02:24.769> so<00:02:25.660> those

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
cramp a little bit more okay so those
