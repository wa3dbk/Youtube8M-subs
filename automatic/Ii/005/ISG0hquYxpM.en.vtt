00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.640
 great adventure you have again 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.510
 experienced because milk milk milk is good 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.510
 for each 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.209
 every half you get the first milk from the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.829
 mother cow the colostrum every baby will 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.950
 and dance calf is big enough 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.750
 gets it just lumps and goes the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.560
 rest of the milk 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.560
 straight to the factory 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.859
 a cow swallows a bite of grass in the one 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.269
 continue without chewing then it comes 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.920
 in the tripe 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.040
 here all the boundaries are made small 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.049
 when the tripe is full the gas comes back in 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.760
 the mouth fits the second time 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.069
 finely chewed the grass 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.780
 therefore my cows and also ruminants 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.670
 the finely chewed grass 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.450
 spirit of through to the net stomach and the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:38.709
 rest of the stomach and it with a lot of it 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.230
 This once interviewed you all 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.769
 oh yeah this is for the night 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.930
 this is corn and grass and they mixed 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.209
 get around 10 pounds of corn and 12 pounds 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.169
 grass and that is all needed for one 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.629
 glass of milk 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.310
 that's all needed at night too 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.930
 so the cows get some food for the cows 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.669
 before she has prepared 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.540
 but during the day when the ladies prefer nothing 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.949
 then in the meadow stand in the feed is a 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.930
 nutritious parts 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.180
 if all the fodder has been consumed incumbent 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.590
 nutritious parts and in the blood 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.530
 this blood also flows through the thousands 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.359
 small blood vessels in the onions this small 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.829
 blood vessels give fluff milk 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.470
 nutrients 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.090
 here a cow has a lot in the 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.030
 milk fluff becomes the nutritious parts 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.780
 converted to milk and when it's time to 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.639
 milking 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.639
 beach him four the teat outside 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.570
 think in this knot 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.570
 here all fresh milk will leave you 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.100
 also a great win 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.160
 here can pack a lot of night 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.050
 be made say 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.150
 feeding after the calf and what 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.440
 power and drops to the factory with this 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.880
 tank truck 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.560
 in the factory it comes neatly in one 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.620
 park so you can get the milk at home 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.620
 drink
