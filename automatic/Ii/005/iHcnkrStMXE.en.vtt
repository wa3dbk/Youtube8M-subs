00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.950
 that you are sitting here now and German 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.660
 That's what I would have a few ago 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280
 years can not imagine that either 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.080
 but it is very nice that you do that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.820
 you have locked yourself against it for so long 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.369
 if I still remember it now 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.220
 how many years you are dealing with this too 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.090
 what is already title in america 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.340
 to produce 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.090
 to work on it and all about it 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.920
 heap casts 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.410
 then to sing German then thought 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.759
 I'm a madman 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 Nick with you 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.099
 when at what point do you have that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.320
 decided after my song wants that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.700
 exchange concert has taken place elisa 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.570
 test in german can be but one 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.660
 to make a whole lot 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.789
 the one is to say that this one 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.520
 world where you in different studios gs 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.949
 with different people work is behind 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.230
 america is there just this 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.850
 Sound I've got in last 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 Five years ago I was much America 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.000
 i was los angeles and have the time 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 spent and i can contact one 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.210
 situation remember where i am on the street 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.129
 stand and my husband and relatively clear 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.680
 Once upon a time the message was that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.939
 brings everything nothing, I'm not here 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.320
 which I substance not come around here 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.780
 a core is all great 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 it sounds great it sounds like i am 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.549
 huge studios but I 'm not coming 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.049
 to focus on that and on 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.479
 my inner voice to hear that me 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.130
 I'm too distracted here but I have to 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 we bring all this great 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.220
 star producers hynix i need that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.320
 I'll make enough myself 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.720
 had hits and and great big ones 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.670
 stories worked with great people 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.649
 but so far I have to know what 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 now in me is because i do not come to it 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.250
 to listen and that was the first one 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 That was the first time I realized 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.710
 have to write yourself 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.360
 I have to tell my own stories 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.430
 So I started writing 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.750
 Do that and in English first 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.990
 Then came the moment where I put it in mine 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.759
 song and then became 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.630
 hamper very much and that 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.500
 feedback was always more 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.180
 try it in german you have 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.469
 already considered and if I am myself 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 finally more or less by chance 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.350
 Or or more, feel free to whiz out 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.539
 met ulf summer and thus peter von 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.680
 rose pride through a mutual friend 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.420
 have been introduced to us 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.200
 met in the studio and have only once 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.580
 written a song 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 It has become very great is the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.310
 first song on the album with full 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.110
 hands 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.660
 if I 'm to waste myself with 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.160
 full hands and it was nice it has 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.050
 I felt well and I felt good 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.420
 thought human is whether it is beautiful here 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.560
 with the boys a good chemistry us 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.000
 arrive next week 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.010
 if you hit it again and still 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.209
 time and again and so is one after 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.310
 the other arose and we had 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.239
 when you're watching this inspiration school 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.519
 told a milked 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.239
 we notice that something happens between us 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.239
 in the room
