00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
back to life in this video I'm using a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.180 
back to life in this video I'm using a
standard<00:02:33.720> gas<00:02:33.900> forge<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.500> many<00:02:34.709> farriers

use it's convenient to use and produces
a<00:02:37.920> quick<00:02:38.190> heat<00:02:38.430> source

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
a quick heat source

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.990 
a quick heat source
they'll<00:02:39.540> also<00:02:39.810> quickly<00:02:40.380> heat<00:02:40.560> metal<00:02:41.000> although

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
they'll also quickly heat metal although

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.670 
they'll also quickly heat metal although
I<00:02:42.060> still<00:02:42.120> use<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.570> code<00:02:42.870> for<00:02:43.079> which<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.350> certain

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
I still use a code for which on certain

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
I still use a code for which on certain
occasions<00:02:43.820> like<00:02:44.820> when<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> make<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.480> horseshoe

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
occasions like when I make the horseshoe

occasions like when I make the horseshoe

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.460 
welding process and coal heats the metal
harder<00:02:50.850> than<00:02:51.000> my<00:02:51.120> gas<00:02:51.299> Forge<00:02:51.630> does<00:02:51.900> which<00:02:52.440> is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
harder than my gas Forge does which is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:02.170 
harder than my gas Forge does which is
necessary<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.130> do<00:02:53.250> forward<00:02:53.579> welding

from recycled horseshoes you can see
