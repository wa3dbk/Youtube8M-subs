disappointed<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> batting

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
disappointed with that batting

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
disappointed with that batting
performance<00:01:18.900> particularly<00:01:19.860> seeing

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
performance particularly seeing

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.760 
performance particularly seeing
Tendulkar<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.119> such<00:01:21.420> good<00:01:21.630> form<00:01:21.960> he<00:01:22.650> was

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
Tendulkar was in such good form he was

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.770 
Tendulkar was in such good form he was
playing<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.280> confidently<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.150> aggressively

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
playing so confidently and aggressively

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
playing so confidently and aggressively
but<00:01:25.170> Wiggins<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.740> kept<00:01:25.979> falling<00:01:26.189> at<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
but Wiggins just kept falling at the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.789 
but Wiggins just kept falling at the
other<00:01:26.729> end<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.240> sooner<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.600> later

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
other end and sooner or later

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.039 
other end and sooner or later
that<00:01:29.219> will<00:01:29.729> deflate<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> best<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.659> batsmen

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that will deflate the best of batsmen

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.529 
that will deflate the best of batsmen
and<00:01:31.289> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.679> that<00:01:31.859> contributed<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> 10

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
and I think that contributed to 10

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:34.669 
and I think that contributed to 10
dogmas<00:01:33.899> downfall

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
dogmas downfall

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.279 
dogmas downfall
so<00:01:34.859> at<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> moment<00:01:35.869> Australia<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> bit<00:01:37.200> of

an upsurge and India are going to have
to<00:01:40.020> turn<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.259> around<00:01:40.469> pretty<00:01:40.950> quickly<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to turn that around pretty quickly and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.849 
to turn that around pretty quickly and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it around in the next few days before

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.309 
it around in the next few days before
Sydney<00:01:56.880> oh<00:01:57.119> yeah<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> mean<00:01:58.170> they're

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
Sydney oh yeah I mean they're

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.520 
Sydney oh yeah I mean they're
experienced<00:01:58.860> enough<00:01:59.069> to<00:01:59.219> turn<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> around

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
experienced enough to turn it around

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.050 
experienced enough to turn it around
yeah<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> problem<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.729> you're<00:02:02.909> talking

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
yeah but the problem is you're talking

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.350 
yeah but the problem is you're talking
about<00:02:03.329> older<00:02:03.780> players<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.149> gets

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
about older players and and it gets

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300 
about older players and and it gets
harder<00:02:06.720> for<00:02:06.869> them<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.259> turn<00:02:07.829> things<00:02:08.069> around

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
harder for them to turn things around

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.809 
harder for them to turn things around
and<00:02:09.030> Dravid<00:02:09.569> would<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:10.130> would<00:02:11.130> be<00:02:11.160> mortified

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and Dravid would be would be mortified

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.910 
and Dravid would be would be mortified
to<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.150> bowled<00:02:12.420> three<00:02:12.540> times<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.500> one<00:02:13.650> go

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
to be bowled three times in the one go

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.530 
to be bowled three times in the one go
obviously<00:02:14.700> one<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.910> them<00:02:15.120> didn't<00:02:15.390> count

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
obviously one of them didn't count

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.380 
obviously one of them didn't count
because<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.049> was<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> no<00:02:16.410> ball<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.390> heavier

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
because it was a no ball but heavier

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.870 
because it was a no ball but heavier
sticks<00:02:19.310> disturbed<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.519> three<00:02:20.760> occasions

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
sticks disturbed on three occasions

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.030 
sticks disturbed on three occasions
particularly<00:02:21.810> when<00:02:22.140> your<00:02:22.260> nickname<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
particularly when your nickname is the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.809 
particularly when your nickname is the
wall<00:02:24.230> after<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.319> first<00:02:25.560> cities<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.610> was

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
wall after the first cities that it was

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.150 
wall after the first cities that it was
probably<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.209> case<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.720> one<00:02:28.470> more<00:02:28.709> brick<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
probably a case of one more brick in the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.009 
probably a case of one more brick in the
wall<00:02:29.190> maybe<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.849> two<00:02:30.120> more<00:02:30.360> bricks<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
wall maybe it's two more bricks in the

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.740 
wall maybe it's two more bricks in the
wall<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.650> fill<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:31.950> hole<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.850> they've<00:02:33.540> got

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
wall to fill that hole so they've got

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.059 
wall to fill that hole so they've got
some<00:02:33.930> things<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:35.220> consider<00:02:35.609> and

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
some things to to consider and

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.190 
some things to to consider and
they<00:02:37.790> are<00:02:38.299> going<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.659> to<00:02:38.810> turn<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.140> around

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
they are going to have to turn it around

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.289 
they are going to have to turn it around
very<00:02:39.409> quickly<00:02:39.739> in<00:02:40.069> Sydney<00:02:40.430> because<00:02:40.579> Australia

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
very quickly in Sydney because Australia

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.929 
very quickly in Sydney because Australia
are<00:02:41.689> on<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.930> bit<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.319> roll<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.939> fastballs

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
are on a bit of a roll the fastballs

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.030 
are on a bit of a roll the fastballs
have<00:02:44.239> got<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.599> upper<00:02:44.900> hand<00:02:44.930> with<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.709> Indian

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
have got the upper hand with the Indian

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.069 
have got the upper hand with the Indian
batsman<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.819> it<00:02:47.060> takes<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:47.420> bit<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.629> turn<00:02:47.900> that

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
batsman and it takes a bit to turn that

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.679 
batsman and it takes a bit to turn that
around<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:49.310> fastball<00:02:49.879> was<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.299> was<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
around and the fastball was it was it

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.179 
around and the fastball was it was it
was<00:02:50.810> all<00:02:50.930> about<00:02:51.109> you<00:02:51.319> know<00:02:51.409> building<00:02:51.950> pressure

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
was all about you know building pressure

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.860 
was all about you know building pressure
and<00:02:52.519> from<00:02:52.849> both<00:02:52.999> ends<00:02:53.269> there<00:02:53.540> was<00:02:53.629> there<00:02:53.810> were

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
and from both ends there was there were

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.959 
and from both ends there was there were
very<00:02:54.109> few<00:02:54.139> as<00:02:54.859> poor<00:02:55.280> periods<00:02:55.670> from<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
very few as poor periods from the

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.229 
very few as poor periods from the
Australian<00:02:56.269> bowlers<00:02:56.569> in<00:02:56.629> the<00:02:56.719> second<00:02:57.049> innings

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
Australian bowlers in the second innings

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.059 
Australian bowlers in the second innings
is<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.420> something<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.810> they<00:03:00.739> might<00:03:00.920> be<00:03:01.040> a

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
is that something that they might be a

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.800 
is that something that they might be a
bit<00:03:01.189> up<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.459> down<00:03:01.549> being<00:03:01.939> a<00:03:02.060> developing<00:03:02.659> sort

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
bit up and down being a developing sort

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.699 
bit up and down being a developing sort
of<00:03:02.870> attack

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
of attack

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.039 
of attack
I<00:03:03.739> think<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.400> consistency<00:03:04.790> they<00:03:05.510> showed<00:03:05.840> in

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
I think the consistency they showed in

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.220 
I think the consistency they showed in
Melbourne<00:03:06.499> was<00:03:07.400> very<00:03:07.730> encouraging<00:03:08.389> they

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
Melbourne was very encouraging they

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.589 
Melbourne was very encouraging they
maintained<00:03:09.919> a<00:03:10.250> very<00:03:10.430> good<00:03:10.879> line<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.209> length

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
maintained a very good line in length

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.119 
maintained a very good line in length
and<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.870> was<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.019> very<00:03:12.260> attacking<00:03:12.859> very

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
and it was a very attacking very

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.689 
and it was a very attacking very
aggressive<00:03:14.079> violently<00:03:15.079> a<00:03:15.650> bit<00:03:16.129> fuller<00:03:16.400> than

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:16.699 
aggressive violently a bit fuller than

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.569 
aggressive violently a bit fuller than
perhaps<00:03:17.409> what<00:03:18.409> we've<00:03:18.590> seen<00:03:18.799> from<00:03:19.010> Australian

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
perhaps what we've seen from Australian

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.199 
perhaps what we've seen from Australian
bowlers<00:03:20.030> recently<00:03:20.659> so<00:03:21.489> yeah<00:03:22.489> if<00:03:22.849> you<00:03:23.030> can

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
bowlers recently so yeah if you can

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.229 
bowlers recently so yeah if you can
maintain<00:03:23.659> it<00:03:24.049> for<00:03:24.949> a<00:03:24.980> full<00:03:25.219> game<00:03:25.519> there's<00:03:26.090> no

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
maintain it for a full game there's no

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.420 
maintain it for a full game there's no
reason<00:03:26.659> why<00:03:26.780> they<00:03:26.959> can't<00:03:27.139> turn<00:03:27.889> around<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.340> do

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
reason why they can't turn around and do

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.420 
reason why they can't turn around and do
it<00:03:28.459> again<00:03:28.609> in<00:03:28.879> Sydney<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:30.129> where<00:03:31.129> do<00:03:31.370> you

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
it again in Sydney and where do you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.970 
it again in Sydney and where do you
think<00:03:31.549> this<00:03:31.699> match<00:03:32.299> was<00:03:32.629> won<00:03:33.109> or<00:03:33.319> lost<00:03:33.500> from

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
think this match was won or lost from

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.360 
think this match was won or lost from
India's<00:03:34.250> perspective<00:03:34.790> was<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.180> was<00:03:35.659> about

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
India's perspective was it was about

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.069 
India's perspective was it was about
that<00:03:37.370> spellin<00:03:37.819> in<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.150> indian<00:03:38.540> first<00:03:38.750> innings

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
that spellin in the indian first innings

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.839 
that spellin in the indian first innings
where<00:03:39.230> they<00:03:39.379> muster<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.859> flurry<00:03:40.129> of<00:03:40.219> wickets

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
where they muster a flurry of wickets

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.759 
where they muster a flurry of wickets
well<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.569> think<00:03:41.840> there<00:03:41.959> were<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.079> few<00:03:42.349> spots

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
well I think there were a few spots

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.610 
well I think there were a few spots
where<00:03:43.150> where<00:03:44.150> India<00:03:45.040> lost<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:47.229> it<00:03:48.229> was<00:03:48.439> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
where where India lost it but it was the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.800 
where where India lost it but it was the
approach<00:03:48.979> that<00:03:49.400> lost<00:03:49.729> to<00:03:49.879> Fulham<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.329> think<00:03:50.629> in

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
approach that lost to Fulham I think in

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.249 
approach that lost to Fulham I think in
the<00:03:51.109> fact<00:03:51.349> that<00:03:51.470> in<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.549> first<00:03:52.579> innings<00:03:53.259> they

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:54.259 
the fact that in the first innings they

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.679 
the fact that in the first innings they
they<00:03:54.470> don't<00:03:55.340> need<00:03:55.489> tends<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:56.060> go<00:03:56.419> on<00:03:56.569> a

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
they don't need tends to go on a

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.509 
they don't need tends to go on a
defensive<00:03:57.229> when<00:03:57.889> you've<00:03:58.009> got<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.340> lower

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
defensive when you've got the lower

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.309 
defensive when you've got the lower
order<00:03:58.849> players<00:03:59.120> there<00:03:59.419> and<00:03:59.780> if<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.989> look<00:04:00.139> at

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
order players there and if you look at

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.170 
order players there and if you look at
the<00:04:00.409> lower<00:04:00.650> order<00:04:01.009> runs<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.549> were<00:04:01.729> scored<00:04:02.060> in

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
the lower order runs that were scored in

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.659 
the lower order runs that were scored in
the<00:04:02.269> first<00:04:02.509> innings<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.049> then<00:04:03.639> really<00:04:04.639> I

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
the first innings and then really I

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.420 
the first innings and then really I
think<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.359> final<00:04:05.780> day<00:04:05.989> went<00:04:06.709> downhill<00:04:06.979> for

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
think the final day went downhill for

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.520 
think the final day went downhill for
India<00:04:07.790> right<00:04:08.359> from<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.720> start<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.199> mean<00:04:09.409> they

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
India right from the start I mean they

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.020 
India right from the start I mean they
had<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.680> wonderful<00:04:09.979> opportunity<00:04:10.310> with

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
had a wonderful opportunity with

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.999 
had a wonderful opportunity with
Pattinson<00:04:11.569> on<00:04:11.689> strike<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.500> finish<00:04:12.829> that

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:13.009 
Pattinson on strike to finish that

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.580 
Pattinson on strike to finish that
innings<00:04:13.370> really<00:04:13.879> quickly<00:04:14.299> but<00:04:14.870> Dhoni<00:04:15.169> for

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
innings really quickly but Dhoni for

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.830 
innings really quickly but Dhoni for
some<00:04:15.859> strange<00:04:16.220> reason<00:04:16.400> took<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.120> very<00:04:17.419> very

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
some strange reason took a very very

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.469 
some strange reason took a very very
conservative<00:04:18.739> approach<00:04:19.130> he<00:04:19.639> pushed<00:04:19.969> fielders

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
conservative approach he pushed fielders

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.719 
conservative approach he pushed fielders
back<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:21.109> mean<00:04:21.680> as<00:04:21.829> soon<00:04:22.009> as<00:04:22.159> you<00:04:22.280> start<00:04:22.550> giving

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
back I mean as soon as you start giving

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.149 
back I mean as soon as you start giving
away<00:04:23.060> easy<00:04:23.389> runs<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.139> you<00:04:24.289> don't<00:04:24.620> attack<00:04:24.949> the

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
away easy runs and you don't attack the

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.820 
away easy runs and you don't attack the
opposition<00:04:25.820> then<00:04:26.599> you<00:04:27.229> let<00:04:27.830> them<00:04:28.009> have<00:04:28.219> them

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
opposition then you let them have them

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.760 
opposition then you let them have them
and<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.669> put<00:04:29.970> India<00:04:30.419> on<00:04:30.569> the<00:04:30.690> back<00:04:30.870> foot<00:04:31.199> and

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
and it put India on the back foot and

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.309 
and it put India on the back foot and
and<00:04:32.699> they<00:04:32.849> really<00:04:33.180> never<00:04:33.360> ever<00:04:33.599> recovered<00:04:34.199> it

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
and they really never ever recovered it

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.290 
and they really never ever recovered it
was<00:04:34.440> just<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.800> downhill<00:04:35.039> slide<00:04:35.550> than<00:04:35.819> that<00:04:36.030> and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
was just a downhill slide than that and

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.510 
was just a downhill slide than that and
and<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.990> me<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.530> was<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.770> pattern<00:04:38.250> set<00:04:38.490> by

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
and to me that was the pattern set by

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.020 
and to me that was the pattern set by
the<00:04:38.759> captain<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:40.099> it<00:04:41.099> just<00:04:41.370> permeated<00:04:41.819> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
the captain and it just permeated the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.999 
the captain and it just permeated the
whole<00:04:42.060> team<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:43.289> mentioned<00:04:43.620> what<00:04:43.740> India

whole team you mentioned what India

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.680 
whole team you mentioned what India
might<00:04:44.190> need<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.490> do<00:04:44.639> before<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.120> Sydney<00:04:45.330> test

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
might need to do before the Sydney test

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.170 
might need to do before the Sydney test
Australia<00:04:46.289> in<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:47.069> second<00:04:47.699> innings<00:04:47.909> that<00:04:48.030> was

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
concerns with the Australian batting and

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.649 
concerns with the Australian batting and
that<00:04:57.840> that's<00:04:58.169> far<00:04:58.500> from<00:04:58.710> big<00:04:59.490> stuff<00:04:59.759> but

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
that that's far from big stuff but

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.089 
that that's far from big stuff but
they'll<00:05:00.870> be<00:05:00.990> encouraged<00:05:01.470> by<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.710> fact<00:05:02.009> that

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
they'll be encouraged by the fact that

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.700 
they'll be encouraged by the fact that
that<00:05:02.430> now<00:05:03.000> looks<00:05:03.389> like<00:05:03.659> there's<00:05:04.530> some

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
that now looks like there's some

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.770 
that now looks like there's some
consistency<00:05:05.099> there<00:05:05.699> with<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:05.970> attack<00:05:06.300> they

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
consistency there with the attack they

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.499 
consistency there with the attack they
know<00:05:07.080> they<00:05:07.409> can<00:05:07.710> they<00:05:08.340> can<00:05:08.520> bowl<00:05:08.729> India<00:05:09.210> out

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
for yeah for reasonable scores that also

for yeah for reasonable scores that also
tends<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.169> give<00:05:13.409> a<00:05:13.440> bit<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.740> confidence<00:05:14.069> to<00:05:14.400> the

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
tends to give a bit of confidence to the

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.820 
tends to give a bit of confidence to the
batting<00:05:14.909> lineup<00:05:15.360> because<00:05:15.870> suddenly<00:05:16.590> the

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.930 
the conditions favor either side well I
think<00:05:37.080> it'll<00:05:37.650> be<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:38.219> little<00:05:38.460> bit<00:05:38.610> more<00:05:39.800> for

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
think it'll be a little bit more for

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.249 
think it'll be a little bit more for
India's<00:05:41.940> liking<00:05:42.389> I<00:05:42.479> think<00:05:42.780> there'll<00:05:42.930> be<00:05:42.960> a<00:05:43.050> bit

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
India's liking I think there'll be a bit

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.980 
India's liking I think there'll be a bit
more<00:05:43.409> encouragement<00:05:44.099> for<00:05:44.250> spin<00:05:44.960> there<00:05:45.960> I

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
more encouragement for spin there I

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.990 
more encouragement for spin there I
thought<00:05:46.469> their<00:05:46.650> quick<00:05:46.889> attack<00:05:47.370> Bob<00:05:47.639> pretty

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
thought their quick attack Bob pretty

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.689 
thought their quick attack Bob pretty
well<00:05:48.300> but<00:05:49.169> they<00:05:49.440> just<00:05:49.770> you<00:05:50.190> know<00:05:50.219> they<00:05:50.460> let

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
well but they just you know they let

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.089 
well but they just you know they let
Australia<00:05:51.300> off<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.719> hook<00:05:51.930> late<00:05:52.710> in<00:05:52.919> the

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
Australia off the hook late in the

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.180 
Australia off the hook late in the
innings<00:05:53.400> in<00:05:54.120> both<00:05:54.389> innings<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.469> that's<00:05:55.770> not

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
innings in both innings and that's not

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.740 
innings in both innings and that's not
down<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.669> bowlers<00:05:57.060> that's<00:05:57.270> down<00:05:57.509> to<00:05:57.539> the

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
down to the bowlers that's down to the

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.830 
down to the bowlers that's down to the
captain<00:05:58.169> so<00:05:58.979> I<00:05:59.009> think<00:05:59.190> that's<00:05:59.639> one<00:06:00.000> area<00:06:00.449> where

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
captain so I think that's one area where

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.570 
captain so I think that's one area where
they've<00:06:01.050> got<00:06:01.349> to<00:06:01.380> they've<00:06:02.069> got<00:06:02.190> to<00:06:02.310> change

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
they've got to they've got to change

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.659 
they've got to they've got to change
their<00:06:03.120> approach<00:06:03.569> and<00:06:03.949> as<00:06:04.949> I<00:06:04.979> say<00:06:05.279> they've<00:06:05.490> got

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
their approach and as I say they've got

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.020 
their approach and as I say they've got
it<00:06:05.789> I<00:06:05.969> think<00:06:06.000> they've<00:06:06.360> got<00:06:06.479> a<00:06:06.539> major

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
it I think they've got a major

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.280 
it I think they've got a major
problem<00:06:07.300> at<00:06:07.420> the<00:06:07.510> top<00:06:07.660> of<00:06:07.810> their<00:06:07.930> batting

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
problem at the top of their batting

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.140 
problem at the top of their batting
