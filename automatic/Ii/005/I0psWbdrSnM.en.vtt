00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.950
 and how is a new good tomorrow? 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.990
 my dear and welcome to one 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.059
 new video of me and that we do 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.440
 Today again something delicious we do 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.269
 today a cake and one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 so-called beta cake 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.109
 how it all works 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.080
 actually the same and there was a lot of fun 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.640
 since our baking is broken you will 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.619
 to preheat the first one 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.119
 Of course you can do that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.830
 offers you the best way to work 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.230
 but with us 15 longer that is namely 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.469
 broken or broken roof 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.140
 and to them we can preheat to 150 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.829
 Grad so with us is still only 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.570
 upper lower heat so below 185 degrees 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.100
 adjust where for the coup you too 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.739
 the following as already shown, of course 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.950
 a cup of yogurt I have here now 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.590
 low-fat yogurt 1.5 percent you can 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.219
 but certainly also accept the 35 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:00.420
 then I have flour sugar then what cacau 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.390
 2 eggs is then right Kaiser natron 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.990
 brought back soda and butter naturally 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.670
 still a bowl and a baking pan like that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.979
 I take butter from the mother now 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 need 175 grams but you can also 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.890
 margarine I'll take the now 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.060
 make the butter a bit soft in the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.930
 Microwave so I better 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.119
 can handle 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.130
 I will also use the baking molds 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.450
 a little bit that it's not stuck button 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.470
 just a small piece of butter 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.470
 and then rub it around 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.020
 so first of all comes this whole 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.120
 mug of yogurt in the shots and this one 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.010
 mug will continue to be ours 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.390
 dosage be help so have the bite 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.760
 I now rinsed and the cup 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.760
 now one of the 24 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.530
 so then we still need sugar in the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:04.570
 recipe was at the trap but a 1 0 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:11.680
 be enough to what the zuckerhut yet 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:13.720
 a fat then 2 1 are there where 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.620
 then you need to get back cacau 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.390
 then you need two tablespoons 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.330
 still are and the team arrives 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:28.000
 teaspoon purely also still a 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.440
 teaspoon of soda and still the butter like that 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.060
 That's it, that's it 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.350
 still stir sonek style is coming 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.350
 Of course, now in denbach before 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.830
 so the cake comes naturally in the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:57.920
 oven at 185 degrees above bottom 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.140
 for 65 minutes recipe is on no 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.400
 case the door has risen extremely 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.250
 I wanted to recognize something I can 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.549
 do not open up the extremely risen 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.640
 is 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:17.870
 because we have such a clean oven mum 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:21.769
 has the oven totally nice but twelve 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.500
 minutes then it's done well out of Gutach 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.230
 so explore now is done now 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.079
 beep so theoretical he is now 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.430
 through that robert revealed that he 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.160
 through is so there you just have to 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.329
 so stick a wooden stick if 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.079
 nothing gets stuck then he is 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.629
 I have six now 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.950
 minutes in it at 200 degrees must 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.140
 you look to see if control 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.480
 maybe it was the air of 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.970
 40 minutes but with us the call goes 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.519
 Let's see how it tastes like me 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.109
 I also crashed everything 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.829
 worked well not broken apart 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.060
 Yeah, there's everything and I'm right now 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.500
 I'll think about this now 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.950
 to supervise the couverture that was now 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.540
 Although are not so close 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.280
 leave because the mum tell everyone 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.620
 case I have that it was the birthday 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.000
 the cake a bit darker I do not know 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.650
 if he really did become like that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.739
 Also a birthday was the super delicious 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.349
 as I said for the first time the bug and me 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.459
 I'm still full of couverture 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:22.039
 fridge in the closet 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.300
 so there should someone has a turkish case 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.180
 I'll still shows the 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.479
 then the triggering couture is the closet 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.039
 he still extremely chocolate so therefore the 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.110
 is now absolutely up optional 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.210
 how it works is he just in 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.289
 Dissolve water bath and then over it 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.150
 protect it so i have it beautiful 1 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.639
 classified as far as it went on the edge 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.310
 it's just not that aggressive and 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.780
 with the ass or berlin have one 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.780
 take a crouch 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:09.460
 there to do dam 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.370
 weekly flies through the chocolate
