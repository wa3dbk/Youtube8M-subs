yes<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.579> did<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.060> couple<00:02:03.180> days<00:02:03.329> ago

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
yes I did get it a couple days ago

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.999 
yes I did get it a couple days ago
because<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.899> got<00:02:04.049> one<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.290> those<00:02:04.350> early<00:02:04.770> pass

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
because I got one of those early pass

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.969 
because I got one of those early pass
codes<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> normally<00:02:06.659> comes<00:02:06.990> out<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
codes but it normally comes out like the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.669 
codes but it normally comes out like the
beta<00:02:08.190> if<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> got<00:02:08.580> Bulletstorm<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
beta if you got Bulletstorm and if you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.959 
beta if you got Bulletstorm and if you
half<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.890> code<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.250> Bulletstorm<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:11.879> you

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
half the code for Bulletstorm then you

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.759 
half the code for Bulletstorm then you
can<00:02:12.090> play<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.299> in<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> couple<00:02:12.629> days<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.590> if<00:02:13.680> you

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
can play it in a couple days but if you

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.289 
can play it in a couple days but if you
just<00:02:13.920> pre-ordered<00:02:14.159> gears<00:02:14.700> you're<00:02:14.939> gonna<00:02:15.060> have

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
just pre-ordered gears you're gonna have

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.869 
just pre-ordered gears you're gonna have
to<00:02:15.480> wait<00:02:15.659> a<00:02:15.719> while<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.230> think<00:02:16.469> it's<00:02:16.829> like<00:02:17.099> what
