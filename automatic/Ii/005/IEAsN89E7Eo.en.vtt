00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
how you do that and then you're gonna

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.640 
how you do that and then you're gonna
want<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.090> push<00:02:29.420> all<00:02:29.569> your<00:02:29.599> bands<00:02:29.930> down<00:02:30.230> again

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
and just keep on doing this of the whole

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.699 
and just keep on doing this of the whole
way<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.220> do<00:02:34.519> your<00:02:34.549> bracelet<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.959> have<00:02:36.319> to<00:02:36.530> do

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
way you do your bracelet so I have to do

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.490 
way you do your bracelet so I have to do
an<00:02:36.920> inverted<00:02:37.579> so<00:02:38.329> if<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.540> do<00:02:38.840> two<00:02:39.049> colors<00:02:39.380> is

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
an inverted so if you do two colors is

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.740 
an inverted so if you do two colors is
easier<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:39.920> remember<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:41.120> for<00:02:41.390> me<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
easier to remember that so for me the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.539 
easier to remember that so for me the
red<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.139> go<00:02:42.260> invert<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.889> then<00:02:43.100> normal

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
red you go invert it and then normal

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.920 
red you go invert it and then normal
fishtail<00:02:44.180> braid<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.690> then<00:02:46.269> for<00:02:47.269> orange<00:02:47.720> you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
fishtail braid and then for orange you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.340 
fishtail braid and then for orange you
would<00:02:48.079> do<00:02:48.549> fishtail<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:50.120> then<00:02:50.870> invert

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
would do fishtail and then invert

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.440 
would do fishtail and then invert
fishtail<00:02:51.980> as<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:52.850> see<00:02:53.030> i'm<00:02:53.150> going<00:02:53.329> to<00:02:53.389> be

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
fishtail as you can see i'm going to be

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.199 
fishtail as you can see i'm going to be
doing<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.840> right<00:02:54.230> now<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.819> really

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
doing that right now and it's really

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.910 
doing that right now and it's really
really<00:02:56.569> simple<00:02:56.600> this<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.620> one<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.769> the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
really simple this is one of the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.349 
really simple this is one of the
simplest<00:02:58.220> bracelets<00:02:58.819> what<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.090> looks<00:02:59.239> like

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
simplest bracelets what it looks like

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.900 
simplest bracelets what it looks like
it's<00:02:59.540> really<00:02:59.930> hard<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.410> make<00:03:00.519> when<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:01.700> wear

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
it's really hard to make when you wear

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.990 
it's really hard to make when you wear
it<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.079> you<00:03:03.170> do<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.319> fishtail<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:04.069> then

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
it so then you do a fishtail and then

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.800 
it so then you do a fishtail and then
inverted<00:03:05.600> fishtail<00:03:07.359> which<00:03:08.359> if<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.780> don't

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
inverted fishtail which if you don't

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.020 
inverted fishtail which if you don't
know<00:03:09.049> again<00:03:09.380> I'm<00:03:09.680> gonna<00:03:09.889> say<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.670> pull<00:03:10.880> back

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
know again I'm gonna say you pull back

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.750 
know again I'm gonna say you pull back
the<00:03:11.150> middle<00:03:11.359> band<00:03:11.480> grab<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.900> bottom<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.760> then

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
the middle band grab the bottom and then

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.420 
the middle band grab the bottom and then
pick<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.569> top<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:15.049> was<00:03:15.799> having<00:03:16.069> troubles

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
pick to the top I was having troubles

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.430 
pick to the top I was having troubles
because<00:03:16.609> my<00:03:16.850> bands<00:03:17.239> weren't<00:03:17.510> stretching<00:03:18.290> far

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
because my bands weren't stretching far

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:35.120 
because my bands weren't stretching far
enough<00:03:18.650> for<00:03:18.859> me<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.040> grab<00:03:19.220> them

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.090 

then<00:03:36.120> once<00:03:36.630> you're<00:03:36.780> done<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.860> will<00:03:37.980> look

then once you're done it will look

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.530 
then once you're done it will look
something<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.210> I'm<00:03:39.300> just<00:03:39.450> going
