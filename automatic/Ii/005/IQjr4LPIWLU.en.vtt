00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.450 
it seems like there are a number of
recurring<00:01:28.439> themes<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> show

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

recurring themes on the show
one<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.299> don't<00:01:31.020> let<00:01:31.229> your

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
one of them is don't let your

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
one of them is don't let your
receivables<00:01:31.950> grow<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.729> remember<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
receivables grow and I remember a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.630 
receivables grow and I remember a
particular<00:01:33.570> episode<00:01:33.799> with<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> meat<00:01:35.100> company

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
particular episode with a meat company

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
particular episode with a meat company
in<00:01:35.790> Brooklyn<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> talk<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.049> why

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
in Brooklyn can you talk about why

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
in Brooklyn can you talk about why
that's<00:01:37.439> such<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> big<00:01:37.770> problem<00:01:37.920> well<00:01:38.640> in

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that's such a big problem well in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.399 
that's such a big problem well in
companies<00:01:39.210> especially<00:01:39.360> small<00:01:39.659> businesses

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
companies especially small businesses

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
companies especially small businesses
the<00:01:40.590> working<00:01:41.009> capital<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the working capital that they have to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 
the working capital that they have to
run<00:01:42.180> their<00:01:42.299> business<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.960> finite<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.770> what

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
run their business is so finite and what

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.469 
run their business is so finite and what
they<00:01:44.399> don't<00:01:44.549> understand<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
they don't understand is when the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
they don't understand is when the
receivables<00:01:46.079> swell<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.470> essentially

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
receivables swell it's essentially

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
receivables swell it's essentially
taking<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> working<00:01:48.149> capital<00:01:48.390> all

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
taking all of the working capital all

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.450 
taking all of the working capital all
their<00:01:48.869> cash<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.770> trapping<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> it's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
their cash and just trapping it it's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.350 
their cash and just trapping it it's
just<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> work

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
just not going to work

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.780 
just not going to work
the<00:01:51.509> other<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.229> maintain<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.189> margins

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the other one is maintain your margins

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.609 
the other one is maintain your margins
this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.119> another<00:01:54.450> problem<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.320> pops

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
this is another problem that really pops

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.429 
this is another problem that really pops
up<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> show<00:01:56.369> when<00:01:56.939> people<00:01:57.329> put<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:58.170> their

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
up on the show when people put in their

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.139 
up on the show when people put in their
storefront<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.219> their<00:01:59.430> store<00:01:59.670> things<00:02:00.000> with

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
storefront in their store things with

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.670 
storefront in their store things with
very<00:02:00.270> thin<00:02:00.600> margins<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.439> thick

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
very thin margins when they have thick

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.830 
very thin margins when they have thick
margins<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.310> back<00:02:02.549> why<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.180> they<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
margins in the back why do they do that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.120 
margins in the back why do they do that
I<00:02:03.869> think<00:02:04.350> part<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> reason<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.100> because

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I think part of the reason is because

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
I think part of the reason is because
they<00:02:05.640> don't<00:02:05.820> understand<00:02:06.360> cost<00:02:06.630> accounting

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
they don't understand cost accounting

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.300 
they don't understand cost accounting
because<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:07.500> don't<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> good<00:02:08.009> inventory

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
because they don't have a good inventory

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.910 
because they don't have a good inventory
system<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.030> place<00:02:09.239> they<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:09.929> don't<00:02:10.619> know

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
system in place they really don't know

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.100 
system in place they really don't know
what<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.400> true<00:02:11.670> margins<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> product

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
what the true margins are on the product

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.810 
what the true margins are on the product
and<00:02:13.230> they<00:02:13.380> don't<00:02:13.590> understand<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> terms<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
and they don't understand the terms that

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.640 
and they don't understand the terms that
come<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.180> product<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.900> they<00:02:16.380> may<00:02:16.590> be

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
come with that product so they may be

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.080 
come with that product so they may be
putting<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.160> there<00:02:17.340> what<00:02:17.460> they<00:02:17.580> think<00:02:17.820> sells

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
putting up there what they think sells

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.090 
putting up there what they think sells
the<00:02:18.300> fastest<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.680> got<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> lowest

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
the fastest but it's got the lowest

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.010 
the fastest but it's got the lowest
amount<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.550> margin<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.180> because<00:02:21.900> they

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
amount of margin and so because they

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.150 
amount of margin and so because they
don't<00:02:22.050> understand<00:02:22.650> their<00:02:22.770> inventory

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
don't understand their inventory

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.680 
don't understand their inventory
understand<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> customer<00:02:24.090> they<00:02:24.510> don't

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
understand the customer they don't

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.180 
understand the customer they don't

today<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.980> three<00:02:41.310> billion<00:02:41.550> dollar<00:02:41.880> company

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
today is a three billion dollar company

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.540 
today is a three billion dollar company
it's<00:02:42.510> Camping<00:02:42.870> World<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.890> apply<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> lot<00:02:44.520> of

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
it's Camping World and I apply a lot of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.130 
it's Camping World and I apply a lot of
the<00:02:44.670> same<00:02:44.880> principles<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.450> my<00:02:45.570> own<00:02:45.690> business

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
the same principles in my own business

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.350 
the same principles in my own business
and<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.800> think<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.670> transference

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
and so I think that the transference

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.030 
and so I think that the transference
between<00:02:48.450> small<00:02:49.200> business<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.770> medium

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
between small business and medium

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.740 
between small business and medium
business<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.610> large<00:02:50.940> business<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.480> really

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
business and large business is really

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.590 
business and large business is really
the<00:02:51.870> same<00:02:52.080> people<00:02:52.850> process<00:02:53.850> product<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.420> mean

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
the same people process product I mean

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.120 
the same people process product I mean
you<00:02:54.990> know<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.380> any<00:02:55.530> business<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:56.010> need
