you've<00:03:25.170> got<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.950> big<00:03:26.100> thing<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.700> over

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
you've got and the big thing on it over

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.750 
you've got and the big thing on it over
here<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.630> we've<00:03:28.350> got<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.800> billet<00:03:29.130> aluminum<00:03:29.550> oil

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
here is we've got a billet aluminum oil

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.520 
here is we've got a billet aluminum oil
filter<00:03:30.150> adapter<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.750> actually<00:03:30.989> sandwiches

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
filter adapter that actually sandwiches

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.530 
filter adapter that actually sandwiches
on<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.830> bracket<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.790> we're<00:03:32.910> able<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.120> keep<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
on the bracket so we're able to keep the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.870 
on the bracket so we're able to keep the
stock<00:03:33.780> position<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.100> case<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.340> wanted<00:03:35.790> to

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
stock position so in case we wanted to

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.699 
stock position so in case we wanted to
build<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.120> front<00:03:36.390> sump<00:03:36.630> GTO<00:03:37.020> base<00:03:37.320> we<00:03:37.590> could

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
build a front sump GTO base we could

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.040 
build a front sump GTO base we could
still<00:03:37.890> keep<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.280> stock<00:03:38.940> oil<00:03:39.150> filter<00:03:39.600> position

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
still keep the stock oil filter position

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.420 
still keep the stock oil filter position
in<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.560> we're<00:03:40.980> eventually<00:03:41.280> going<00:03:41.370> to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
in it and we're eventually going to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.560 
in it and we're eventually going to
build<00:03:41.640> them<00:03:41.790> that'll<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.180> able<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.420> use<00:03:42.540> a

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
build them that'll be able to use a
