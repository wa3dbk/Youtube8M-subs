00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.759 
and that's really about it on the sides
on<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.570> right<00:03:38.750> side<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.170> absolutely<00:03:39.620> nothing

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
on the right side is absolutely nothing

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.550 
on the right side is absolutely nothing
you'll<00:03:40.459> see<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.910> then<00:03:41.329> on<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.720> left<00:03:41.959> side<00:03:42.170> is

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
you'll see and then on the left side is

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.550 
you'll see and then on the left side is
I<00:03:43.310> believe<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.900> Firefly<00:03:44.900> button<00:03:45.200> if<00:03:45.320> I'm<00:03:45.470> not

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
I believe the Firefly button if I'm not

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.949 
I believe the Firefly button if I'm not
mistaken<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.310> volume<00:03:47.120> up<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.450> down<00:03:47.570> in<00:03:47.840> a

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
mistaken and volume up and down in a

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.610 
mistaken and volume up and down in a
nano<00:03:48.769> SIM<00:03:49.310> slot<00:03:49.700> although<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.720> do<00:03:50.840> like<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.410> said

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
nano SIM slot although I do like I said

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.539 
nano SIM slot although I do like I said
earlier<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.130> is<00:03:52.340> only<00:03:53.079> available<00:03:54.079> on<00:03:54.680> 18<00:03:55.340> T

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
earlier this is only available on 18 T

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.789 
earlier this is only available on 18 T
so<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.880> only<00:03:56.000> works<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.480> ETM<00:03:56.810> T<00:03:56.989> which<00:03:57.769> is

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
so it only works on the ETM T which is

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.810 
so it only works on the ETM T which is
interesting<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.400> they<00:03:58.610> didn't<00:03:58.910> include<00:03:59.030> any

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
interesting that they didn't include any

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.160 
interesting that they didn't include any
carrier<00:04:01.820> branding<00:04:02.299> on<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.510> I'm<00:04:02.810> really

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
carrier branding on it I'm really

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.080 
carrier branding on it I'm really
surprised<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.769> figured<00:04:04.010> I'd<00:04:04.100> seen<00:04:04.310> 18<00:04:04.670> T<00:04:04.820> symbol

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
surprised I figured I'd seen 18 T symbol

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.270 
surprised I figured I'd seen 18 T symbol
on<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.299> back<00:04:05.480> or<00:04:05.690> something<00:04:06.049> like<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.440> so

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
on the back or something like that so

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.170 
on the back or something like that so
there<00:04:07.700> we<00:04:07.790> go

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
there we go

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.509 
there we go
you'll<00:04:08.420> see<00:04:08.799> you<00:04:09.799> have<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.980> bunch<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.220> different

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
options it's is a different OS I guess

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.199 
options it's is a different OS I guess
it<00:04:14.150> looks<00:04:14.180> like<00:04:14.720> they<00:04:15.730> decided<00:04:16.730> to<00:04:16.760> make<00:04:16.970> their

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209

video<00:05:22.260> so<00:05:22.500> let's<00:05:22.800> say<00:05:22.950> we<00:05:23.070> wanted<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.310> go<00:05:23.400> to

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
video so let's say we wanted to go to

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.860 
video so let's say we wanted to go to
music<00:05:23.700> it's<00:05:24.150> probably<00:05:24.390> going<00:05:24.510> to<00:05:24.570> ask<00:05:24.660> me<00:05:24.840> to

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
music it's probably going to ask me to

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.380 
music it's probably going to ask me to
sign<00:05:25.140> in<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.380> Amazon<00:05:25.760> which<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.880> did<00:05:27.030> not<00:05:27.060> do

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
sign in to Amazon which I did not do

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.390 
sign in to Amazon which I did not do
because<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.720> skipped<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.260> looks<00:05:29.130> like<00:05:29.280> it

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
because I skipped it looks like it

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.180 
because I skipped it looks like it
brings<00:05:29.670> you<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:29.790> the<00:05:29.880> Amazon<00:05:30.360> website<00:05:31.190> not

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
brings you to the Amazon website not

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.370 
brings you to the Amazon website not
exactly<00:05:32.610> sure<00:05:32.910> why<00:05:33.180> it<00:05:33.240> brought<00:05:34.020> me<00:05:34.170> to<00:05:34.260> this

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
exactly sure why it brought me to this

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.010 
exactly sure why it brought me to this
page<00:05:34.680> right<00:05:34.980> here<00:05:35.040> but<00:05:35.550> let's<00:05:36.150> try<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.510> I

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
page right here but let's try the I

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.490 
page right here but let's try the I
believe<00:05:37.380> this<00:05:37.590> is<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:39.080> Firefly<00:05:40.080> button<00:05:40.410> on

believe this is the Firefly button on
the<00:05:40.620> left<00:05:40.890> side<00:05:41.010> here<00:05:41.460> let's<00:05:42.120> go<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.360> press

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
design wise it has a little bit of

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.010 
design wise it has a little bit of
weight<00:07:23.979> to<00:07:24.099> it<00:07:24.129> but<00:07:24.400> it<00:07:24.490> does<00:07:24.639> feel<00:07:24.990> nice<00:07:25.990> in
