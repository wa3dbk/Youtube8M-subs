00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.350 

now<00:00:01.199> we'll<00:00:01.350> talk<00:00:01.469> about<00:00:01.550> rules<00:00:02.550> for<00:00:03.120> division

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
now we'll talk about rules for division

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.869 
now we'll talk about rules for division
and<00:00:03.659> specifically<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.830> rules<00:00:05.069> for<00:00:05.370> dividing

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
and specifically the rules for dividing

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.730 
and specifically the rules for dividing
positive<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.690> negative<00:00:07.049> numbers<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.560> these

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
positive and negative numbers and these

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.589 
positive and negative numbers and these
are<00:00:07.919> very<00:00:08.069> similar<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.700> rules<00:00:08.910> for

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
are very similar to the rules for

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.169 
are very similar to the rules for
dividing<00:00:09.840> or<00:00:10.170> multiplying<00:00:10.759> positive<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
dividing or multiplying positive and

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.360 
dividing or multiplying positive and
negative<00:00:12.480> numbers<00:00:12.780> if<00:00:13.080> two<00:00:13.860> numbers<00:00:14.190> have<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
negative numbers if two numbers have the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.689 
negative numbers if two numbers have the
same<00:00:14.549> sign<00:00:15.619> then<00:00:16.619> their<00:00:16.890> quotient<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
same sign then their quotient is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:26.390 
same sign then their quotient is
positive<00:00:24.590> if<00:00:25.590> two<00:00:25.800> numbers<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> same

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
positive if two numbers have the same

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.810 
positive if two numbers have the same
sign<00:00:26.609> then<00:00:27.390> their<00:00:28.289> quotient<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.890> positive<00:00:28.949> in

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
sign then their quotient is positive in

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
sign then their quotient is positive in
other<00:00:29.939> words<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> divide<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.990> positive

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
other words if you divide a positive

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.500 
other words if you divide a positive
number<00:00:31.710> by<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> positive<00:00:32.369> number<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.360> result

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
number by a positive number the result

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.110 
number by a positive number the result
is<00:00:33.840> positive<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> divide<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.460> negative

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
is positive and if you divide a negative

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
is positive and if you divide a negative
number<00:00:36.270> by<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> negative<00:00:36.899> number<00:00:37.140> again<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
number by a negative number again the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.790 
number by a negative number again the
result<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.910> positive<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.500> two<00:00:40.649> numbers

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
result is positive and if two numbers

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
result is positive and if two numbers
have<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.850> opposite<00:00:42.420> sign<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:42.960> their

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
have the opposite sign then their

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.229 
have the opposite sign then their
quotient<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.800> negative<00:00:46.520> if<00:00:47.520> two<00:00:47.760> numbers<00:00:47.910> have

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
quotient is negative if two numbers have

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.160 
quotient is negative if two numbers have
the<00:00:48.360> opposite<00:00:49.050> sign<00:00:49.370> their<00:00:50.370> quotient<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
the opposite sign their quotient is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.850 
the opposite sign their quotient is
negative<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.539> divide<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.930> positive

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
negative so if you divide a positive

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680 
negative so if you divide a positive
number<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> negative<00:00:56.460> or<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> negative

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
number by a negative or a negative

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.889 
number by a negative or a negative
number<00:00:58.500> by<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> positive<00:00:59.340> then<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> result<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
number by a positive then the result is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.119 
number by a positive then the result is
negative<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:03.989> some<00:01:04.080> examples<00:01:04.140> 9

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
negative so here are some examples 9

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.179 
negative so here are some examples 9
divided<00:01:05.640> by<00:01:05.670> 3<00:01:06.560> obviously<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.010> 9

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
divided by 3 obviously we know that 9

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.820 
divided by 3 obviously we know that 9
divided<00:01:08.610> by<00:01:08.640> 3<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.180> 3<00:01:09.210> well<00:01:10.170> negative<00:01:10.439> 9

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
divided by 3 is 3 well negative 9

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.719 
divided by 3 is 3 well negative 9
divided<00:01:11.729> by<00:01:11.909> negative<00:01:12.119> 3<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.659> also<00:01:13.140> 3<00:01:13.799> again<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
divided by negative 3 is also 3 again I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.700 
divided by negative 3 is also 3 again I
take<00:01:15.030> note<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.270> both<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> these<00:01:16.140> numbers<00:01:16.590> are

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
take note that both of these numbers are

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.670 
take note that both of these numbers are
negative<00:01:17.270> they<00:01:18.270> both<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> same<00:01:19.049> sign<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
negative they both have the same sign so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.800 
negative they both have the same sign so
the<00:01:19.799> result<00:01:20.159> ends<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.549> being<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.880> positive<00:01:21.180> 3

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the result ends up being a positive 3

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.179 
the result ends up being a positive 3
and<00:01:21.979> negative<00:01:22.979> 9<00:01:23.640> divided<00:01:24.150> by<00:01:24.180> 3<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:25.189> negative

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and negative 9 divided by 3 is negative

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.429 
and negative 9 divided by 3 is negative
3<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> same<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.360> 9<00:01:27.570> divided<00:01:28.110> by<00:01:28.140> negative

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
3 and the same as 9 divided by negative

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.819 
3 and the same as 9 divided by negative
3<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.159> negative<00:01:29.520> 3<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> numbers<00:01:31.439> is

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
3 is negative 3 if one of the numbers is

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
3 is negative 3 if one of the numbers is
negative<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.670> end<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> negative

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
negative then we end up with a negative

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.260 
negative then we end up with a negative
sign<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.990> our<00:01:34.229> answer<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.970> this

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
sign on our answer you can think of this

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
sign on our answer you can think of this
as<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> negative<00:01:37.110> sign<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.829> numerator<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
as a negative sign in the numerator and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850 
as a negative sign in the numerator and
denominator<00:01:38.960> cancelling<00:01:39.960> each<00:01:40.140> other<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.409> so

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
denominator cancelling each other out so

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.190 
denominator cancelling each other out so
this<00:01:41.070> negative<00:01:41.340> sign<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this negative sign here and that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.590 
this negative sign here and that
negative<00:01:43.470> sign<00:01:43.860> there<00:01:44.329> cancel<00:01:45.329> each<00:01:45.420> other

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
negative sign there cancel each other

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.260 
negative sign there cancel each other
out<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> same<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.700> positive

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
out and it's the same as just a positive

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
out and it's the same as just a positive
9<00:01:48.450> divided<00:01:48.899> by<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.990> positive<00:01:49.259> 3<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.950> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
9 divided by a positive 3 and this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.940 
9 divided by a positive 3 and this
concept<00:01:50.939> applies<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.390> variables<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.290> well<00:01:52.890> as

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
concept applies to variables as well as

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
concept applies to variables as well as
to<00:01:53.250> numbers<00:01:54.229> look<00:01:55.229> at<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:56.600> negative<00:01:57.600> 8<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990

over negative 2b I have a negative thing

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.530 
over negative 2b I have a negative thing
divided<00:02:01.680> by<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> negative<00:02:02.310> thing<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.149> result

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
divided by a negative thing the result

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.469 
divided by a negative thing the result
there<00:02:03.899> will<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.409> positive<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.520> don't<00:02:06.090> really

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
there will be positive or I don't really

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.880 
there will be positive or I don't really
know<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.930> positive<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.740> because

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
know if it's positive or not because

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.559 
know if it's positive or not because
they<00:02:07.979> don't<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.250> values<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.390> those

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
they don't have values for those

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.170 
they don't have values for those
variables<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.590> B<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.819> think<00:02:11.849> of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
variables a and B but I can think of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.630 
variables a and B but I can think of
this<00:02:12.480> negative<00:02:12.959> sign

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
this negative sign

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.910 
this negative sign
that<00:02:13.790> negative<00:02:14.060> sign<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:15.050> cancelling<00:02:15.770> each

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
that negative sign is cancelling each

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.040 
that negative sign is cancelling each
other<00:02:16.069> out<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.700> one<00:02:17.120> way<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.330> cancel<00:02:17.750> them<00:02:17.900> out

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
other out and one way to cancel them out

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.290 
other out and one way to cancel them out
is<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.650> change<00:02:19.280> them<00:02:19.610> into<00:02:19.760> plus<00:02:20.030> signs

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
is to just change them into plus signs

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.420 
is to just change them into plus signs
by<00:02:20.510> putting<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.930> little<00:02:20.959> mark<00:02:21.350> there<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.830> then

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
by putting a little mark there and then

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.660 
by putting a little mark there and then
I<00:02:22.459> just<00:02:22.550> end<00:02:22.970> up<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.150> 8a<00:02:23.959> over<00:02:24.350> 2b<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.459> can

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
I just end up with 8a over 2b and I can

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.730 
I just end up with 8a over 2b and I can
reduce<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.390> 8<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.200> 2<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> 4<00:02:28.940> over<00:02:29.270> 1

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
reduce this 8 and the 2 to a 4 over 1

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.330 
reduce this 8 and the 2 to a 4 over 1
and<00:02:30.740> so<00:02:30.890> I'm<00:02:30.980> just<00:02:31.160> left<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.520> 4<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.720> over<00:02:33.350> B<00:02:33.650> for

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
and so I'm just left with 4 a over B for

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.460 
and so I'm just left with 4 a over B for
my<00:02:34.459> answer<00:02:34.790> with<00:02:34.970> no<00:02:35.209> negative<00:02:35.480> signs<00:02:35.900> because

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
my answer with no negative signs because

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.170 
my answer with no negative signs because
those<00:02:36.650> negative<00:02:37.070> signs<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.430> have<00:02:37.730> canceled

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
those negative signs is have canceled

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.870 
those negative signs is have canceled
out<00:02:38.330> over<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.560> there's<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.280> single<00:02:40.730> negative

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
out over here there's a single negative

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.300 
out over here there's a single negative
sign<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.750> doesn't<00:02:42.110> matter<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:43.130> in

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
sign and it doesn't matter if it's in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.120 
sign and it doesn't matter if it's in
the<00:02:43.580> denominator<00:02:44.180> or<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.540> numerator<00:02:45.170> in

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
the denominator or the numerator in

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.949 
the denominator or the numerator in
either<00:02:46.459> case<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:46.970> have<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> single<00:02:47.600> negative

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
either case I have a single negative

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.110 
either case I have a single negative
sign<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.410> doesn't<00:02:48.770> cancel<00:02:48.950> out<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.580> can

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
sign so it doesn't cancel out I can

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.040 
sign so it doesn't cancel out I can
still<00:02:50.420> reduce<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.080> 8<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.620> 2<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> 4<00:02:53.810> and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
still reduce the 8 and the 2 to a 4 and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.380 
still reduce the 8 and the 2 to a 4 and
a<00:02:54.140> 1<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.070> negative<00:02:55.580> sign<00:02:55.820> right<00:02:56.060> there<00:02:56.090> is

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
a 1 but the negative sign right there is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.990 
a 1 but the negative sign right there is
still<00:02:56.959> there<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.220> end<00:02:58.459> up<00:02:58.610> with<00:02:58.670> 4a<00:03:01.000> over

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
still there so I end up with 4a over

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.900 
still there so I end up with 4a over
negative<00:03:02.239> B<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.900> again<00:03:03.650> it's<00:03:03.860> not<00:03:03.920> common<00:03:04.880> to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
negative B and again it's not common to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.940 
negative B and again it's not common to
leave<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.480> negative<00:03:05.690> sign<00:03:06.080> like<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.800> the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
leave the negative sign like that in the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.590 
leave the negative sign like that in the
numerator<00:03:07.130> I'm<00:03:07.610> gonna<00:03:07.850> rewrite<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.360> as

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
numerator I'm gonna rewrite this as

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
numerator I'm gonna rewrite this as
negative<00:03:09.760> 4a<00:03:10.760> over<00:03:11.390> B<00:03:11.600> although<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.380> could

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
negative 4a over B although you could

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.670 
negative 4a over B although you could
also<00:03:12.769> write<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.250> as<00:03:13.400> negative<00:03:13.610> 4a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
also write it as negative 4a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.640 
also write it as negative 4a
over<00:03:15.680> B<00:03:16.600> one<00:03:17.600> important<00:03:17.989> thing<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.260> take<00:03:18.410> note

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
over B one important thing to take note

over B one important thing to take note
of<00:03:18.680> here<00:03:19.040> don't<00:03:19.760> make<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.180> mistake<00:03:20.480> of

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
of here don't make the mistake of

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.319 
of here don't make the mistake of
thinking<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:21.049> any<00:03:21.489> negative<00:03:22.489> sign<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:23.060> the

that's wrong the rule to remember here

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.850 
that's wrong the rule to remember here
is<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.459> only<00:03:47.120> things<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:47.840> are<00:03:47.959> multiplied

negative 1 on the top and the bottom can
cancel<00:04:29.990> out<00:04:30.169> note<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:30.980> negative<00:04:31.430> 1<00:04:31.639> is<00:04:31.880> a

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
cancel out note that negative 1 is a

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.830 
cancel out note that negative 1 is a
factor<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.990> our<00:04:33.740> numerator<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:35.240> factor<00:04:35.270> of

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
factor of our numerator and a factor of

factor of our numerator and a factor of
our<00:04:36.139> denominator<00:04:36.860> so<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.520> those<00:04:38.060> can<00:04:38.240> cancel

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
our denominator so that those can cancel

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.330 
our denominator so that those can cancel
out<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.900> that's<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.139> same<00:04:39.440> as<00:04:39.620> canceling<00:04:40.190> out

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
out and that's the same as canceling out

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.670 
out and that's the same as canceling out
those<00:04:40.580> negative<00:04:40.970> signs<00:04:41.150> that<00:04:41.840> doesn't<00:04:42.410> work

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
those negative signs that doesn't work

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
those negative signs that doesn't work
over<00:04:43.220> here<00:04:43.250> this<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.690> not<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.020> factor<00:04:45.800> that's<00:04:46.460> an

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
over here this is not a factor that's an

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.379 
over here this is not a factor that's an
operator<00:04:47.419> that's<00:04:47.690> 3<00:04:48.110> minus<00:04:48.620> X<00:04:49.030> so<00:04:50.030> there's<00:04:50.210> no

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
operator that's 3 minus X so there's no

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.750 
operator that's 3 minus X so there's no
factor<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.139> negative<00:04:51.590> 1<00:04:51.800> in<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.100> numerator<00:04:52.280> to

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
factor of negative 1 in the numerator to

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.920 
factor of negative 1 in the numerator to
cancel<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.860> same<00:04:55.040> thing<00:04:55.280> here<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.550> can't

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
cancel and the same thing here I can't

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.950 
cancel and the same thing here I can't
reduce<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.229> 3<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.710> 6<00:04:58.300> because<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.510> 3<00:04:59.810> is

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
reduce the 3 and the 6 because the 3 is

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.290 
reduce the 3 and the 6 because the 3 is
not<00:05:00.139> a<00:05:00.200> factor<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:01.250> can<00:05:01.430> only<00:05:01.669> cancel<00:05:02.000> the

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
not a factor you can only cancel the

not a factor you can only cancel the
factors
