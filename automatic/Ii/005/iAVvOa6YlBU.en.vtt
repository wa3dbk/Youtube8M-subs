of<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.409> originally<00:01:07.920> saw<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.460> with

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
of what you originally saw it just with

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.920 
of what you originally saw it just with
the<00:01:08.640> smallest<00:01:08.939> screen<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the smallest screen you see that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.469 
the smallest screen you see that
actually<00:01:10.140> added<00:01:11.100> an<00:01:11.220> actual<00:01:11.820> extra

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
actually added an actual extra

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.649 
actually added an actual extra
peripheral<00:01:13.170> view<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> iPhone<00:01:14.880> 5<00:01:15.180> version

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
peripheral view for the iPhone 5 version

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.090 
peripheral view for the iPhone 5 version
which<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.900> definitely<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.380> good<00:01:16.470> because

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
which is definitely really good because

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800 
which is definitely really good because
they<00:01:17.340> didn't<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.729> extend<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.450> actually

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
they didn't just extend it they actually

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.289 
they didn't just extend it they actually
extended<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.530> landscape<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.490> atmosphere<00:01:21.119> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
extended the landscape and atmosphere of

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.270 
extended the landscape and atmosphere of
the<00:01:21.810> game<00:01:22.020> itself<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.619> gives<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> much

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the game itself and it gives it much

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.109 
the game itself and it gives it much
more<00:01:23.909> fluid<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.890> emotional<00:01:25.890> tone<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> game

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
more fluid of emotional tone to the game

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.210 
more fluid of emotional tone to the game
itself<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.900> recommend<00:01:28.470> checking<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.009> is
