ribbon<00:05:18.270> holes<00:05:18.510> and<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.470> reason<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.830> did<00:05:20.010> that

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
ribbon holes and the reason I did that

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.530 
ribbon holes and the reason I did that
was<00:05:20.580> so<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:22.970> where<00:05:23.970> are<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.240> tags<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:26.540> could

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
was so that where are the tags I could

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.000 
was so that where are the tags I could
slot<00:05:28.790> that<00:05:29.790> button<00:05:30.300> over<00:05:31.170> the<00:05:31.260> top<00:05:31.470> of<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.740> tag

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
slot that button over the top of the tag

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.690 
slot that button over the top of the tag
and<00:05:32.250> then<00:05:32.490> stick<00:05:32.850> down<00:05:33.920> that<00:05:34.920> side<00:05:37.580> so<00:05:38.580> they

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
and then stick down that side so they

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.280 
and then stick down that side so they
fitted<00:05:39.000> on<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.960> photo<00:05:40.290> mats<00:05:40.530> night<00:05:40.800> that<00:05:42.290> so
