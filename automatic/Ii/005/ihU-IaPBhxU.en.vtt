00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 starting from that collective embrace 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.470
 wonderful collective I mean of all 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.309
 his team and all the public but 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.340
 surely I think we are talking about today 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.270
 a friendly but certainly for me 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.640
 are the situations you still have 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.530
 I don't know I'm not aware of it myself 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.710
 maybe everything that's happening 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:29.540
 but I only know that a road is certain 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 that of going ahead to respect 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.690
 what happened and to respect 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.410
 what I have to do when it means 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.930
 go on living and that hug 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.520
 surely means means that 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.160
 everyone has understood how much it is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.340
 nothing happened 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.840
 I 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.580
 I will certainly try to move forward 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.320
 as I said a few days ago and that's it 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.790
 I want to find the smile that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.590
 I had 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.720
 bring back his smile that had us 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.730
 low I felt is August football 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.830
 result is worth what is true though 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.210
 we saw a toned team at least 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.320
 this is a team that is found in 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.480
 field you agree surely must 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.090
 still grow so much moisture first 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.400
 turn barbera for the mister x for i 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.280
 new players bodies for the new way 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.729
 to play for new ideas I think 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.620
 today bio that maybe I 'm a little less with 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.540
 they have already seen concepts that 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.090
 want to mister this the biggest thing 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.670
 especially in defense 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.710
 as always, however, I need to improve 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.360
 who are not condemned but are 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.930
 glad that we started with less 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.690
 enthusiasm 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.940
 finally after 10 years because it was there 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.790
 always history enthusiasm we will go there 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.410
 we'll go there instead I'm glad it is 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.930
 started with less pressure for us too 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.909
 and I think that with the match of 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.880
 today 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.439
 we will open a nice 5 for 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.090
 enthusiasm you are now one of the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.979
 more experienced players more experienced 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.229
 this team are as many young people as 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.720
 you have seen in this beginning or better I think 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.950
 that seen well mister 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.500
 the compliments above all 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.530
 them because what I saw on 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.569
 retreat worked really well 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.430
 there have been no complaints 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.160
 willed will also marry the concepts 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.959
 of the coach 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.480
 I think that as I said before you are 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.170
 given these concepts he wants 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.900
 I think that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.250
 young people must listen to grow 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.380
 so much because there are so much quality 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.200
 but we must certainly enter into the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.550
 schemes in Italian tactics he calls it 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.620
 and we close with a joke maybe from 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.700
 so much sannin they shout we see it from 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.450
 out maybe from almost even in 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.310
 workout is really less 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.709
 it certainly has a lot of effect on young people 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.890
 and I see that I am very careful but it is a 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.319
 mister is a good mister who is not shouting 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.140
 one who screams and maybe offends you 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.239
 mister who respects so much maybe 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.280
 at the beginning I was a little skeptical said 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.870
 but it seems to me a bit obnoxious steven not 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.799
 I like books so much instead 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.140
 I am yes yes I have changed my mind I think 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.660
 who has clear ideas thanks thanks 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.810
 to the average dollars from in-depth analysis 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.810
