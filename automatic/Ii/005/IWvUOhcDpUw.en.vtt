priced at more like $200 it's not

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.099 
priced at more like $200 it's not
exactly<00:00:23.100> fair<00:00:23.430> comparison<00:00:24.090> because<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.840> this

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
exactly fair comparison because the this

and do it well and it does do it well
and<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.440> Lila<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.239> buffer<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.170> also

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and the Lila is a buffer but it can also

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.440 
and the Lila is a buffer but it can also
be<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> booster<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> recording

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
be a booster it can be a recording

be a booster it can be a recording
preamp<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.140> has<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> lot<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.800> different<00:00:41.219> uses<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
preamp it has a lot of different uses it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.740 
preamp it has a lot of different uses it
can<00:00:42.360> drive<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:44.789> overdrive<00:00:45.450> your

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
can drive it can actually overdrive your

can drive it can actually overdrive your
your<00:00:46.110> amp

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
your amp

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.470 
your amp
it's<00:00:47.340> made<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.550> super<00:00:47.969> high<00:00:48.090> quality

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
it's made with super high quality

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.170 
it's made with super high quality
components<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.579> wanted<00:00:50.910> something

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
components so if you wanted something

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
components so if you wanted something
that's<00:00:51.510> more<00:00:51.690> multi-use<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.649> might

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that's more multi-use that you might

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.350 
that's more multi-use that you might
take<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.460> off<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.760> board<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.270> use

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
take on and off of your board and use

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.150 
take on and off of your board and use
for<00:00:54.570> other<00:00:54.660> things<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.350> should<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
for other things that should be in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.729 
for other things that should be in
consideration<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:56.969> well<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.530> because<00:00:58.530> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
consideration as well but because it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.529 
consideration as well but because it's
such<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> high<00:00:59.190> quality<00:00:59.430> box<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.030> did<00:01:00.270> want<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
such a high quality box I did want to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.990 
such a high quality box I did want to
just<00:01:00.600> compare<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.770> characteristics<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.789> both

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just compare the characteristics of both

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570 
just compare the characteristics of both
just<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.719> buffers<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.280> quickly

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
just as buffers I also really quickly

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
just as buffers I also really quickly
want<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> answer<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.270> question<00:01:06.320> do<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.380> need<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
want to answer the question do I need a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.850 
want to answer the question do I need a
buffer<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:09.060> setup<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.380> answer<00:01:10.710> that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
buffer in my setup and the answer that

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.179 
buffer in my setup and the answer that
question<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.820> don't<00:01:11.909> know<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
question is I don't know do you

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.770 
question is I don't know do you
the<00:01:14.189> reason<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.580> say<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.150> it's

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the reason I say that is because it's

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.969 
the reason I say that is because it's
entirely<00:01:16.110> based<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.799> you're<00:01:16.950> hearing

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
entirely based on what you're hearing

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.760 
entirely based on what you're hearing
and<00:01:17.450> before<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.810> any<00:01:19.049> further<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and before you go any further if you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
and before you go any further if you
like<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.610> sound<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.150> you're<00:01:21.360> getting<00:01:21.659> out

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
like the sound that you're getting out

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440 
like the sound that you're getting out
of<00:01:22.080> your<00:01:22.110> pedals<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.220> amp<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
of your pedals and your amp and you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
of your pedals and your amp and you
don't<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> buffer<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.400> answer<00:01:26.640> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
don't have a buffer then the answer is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
don't have a buffer then the answer is
no<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.360> probably<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> buffer

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
no you probably don't need a buffer

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
no you probably don't need a buffer
because<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.880> you're<00:01:30.000> getting

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
because if you like what you're getting

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.789 
because if you like what you're getting
there's<00:01:30.570> no<00:01:30.780> real<00:01:31.020> reason<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.350> mess<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
there's no real reason to mess with it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.149 
there's no real reason to mess with it
unless<00:01:32.729> you're<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.810> super<00:01:34.530> preoccupied

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
unless you're you know super preoccupied

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.880 
unless you're you know super preoccupied
with<00:01:35.340> making<00:01:35.640> sure<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.890> mentally

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
with making sure that you know mentally

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
with making sure that you know mentally
that<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.090> sound<00:01:39.360> closest

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that you're gonna get the sound closest

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.749 
that you're gonna get the sound closest
to<00:01:40.229> plugging<00:01:40.710> straight<00:01:40.979> into<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.340> amp<00:01:41.549> as

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to plugging straight into your amp as

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.310 
to plugging straight into your amp as
possible<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.869> some<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.200> going

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
possible and I have some of that going

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.249 
possible and I have some of that going
on<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> understand<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.840> but<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> don't

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
on so I understand that but if you don't

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.660 
on so I understand that but if you don't
like<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> sounds<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:46.979> gettin<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.430> could

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
like the sounds you're gettin this could

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.359 
like the sounds you're gettin this could
be<00:01:47.790> something<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> look<00:01:48.390> into

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
be something to look into

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
be something to look into
really<00:01:50.369> quickly<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> buffer<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.960> unit<00:01:52.409> that

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
really quickly a buffer is a unit that

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.039 
really quickly a buffer is a unit that
reduces<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> impedance<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.450> signal<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
reduces the impedance in your signal and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749 
reduces the impedance in your signal and
that's<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.770> fancy<00:01:55.979> way<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> say<00:01:56.460> it's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that's just a fancy way to say it's

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.660 
that's just a fancy way to say it's
gonna<00:01:56.939> restore<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.590> your<00:01:58.740> tone<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.579> of

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
gonna restore some of your tone kind of

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.959 
gonna restore some of your tone kind of
high-end<00:02:00.090> clarity<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> mean<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.100> when

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
high-end clarity and what I mean is when

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.359 
high-end clarity and what I mean is when
you<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.270> long<00:02:03.570> runs<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.380> cable<00:02:04.770> between<00:02:05.040> your

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
you have long runs of cable between your

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.679 
you have long runs of cable between your
amp<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.729> your<00:02:05.880> guitar<00:02:06.149> even<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.540> there

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
amp and your guitar even if there

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.960 
amp and your guitar even if there
weren't<00:02:06.869> any<00:02:07.079> pedals<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> way<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.700> more

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
weren't any pedals in the way the more

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
weren't any pedals in the way the more
cabling<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.629> add<00:02:10.020> you're<00:02:10.500> gonna<00:02:10.619> notice<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
cabling you add you're gonna notice a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.670 
cabling you add you're gonna notice a
loss<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.760> clarity<00:02:12.510> mostly<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.110> highs

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
loss of clarity mostly in the highs

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.039 
loss of clarity mostly in the highs
some<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.129> highs<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:15.060> gonna<00:02:15.239> drop<00:02:15.540> off<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
some of the highs are gonna drop off and

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.839 
some of the highs are gonna drop off and
it's<00:02:16.170> gonna<00:02:16.319> sound<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.799> little<00:02:16.829> bit<00:02:17.280> muddy

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
it's gonna sound a little bit muddy

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.149 
it's gonna sound a little bit muddy
that's<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.200> nature<00:02:19.409> of<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:19.680> happens

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
that's just the nature of what happens

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.369 
that's just the nature of what happens
it's<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.969> same<00:02:21.269> thing<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:21.780> happens<00:02:22.170> when

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
it's the same thing that happens when

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.050 
it's the same thing that happens when
you<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> lot<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.950> true-bypass<00:02:23.370> pedals

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
you have a lot of true-bypass pedals

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.390 
you have a lot of true-bypass pedals
together<00:02:24.510> true-bypass<00:02:25.260> pedals<00:02:25.859> are<00:02:25.980> designed

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
together true-bypass pedals are designed

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.440 
together true-bypass pedals are designed
to<00:02:26.730> truly<00:02:27.659> bypass<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.920> signal<00:02:29.849> path<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.299> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
to truly bypass the signal path of the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.360 
to truly bypass the signal path of the
pedal<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.989> just<00:02:31.200> let<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.439> be<00:02:31.680> straight<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.189> and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
pedal and just let it be straight in and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.910 
pedal and just let it be straight in and
straight<00:02:32.400> out<00:02:32.670> for<00:02:33.000> your<00:02:33.120> signal<00:02:33.450> which<00:02:33.599> means

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
straight out for your signal which means

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.959 
straight out for your signal which means
if<00:02:34.920> you've<00:02:35.040> got<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> bunch<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.639> true-bypass

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
if you've got a bunch of true-bypass

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.030 
if you've got a bunch of true-bypass
pedals<00:02:36.629> you're<00:02:36.930> adding<00:02:37.349> up<00:02:37.469> the<00:02:37.620> lengths<00:02:37.859> of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
pedals you're adding up the lengths of

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.339 
pedals you're adding up the lengths of
all<00:02:38.280> those<00:02:38.579> patch<00:02:38.939> cables<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.750> adding<00:02:40.170> that

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
all those patch cables and adding that

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.309 
all those patch cables and adding that
much<00:02:40.620> cable<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:41.280> your<00:02:42.269> path<00:02:42.659> between<00:02:43.170> your

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
much cable to your path between your

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.780 
much cable to your path between your
guitar<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.680> your<00:02:43.799> amp<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.189> it's<00:02:44.310> gonna<00:02:44.430> cause

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
guitar and your amp and it's gonna cause

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.300 
guitar and your amp and it's gonna cause
that<00:02:44.819> mud<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.629> that<00:02:46.049> loss<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.650> high-end<00:02:47.069> loss

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
that mud and that loss of high-end loss

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.580 
that mud and that loss of high-end loss
of<00:02:47.489> clarity<00:02:47.609> etcetera<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.689> great<00:02:49.439> way<00:02:49.560> to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
of clarity etcetera so a great way to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.379 
of clarity etcetera so a great way to
tell<00:02:49.889> is<00:02:50.069> plug<00:02:50.310> your<00:02:50.430> guitar<00:02:50.489> straight<00:02:51.150> into

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
tell is plug your guitar straight into

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.449 
tell is plug your guitar straight into
your<00:02:51.510> amp<00:02:51.689> hear<00:02:52.319> what<00:02:52.439> it<00:02:52.530> sounds<00:02:52.859> like<00:02:52.889> play

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
your amp hear what it sounds like play

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.000 
your amp hear what it sounds like play
some<00:02:53.760> something<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.359> has<00:02:54.689> some<00:02:55.019> high<00:02:55.500> end<00:02:55.769> in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
some something that has some high end in

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.640 
some something that has some high end in
it<00:02:56.159> high<00:02:56.340> notes<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:56.879> then<00:02:57.569> as<00:02:58.049> quickly<00:02:58.169> as<00:02:58.530> you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
it high notes and then as quickly as you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.280 
it high notes and then as quickly as you
can<00:02:58.859> plug<00:02:59.189> in<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.730> through<00:03:00.480> your<00:03:00.510> entire<00:03:00.870> board

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
can plug in to through your entire board

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.770 
can plug in to through your entire board
with<00:03:01.500> everything<00:03:01.919> off<00:03:02.159> and<00:03:02.549> then<00:03:03.180> listen

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
with everything off and then listen

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.920 
with everything off and then listen
again<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:04.560> notice<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.129> difference<00:03:05.930> then

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
again if you notice a difference then

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.360 
again if you notice a difference then
you<00:03:07.200> might<00:03:07.349> want<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> check<00:03:07.769> in<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.159> buffer

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you might want to check in to a buffer

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.089 
you might want to check in to a buffer
because<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:08.939> buffer<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.389> going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:10.010> fixed<00:03:11.010> a

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
because the buffer is going to fixed a

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.619 
because the buffer is going to fixed a
lot<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.579> problem<00:03:11.939> for<00:03:12.359> you

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
lot of that problem for you

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.020 
lot of that problem for you
and<00:03:12.719> eliminate<00:03:13.349> some<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:13.950> loss<00:03:14.310> from<00:03:14.669> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and eliminate some of that loss from the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.170 
and eliminate some of that loss from the
cabling<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.719> I<00:03:16.250> do<00:03:17.250> really<00:03:17.519> quickly<00:03:17.879> want<00:03:18.000> to

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
cabling so I do really quickly want to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.240 
cabling so I do really quickly want to
show<00:03:18.389> you<00:03:18.449> how<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.109> looks<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.620> me<00:03:19.799> I've<00:03:20.010> got

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
show you how that looks for me I've got

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.430 
show you how that looks for me I've got
about<00:03:20.489> eight<00:03:20.790> true-bypass<00:03:21.479> pedals<00:03:22.139> on<00:03:22.290> my

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
about eight true-bypass pedals on my

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.589 
about eight true-bypass pedals on my
board<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:23.280> want<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.909> show<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.150> what<00:03:24.479> it

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
board and I want to show you what it

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.719 
board and I want to show you what it
sounds<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:25.019> straight<00:03:25.560> into<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.919> amp<00:03:26.159> versus

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
sounds like straight into the amp versus

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.119 
sounds like straight into the amp versus
what<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> sounds<00:03:27.479> like<00:03:27.720> through<00:03:28.500> those<00:03:28.739> pedals

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
what it sounds like through those pedals

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.599 
what it sounds like through those pedals
off<00:03:29.400> with<00:03:29.699> no<00:03:29.879> buffer<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.510> chain<00:03:31.069> so<00:03:32.069> I'm

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
off with no buffer in the chain so I'm

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.069 
off with no buffer in the chain so I'm
gonna<00:03:32.760> go<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> old<00:03:33.120> D<00:03:33.479> chord<00:03:33.810> here

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
gonna go with the old D chord here

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.809 
gonna go with the old D chord here
because<00:03:34.349> it's<00:03:34.530> got<00:03:34.680> plenty<00:03:34.949> of<00:03:35.099> high<00:03:35.340> notes<00:03:35.609> in

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
because it's got plenty of high notes in

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.270 
because it's got plenty of high notes in
it<00:03:35.939> so<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.449> tell<00:03:36.689> kind<00:03:37.409> of<00:03:37.530> what<00:03:37.739> loss

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
it so you can tell kind of what loss

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.099 
it so you can tell kind of what loss
there<00:03:38.609> might<00:03:38.790> be<00:03:38.819> since<00:03:39.269> high<00:03:39.479> end<00:03:39.659> is<00:03:39.780> kind<00:03:40.019> of

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
there might be since high end is kind of

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.750 
there might be since high end is kind of
thing<00:03:40.349> that<00:03:40.379> seems<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.859> suffer<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.430> most<00:03:41.579> from

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
thing that seems to suffer the most from

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.330 
thing that seems to suffer the most from
long<00:03:42.090> cable<00:03:42.449> runs<00:03:42.659> and<00:03:42.959> true-bypass<00:03:43.769> boards

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
long cable runs and true-bypass boards

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.369 
long cable runs and true-bypass boards
and<00:03:44.519> such<00:03:44.699> so<00:03:45.000> straight<00:03:45.509> into<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.900> amp<00:03:46.079> that

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
and such so straight into the amp that

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:53.349 
and such so straight into the amp that
cord<00:03:46.709> sounds<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.579> this

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.910 

so<00:03:54.359> now<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.540> same<00:03:54.930> cord<00:03:55.260> running<00:03:55.530> through

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
so now that same cord running through

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.250 
so now that same cord running through
all<00:03:56.249> eight<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.489> my<00:03:56.909> true-bypass<00:03:57.389> pedals<00:03:58.049> all

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
all eight of my true-bypass pedals all

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.020 
all eight of my true-bypass pedals all
off<00:03:58.709> it's<00:03:59.310> going<00:03:59.609> to<00:03:59.730> sound<00:03:59.939> like<00:04:00.299> this

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.210 

now<00:04:06.960> even<00:04:07.200> not<00:04:07.350> having<00:04:07.530> them<00:04:07.740> back-to-back

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
now even not having them back-to-back

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.040 
now even not having them back-to-back
and<00:04:08.490> because<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:08.970> know<00:04:09.030> already<00:04:09.450> cuz<00:04:09.750> I've<00:04:09.870> done

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
and because I know already cuz I've done

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.050 
and because I know already cuz I've done
this<00:04:10.170> once<00:04:10.470> before<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.340> can<00:04:11.730> already<00:04:11.880> hear

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
this once before but I can already hear

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.120 
this once before but I can already hear
a<00:04:12.120> pretty<00:04:12.540> serious<00:04:12.870> difference<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.650> I'm<00:04:13.830> going

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
a pretty serious difference so I'm going

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.980 
a pretty serious difference so I'm going
okay<00:04:14.310> there's<00:04:15.180> definitely<00:04:15.630> something<00:04:15.960> going

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
okay there's definitely something going

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.960 
okay there's definitely something going
on<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.560> think<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.950> want<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.190> try<00:04:17.459> adding<00:04:17.910> a

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
on so I think I want to try adding a

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.880 
on so I think I want to try adding a
buffer<00:04:18.239> end<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.510> chain<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.680> want<00:04:19.829> to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
buffer end of the chain so I want to

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.590 
buffer end of the chain so I want to
start<00:04:20.130> with<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.549> mini<00:04:20.850> buffer<00:04:21.239> from<00:04:21.390> this

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
start with the mini buffer from this

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.410 
start with the mini buffer from this
one's<00:04:21.810> mine<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.320> when<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.430> add<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:24.030> buffer

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
one's mine and when you add that buffer

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.440 
one's mine and when you add that buffer
into<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.230> chain<00:04:25.580> your<00:04:26.580> signal<00:04:27.030> sounds

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
into the chain your signal sounds

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:36.170 
into the chain your signal sounds
instead<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:28.230> this

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:48.730 

and<00:04:37.180> now<00:04:37.510> with<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.050> Leela<00:04:38.500> in<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:39.040> same<00:04:39.280> spot

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.960 

and<00:04:49.740> now<00:04:49.860> here<00:04:50.070> at<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.250> end<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.490> really<00:04:50.760> just

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
and now here at the end I really just

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.820 
and now here at the end I really just
want<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.240> finish<00:04:51.390> up<00:04:51.690> with<00:04:51.750> again<00:04:52.530> through<00:04:52.710> the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
want to finish up with again through the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.250 
want to finish up with again through the
magic<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:53.340> editing<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:54.030> wanna<00:04:54.300> put<00:04:54.990> all<00:04:55.140> these

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
magic of editing I wanna put all these

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.290 
magic of editing I wanna put all these
clips<00:04:55.680> right<00:04:55.950> next<00:04:56.640> to<00:04:56.700> each<00:04:56.820> other<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.240> you

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
clips right next to each other so you

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.240 
clips right next to each other so you
can<00:04:57.360> kind<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:57.780> hear<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.440> differences<00:04:58.950> both

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
can kind of hear the differences both

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.240 
can kind of hear the differences both
between<00:04:59.580> a<00:05:00.260> straight<00:05:01.260> and<00:05:01.440> signal<00:05:01.800> versus<00:05:02.220> a

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
between a straight and signal versus a

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.250 
between a straight and signal versus a
buffered<00:05:03.000> signal<00:05:03.390> versus<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:03.930> unbuffered

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
buffered signal versus and unbuffered

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.980 
buffered signal versus and unbuffered
signal<00:05:04.860> versus<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:06.030> two<00:05:06.210> boxes<00:05:06.630> kind<00:05:06.900> of

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
signal versus the two boxes kind of

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.570 
signal versus the two boxes kind of
against<00:05:07.320> each<00:05:07.440> other<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.860> can<00:05:07.950> decide<00:05:08.400> for

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
against each other so you can decide for

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.090 
against each other so you can decide for
yourself<00:05:08.910> what<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:10.020> think<00:05:10.230> sounds<00:05:10.530> best<00:05:10.770> so

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
yourself what you think sounds best so

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:31.790 
yourself what you think sounds best so
here<00:05:11.430> we<00:05:11.490> go
