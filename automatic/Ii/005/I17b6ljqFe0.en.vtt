00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.619
 here you just looked at the screensaver 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.419
 what do you think this is a game and he even 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.059
 clean I will not let you break all the intrigue mobs 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.309
 dot if by our extremely condolences 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.989
 who knows the worth of such a genre however 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.580
 this game is made a little different 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.110
 direction wait for someone right away 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.269
 jumped to the middle let's better 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.309
 over first this cute cartoon something 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.010
 otherwise for the foot to the game with me 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.750
 We're going to entertain the genre 1 said mob 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.120
 but made in two-dimensional space 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.589
 and decorated from the approach that is 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.480
 get ready to kill mobs and 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.219
 jump a lot and don't know what 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.110
 such a mob I would say this with an example 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.879
 original source but since during my 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.220
 limited immediately get down to business 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.930
 there are two camps yours and your opponent are 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.759
 three heroes from each side they 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.050
 controlled by players through a certain 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.180
 the time interval from the base will be 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.920
 packs of freshly picked robots 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.869
 well or mobs they will be on their line 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.820
 or divided into two groups if not 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.259
 two turrets along the way which 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.810
 automatically attack nearby 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.940
 enemies task to destroy the enemy base 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.470
 In general, this is all not clear so this 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.300
 must be at first don't be scared you 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.780
 take control of one of 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.950
 heroes 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.630
 choose him and a starter kit 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.459
 abilities which you will later 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.349
 open for earn during battle 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:35.720
 solar energy your task becomes 

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:37.160
 help their about boom destruction of enemy 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 turrets and enemy bases 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.390
 you killed the enemy hero your team 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.250
 gets energy in dead and and will get 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.630
 enemies are therefore very important in this genre 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.610
 team action itself therefore 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.440
 she attracts people so much no 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.910
 more such a genre in which strategies 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.830
 coordinated teamwork would 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.660
 more important well, and the champions in it most often 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.739
 the Chinese who did not wait in the factories 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.470
 on assembling Intel's processors 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.660
 probably need to enter it I will just say 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.610
 I want to say that I do not like to poke 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.349
 girl of course as excellent in all 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.630
 senses of your pastime 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.489
 13 heroes each have their own 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.379
 abilities your look your 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.200
 character story even music in the back 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.250
 the plan plays different learn to play 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 tremendous robot who shoot 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.120
 gigantic rockets bite off enemies 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.430
 pieces of flesh by giant jaws 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.230
 please here you like the clan to play 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.030
 role of wendy who is stepping out of invisibility 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.459
 strike enemies with critical hits 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.080
 leh million here h-service think that 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.360
 defense of combat points is your combat 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.500
 vocation well then slug in a robot 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.020
 the name of the seal to pay by your 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.090
 for the dream of life the card is not the same here 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.770
 relies a whole three and all 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.330
 completely different starting just from 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.490
 exterior design ending 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.380
 the location of the turrets and some 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.210
 special chips and it's in the jungle 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.890
 for example, hiding the sun boss 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.170
 giant monster who is in one 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.760
 the player will kill incredibly difficult 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.040
 I will not be able to do this 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.750
 on another map right in the middle lives 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.250
 a giant worm just like in star 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.020
 wars and at the touch of a button he 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.670
 rises to the top and devour all that 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.500
 is on his way on 3 cards 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.420
 initially only one line for fighting but 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.220
 right above it is a low gravity field 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.200
 which transform the scene of the battle chameleons 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.570
 sniper circus performance here 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.620
 no blood says only solar 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.660
 energy only hardcore 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.760
 the characters are releasing funny phrases when 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.560
 any opportunity if the same dota 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.360
 after a couple of games I wanted to play without 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.130
 sound 0 and sit in a trance repeat then 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.959
 here they are really to the point and 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.020
 create an atmosphere a unique atmosphere 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.880
 the very nose of the game that you can seriously 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.100
 play yoko sip talking on 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.380
 skype with my second love well or else 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.310
 better bring 2 joystick and play with 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.320
 screen splitting 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.360
 these guys all thought the game went beyond 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.010
 a relatively long time ago in summer but to me 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.840
 it seems that at least the fact that our 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.940
 days and super monday night combat 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.130
 being paid give food for thought 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.739
 find a lobby right now 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.269
 time from 6 am to 12 pm no problem 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.980
 other time own therefore not 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.260
 checked herself she is a mere penny 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.360
 here you can support the developers 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.950
 buy skins for characters that are all 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.810
 together only to the game itself however 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.120
 no bonuses they give in this game 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.400
 There is all that need achievement table 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.440
 records of the offices are anal and adequate 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.269
 creative community of players development 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.400
 account opening can abilities 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.930
 many character levels and most importantly 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.630
 future plans and I with confidence 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.700
 I declare that this mixture is amazing 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.739
 style them a few genres so for 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.450
 I can open the car last year 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.340
