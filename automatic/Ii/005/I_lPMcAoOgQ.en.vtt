ok when you palm into the body for
instant<00:01:47.520> exactly<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> same<00:01:48.390> way<00:01:48.570> when<00:01:49.020> you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
instant exactly the same way when you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
instant exactly the same way when you
pau<00:01:49.320> mean<00:01:49.530> others<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> same<00:01:50.729> line<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.119> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
pau mean others in the same line of that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.780 
pau mean others in the same line of that
now<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.140> you're<00:01:52.290> blocking<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.640> you're

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
now when you're blocking when you're

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.490 
now when you're blocking when you're
blocking<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> turn<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:55.020> hand<00:01:55.290> in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
blocking you have to turn your hand in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.200 
blocking you have to turn your hand in
adapt<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> full<00:01:56.939> hand

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
adapt because you can have the full hand

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.080 
adapt because you can have the full hand
in<00:01:57.540> there<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> cover<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.590> block<00:01:58.799> ok<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.909> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
in there the cover the block ok so this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.539 
in there the cover the block ok so this
is<00:02:00.270> why<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.719> blocking<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> different<00:02:02.340> lipid

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
is why the blocking is a different lipid

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.520 
is why the blocking is a different lipid
on<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> palming<00:02:03.090> slightly<00:02:03.960> different<00:02:04.350> from

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
on a palming slightly different from

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.690 
on a palming slightly different from
