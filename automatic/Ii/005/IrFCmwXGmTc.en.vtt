00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.879
 hi people is how will gecko 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.040
 you me it's going great 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.620
 and so today good are found 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.989
 for a new tutorial so in this 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.780
 tutorial i'm going to show you how to create 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.449
 your own lobby on gta 5 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 so that's all going to be in several 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.070
 steps whose first as you 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 can see it will happen on pc 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.699
 so you launched an internet page 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.710
 in the time search bar at 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.510
 you will type gta kit pointed at that 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.299
 you have validated dance research 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.490
 you are going to land on this page and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.110
 its 10 6 and 2 is on this page that 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.030
 you have set your own 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.710
 server actually finally that's where 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.659
 you will have a dedicated server at 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.760
 your ip to what I understood is a 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.439
 thing that works pretty much like that so 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.479
 there we can see on the left of the screen 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.490
 on the left of the page everything that binds 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.119
 at parametric so seven bars and his 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
 health bar 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.450
 so laurent godmode with apples cochet 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 just below so at a life 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.749
 normal times a hundred thousand necessarily 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.490
 godmode so here I check the barge is 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.490
 underneath as it's written a it's 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.350
 to multiply wide online this is the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.590
 duplicator for multiplier for 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.030
 the money is there for the xp poles so 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.369
 for peace is what I want 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.719
 Council to what it is that I 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.969
 counted counselor actually it's from 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.560
 put about a shot from there and 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.710
 even from there you will realize 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.359
 that it's too much actually I think we 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.329
 will say go to one-tenth of the bar 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.159
 it's more than enough for xp 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.899
 then small box below both 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.119
 which are all alone list below it 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.340
 do not get unchecked and all those who 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.400
 are ticked right after that actually it's 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.020
 all that comes so hairdresser 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.220
 concession thatcher stores the boxes 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.540
 still below that is all that is 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.150
 going internally is so to buy 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.760
 the cars boats helicopter motorcycles 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.230
 everything that follows then and two 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 last boxes so the one that is in 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.240
 below is not having snow and on 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.660
 the map 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.190
 and it's just above I do not know anymore 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.290
 so once you've set 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.540
 all this you will click on save all 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.480
 at the bottom of the top it will be registered 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.730
 success if its mark error is that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.080
 you put too big values 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.970
 you start again by lowering the values 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.860
 in your stuff so a fault is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.069
 scored successful success you're going to have 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.510
 the dns so there for me it was the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.700
 535 59.1 in secondary school in primary 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.379
 pardon and in the secondary the same thing where 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.269
 the heroes so I had to put the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.010
 same thing in high school in primary 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.079
 because the heroes did not work 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.450
 not good but do not try to master 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.989
 waiter there it will not work for you 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.900
 we really have to do each other our otherwise 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.269
 I try to do the same for many 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.159
 people it did not work so that's it 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.620
 once you have the dns is good 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.819
 meal these are the network settings of 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.549
 the console so I'm a cable and 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.250
 configure the network dns settings 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.019
 so I'm sorry I wanted to do 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.370
 epic watch is Rome and I missed a 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.219
 cable with me cakes that me 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.420
 allowed to record on ps3 I did not 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:43.680
 not found I do not know what I have 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.290
 damn so you will see that for xbox one 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.730
 Once you have returned both dns 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.780
 a primary and secondary 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.909
 well you have just validated 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.890
 by pressing done to save 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:04:01.230
 by a m so me I get the same in 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.209
 secondary because I had tried with 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.209
 the 4 0 but it did not work 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:17.690
 so the first and the second 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.150
 535-59.1 that is there at the clip ends 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.400
 and we find ourselves unemployed 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.949
 so we will start with a small 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.050
 robbery 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.900
 I wanted to show that I am level 4 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.240
 or May 5 follows level 5 have the money there 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:41.050
 not bad and you'll see it's going 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.050
 ride a small robbery 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.430
 yeah I was a little buggy it was not good 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.430
 in front of the screen when I was playing the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.230
 senior management the cash is there like 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.360
 you can see looking already loving 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.740
 level just by opening the crate and 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.400
 you can see the money that shows 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.660
 so 342000 more does not know how much 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.910
 I too did not you just 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.840
 see that it works well 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.430
 then then there I had a surprise 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.050
 as you can see I had three 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.600
 stars so there I had stopped 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.940
 to record I had 6.8 in the ass I 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.270
 sowed the cops and from there I got 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.530
 found at level 350 so I got 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.540
 says that if it was a race is over 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.040
 I'm going to get past the sunrise 2009 is banned 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.480
 so here I will not show you 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.970
 trying to actually making race 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.500
 so had to redo a little robbery and I 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.480
 want to show a fault that jaurÃ¨s 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.210
 but the cops the levels how are 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.670
 climb a little flared minigun way 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.230
 it's really that I'm at 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.580
 high level 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.430
 I redo my little turning the reveals 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.200
 at level 457 strong it's my little 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.550
 robbery after I had sown the cops and 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.590
 you will see the number of levels that 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.690
 I take I even stopped the party 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.580
 even before it stops climbing 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.390
 so in my opinion when I'm going to reignite 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.690
 the console is this profile my opinion 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.690
 would be banned 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.930
 that's why you must not be too 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.850
 greedy parameterizing the xp it takes 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.370
 really honest I think a tenth 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.160
 from there I think that a tenth game 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.660
 should be fine because I had seen it at 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.910
 put a quarter of the bar but it shows 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.070
 too fast and it's huge 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.830
 so here I am hidden it was not long before 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.120
 finish and look at it 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.830
 alas the levels I can tell you 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.250
 that they will be chained I left the 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.950
 part 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.290
 it goes up again roger how's that 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.800
 stopped but well I might have 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.960
 surprises 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.500
 so I repeat myself but do not be too 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.000
 gourmand sion and equip it and apart from that 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.070
 I will give links the description 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.230
 to join the right page for 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.120
 set up servers is safe this 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.710
 badge hope I have not forgotten anything 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.500
