00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.999 
and now they try and launch the counter
maybe<00:05:13.400> a<00:05:13.550> chance<00:05:13.820> for<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.030> shot<00:05:14.240> here<00:05:14.860> right<00:05:15.860> now

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
maybe a chance for a shot here right now

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:24.219 
maybe a chance for a shot here right now
there<00:05:17.650> are<00:05:18.650> another<00:05:19.070> own<00:05:19.759> go<00:05:20.120> there<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.990> old

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
there are another own go there that old

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.629 
there are another own go there that old
goal<00:05:24.440> could<00:05:24.590> really<00:05:24.860> take<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.250> wind<00:05:25.460> out<00:05:25.580> of

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.449 

a<00:05:36.139> comfortable<00:05:37.139> lead<00:05:37.349> when<00:05:38.069> they<00:05:38.189> try<00:05:38.399> and

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:38.459 
a comfortable lead when they try and

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.359 
a comfortable lead when they try and
build<00:05:38.819> on<00:05:38.999> it<00:05:39.029> I<00:05:39.649> think<00:05:40.649> this<00:05:40.769> team<00:05:41.039> got<00:05:41.219> the

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:41.369 
build on it I think this team got the

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:43.789 
build on it I think this team got the
tactics<00:05:41.879> absolutely<00:05:42.839> right<00:05:43.049> extended<00:05:43.739> the

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:43.799 
tactics absolutely right extended the

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:45.469 
tactics absolutely right extended the
lead<00:05:44.009> to<00:05:44.159> two<00:05:44.399> in<00:05:44.549> the<00:05:44.639> first<00:05:44.909> many<00:05:45.239> of<00:05:45.389> the

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
lead to two in the first many of the

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:51.170 
lead to two in the first many of the
second<00:05:45.869> half

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:59.519
