was<00:00:53.489> Fitch<00:00:53.699> fixed<00:00:54.480> by<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> patch<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
was Fitch fixed by a patch but the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
was Fitch fixed by a patch but the
solution<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.199> found<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.340> doing<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.000> is

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
solution I found for me doing this is is

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.049 
solution I found for me doing this is is
I<00:01:00.899> obviously<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.949> wanted<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> record<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> put

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
I obviously I wanted to record and put

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.990 
I obviously I wanted to record and put
on<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.300> YouTube<00:01:03.629> channel<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:05.000> essentially

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
on this YouTube channel but essentially

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.679 
on this YouTube channel but essentially
I<00:01:06.210> used<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> story<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.640> bread<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.330> saw

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
I used it a story and the bread I saw

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
I used it a story and the bread I saw
used<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.799> using<00:01:11.010> dear<00:01:11.220> story<00:01:11.490> as
