battery after a quick test with a test
meter<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.810> imagine<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.560> long<00:03:22.710> term

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980

meter so I imagine in the long term
battery<00:03:23.640> changes<00:03:24.000> won't<00:03:24.300> be<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> common<00:03:24.840> thing
