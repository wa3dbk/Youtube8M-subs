like<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.650> healthy<00:03:31.920> for<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.100> story<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.520> we

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
like this healthy for the story that we

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.250 
like this healthy for the story that we
did<00:03:32.790> use<00:03:32.970> actually<00:03:33.330> escape<00:03:33.630> war<00:03:33.840> at<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.050> point

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
did use actually escape war at one point

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.750 
did use actually escape war at one point
and<00:03:34.590> she<00:03:34.890> fell<00:03:35.070> off<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.250> few<00:03:35.490> too<00:03:35.580> many<00:03:35.610> times

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.910 
and she fell off a few too many times
and<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.360> we<00:03:36.750> tried<00:03:37.110> strapping<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.650> her<00:03:37.800> we

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
and so we tried strapping it to her we

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.840 
and so we tried strapping it to her we
tried<00:03:38.070> all<00:03:38.130> kinds<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.490> different<00:03:38.580> ways<00:03:38.820> to

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850
