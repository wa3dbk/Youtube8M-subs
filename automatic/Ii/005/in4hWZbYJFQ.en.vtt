00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
sort of going to be taken care of by

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.390 
sort of going to be taken care of by
this<00:02:14.629> technique<00:02:15.470> as<00:02:15.680> well<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.310> don't

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
this technique as well so you don't

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.800 
this technique as well so you don't
really<00:02:16.549> need<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.819> worry<00:02:16.940> about<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.299> okay

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
really need to worry about that okay

really need to worry about that okay
stop<00:02:18.170> your<00:02:18.379> will<00:02:19.690> gently<00:02:20.690> mark<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.830> very<00:02:22.280> light

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
stop your will gently mark a very light

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.479 
stop your will gently mark a very light
X<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.930> top<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.470> your<00:02:24.680> pot<00:02:25.030> with<00:02:26.030> your<00:02:26.209> wire

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
X in the top of your pot with your wire

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.690 
X in the top of your pot with your wire
now<00:02:29.590> wrap<00:02:30.590> your<00:02:30.769> wire<00:02:30.799> nice<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.489> tight<00:02:31.670> like

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
now wrap your wire nice and tight like

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.600 
now wrap your wire nice and tight like
dental<00:02:32.150> floss<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.989> we're<00:02:33.560> going<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.799> carve

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
dental floss and we're going to carve

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.539 
dental floss and we're going to carve
out<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:36.170> we're<00:02:36.349> going<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.500> leave<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:37.130> little

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
out so we're going to leave a little

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.670 
out so we're going to leave a little
chunk<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.299> clay<00:02:38.450> about<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.660> centimeter<00:02:39.170> wide<00:02:39.260> on

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
chunk of clay about a centimeter wide on

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.009 
chunk of clay about a centimeter wide on
each<00:02:39.829> side<00:02:40.160> on<00:02:40.519> each<00:02:40.700> corner<00:02:41.329> of<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.599> rim<00:02:41.780> and

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
each side on each corner of the rim and

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.750 
each side on each corner of the rim and
we're<00:02:42.590> going<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.739> just<00:02:42.920> slice<00:02:43.160> out<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> nice

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
we're going to just slice out a nice

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.539 
we're going to just slice out a nice
little<00:02:44.269> arc<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:52.160> want<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.400> get

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
little arc like that you want to get

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.229 
little arc like that you want to get
these<00:02:53.560> as<00:02:54.560> close<00:02:54.860> as<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.190> can<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.459> get<00:02:55.910> around

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
these as close as you can to get around

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.920 
these as close as you can to get around
it<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.510> even<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.549> not<00:02:58.910> super<00:02:59.569> critical

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it and even but it is not super critical

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.479 
it and even but it is not super critical
that<00:03:00.319> they<00:03:00.500> are<00:03:00.560> perfect<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.069> want<00:03:07.430> to

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
that they are perfect you just want to

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.160 
that they are perfect you just want to
try<00:03:07.609> and<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:07.910> them<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.269> consistent<00:03:09.139> as

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
try and have them as consistent as

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.540 
try and have them as consistent as
possible

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.190 
want to do this and this can be done on
very<00:03:38.489> large<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:39.090> there's<00:03:39.420> under<00:03:39.750> showing<00:03:40.110> you

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
very large so there's under showing you

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.190 
very large so there's under showing you
on<00:03:40.319> this<00:03:40.470> small<00:03:40.799> as<00:03:41.129> a<00:03:41.190> easy<00:03:41.760> example<00:03:42.360> what<00:03:43.079> I'm

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
on this small as a easy example what I'm

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.050 
on this small as a easy example what I'm
going<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.409> do<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.190> don't<00:03:44.310> need<00:03:44.459> water<00:03:44.700> for

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
going to do you don't need water for

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.880 
going to do you don't need water for
this<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.480> will<00:03:45.660> work<00:03:45.780> without<00:03:46.170> water<00:03:46.379> and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
this this will work without water and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.619 
this this will work without water and
place<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.400> into<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.760> pot<00:03:48.030> here<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.540> I'm

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
place this into the pot here and I'm

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.259 
place this into the pot here and I'm
going<00:03:48.870> I'm<00:03:49.079> not<00:03:49.230> pressing<00:03:49.590> downward<00:03:50.010> much<00:03:51.000> a

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
going I'm not pressing downward much a

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.740 
going I'm not pressing downward much a
little<00:03:51.569> bit<00:03:51.720> if<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.950> need<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:53.849> mostly<00:03:54.359> I'm

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
little bit if you need to but mostly I'm

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:03.480 
little bit if you need to but mostly I'm
just<00:03:54.859> levering<00:03:55.859> this<00:03:56.099> stick<00:03:56.459> outward

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.790 

I'm<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:04.300> going<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.540> keep<00:04:04.780> pushing<00:04:06.030> and

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
I'm just going to keep pushing and

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.020 
I'm just going to keep pushing and
sometimes<00:04:08.800> you<00:04:09.010> might<00:04:09.190> need<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.550> check<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
sometimes you might need to check and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.810 
sometimes you might need to check and
stop<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:10.840> check<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:12.280> make<00:04:12.310> sure<00:04:12.640> you're

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
stop and check it to make sure you're

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.330 
stop and check it to make sure you're
not<00:04:13.000> tearing<00:04:13.840> now<00:04:14.470> yeah<00:04:14.710> I'm<00:04:14.830> getting<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:15.310> the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
not tearing now yeah I'm getting to the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.120 
not tearing now yeah I'm getting to the
point<00:04:15.580> where<00:04:15.790> it's<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:16.000> little<00:04:16.330> thin<00:04:16.890> out<00:04:17.890> on

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
point where it's a little thin out on

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.990 
point where it's a little thin out on
the<00:04:18.220> edges<00:04:18.520> here<00:04:18.550> so<00:04:18.850> I'm<00:04:19.060> going<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.360> quit

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
the edges here so I'm going to quit

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.430 
the edges here so I'm going to quit
although<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.030> should<00:04:22.270> have<00:04:22.390> left<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.170> little

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
although I should have left it a little

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.360 
although I should have left it a little
thicker<00:04:23.770> slick<00:04:24.190> I've<00:04:24.760> gotten<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.150> little<00:04:25.360> wider

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
thicker slick I've gotten a little wider

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.010 
thicker slick I've gotten a little wider
just<00:04:27.370> push<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.910> envelope<00:04:28.270> here<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.570> little<00:04:28.810> bit

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
just push the envelope here a little bit

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.560 
just push the envelope here a little bit
the<00:04:29.710> trick<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.160> if<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.460> go<00:04:30.610> too<00:04:30.670> far<00:04:31.150> then

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
the trick is if you go too far then

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.970 
the trick is if you go too far then
you'll<00:04:31.660> wind<00:04:31.840> up<00:04:31.960> really<00:04:32.350> tearing<00:04:32.800> these

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
you'll wind up really tearing these

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.600 
you'll wind up really tearing these
edges<00:04:33.370> because<00:04:33.580> these<00:04:33.700> are<00:04:33.880> real<00:04:34.090> thin<00:04:34.360> and

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
edges because these are real thin and

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.790 
edges because these are real thin and
causing<00:04:36.610> yourself<00:04:36.670> problems<00:04:40.350> now<00:04:41.350> I'm<00:04:41.530> going

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
causing yourself problems now I'm going

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:56.240 
causing yourself problems now I'm going
to<00:04:41.980> smooth<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.490> inside

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.690 

and<00:04:56.760> then<00:04:56.910> go<00:04:57.090> very<00:04:57.450> slowly<00:04:57.990> very<00:04:59.540> slowly<00:05:00.540> and

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
and then go very slowly very slowly and

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:18.960 
and then go very slowly very slowly and
just<00:05:02.700> glide<00:05:03.150> this<00:05:06.710> damp<00:05:07.710> sponge<00:05:08.070> over<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.790> rim

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.700 

yeah<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.000> did<00:05:20.479> get<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.900> little<00:05:21.139> too<00:05:21.380> thin<00:05:21.680> so

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
yeah I did get it a little too thin so

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.170 
yeah I did get it a little too thin so
I'm<00:05:22.069> actually<00:05:22.220> gonna<00:05:22.580> travel<00:05:22.910> a<00:05:23.060> little

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
I'm actually gonna travel a little

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:46.389 
I'm actually gonna travel a little
business<00:05:24.100> in<00:05:25.100> towards<00:05:25.850> peace<00:05:26.539> off

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:46.399 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.820 

then<00:05:46.639> we'll<00:05:46.759> go<00:05:46.879> back<00:05:47.089> to<00:05:47.389> our<00:05:47.419> smoothing<00:05:48.080> very

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
then we'll go back to our smoothing very

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.549 
then we'll go back to our smoothing very
slow<00:05:49.189> move<00:05:49.879> the<00:05:50.029> wheel<00:05:50.509> slow<00:05:50.899> as<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.139> possibly

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:51.559 
slow move the wheel slow as you possibly

00:05:51.559 --> 00:06:53.190 
slow move the wheel slow as you possibly
can

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.050 

well<00:06:54.200> that's<00:06:54.380> essentially<00:06:55.040> it<00:06:55.160> kind<00:06:55.880> of<00:06:55.970> a

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
well that's essentially it kind of a

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.740 
well that's essentially it kind of a
quick<00:06:56.330> and<00:06:56.570> dirty<00:06:57.970> stretched<00:06:58.970> out<00:06:59.240> square

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
quick and dirty stretched out square

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.080 
quick and dirty stretched out square
plate
