00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.550 

after<00:00:03.510> you<00:00:03.570> learn<00:00:03.720> board<00:00:03.959> sides<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.380> think<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
after you learn board sides I think the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.010 
after you learn board sides I think the
next<00:00:04.770> thing<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.950> online<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> lipslide

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
next thing you online is a lipslide

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.600 
next thing you online is a lipslide
lipslide<00:00:07.020> similar<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.440> boardslide<00:00:07.710> but<00:00:08.519> you

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
lipslide similar to boardslide but you

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.600 
lipslide similar to boardslide but you
actually<00:00:08.760> all<00:00:09.059> 8<00:00:09.269> 180<00:00:10.219> into<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> boardslide

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
actually all 8 180 into the boardslide

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.140 
actually all 8 180 into the boardslide
so<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.660> frontside<00:00:13.110> lipslide<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.889> actually<00:00:14.340> ends

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
so a frontside lipslide is actually ends

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.550 
so a frontside lipslide is actually ends
up<00:00:15.240> like<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> backside<00:00:15.870> boardslide<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.470> we're

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
up like a backside boardslide and we're

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.630 
up like a backside boardslide and we're
going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> pyramid<00:00:17.369> here

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
going to do it on the pyramid here

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.560 
going to do it on the pyramid here
because<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> think<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> little<00:00:18.150> easier<00:00:18.390> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
because I think it's a little easier to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.560 
because I think it's a little easier to
get<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> lift<00:00:19.109> off<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> ramp<00:00:20.330> lube<00:00:21.330> slides

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
get the lift off of the ramp lube slides

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.750 
get the lift off of the ramp lube slides
can<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.810> done<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.109> hand<00:00:22.380> rails<00:00:22.590> ledges<00:00:22.949> benches

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
can be done on hand rails ledges benches

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.849 
can be done on hand rails ledges benches
and<00:00:23.939> ramps<00:00:24.949> ok<00:00:25.949> key<00:00:26.730> factors<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> lipslide

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
and ramps ok key factors to lipslide

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.779 
and ramps ok key factors to lipslide
first<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> want<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.369> make<00:00:29.460> sure<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
first of all you want to make sure that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.700 
first of all you want to make sure that
you<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:30.000> i<00:00:30.210> light<00:00:30.420> over<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> rail<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.230> this

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you can i light over the rail and this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.590 
you can i light over the rail and this
is<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> same<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> boardslide<00:00:33.149> but

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
is this is the same as a boardslide but

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.560 
is this is the same as a boardslide but
only<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> lien<00:00:34.320> over<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.790> 180<00:00:36.090> over<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
only a lien over so all in 180 over so

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.400 
only a lien over so all in 180 over so
you<00:00:36.630> got<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.840> make<00:00:36.930> sure<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.320> actually

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
you got to make sure you can actually

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.780 
you got to make sure you can actually
clear<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> obstacle<00:00:38.010> you're<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> try

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
clear the obstacle you're going to try

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.819 
clear the obstacle you're going to try
it<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.969> approach<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> obstacle<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> slight

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
it on approach the obstacle at a slight

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
it on approach the obstacle at a slight
angle<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.399> start<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:41.940> ollie<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
angle and start your ollie so that you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
angle and start your ollie so that you
have<00:00:42.899> enough<00:00:42.930> distance<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.950> time<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.520> clear

rail as you come off the rail turn your
board<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.539> full<00:00:54.809> 90<00:00:55.050> degrees<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.410> order<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
board the full 90 degrees in order to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
board the full 90 degrees in order to
write<00:00:56.039> down<00:00:56.250> straight<00:00:56.640> avoid<00:00:57.059> landing

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
write down straight avoid landing

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
write down straight avoid landing
sideways<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> kick<00:00:58.530> turning<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> rest<00:00:59.100> of

sideways and kick turning the rest of

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
sideways and kick turning the rest of
the<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.120> will<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.359> much<00:01:00.660> harder<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the way as it will be much harder to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.560 
the way as it will be much harder to
land<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.410> higher<00:01:01.559> speeds<00:01:05.390> alright<00:01:06.390> some

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
land at higher speeds alright some

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
land at higher speeds alright some
common<00:01:06.869> mistakes<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.320> lipslides<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.040> think

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
common mistakes with lipslides I think

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
common mistakes with lipslides I think
the<00:01:08.670> most<00:01:08.880> common<00:01:09.299> which<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.049> done<00:01:10.170> many

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the most common which I have done many

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
the most common which I have done many
times<00:01:10.650> Brian<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.280> demonstrated<00:01:11.909> when<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
times Brian just demonstrated when you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
times Brian just demonstrated when you
ollie<00:01:12.510> too<00:01:12.810> close<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> rail<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.890> don't

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
ollie too close to the rail you don't

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.679 
ollie too close to the rail you don't
give<00:01:14.159> your<00:01:14.280> tail<00:01:14.580> enough<00:01:14.939> time<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.299> clear<00:01:15.570> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
give your tail enough time to clear it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
give your tail enough time to clear it
before<00:01:16.229> you're<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.439> getting<00:01:16.680> over<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
before you're actually getting over it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.469 
before you're actually getting over it
you<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> make<00:01:17.759> sure<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.000> own<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.270> little

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
you got to make sure you own a little

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.969 
you got to make sure you own a little
bit<00:01:18.600> further<00:01:18.750> away<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.680> you're<00:01:19.740> doing<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
bit further away and when you're doing a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.340 
bit further away and when you're doing a
boardslide<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:21.090> enough<00:01:21.330> time<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.110> give<00:01:22.229> your

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
boardslide but enough time to give your

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.590 
boardslide but enough time to give your
vac<00:01:23.009> trucks<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> clear<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> whole<00:01:23.850> thing<00:01:24.090> it's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
vac trucks to clear the whole thing it's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.850 
vac trucks to clear the whole thing it's
almost<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.200> about<00:01:25.409> trying<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
almost like think about trying to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.469 
almost like think about trying to
lipslide<00:01:26.070> something<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.939> you're<00:01:27.390> not

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
lipslide something this I you're not

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
lipslide something this I you're not
going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> ollie<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
going to ollie up there so you want to

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.310 
going to ollie up there so you want to
feel<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:29.939> yeah<00:01:30.210> overcompensate<00:01:31.110> your

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
feel to all yeah overcompensate your

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
feel to all yeah overcompensate your
ollie<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.799> think<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.400> how<00:01:32.549> high<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
ollie I think about how high the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
leaning too far forward because you've

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.770 
leaning too far forward because you've
been<00:01:40.860> focusing<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.579> much<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.000> ollie<00:01:42.150> you
