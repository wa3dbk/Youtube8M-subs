00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
so let's just move on from there the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.609 
so let's just move on from there the
sc-2010<00:00:51.979> has<00:00:52.549> damage<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.210> 35<00:00:53.869> up<00:00:54.049> close<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.559> it

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
sc-2010 has damage of 35 up close and it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.100

has a drop-off of 20 at a distance is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.630 
has a drop-off of 20 at a distance is
not<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:57.530> bad<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.040> actually<00:00:58.309> pretty<00:00:58.549> decent

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
not that bad it's actually pretty decent

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.189 
not that bad it's actually pretty decent
compared<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.390> some<00:00:59.510> of<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.689> other<00:00:59.809> assault

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199

rifles<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.589> call<00:01:00.769> duty<00:01:00.949> ghosts<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:01.970> just

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
rifles and call duty ghosts so this just

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.880 
rifles and call duty ghosts so this just
means<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.720> because<00:01:02.839> it<00:01:03.110> does<00:01:03.290> do<00:01:03.470> that<00:01:03.680> kind

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
means that because it does do that kind

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.679 
means that because it does do that kind
of<00:01:03.979> lower<00:01:04.220> end<00:01:04.519> damage<00:01:04.970> it's<00:01:05.360> gonna<00:01:05.449> be<00:01:05.659> a

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
of lower end damage it's gonna be a

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.320 
of lower end damage it's gonna be a
three<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.260> five<00:01:06.500> shot<00:01:06.799> kill<00:01:07.040> weapon<00:01:07.490> now<00:01:08.180> one

this time to kill and decrease the

to 4 shot kill weapon it's gonna be a

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.840 
to 4 shot kill weapon it's gonna be a
very<00:01:23.780> usable<00:01:24.109> weapon<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.799> use<00:01:25.009> at<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> distance

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
very usable weapon to use at a distance

very usable weapon to use at a distance
the<00:01:26.090> sc-2010

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
the sc-2010

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.859 
the sc-2010
has<00:01:27.439> a<00:01:27.469> fire<00:01:27.890> rate<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.299> 750<00:01:29.299> rounds<00:01:29.450> per<00:01:29.630> minute

has a fire rate of 750 rounds per minute

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.840 
has a fire rate of 750 rounds per minute
this<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.259> about<00:01:30.499> average<00:01:30.920> for<00:01:30.950> assault<00:01:31.429> rifles

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
this is about average for assault rifles

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.190 
this is about average for assault rifles
I'd<00:01:32.030> say<00:01:32.179> it's<00:01:32.329> a<00:01:32.390> little<00:01:32.420> bit<00:01:32.689> on<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.929> slower

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
I'd say it's a little bit on the slower

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.870 
I'd say it's a little bit on the slower
end<00:01:33.469> although<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.070> does<00:01:34.219> feel<00:01:34.429> like<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:34.670> shoots

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
end although it does feel like it shoots

end although it does feel like it shoots
faster<00:01:35.299> I<00:01:35.329> don't<00:01:35.569> know<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:35.810> kind<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.079> weird

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
faster I don't know it's kind of weird

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.450 
faster I don't know it's kind of weird

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
like it's shooting a little faster but

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.410 
like it's shooting a little faster but
it<00:01:39.289> does<00:01:39.439> shoot<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.819> 750<00:01:40.819> rounds<00:01:40.969> per<00:01:41.179> minute

it does shoot a 750 rounds per minute
well<00:01:41.899> now<00:01:42.020> one<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.350> upsides<00:01:42.679> of<00:01:42.950> having<00:01:43.310> a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350

than some of the other assault rifles

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.940 
than some of the other assault rifles
means<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.359> do<00:01:47.569> have<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> lower<00:01:48.590> and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
means that you do have a lower and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.469 
means that you do have a lower and
recoil<00:01:49.670> which<00:01:49.850> means<00:01:50.090> you're<00:01:50.240> gonna<00:01:50.329> be

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
recoil which means you're gonna be

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.999 
recoil which means you're gonna be
staying<00:01:50.689> on<00:01:50.840> target<00:01:51.020> especially<00:01:51.770> from<00:01:51.920> a

staying on target especially from a

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.950 
staying on target especially from a
distance<00:01:52.429> it's<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:52.969> great<00:01:53.179> weapon<00:01:53.509> for<00:01:53.539> someone

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
distance it's a great weapon for someone

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.020 
distance it's a great weapon for someone
who's<00:01:54.109> not<00:01:54.319> really<00:01:54.469> good<00:01:54.740> with<00:01:54.789> recoil<00:01:55.789> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
who's not really good with recoil and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.639 
who's not really good with recoil and
visual<00:01:56.420> kick<00:01:56.719> and<00:01:56.899> all<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.139> that<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.409> if<00:01:57.530> you're

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
visual kick and all of that so if you're

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:58.809 
visual kick and all of that so if you're
the<00:01:57.710> kind<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.920> person<00:01:57.979> who<00:01:58.280> gets<00:01:58.399> distracted

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
the kind of person who gets distracted

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.849 
the kind of person who gets distracted
easily<00:01:59.119> by<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.479> moving<00:01:59.719> gun<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:00.619> can't

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
easily by a moving gun and you can't

stay<00:02:01.069> on<00:02:01.159> point

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
stay on point

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.639 
stay on point
I<00:02:01.670> recommend<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.270> sc-2010<00:02:02.780> sense<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.530> has

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
I recommend the sc-2010 sense it has

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.080 
I recommend the sc-2010 sense it has
very<00:02:04.069> low<00:02:04.399> recoil

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
very low recoil

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.120 
very low recoil

now if the stats out of the way for the

same<00:02:14.900> thing<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.410> mostly<00:02:15.920> an<00:02:16.100> average<00:02:16.460> for

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
down to a two to four so it's gonna be a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.080 
down to a two to four so it's gonna be a
really<00:03:03.709> good<00:03:03.830> weapon<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.310> use<00:03:04.520> if<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:04.880> want<00:03:04.910> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
really good weapon to use if you want to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.340 
really good weapon to use if you want to
use<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.330> up<00:03:05.420> close<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.840> try<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.020> go<00:03:06.170> for

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
use it up close and try to go for

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.020 
use it up close and try to go for
headshots<00:03:06.500> at<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.010> distance<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.550> would<00:03:07.700> say<00:03:07.880> try

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
headshots at a distance I would say try

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.940 
headshots at a distance I would say try
to<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.600> know<00:03:08.720> focus<00:03:09.080> more<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.530> actually

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
to you know focus more on actually

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.620 
to you know focus more on actually
getting<00:03:10.100> hits<00:03:10.490> on<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.820> body<00:03:11.030> than<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.420> head

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630

foregrip to the weapon but it's still

foregrip to the weapon but it's still
pretty<00:03:44.150> noticeable<00:03:44.540> for<00:03:45.410> someone<00:03:45.830> who<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.250> not

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
very good with maintaining accuracy so

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.040 
very good with maintaining accuracy so
if<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.220> are<00:03:49.519> able<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.850> control<00:03:50.180> accuracy<00:03:50.780> at

if you are able to control accuracy at

if you are able to control accuracy at
least<00:03:51.320> somewhat<00:03:51.860> decently<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.580> this<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:52.790> a

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
least somewhat decently that this is a

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.610 
least somewhat decently that this is a
great<00:03:53.120> weapon<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.420> use<00:03:53.660> since<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.380> has<00:03:54.470> that

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
great weapon to use since I has that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.920 
great weapon to use since I has that
faster<00:03:54.980> firing<00:03:55.220> rate<00:03:55.550> it<00:03:55.850> makes<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.239> a<00:03:56.360> faster

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
faster firing rate it makes it a faster

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.900 
faster firing rate it makes it a faster
time<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.290> kill<00:03:57.650> weapon<00:03:57.890> than<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.370> sc-2010

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910

are you more of a sc-2010 kind of person

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.270 
are you more of a sc-2010 kind of person
with<00:04:08.959> lower<00:04:09.140> recoil<00:04:09.680> or<00:04:09.890> do<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:10.130> prefer

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
with lower recoil or do you prefer

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.949 
with lower recoil or do you prefer
having<00:04:10.640> a<00:04:10.850> little<00:04:11.090> bit<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.330> faster<00:04:11.690> firing

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
having a little bit of a faster firing

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.229 
having a little bit of a faster firing
rate<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:13.010> in<00:04:13.220> turn<00:04:13.430> having<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.820> little<00:04:14.120> bit

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
more recoil with these cz 805 anyways

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.580 
more recoil with these cz 805 anyways
guys<00:04:17.299> with<00:04:17.479> that<00:04:17.660> being<00:04:17.840> said<00:04:17.930> in<00:04:18.320> my<00:04:18.470> opinion

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
guys with that being said in my opinion

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.650 
guys with that being said in my opinion
the<00:04:19.130> better<00:04:19.430> assault<00:04:19.850> rifle<00:04:20.180> between<00:04:20.299> these

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
the better assault rifle between these

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.250 
the better assault rifle between these
two<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.229> going<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:21.950> be<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.520> sc-2010<00:04:23.300> now<00:04:24.200> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
two is going to be the sc-2010 now the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.020 
two is going to be the sc-2010 now the
only<00:04:24.470> reason<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:24.860> say<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.070> is<00:04:25.250> because<00:04:25.400> even

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
only reason I say this is because even

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.690 
only reason I say this is because even
though<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.510> cz<00:04:27.110> 805<00:04:27.320> does<00:04:27.890> more<00:04:28.100> damage<00:04:28.520> and

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
though the cz 805 does more damage and

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.130 
though the cz 805 does more damage and
even<00:04:29.390> though<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.630> does<00:04:29.750> fire<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.020> little<00:04:30.320> bit

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
even though it does fire a little bit

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.260 
even though it does fire a little bit
just<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.530> fact<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.010> sc-2010<00:04:32.550> can<00:04:33.090> keep

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
just the fact that the sc-2010 can keep

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.000 
just the fact that the sc-2010 can keep
up<00:04:33.480> with<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.020> still<00:04:34.350> be<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> lot<00:04:34.830> more

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
up with it and still be a lot more

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.220 
up with it and still be a lot more
accurate<00:04:35.490> than<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.790> cz<00:04:36.060> 805<00:04:36.360> at<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.870> distance

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
accurate than the cz 805 at a distance

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.440 
accurate than the cz 805 at a distance
makes<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.740> more<00:04:38.130> viable<00:04:38.370> choice<00:04:38.760> for<00:04:38.790> the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
makes it a more viable choice for the

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.300 
makes it a more viable choice for the
fact<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.750> in<00:04:39.960> assault<00:04:40.290> rifle<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.770> do<00:04:40.920> mostly

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
fact that in assault rifle you do mostly

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.640 
fact that in assault rifle you do mostly
use<00:04:41.520> at<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.760> distance<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.450> with<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.020> sc-2010

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
use at a distance and with the sc-2010

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.410 
use at a distance and with the sc-2010
you're<00:04:44.160> gonna<00:04:44.250> be<00:04:44.430> staying<00:04:44.670> on<00:04:44.790> target<00:04:45.060> like

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
you're gonna be staying on target like

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.180 
you're gonna be staying on target like
it's<00:04:45.630> like<00:04:46.080> it's<00:04:46.260> nobody's<00:04:46.470> business<00:04:46.890> is

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
it's like it's nobody's business is

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.890 
it's like it's nobody's business is
gonna<00:04:47.310> be<00:04:47.490> crazy<00:04:47.700> how<00:04:48.000> accurate<00:04:48.450> this<00:04:48.540> weapon

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
gonna be crazy how accurate this weapon

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.440 
gonna be crazy how accurate this weapon
is<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.770> even<00:04:50.160> though<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.850> three<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.270> five

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
is so even though it is a three to five

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.450 
is so even though it is a three to five
shot<00:04:51.720> kill<00:04:51.930> weapon<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.410> accuracy<00:04:53.100> more<00:04:53.310> than

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
shot kill weapon the accuracy more than

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.730 
shot kill weapon the accuracy more than
anything<00:04:53.850> makes<00:04:54.300> up<00:04:54.510> for<00:04:54.720> its<00:04:54.810> flaws<00:04:55.110> but

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
anything makes up for its flaws but

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.780 
anything makes up for its flaws but
anyways<00:04:56.040> this<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.310> just<00:04:56.550> my<00:04:56.670> opinion

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
anyways this is just my opinion

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.970 
anyways this is just my opinion
depending<00:04:57.780> on<00:04:57.870> what<00:04:58.050> map<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.440> are<00:04:58.530> playing<00:04:58.800> on

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
depending on what map you are playing on

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.280 
depending on what map you are playing on
you<00:04:59.130> could<00:04:59.280> switch<00:04:59.490> between<00:04:59.700> the<00:05:00.000> 2d<00:05:00.330> cz<00:05:00.780> 2010

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
you could switch between the 2d cz 2010

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.960 
you could switch between the 2d cz 2010
is<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.500> better<00:05:01.680> weapon<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.130> use<00:05:02.280> up<00:05:02.430> close<00:05:02.670> and
