00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello with you Elena and good 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.010
 recipes today are cooking carrots by 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.140
 Korean 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.210
 I want to immediately warn it is not Korean 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.309
 dish as it may seem from the title 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.890
 actually korean carrot 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.589
 came up with in the Soviet Union namely 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.849
 veto in middle asia at least 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.119
 us in Uzbekistan 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.589
 it was a very common dish and 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.609
 traded this korean carrot 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.999
 Koreans immigrants in the market could 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.399
 buy 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:37.190
 Korean carrot mostly with them 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.769
 for those who have claims that it 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.859
 dish is not Korean know that this is the case 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.859
 there is 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 for cooking Korean carrot 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.980
 where 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.739
 just use this kind of grater 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.570
 the easiest and fastest way but if u 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.449
 you do not have a Korean grater can do 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.180
 differently if you have vegetables cleaning 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.190
 then you can cut it 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 carrots with thin stripes using 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.460
 cleaning vegetables 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:22.800
 and then with a knife 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:25.110
 cut these strips into strips of course 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.860
 it will not be as neat and small as 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 grated should be quite good if u 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.959
 you no no grater bottom cleaning when 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.479
 have to cut carrots by hand 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.670
 thin straws 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.270
 carrot rubbed now pour it 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:49.500
 with fine salt, mix the carrot with salt 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.330
 hands and lightly crush after that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.440
 briefly leave to carrot 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.619
 spilled juice 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:01.409
 and at this time we are preparing refueling for 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.810
 carrot squeezing lemon juice can 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.810
 make korean carrot with vinegar but i 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.109
 I do not like vinegar I do not cook anything with him 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.590
 lemon juice 10 perfectly replaces vinegar 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:15.000
 and the taste is very similar as with 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:22.250
 vinegar so lemon 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.250
 bitch mix lemon juice with butter 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.680
 add coriander 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.210
 sure whole grains are not young and 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.060
 hunger their taste is not like that 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:42.050
 you need to grind in a mortar 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.050
 coriander so it will give more flavor 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.590
 add hot red pepper ground 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:03:00.220
 on request you can add a little bit 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:00.220
 the consultant does not necessarily mix 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.010
 if you like spicy you can add 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.920
 more red hot pepper is 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.330
 depends on your preferences 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.850
 Of course the Korean carrot should be 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.160
 quite sharp also in this mixture 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.239
 you can squeeze a couple of garlic cloves 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.900
 but I won't do it now 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.600
 carrot has already started juice 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:35.500
 pour it to our lemon oil 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:37.700
 mix and mix now 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.780
 press down the carrot with something heavy 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.160
 for example a jar of water or a low one with 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.850
 beans and leave for twenty minutes 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.950
 in 20 minutes 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.730
 put the carrot in the fridge for two 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.209
 hours Korean carrot ready to enjoy 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.209
