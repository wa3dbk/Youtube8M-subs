00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
okay well i finished up the french part

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.730 
okay well i finished up the french part
of<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.150> brain<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.629> adding<00:00:07.020> strands<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:07.589> now

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
of this brain of adding strands so now

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.070 
of this brain of adding strands so now
we're<00:00:08.010> just<00:00:08.059> finishing<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.389> off<00:00:09.480> which<00:00:09.780> I

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
we're just finishing it off which I

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.259 
we're just finishing it off which I
actually<00:00:10.950> think<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.790> hardest<00:00:12.000> part

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
actually think is the hardest part

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.360 
actually think is the hardest part
especially<00:00:13.110> when<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.469> flip<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.130> over

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
especially when you have to flip it over

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.779 
especially when you have to flip it over
your<00:00:14.700> shoulder<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.330> keep<00:00:15.540> writing<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.199> because

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
your shoulder to keep writing it because

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.340 
your shoulder to keep writing it because
then<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.910> don't<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.449> your<00:00:18.600> shoulder<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
then you don't have your shoulder to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.220 
then you don't have your shoulder to
separate<00:00:19.949> hair<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:21.060> gets<00:00:21.270> confusing<00:00:21.539> so

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
separate hair and it gets confusing so

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.660 
separate hair and it gets confusing so
you're<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> need<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> mere<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:23.490> this

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
you're going to need a mere at this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.120 
you're going to need a mere at this
point<00:00:24.289> when<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.410> flip<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.830> over<00:00:25.980> your

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
point when you flip it over your

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.150 
point when you flip it over your
shoulder<00:00:26.510> just<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.810> keep<00:00:28.619> track<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
shoulder just to keep track of the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.880 
shoulder just to keep track of the

and<00:01:55.620> I<00:01:55.830> actually<00:01:55.920> gave<00:01:56.370> some<00:01:56.670> hair<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.110> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and I actually gave some hair to one of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.900 
and I actually gave some hair to one of
my<00:01:58.290> thinner<00:01:58.530> shrimp<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.070> try<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.280> even<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.760> out

so<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.410> that<00:02:01.440> when<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> flip

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
so you're going to see that when I flip

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.280 
so you're going to see that when I flip
around<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:03.360> should<00:02:03.630> blend<00:02:03.900> into<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
around that should blend into the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.040 
around that should blend into the
overall<00:02:04.620> fat<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.300> do<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:06.750> mess

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
overall fat you can do that if you mess

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.290 
overall fat you can do that if you mess
up<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.500> didn't<00:02:07.830> get<00:02:07.950> shoes<00:02:08.550> thickest<00:02:08.880> Rams

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
up like I didn't get shoes thickest Rams

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.540 
up like I didn't get shoes thickest Rams
just<00:02:09.720> give<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.290> to<00:02:10.470> little<00:02:10.979> bit<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.220> hair<00:02:11.400> than

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
just give it to little bit of hair than

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.540 
just give it to little bit of hair than
a<00:02:11.610> spinner<00:02:11.850> strand<00:02:12.920> ok<00:02:13.920> find<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> right

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
a spinner strand ok find you the right

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:37.550 
a spinner strand ok find you the right
side<00:02:14.880> again

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.309 

I<00:02:37.650> really<00:02:38.580> can't<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.390> much<00:02:39.540> farther<00:02:39.840> at<00:02:40.110> this

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
I really can't go much farther at this

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.860 
I really can't go much farther at this
point<00:02:40.620> um<00:02:42.080> with<00:02:44.120> behind<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.239> back<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.660> at<00:02:45.750> this

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
point um with behind it back so at this

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.290 
point um with behind it back so at this
point<00:02:46.110> what<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:46.530> going<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.190> I'm<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.270> my

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
point what I'm going to do and I'm on my

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.320 
point what I'm going to do and I'm on my
left<00:02:48.720> side<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.220> always<00:02:50.459> pull<00:02:50.760> over<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.209> my

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
left side but I always pull over to my

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.930 
left side but I always pull over to my
right<00:02:51.599> side<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:52.260> because<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.739> mmm<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.880> feels

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
right side just because it mmm it feels

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.210 
right side just because it mmm it feels
better<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.480> way<00:02:54.750> makes<00:02:55.140> sense<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:55.860> pull

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
better that way makes sense if you pull

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.460 
better that way makes sense if you pull
over<00:02:56.250> your<00:02:56.489> left<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.110> whatever

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
over your left just do that so whatever

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.460 
over your left just do that so whatever
work<00:02:58.769> for<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> and<00:03:00.120> I'm<00:03:00.390> going<00:03:00.930> from<00:03:01.140> my<00:03:01.260> left

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
work for you and I'm going from my left

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.680 
work for you and I'm going from my left
side<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:02.040> time<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.849> just<00:03:03.120> need<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.420> keep

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
side this time so I just need to keep

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.800 
side this time so I just need to keep

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
going to end up putting the four right

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.740 
going to end up putting the four right
strands<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.590> my<00:03:16.739> mouth<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.760> way<00:03:17.940> i<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.480> only

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
strands in my mouth that way i have only

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:29.570 
strands in my mouth that way i have only
to<00:03:19.110> hold<00:03:19.350> five<00:03:19.739> strands<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:21.000> hand

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.710 

what

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.920 

as<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.350> can<00:03:33.470> see<00:03:34.060> again<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.330> one's<00:03:35.630> going<00:03:35.870> to

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
as you can see again this one's going to

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.930 
as you can see again this one's going to
be<00:03:35.990> higher<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:36.830> that's<00:03:36.950> your<00:03:37.160> far<00:03:37.520> outside

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
be higher and so that's your far outside

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.460 
be higher and so that's your far outside
strand<00:03:38.330> so<00:03:38.630> that's<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.930> one<00:03:39.080> that's<00:03:39.140> going<00:03:39.380> to

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
strand so that's the one that's going to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.610 
strand so that's the one that's going to
go<00:03:39.730> under<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.030> we're<00:03:41.180> going<00:03:41.270> to<00:03:41.360> do<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:41.960> in<00:03:42.350> a

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
go under so we're going to do that in a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.590 
go under so we're going to do that in a
second<00:03:43.040> let<00:03:43.280> me<00:03:43.400> get<00:03:43.760> these<00:03:43.910> back<00:03:44.270> out<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.480> the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
second let me get these back out of the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:04:11.400 
second let me get these back out of the
way

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.310 

so<00:04:11.950> now<00:04:12.550> it<00:04:12.700> should<00:04:13.030> be<00:04:13.150> your<00:04:13.360> outside<00:04:13.900> strands

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
so now it should be your outside strands

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.460 
so now it should be your outside strands
in<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:15.280> hand<00:04:15.640> with<00:04:16.510> your<00:04:16.660> four<00:04:16.930> in<00:04:17.080> this<00:04:17.200> hand

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
in this hand with your four in this hand

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.449 
in this hand with your four in this hand
um<00:04:19.260> what<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.380> can<00:04:20.680> do<00:04:20.890> at<00:04:20.980> this<00:04:21.100> point<00:04:21.220> to

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
um what you can do at this point to

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.010 
um what you can do at this point to
start<00:04:21.790> combining<00:04:21.970> because<00:04:22.660> you're<00:04:22.810> going<00:04:22.960> to

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
start combining because you're going to

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.520 
start combining because you're going to
be<00:04:23.080> able<00:04:23.140> to<00:04:23.260> separate<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:24.600> Dom<00:04:25.600> enough<00:04:25.900> you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
be able to separate and Dom enough you

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.500 
be able to separate and Dom enough you
can't<00:04:26.740> put<00:04:26.860> this<00:04:27.010> mask<00:04:27.310> I'll<00:04:27.640> help<00:04:27.760> get<00:04:28.270> things

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
can't put this mask I'll help get things

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:52.350 
can't put this mask I'll help get things
settled

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.020 

and<00:04:52.930> i<00:04:53.229> just<00:04:53.379> discovered<00:04:53.949> i<00:04:54.159> messed<00:04:54.400> up<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:54.849> I

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
and i just discovered i messed up so I

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:29.710 
and i just discovered i messed up so I
gotta<00:04:55.300> fix<00:04:55.960> something<00:04:56.409> so<00:04:56.680> bear<00:04:57.159> with<00:04:57.189> me

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.290 

I<00:05:29.780> got<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.830> couple<00:05:31.070> strands<00:05:31.520> mix<00:05:31.910> up<00:05:32.060> that's

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
I got a couple strands mix up that's

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.030 
I got a couple strands mix up that's
playing<00:05:32.720> using<00:05:33.110> mirror<00:05:33.320> so<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:33.620> can<00:05:33.680> check

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
playing using mirror so you can check

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.980 
playing using mirror so you can check
these<00:05:34.250> things<00:05:36.280> now<00:05:37.280> we<00:05:37.340> r<00:05:37.460> you<00:05:37.610> do<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.240> right

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
these things now we r you do the right

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.860 
these things now we r you do the right
side<00:05:39.760> you're<00:05:40.760> going<00:05:40.820> to<00:05:41.000> find<00:05:41.240> your<00:05:41.420> upper

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
side you're going to find your upper

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.750 
side you're going to find your upper
strand<00:05:42.170> it's<00:05:42.470> going<00:05:42.740> to<00:05:42.770> be<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.010> highest<00:05:43.490> one

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
strand it's going to be the highest one

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.790 
strand it's going to be the highest one
that's<00:05:44.030> coming<00:05:44.240> out<00:05:44.540> and<00:05:47.140> then<00:05:48.140> the<00:05:48.320> second

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
that's coming out and then the second

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.090 
that's coming out and then the second
one<00:05:48.830> simply<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:49.940> lowest<00:05:50.360> one<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:51.710> second

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
one simply the lowest one the second

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.620 
one simply the lowest one the second
highest<00:05:52.220> limbo<00:05:52.700> is<00:05:52.760> going<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.030> be<00:05:53.090> going<00:05:53.240> down

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
highest limbo is going to be going down

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.010 
highest limbo is going to be going down
and<00:05:55.300> again<00:05:56.300> I'm<00:05:56.390> going<00:05:56.480> to<00:05:56.540> use<00:05:56.660> my<00:05:56.690> mouth

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
and again I'm going to use my mouth

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:11.350 
and again I'm going to use my mouth
because<00:05:57.290> it<00:05:57.680> helps<00:05:58.750> go<00:05:59.770> under<00:06:03.130> over<00:06:04.130> under

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.850 

right<00:06:11.599> over

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.219 

so<00:06:16.400> you're<00:06:16.610> far<00:06:17.300> outside<00:06:17.750> strand<00:06:18.110> that

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
so you're far outside strand that

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.070 
so you're far outside strand that
started<00:06:18.889> in<00:06:19.009> this<00:06:19.129> hand<00:06:19.400> should<00:06:19.490> be<00:06:19.759> in<00:06:20.080> this

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
started in this hand should be in this

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.920 
started in this hand should be in this
hand<00:06:21.409> down<00:06:21.849> um<00:06:24.789> and<00:06:25.789> we're<00:06:26.569> going<00:06:26.719> to<00:06:26.780> do<00:06:26.840> the

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
hand down um and we're going to do the

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.459 
hand down um and we're going to do the
left<00:06:27.139> side<00:06:27.349> again<00:06:27.680> or<00:06:28.219> the<00:06:28.370> right<00:06:28.520> side<00:06:28.759> I<00:06:28.969> mean

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:29.469 
left side again or the right side I mean

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:31.959 
left side again or the right side I mean
so<00:06:30.469> I'm<00:06:30.710> going<00:06:30.770> to<00:06:30.949> actually<00:06:31.069> just<00:06:31.340> drop<00:06:31.729> all

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 
so I'm going to actually just drop all

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.550 
so I'm going to actually just drop all
these<00:06:32.120> together<00:06:32.360> because<00:06:32.960> I<00:06:33.020> can<00:06:33.229> separate

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
these together because I can separate

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.320 
these together because I can separate
them<00:06:33.740> later<00:06:34.039> and<00:06:34.539> then<00:06:35.539> just<00:06:35.750> kind<00:06:36.500> of<00:06:40.330> use

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
them later and then just kind of use

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.659 
them later and then just kind of use
your<00:06:41.539> hand<00:06:41.840> step<00:06:42.319> and<00:06:42.620> fingers<00:06:43.099> trying<00:06:43.520> to

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
your hand step and fingers trying to

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.820 
your hand step and fingers trying to
keep<00:06:43.819> being<00:06:43.969> separated<00:06:44.629> like<00:06:45.319> I<00:06:45.409> said<00:06:45.469> this<00:06:45.770> is

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
keep being separated like I said this is

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.300 
keep being separated like I said this is
the<00:06:46.129> hardest<00:06:46.520> part<00:06:46.879> um<00:06:47.150> and<00:06:48.080> then<00:06:48.889> I<00:06:49.069> think

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
the hardest part um and then I think

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.240 
the hardest part um and then I think
this<00:06:49.460> takes<00:06:49.669> the<00:06:49.789> most<00:06:49.909> concentration<00:06:51.129> but<00:06:52.129> if

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
this takes the most concentration but if

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.129 
this takes the most concentration but if
you<00:06:52.370> can<00:06:52.520> get<00:06:52.669> this<00:06:52.849> down<00:06:53.120> you're<00:06:53.840> going<00:06:54.020> to<00:06:54.080> be

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
you can get this down you're going to be

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.800 
you can get this down you're going to be
a<00:06:54.169> great<00:06:54.349> date<00:06:54.710> so<00:06:55.009> um<00:06:55.490> don't<00:06:56.389> get<00:06:56.539> discouraged

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
a great date so um don't get discouraged

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.920 
a great date so um don't get discouraged
at<00:06:57.229> this<00:06:57.409> point<00:06:57.680> just<00:06:57.919> keep<00:06:58.430> practicing

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
at this point just keep practicing

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.760 
at this point just keep practicing
because<00:06:59.930> you<00:06:59.990> know<00:07:00.229> what<00:07:00.409> you<00:07:00.439> could<00:07:00.620> always

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
because you know what you could always

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.439 
because you know what you could always
just<00:07:01.099> tie<00:07:01.310> it<00:07:01.340> up<00:07:01.550> at<00:07:01.759> the<00:07:01.939> end<00:07:01.969> in<00:07:02.180> the<00:07:02.240> back

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
just tie it up at the end in the back

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
start kind of you'll be able to kind of

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.719 
start kind of you'll be able to kind of
leave<00:07:24.169> it<00:07:24.199> yourself<00:07:24.800> with<00:07:25.039> using<00:07:25.610> your

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:25.729 
leave it yourself with using your

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.570 
leave it yourself with using your
fingers<00:07:26.120> since<00:07:26.500> your<00:07:27.500> strands<00:07:27.860> are<00:07:28.039> going<00:07:28.460> to

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
fingers since your strands are going to

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.379 
fingers since your strands are going to
stay<00:07:28.789> basically<00:07:29.419> separated<00:07:31.060> because<00:07:32.060> there's

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:32.389 
stay basically separated because there's

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:35.350 
stay basically separated because there's
so<00:07:32.539> much<00:07:32.750> and<00:07:33.400> it's<00:07:34.400> just<00:07:34.639> important<00:07:35.000> to<00:07:35.060> get

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
so much and it's just important to get

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.450 
so much and it's just important to get
that<00:07:35.389> outside<00:07:36.020> strand<00:07:36.379> to<00:07:36.710> the<00:07:36.889> middle<00:07:37.219> and

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
that outside strand to the middle and

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.200 
that outside strand to the middle and
then<00:07:38.089> pull<00:07:38.599> tight<00:07:38.900> and<00:07:39.400> then<00:07:40.400> just<00:07:40.610> keep<00:07:40.789> going

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210 
then pull tight and then just keep going

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.800 
then pull tight and then just keep going
from<00:07:41.330> there<00:07:41.650> until<00:07:42.650> you<00:07:42.889> finish<00:07:43.310> up<00:07:43.460> the<00:07:43.610> brain

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
from there until you finish up the brain

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.360 
from there until you finish up the brain
