continue<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:38.090> form<00:01:38.450> here<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:39.110> certainly

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
continue that form here I certainly

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.250

think<00:01:40.130> he<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.610> when<00:01:41.120> John<00:01:41.360> zappy<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.050> sort

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
think he can when John zappy is the sort

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.810 
think he can when John zappy is the sort
of<00:01:42.320> guy<00:01:42.440> that<00:01:42.590> wants<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.920> run<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.070> five<00:01:43.340> second

part<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.270> every<00:01:44.600> event<00:01:44.840> he<00:01:44.960> goes<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.470> is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
part that every event he goes to is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.770 
part that every event he goes to is
certainly<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.640> performance<00:01:47.180> leader<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.600> top

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780

door<00:01:48.020> slammer<00:01:48.320> at<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.590> moment<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.460> his<00:01:49.729> risk

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
door slammer at the moment but his risk

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.240 
door slammer at the moment but his risk
is<00:01:50.510> if<00:01:50.720> he<00:01:50.810> tries<00:01:51.050> too<00:01:51.380> hard<00:01:51.410> to<00:01:51.770> run<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:51.920> five

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
is if he tries too hard to run a five

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.940 
is if he tries too hard to run a five
