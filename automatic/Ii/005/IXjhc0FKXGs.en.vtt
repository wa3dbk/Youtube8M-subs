00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the foot and pressing is the bubbling

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
the foot and pressing is the bubbling
well<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> idea<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.899> being<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980

balls of your feet a little bit so let's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.389 
balls of your feet a little bit so let's
take<00:00:56.670> an<00:00:56.789> opening<00:00:57.149> move<00:00:57.300> from<00:00:57.420> young<00:00:57.690> style<00:00:58.399> if

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
take an opening move from young style if

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.779 
take an opening move from young style if
I<00:00:59.760> were<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.600> turn<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:02.280> last<00:01:02.489> video<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
time I'm going to talk about the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.760 
time I'm going to talk about the
pressure<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> feel<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.500> pressure

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
pressure I want to feel the pressure

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920 
pressure I want to feel the pressure
down<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> balls<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.060> my<00:01:09.090> feet<00:01:09.180> while

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
maintaining the heels on the floor so

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.660 
maintaining the heels on the floor so
the<00:01:12.330> he'll<00:01:12.540> stay<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> floor<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.400> put

pressure into the balls of my feet so if

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
pressure into the balls of my feet so if

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you kind of jumped in place and kind of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990 
you kind of jumped in place and kind of
felt<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.080> spring<00:01:19.530> through<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> legs<00:01:20.250> this

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
felt a spring through the legs this

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
felt a spring through the legs this
connects<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> root<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> bottom<00:01:22.830> of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
this is specifically to keep the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
this is specifically to keep the
pressure<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.619> knee<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.009> pressure<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
pressure off the knee so pressure the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.569 
pressure off the knee so pressure the
balls<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.150> feet<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.130> then<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.340> do

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
losing my balance but just that I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.210 
losing my balance but just that I
pressure<00:01:50.360> into<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.390> ball<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:51.990> foot<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.710> keep

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
pressure into the ball of my foot I keep

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.399 
pressure into the ball of my foot I keep
my<00:01:53.430> heel<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.270> haven't<00:01:54.600> moved<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.960> way<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
my heel down I haven't moved my way is

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
my heel down I haven't moved my way is
or<00:01:55.590> when<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> keep<00:01:56.040> when<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> moved<00:01:56.969> my<00:01:57.030> weight<00:01:57.390> my

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.010 
or when I keep when I moved my weight my
heel<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.229> automatically<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.250> down

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
heel will automatically have to be down

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.319 
heel will automatically have to be down
okay<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> take<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> step<00:02:02.009> even<00:02:02.880> here

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
okay I'm going to take a step even here

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.179 
okay I'm going to take a step even here
I<00:02:03.450> put<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> pressure<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.500> ball<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.979> foot

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
I put the pressure in the ball the foot

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.960 
I put the pressure in the ball the foot
even<00:02:05.430> though<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.790> step<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.420> heel

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
even though I step with my heel

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.520 
even though I step with my heel
pressure<00:02:07.810> in<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.140> ball<00:02:08.290> of<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.500> foot

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
pressure in the ball of the foot

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.080

then<00:02:10.899> when<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.830> pivot<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.490> still<00:02:13.120> pivot<00:02:13.630> as<00:02:13.750> in

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
then when I pivot I still pivot as in

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.160 
then when I pivot I still pivot as in
yon<00:02:14.770> style<00:02:15.160> pivoting<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.850> still<00:02:16.660> pivot<00:02:17.050> on<00:02:17.140> the

yon style pivoting I still pivot on the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.100 
yon style pivoting I still pivot on the
heel<00:02:18.030> but<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.120> still<00:02:19.420> feeling<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.810> pressure

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110

this<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.250> weight-bearing<00:02:21.460> leg<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.780> if<00:02:22.900> I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
this is the weight-bearing leg so if I

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.230 
this is the weight-bearing leg so if I
pivot<00:02:23.260> on<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.560> by<00:02:24.400> put<00:02:24.610> pressure<00:02:24.850> on<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.120> ball

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
pivot on the by put pressure on the ball

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.230 
pivot on the by put pressure on the ball
back<00:02:25.450> here<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.690> don't<00:02:25.900> want<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.230> pop<00:02:26.440> out<00:02:27.240> my

weight<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.510> moving<00:02:28.900> here<00:02:29.470> when<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.400> heel

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
weight is moving here when the heel

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.100 
weight is moving here when the heel
turns<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.300> now<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.810> feel<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.580> constant

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110

paying attention to or not actively
putting<00:02:53.910> pressure<00:02:54.910> isn't<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.780> way<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:55.990> saying

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
putting pressure isn't the way of saying

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.230 
putting pressure isn't the way of saying
energy<00:02:56.590> like<00:02:57.040> feeling<00:02:57.400> an<00:02:57.520> energy<00:02:57.880> pressure

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
energy like feeling an energy pressure

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240 
energy like feeling an energy pressure

move to another move I don't just forget

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.300 
move to another move I don't just forget
about<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.730> leg<00:03:04.470> when<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.500> step<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.100> see<00:03:06.220> all

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
about this leg when I step and see all

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.449 
about this leg when I step and see all
the<00:03:06.340> collapsing<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.090> my<00:03:07.390> leg<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:08.250> want<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.310> feel

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
the collapsing of my leg I want to feel

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.410 
the collapsing of my leg I want to feel
the<00:03:09.610> pressure<00:03:10.170> through<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.410> ok<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:13.180> is

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the pressure through that ok this is

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.540 
the pressure through that ok this is
obviously<00:03:13.860> something<00:03:14.860> that's<00:03:15.130> more<00:03:15.280> easily

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
obviously something that's more easily

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.000 
obviously something that's more easily
learned<00:03:15.820> in<00:03:15.970> person<00:03:16.450> but<00:03:17.080> if<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.260> play<00:03:17.620> around
