00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hello dear viewers, I decided so 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.750
 release one video on this channel 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.219
 such as mine 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.390
 assembled model I as you already understood 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.090
 I am engaged in such bench modeling 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.660
 periodic and just recently collected 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.349
 full tank tiger 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.349
 German famous tank for a long time 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.489
 Of course, I gave were a case after all, but 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.770
 I decided to post all canons possible 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.210
 don't consider something in it because 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.010
 I take off with enough beef cam so 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.329
 in principle, you can see 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.440
 with a long time ago I used it 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.489
 stagnation technology I do not remember how 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.890
 he hung there molding molding both godin like 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.739
 he is called by some 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:09.799
 modellers on with you jargon not 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:12.990
 it turned out like this 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.310
 I decided to have an interesting coloring 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:22.619
 make it so without any drawings 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.770
 without anything else so much 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.840
 it is interesting here every detail 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.700
 had to paint a separate 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.040
 cabinet 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:39.439
 shovels are different here these nippers here 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:44.130
 cable and this is by the way a tank from Tamia 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.530
 scale 135 and generally not set 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.250
 quite impressed never even 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.140
 faced 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.570
 honestly decided to try with Tanya 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:02:00.689
 actually so here's the side 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.759
 now turn this 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.020
 interestingly I got caterpillars 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.970
 such stagnant 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:13.640
 I used anything here and 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.880
 and rust pigment and in even here in cement 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.540
 which I said effect 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.410
 dustiness can do so here 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.770
 something like this 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.850
 also decals pasted so in their own way 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.730
 a little more now opens donkey 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.370
 oh no kicks until i watch everything 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.870
 the whole essence is revealed and must 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:43.190
 open it here it opens everything 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:48.950
 ok here still included 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.430
 a soldier so let's say there is an officer of some kind 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.230
 tank 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.740
 I'm still doing it tank I gave 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.700
 to my friend in of course me also 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.510
 assemblies 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.520
 and others I can show you in 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.490
 next releases but for now what is it 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.250
 as I already said 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.470
 recent my such release 1 faced 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.780
 his stagnation me judged and rigor 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.780
 something you may not be here 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.260
 I like it too much 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.610
 like but for example what's coming 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.280
 searched a little bit I did not succeed well 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:35.120
 oh well nothing in the future we take into account all these 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:39.380
 but the tankâ€™s surplus 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.450
 normal well what about the following 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.450
 releases everyone thanks everyone bye
