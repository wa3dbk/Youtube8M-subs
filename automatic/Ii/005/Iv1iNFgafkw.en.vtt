to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.850> fuckin<00:00:39.120> mind<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.719> was

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to be out of your fuckin mind it was

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.690 
to be out of your fuckin mind it was
like<00:00:39.870> trading<00:00:40.379> Gary<00:00:40.860> Lehman<00:00:41.190> straight<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.550> for

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
like trading Gary Lehman straight up for

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.170 
like trading Gary Lehman straight up for
quartic<00:00:42.530> yeah<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.829> was<00:00:44.040> scorched<00:00:44.430> oh<00:00:44.579> yeah

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
quartic yeah that was scorched oh yeah

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
quartic yeah that was scorched oh yeah

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so wouldn't it be the same type of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.180 
so wouldn't it be the same type of
analogy<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> goalie<00:00:49.230> who<00:00:49.530> had<00:00:50.070> the
