I'm happy with that tone the next step

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.070 
I'm happy with that tone the next step

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
usually the brightest pickup on your

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.219 
usually the brightest pickup on your
guitar<00:02:01.550> because<00:02:02.390> it's<00:02:02.540> close<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:02.990> bridge

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
guitar because it's close to the bridge

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.399 
guitar because it's close to the bridge
and<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.040> can<00:02:04.190> hear<00:02:04.400> now<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:05.170> it's<00:02:06.170> going<00:02:06.320> to

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
and you can hear now that it's going to

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:18.580 
and you can hear now that it's going to
be<00:02:06.590> quite<00:02:07.190> bright<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.790> quite<00:02:08.000> harsh<00:02:08.240> setting

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.020 

now<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.710> okay<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.250> game<00:02:20.460> but<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:20.880> just

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
now I'm okay with the game but it's just

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.540 
now I'm okay with the game but it's just
too<00:02:21.240> harsh<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.230> what<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.920> roll<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
too harsh so what I do is I roll the
