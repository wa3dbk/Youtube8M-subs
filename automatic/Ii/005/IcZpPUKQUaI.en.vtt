not<00:04:02.290> i<00:04:02.350> always<00:04:02.620> think<00:04:02.769> 'what<00:04:02.890> can<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.280> reuse

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.259 
not i always think 'what can you reuse
all<00:04:04.209> right<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:04.750> then<00:04:05.049> I<00:04:05.530> think<00:04:06.069> there<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:06.850> just

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
all right so then I think there is just

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.360 
all right so then I think there is just
one<00:04:07.329> more<00:04:07.690> thing

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370

one more thing
and<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:11.269> lipstick<00:04:12.269> like<00:04:12.480> a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
and it is this it is a lipstick like a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.509 
and it is this it is a lipstick like a
little<00:04:12.900> mini<00:04:13.260> lipstick<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.099> it's<00:04:14.280> not<00:04:14.489> a

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
little mini lipstick and it's not a

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.699 
little mini lipstick and it's not a
color<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.849> would<00:04:15.150> like<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.720> it's<00:04:16.380> kind<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.590> like

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709
