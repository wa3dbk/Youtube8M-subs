00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
this is actually hilarious and I don't

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.240 
this is actually hilarious and I don't
know<00:00:03.030> but<00:00:03.300> it<00:00:03.389> comes<00:00:03.600> out<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:04.140> make<00:00:04.770> it<00:00:04.920> seven

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
know but it comes out I make it seven

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.130 
know but it comes out I make it seven
point<00:00:05.460> eight<00:00:05.640> one<00:00:05.850> times<00:00:06.180> ten<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.629> seven

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
point eight one times ten to the seven

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.379 
point eight one times ten to the seven
the<00:00:07.950> book<00:00:08.130> makes<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.639> four<00:00:08.940> point<00:00:09.240> one<00:00:14.389> not

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the book makes it four point one not

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.660 
the book makes it four point one not
like<00:00:15.570> Jared<00:00:15.870> go<00:00:16.070> approximately<00:00:17.070> twice<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
like Jared go approximately twice the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.400 
like Jared go approximately twice the
value<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:19.430> think<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.760> Jared's<00:00:21.119> fault<00:00:21.410> well

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
value I think it's Jared's fault well

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:44.350 
value I think it's Jared's fault well
could<00:00:22.560> he<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.800> invite<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.060> got<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.300> wrong

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.880 

it's<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.450> sad<00:00:45.660> day<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.110> students<00:00:46.530> Excel

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's a sad day when your students Excel

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:56.630 
it's a sad day when your students Excel
your<00:00:47.129> abilities<00:00:47.670> now<00:00:54.680> well<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> looks

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
your abilities now well because it looks

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.880 
your abilities now well because it looks
like<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> spiders<00:00:57.239> build<00:00:57.480> across<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.930> page

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.609 

change<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.189> into<00:01:05.519> electron<00:01:05.909> volts<00:01:06.210> yeah<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
change that into electron volts yeah so

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.359 
change that into electron volts yeah so
it'll<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.030> eight<00:01:09.030> times<00:01:09.740> ten<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:10.979> minus

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it'll be eight times ten to the minus

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.130 
it'll be eight times ten to the minus
sixteen<00:01:12.330> sixteen<00:01:13.020> times<00:01:13.320> by<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:13.580> yeah<00:01:15.140> so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
sixteen sixteen times by two yeah so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.620 
sixteen sixteen times by two yeah so
that's<00:01:16.320> 16<00:01:16.830> times<00:01:17.189> 10<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.640> minus<00:01:18.000> 16<00:01:18.420> which

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that's 16 times 10 to the minus 16 which

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:31.460 
that's 16 times 10 to the minus 16 which
is<00:01:19.350> 1.6<00:01:19.950> times<00:01:20.310> 10<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.729> minus<00:01:21.119> 15

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.780 

if<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.650> figures<00:01:32.980> are<00:01:33.100> right<00:01:33.280> then<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.580> just

you just just rather botmaster than that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.580 
you just just rather botmaster than that
it's<00:01:37.510> just<00:01:37.660> about<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.930> order<00:01:38.170> of<00:01:38.260> what<00:01:38.410> you've

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
done if you figure the right it must be

00:01:45.760 --> 00:02:08.669 
done if you figure the right it must be
