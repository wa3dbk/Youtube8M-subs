so I think this is really perfect for

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.630 
so I think this is really perfect for
the<00:01:52.079> gym<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.649> lightweight<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.399> has

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the gym because it's lightweight it has

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.310 
the gym because it's lightweight it has
salicylic<00:01:54.060> acid<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.200> not

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
salicylic acid in it so it's not

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.780 
salicylic acid in it so it's not
clogging<00:01:55.619> your<00:01:55.860> pores<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.340> almost<00:01:56.549> actually
