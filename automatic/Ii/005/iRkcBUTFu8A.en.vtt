00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.090 
fix-it tricks are you dusty guys and
dusty<00:00:12.469> out

you<00:00:14.030> know<00:00:14.150> how<00:00:16.540> sometimes<00:00:17.540> you<00:00:17.870> get<00:00:17.990> your

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
you know how sometimes you get your

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.350 
you know how sometimes you get your
boxes<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:19.160> electricians<00:00:19.730> get<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.000> boxes

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
boxes the electricians get the boxes

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.200 
boxes the electricians get the boxes
back<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:20.870> fat<00:00:21.170> farm<00:00:21.619> and<00:00:22.330> then<00:00:23.330> I<00:00:25.090> can't<00:00:26.090> get

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
back to fat farm and then I can't get

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.940 
back to fat farm and then I can't get
the<00:00:26.300> plug<00:00:26.570> out<00:00:26.750> far<00:00:27.050> enough<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:27.470> when<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:27.710> plug

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
the plug out far enough so when you plug

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.320 
the plug out far enough so when you plug
something<00:00:27.980> in<00:00:28.490> it<00:00:28.810> breaks<00:00:31.239> breaks<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.510> plate

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
something in it breaks breaks the plate

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.090 
something in it breaks breaks the plate
well<00:00:35.330> rather<00:00:36.320> than<00:00:36.500> going<00:00:36.620> out<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:36.980> buying

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
well rather than going out and buying

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.540 
well rather than going out and buying
all<00:00:37.400> that<00:00:37.670> expensive<00:00:39.280> stuff<00:00:40.280> that

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
all that expensive stuff that

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.470 
all that expensive stuff that
electricians<00:00:41.480> use<00:00:41.780> what<00:00:42.650> I<00:00:42.680> use<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.400> just<00:00:44.270> this

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
electricians use what I use is just this

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.250 
electricians use what I use is just this
old<00:00:44.720> past<00:00:44.989> plastic<00:00:47.170> waterline<00:00:48.170> I<00:00:50.019> use<00:00:51.019> it<00:00:51.170> on

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
old past plastic waterline I use it on

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.640 
old past plastic waterline I use it on
ice<00:00:51.530> makers<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.370> things<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.269> that<00:00:53.300> nature<00:00:53.650> and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
ice makers and things of that nature and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.219 
ice makers and things of that nature and
it<00:00:54.769> works<00:00:54.979> great<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:56.390> can<00:00:56.570> cut<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.930> a<00:00:56.989> little

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
it works great you can cut it a little

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.630 
it works great you can cut it a little
extra<00:00:57.379> long<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.900> it'll<00:00:59.900> compress<00:01:00.350> down<00:01:00.680> so

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
extra long and it'll compress down so

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.340 
extra long and it'll compress down so
that<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:01.940> can<00:01:02.089> actually<00:01:02.269> adjust<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:03.830> plug<00:01:05.350> to

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
that you can actually adjust the plug to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.060 
that you can actually adjust the plug to
the<00:01:06.470> height<00:01:06.620> you<00:01:06.830> want<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:09.229> anyway<00:01:09.920> I'm<00:01:10.040> going

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
the height you want so anyway I'm going

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.880 
the height you want so anyway I'm going
to<00:01:10.220> pull<00:01:10.370> this<00:01:10.490> out<00:01:10.700> we'll<00:01:11.270> get<00:01:11.360> it<00:01:11.479> set<00:01:11.890> and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
to pull this out we'll get it set and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.100 
to pull this out we'll get it set and
I'll<00:01:13.190> show<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.610> what<00:01:13.729> we're<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:15.700> all<00:01:16.700> right

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
I'll show you what we're up to all right

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.069 
I'll show you what we're up to all right
take<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.140> look<00:01:18.439> at<00:01:18.590> what<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.860> problem<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.490> here

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
take a look at what the problem is here

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.560 
take a look at what the problem is here
you<00:01:21.079> can<00:01:21.289> see<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.490> bottom<00:01:22.700> ears<00:01:23.090> against

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
you can see that the bottom ears against

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.959 
you can see that the bottom ears against
the<00:01:23.689> sheetrock<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.729> top<00:01:25.729> here<00:01:25.969> is<00:01:26.299> not<00:01:26.659> and

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
the sheetrock the top here is not and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.539 
the sheetrock the top here is not and
that's<00:01:28.969> what<00:01:29.210> usually<00:01:29.359> holds<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.930> plug<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.549> is

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
that's what usually holds the plug in is

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.399 
that's what usually holds the plug in is
it<00:01:31.759> sets<00:01:32.030> on<00:01:32.149> top<00:01:32.359> that<00:01:32.539> sheetrock<00:01:33.049> at<00:01:33.259> this

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
it sets on top that sheetrock at this

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.690 
it sets on top that sheetrock at this
one<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.649> can<00:01:33.920> see<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.189> goes<00:01:34.340> back<00:01:34.549> up<00:01:34.729> in<00:01:34.939> there

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
one you can see it goes back up in there

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.179 
one you can see it goes back up in there
so<00:01:37.700> really<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.060> have<00:01:38.210> no<00:01:38.240> support<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:40.009> so

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
so really you have no support and so

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.289 
so really you have no support and so
what<00:01:40.340> we're<00:01:40.490> going<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.670> do<00:01:40.759> is<00:01:40.850> take<00:01:40.969> the<00:01:41.090> plug

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
what we're going to do is take the plug

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.469 
what we're going to do is take the plug
out<00:01:42.280> put<00:01:45.429> some<00:01:46.429> of<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.579> plastic<00:01:46.820> water<00:01:47.270> line

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
out put some of this plastic water line

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.749 
out put some of this plastic water line
in<00:01:47.689> there<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:50.439> this<00:01:51.439> stuff<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.609> could

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
in there and this stuff is you could

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.200 
in there and this stuff is you could
probably<00:01:52.969> buy<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:53.359> a<00:01:54.100> piece<00:01:55.100> for<00:01:56.030> about<00:01:56.179> a

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
probably buy you a piece for about a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.330 
probably buy you a piece for about a
dollar<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:56.990> you'd<00:01:57.649> have<00:01:57.740> enough<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.189> do

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
dollar and you'd have enough to do

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.789 
dollar and you'd have enough to do
probably<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.850> hundred<00:01:58.999> plugs

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
probably a hundred plugs

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.310 
probably a hundred plugs
that's<00:02:00.799> better<00:02:01.039> than<00:02:01.280> spending<00:02:01.990> 25<00:02:02.990> cents

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
that's better than spending 25 cents

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:13.059 
that's better than spending 25 cents
apiece<00:02:03.409> for<00:02:03.859> those<00:02:04.659> electricians<00:02:06.009> spacers

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.960
