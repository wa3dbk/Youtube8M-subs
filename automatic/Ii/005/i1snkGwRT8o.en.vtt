00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.990 
where you know you have to remember
pakistan<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.619> geographically<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
pakistan is geographically and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.080 
pakistan is geographically and
population<00:01:57.000> wise<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> huge<00:01:57.689> country<00:01:57.990> as

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
population wise is a huge country as

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
population wise is a huge country as
population<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.479> think<00:02:00.570> very<00:02:00.869> close<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
population I think very close to the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.590 
population I think very close to the
size<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.799> United<00:02:02.100> States<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.149> it's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
size of the United States and it's it's

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.810 
size of the United States and it's it's
not<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:04.079> big<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> lower<00:02:04.770> 48<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.490> it's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
not as big as the lower 48 but it's it's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.490 
not as big as the lower 48 but it's it's
very<00:02:06.060> big<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.200> those<00:02:07.350> things

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
very big and so a lot of those things

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.190 
very big and so a lot of those things
happen<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.550> remote<00:02:08.879> areas

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
happen in remote areas

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
happen in remote areas
have<00:02:10.500> nothing<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.130> with<00:02:11.280> places<00:02:11.700> where<00:02:11.849> you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
have nothing to do with places where you

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.970 
have nothing to do with places where you
go<00:02:12.090> climbing<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> go<00:02:12.990> climbing<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.800> go

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
into this long bod and you go up to the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.750 
into this long bod and you go up to the
northern<00:02:15.750> areas<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:16.739> those<00:02:17.250> places<00:02:17.520> are

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
northern areas now those places are
