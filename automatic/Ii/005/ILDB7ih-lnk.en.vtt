00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
if you were to anything else it will be

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.769 
if you were to anything else it will be
into<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> complete<00:00:17.130> length<00:00:17.340> Plus<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.600> have

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
into the complete length Plus and I have

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.750 
into the complete length Plus and I have
a<00:00:18.810> few<00:00:19.109> more<00:00:19.289> ingredients<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.890> go<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
a few more ingredients I go to the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.689 
a few more ingredients I go to the
complete<00:00:21.150> length<00:00:21.270> plus<00:00:22.279> one<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.400> them<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
complete length plus one of them is

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.529 
complete length plus one of them is
scallops<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.890> one's<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.359> use

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
scallops and this one's I like to use

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.870 
scallops and this one's I like to use
the<00:00:27.689> ocean<00:00:27.869> scallops<00:00:28.880> just<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.179> bigger

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
the ocean scallops just a little bigger

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.470 
the ocean scallops just a little bigger
these<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:33.120> very<00:00:33.329> easy<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.690> dice<00:00:35.329> you<00:00:36.329> don't

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
these are very easy to dice you don't

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:50.540 
these are very easy to dice you don't
need<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.870> much<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> them

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.830 

the<00:00:51.060> fish<00:00:51.390> did<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.910> have<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> problem<00:00:54.300> biting

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the fish did not have a problem biting

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
the fish did not have a problem biting
into<00:00:54.990> this<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:56.040> fish<00:00:56.340> combining<00:00:56.790> two

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
into this and fish combining two

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.730 
into this and fish combining two
scallops<00:00:57.330> but<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.840> got<00:00:58.020> some<00:00:58.230> already<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:58.710> I

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
scallops but I got some already but I

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.170 
scallops but I got some already but I
already<00:00:58.890> crosses<00:00:59.490> here<00:00:59.700> so<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.960> would<00:01:01.080> be

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
already crosses here so that would be

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.490 
already crosses here so that would be
the<00:01:03.180> plus<00:01:03.570> formula<00:01:04.070> uses<00:01:05.070> scallops<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> next

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the plus formula uses scallops the next

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.630 
the plus formula uses scallops the next
ingredient<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.820> plus<00:01:09.120> formula<00:01:10.220> is<00:01:11.220> up

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
ingredient in the plus formula is up

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
ingredient in the plus formula is up
stir<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:14.870> after<00:01:15.870> is<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.260> those

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
stir and after is one of those

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.660 
stir and after is one of those
ingredients<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.490> basically<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:19.670> option

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
ingredients that it's basically a option

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.420 
ingredients that it's basically a option
I<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.750> use<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.440> plus<00:01:22.800> formula<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
I like to use it on the plus formula I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.830 
I like to use it on the plus formula I
think<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> doesn't<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> difference<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
think it doesn't make the difference to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.210 
think it doesn't make the difference to
that<00:01:24.900> formula<00:01:26.330> I'm<00:01:27.330> gonna<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.720> ahead<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.220> add

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that formula I'm gonna get ahead and add

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.500 
that formula I'm gonna get ahead and add
it<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:34.010> basically<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.550> stir<00:01:35.760> you<00:01:36.300> can

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
it to it basically it up stir you can

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.969 
it to it basically it up stir you can
you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.900> by<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> tails<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:40.020> slide<00:01:40.830> it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you know by the tails and just slide it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:41.930 
you know by the tails and just slide it
right<00:01:41.010> through<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.460> middle

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
right through the middle

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.960 
right through the middle
once<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.600> open<00:01:42.900> them<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.790> can

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
once you open them out like this you can

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270 
once you open them out like this you can
just<00:01:45.000> stick<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:45.930> finger<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.560> pull<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> meat

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
just stick your finger and pull the meat

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.960 
just stick your finger and pull the meat
out<00:01:47.479> on<00:01:48.479> both<00:01:48.780> ends<00:01:53.450> drive<00:01:54.450> by<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.690> tail<00:01:55.970> pull

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
out on both ends drive by the tail pull

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.260 
out on both ends drive by the tail pull
that<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.869> will<00:01:58.440> say<00:01:58.590> your<00:01:59.270> lobster

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that out and they will say your lobster

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
that out and they will say your lobster
meat

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:15.809 

this<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.360> gonna<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.690> here<00:02:06.900> for<00:02:07.200> me

all<00:02:16.360> right<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.689> now<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.840> we're<00:02:17.049> gonna<00:02:17.110> make

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
all right so now that we're gonna make

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:28.790 
all right so now that we're gonna make
this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:03:04.449

and pretty much from here you have

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.190 
and pretty much from here you have
several<00:03:13.830> options<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.580> can<00:03:15.330> pack<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.050> into

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
several options you can pack it into

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.820 
several options you can pack it into
backs<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.860> freeze<00:03:17.819> them<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.599> flat<00:03:18.959> pack<00:03:19.260> or

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
you can put it into ice cubes maybe you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.100 
you can put it into ice cubes maybe you
can<00:03:25.080> find<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.709> smaller<00:03:26.160> ice<00:03:26.519> cube<00:03:26.880> trays<00:03:27.180> at

foods that you can give to your fish

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.379 
foods that you can give to your fish
you'll<00:04:36.830> with<00:04:37.250> this<00:04:37.430> fresh<00:04:37.729> if<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.030> put<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.330> in
