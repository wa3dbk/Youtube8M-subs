okay<00:00:01.319> what<00:00:01.680> else<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.190> wrong<00:00:02.399> with<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.790> Prius

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
okay what else is wrong with the Prius

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.840 
okay what else is wrong with the Prius
well<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.840> big<00:00:04.470> problem<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.950> Prius<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.520> that

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
well the big problem the Prius is that

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.240 
well the big problem the Prius is that
it<00:00:06.120> has<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> tiny<00:00:06.629> battery<00:00:07.049> pack<00:00:07.350> which

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
it has a tiny battery pack which

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.459 
it has a tiny battery pack which
apparently<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:09.179> lawsuit<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.050> Chevron

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
apparently the lawsuit that Chevron

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
apparently the lawsuit that Chevron
funded<00:00:10.889> against<00:00:11.219> Toyota<00:00:11.630> restricted<00:00:12.630> them<00:00:12.780> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
funded against Toyota restricted them to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.410 
funded against Toyota restricted them to
using<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.380> tiny<00:00:13.650> battery<00:00:13.980> pack<00:00:14.370> which<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.360> only

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
using a tiny battery pack which can only

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.210 
using a tiny battery pack which can only
power<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.960> prius<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> tiny<00:00:16.949> distance<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
power the prius for a tiny distance the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220 
power the prius for a tiny distance the
overall<00:00:20.220> problem<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.180> toyota<00:00:21.869> put

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
overall problem is that toyota put

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.230 
overall problem is that toyota put
inside<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> computer<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> routine<00:00:23.939> which

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
inside the computer a routine which

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.480 
inside the computer a routine which
stops<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.810> from<00:00:24.840> adding<00:00:25.289> batteries<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.310> all

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
stops you from adding batteries so all

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.609 
stops you from adding batteries so all
of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> plug-in<00:00:26.970> Prius<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.990> Prius<00:00:28.470> is

of the plug-in Prius is the Prius is

of the plug-in Prius is the Prius is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
solar system all of them have to put add

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.350 
solar system all of them have to put add
firmware<00:00:33.719> software<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:35.160> defeat<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.850> routine

into allowing us to add batteries now

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
into allowing us to add batteries now
why<00:00:41.129> did<00:00:41.370> Toyota<00:00:41.760> put<00:00:42.030> such<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> routine<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
why did Toyota put such a routine in the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.470 
why did Toyota put such a routine in the
computer<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.980> stop<00:00:44.309> people<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:44.850> making<00:00:45.390> it

engineers<00:00:48.360> who<00:00:48.690> solved<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> problem<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
engineers who solved that problem and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.580 
engineers who solved that problem and
made<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> possible<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.750> make<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> plug-in<00:00:52.350> Prius

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
made it possible to make a plug-in Prius

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799 
made it possible to make a plug-in Prius
and<00:00:52.890> Toyota<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.460> still<00:00:53.730> arguing<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.629> it's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and Toyota is still arguing that it's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
and Toyota is still arguing that it's
impossible<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.590> it'll<00:00:56.070> void<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.550> warranty

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
impossible that it'll void the warranty

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.880 
impossible that it'll void the warranty
they<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:57.600> hurt<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> battery<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.500> blah<00:00:58.680> blah

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
they don't hurt the battery or blah blah

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.270 
they don't hurt the battery or blah blah
blah<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.000> works<00:01:00.210> fine<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:01.170> after<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
blah but it works fine now after you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.359 
blah but it works fine now after you
after<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.879> defeat<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.739> routines<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
after you defeat the the routines that

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.630 
after you defeat the the routines that
inhibit<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.409> adding<00:01:07.409> batteries<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.430> other

problem<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.390> Prius<00:01:09.630> won't<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.229> faster

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
problem is the Prius won't go faster

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.039 
problem is the Prius won't go faster

defeat that routine Toyota could defeat
it<00:01:27.060> very<00:01:27.240> easily<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.829> know<00:01:28.950> one

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it very easily but that's you know one

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.560 
it very easily but that's you know one
of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> severe<00:01:29.549> problems<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.299> can't

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
of the severe problems is you can't

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.800 
of the severe problems is you can't
drive<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.650> my<00:01:31.829> rav4<00:01:32.280> UV<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.360> can't<00:01:33.600> drive

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
drive on like my rav4 UV you can't drive

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.590 
drive on like my rav4 UV you can't drive
it<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.110> electric<00:01:34.560> power<00:01:34.590> alone<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.600> normal

it on electric power alone at normal
highway<00:01:36.900> speeds<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> only<00:01:37.950> drive

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
highway speeds you have to only drive

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.880 
highway speeds you have to only drive
around<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> golf<00:01:39.030> cart<00:01:39.329> which<00:01:40.259> maybe

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
around like a golf cart which maybe

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.460 
around like a golf cart which maybe
that's<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.460> meant<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.079> last<00:01:43.079> problem

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that's what they meant the last problem

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
that's what they meant the last problem
is<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.430> catalytic<00:01:45.000> converter<00:01:45.149> when

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
is that the catalytic converter when

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
is that the catalytic converter when
it's<00:01:45.840> cold<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.799> engine<00:01:47.189> comes<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.880> warm

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it's cold the engine comes on to warm

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.719 
it's cold the engine comes on to warm
that<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.840> even<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.229> low<00:01:49.439> speed<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.159> your

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
that up so even at low speed if your

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.510 
that up so even at low speed if your
