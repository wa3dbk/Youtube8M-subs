are<00:00:26.340> super<00:00:26.880> super<00:00:27.420> valuable<00:00:27.800> let's<00:00:28.800> look<00:00:28.920> at

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
are super super valuable let's look at

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.310 
are super super valuable let's look at
the<00:00:29.160> best<00:00:29.429> spot<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:30.090> public<00:00:30.449> events<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.869> earth

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the best spot for public events on earth

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.069 
the best spot for public events on earth
the<00:00:31.980> location<00:00:32.520> itself<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.090> called<00:00:33.360> sky<00:00:33.780> watch

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the location itself is called sky watch

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.380 
the location itself is called sky watch
and<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.710> big<00:00:34.950> area<00:00:35.219> where<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> bunch<00:00:36.210> of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and it's this big area where a bunch of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.479 
and it's this big area where a bunch of
hive<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.050> fallen<00:00:37.440> are<00:00:37.620> fighting<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.340> killing

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
hive and fallen are fighting and killing

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.369 
hive and fallen are fighting and killing
each<00:00:38.670> other<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.750> three<00:00:40.050> different

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
each other and there are three different

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.290 
each other and there are three different
event<00:00:40.620> locations<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.430> shooting<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.090> on

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
event locations and I'm shooting them on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
event locations and I'm shooting them on
the<00:00:42.420> ground<00:00:42.660> right<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.190> first

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the ground right here so the first

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.490 
the ground right here so the first
location<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.239> shooting<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.809> pretty

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
location that I'm shooting is pretty

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950 
location that I'm shooting is pretty
much<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.039> most<00:00:47.550> frequent<00:00:48.090> location<00:00:48.600> that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
much the most frequent location that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.900 
much the most frequent location that
you'll<00:00:49.170> find<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.680> public<00:00:49.950> event<00:00:50.250> spawn<00:00:50.579> but

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
you'll find the public event spawn but

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.060 
you'll find the public event spawn but
they<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.180> also<00:00:51.329> spawn<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> other<00:00:52.020> spots<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
they can also spawn the other spots that

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
they can also spawn the other spots that
I'm<00:00:53.160> shooting<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> screen<00:00:53.969> also<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
I'm shooting on the screen also the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
I'm shooting on the screen also the
frequency<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.070> events<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.879> used<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.270> be

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
frequency of these events it used to be

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.869 
frequency of these events it used to be
every<00:00:57.570> 25<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.590> 35<00:00:59.039> minutes<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.550> these<00:00:59.699> would

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
every 25 to 35 minutes that these would

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.650 
every 25 to 35 minutes that these would
come<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.960> area<00:01:01.320> however<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.120> frequency

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
come in this area however the frequency

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
come in this area however the frequency
has<00:01:03.780> been<00:01:03.930> doubled<00:01:04.350> by<00:01:04.500> Bungie<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> new

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
has been doubled by Bungie with a new

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.300 
has been doubled by Bungie with a new
patch<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:06.720> makes<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.229> every<00:01:07.409> 12<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> half

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
patch that makes it every 12 and a half

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
patch that makes it every 12 and a half
to<00:01:08.729> seventeen<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> half<00:01:09.630> minutes<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to seventeen and a half minutes that a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710 
to seventeen and a half minutes that a
public<00:01:10.680> event<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:11.280> spawn<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
public event will spawn so that is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.380 
public event will spawn so that is
really<00:01:13.439> really<00:01:14.130> frequent<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.150> pretty

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
really really frequent so this is pretty

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990 
really really frequent so this is pretty
much<00:01:15.570> one<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> best<00:01:16.799> areas<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.670> because

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
much one of the best areas also because

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.969 
much one of the best areas also because
these<00:01:18.180> three<00:01:18.450> event<00:01:18.720> locations<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.650> close

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
these three event locations are so close

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
these three event locations are so close
to<00:01:20.159> each<00:01:20.250> other<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:21.330> can't<00:01:21.600> miss<00:01:21.840> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
to each other you really can't miss it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.539 
to each other you really can't miss it
you<00:01:22.259> mean<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:22.650> no<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.310> you're<00:01:23.460> gonna

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you mean there's no way if you're gonna

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.060 
you mean there's no way if you're gonna
hang<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.090> area<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.009> said

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
hang out in this area and so like I said

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
hang out in this area and so like I said
the<00:01:26.430> event<00:01:26.580> type<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.299> almost<00:01:27.570> always<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the event type is almost always going to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.740 
the event type is almost always going to
be<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.710> war<00:01:29.040> set<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.460> say<00:01:29.700> almost<00:01:29.909> always<00:01:30.329> because

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
be a war set I say almost always because

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.950 
be a war set I say almost always because
I'm<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.619> 100%<00:01:32.100> sure<00:01:32.430> sometimes<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.329> may<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I'm not 100% sure sometimes it may be a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.679 
I'm not 100% sure sometimes it may be a
kill<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.009> high<00:01:35.220> value<00:01:35.400> target<00:01:36.030> kind<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
kill this high value target kind of

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.719 
kill this high value target kind of
public<00:01:36.990> event<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:37.920> most<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> time<00:01:38.579> it'll

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
public event but most of the time it'll

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
public event but most of the time it'll
be<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> war<00:01:39.180> set<00:01:39.479> where<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.990> defend<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
be a war set where you have to defend it

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.260 
be a war set where you have to defend it
and<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.009> course<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.430> seeing<00:01:41.700> me<00:01:41.820> defend<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and of course you're seeing me defend it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.990 
and of course you're seeing me defend it
on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> screen<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> something<00:01:44.970> you
