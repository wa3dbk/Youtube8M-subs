 is not taken into account 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.140
 the corners

 there are also houses 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.980
 located 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 And pleasant

 improve the living conditions of peasant populations 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.829
 it also means improving economic conditions 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:47.829
 security 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.019
