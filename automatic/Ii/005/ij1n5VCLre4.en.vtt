00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.270
 welcome again more recycled 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.130
 creative in this video I want to share 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.370
 with you how I transformed some 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 espadrilles and the custom sep 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.470
 some would call it a tunnel 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.420
 with them or customize them at a party 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.960
 they gave us these white espadrilles 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.630
 I used mine several times but not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.480
 They were my style, my husband has 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.490
 premiered I still decided to customize them 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 and turn them into very sandals 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.730
 we will need the sole of the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 espadrilles 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:45.170
 hemp thread or rope fishing line 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.170
 die needle and scissors 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
 we can use the rope as is 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.470
 although I preferred to make some 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.460
 four-strand braids I have used 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:05.700
 four pieces of 17 centimeters 2 of 23 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.180
 centimeters and two one meter and 30 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.180
 centimeters 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.930
 once the braid is finished we will take 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.189
 with fishing line so that it does not 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.189
 undo cutting with scissors 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.579
 here 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.240
 we grant the braid for all 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.710
 necessary points to obtain our 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.710
 pieces of different sizes 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.979
 here 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.000
 here 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.970
 the two longest pieces will be braids 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.299
 finer ones and when finishing these we will make a 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.299
 knot 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.569
 and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.200
 Y 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.880
 we will use a template to mark 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.300
 the points at which the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.300
 braids 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.540
 Y 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.830
 We will hold with some pins before 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.660
 sewing it would be advisable to check if 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.020
 These measures are appropriate to your size 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.020
 of skin 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.450
 ah 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.739
 ah 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.370
 once they are nailed and adjusted 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.790
 strips we will proceed to sew them with the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.790
 fishing line 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.660
 here 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.220
 to me 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.880
 we will use the longest braids and 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.220
 thin to pass through the two strips 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.220
 front and by the ankle 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.080
 We can decorate with conches or 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.980
 little shells on the beach to give them a 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.190
 touch more sailor 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.670
 but I also like nothing so what 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.670
 I leave to your liking 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.580
 I made these sandals from 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.999
 some cloth espadrilles that were not 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.809
 my style I have these others I do not know if 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:29.829
 I'll leave them as you are, what do you think? 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.829
 What would you have done 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.440
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.420

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.420
 the channel projects subscribe 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.939
 there are more sandals of this style in the 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:49.250
 channel are comfortable and I like a lot of power 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:52.400
 wear recycled and reused pieces 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.250
 made with my own hands your 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.800
