pretty<00:02:04.070> much<00:02:04.159> we<00:02:04.340> just<00:02:04.369> take<00:02:04.640> advantage<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.180> in

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
pretty much we just take advantage of in

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.120 
pretty much we just take advantage of in
having<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.659> good<00:02:05.689> time<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.320> think<00:02:06.650> Minnesota

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
having a good time I think Minnesota

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.150 
having a good time I think Minnesota
produces<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.939> lot<00:02:08.239> of<00:02:08.269> talent<00:02:08.750> because<00:02:09.079> we<00:02:09.950> all

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
produces a lot of talent because we all

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.490 
produces a lot of talent because we all
have<00:02:10.790> really<00:02:11.450> only<00:02:11.570> have<00:02:11.720> one<00:02:11.900> place<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.290> skate

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
have really only have one place to skate

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.370 
have really only have one place to skate
during<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.860> winter<00:02:13.100> time<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.549> so<00:02:14.420> skating<00:02:15.230> a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
during the winter time and so skating a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.710 
during the winter time and so skating a
skate<00:02:15.650> park<00:02:15.680> for<00:02:16.190> six<00:02:16.400> months<00:02:16.700> straight<00:02:16.910> we

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
skate park for six months straight we

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.180 
skate park for six months straight we
all<00:02:17.900> kind<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.440> get<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.709> know<00:02:18.739> each<00:02:18.980> other

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
all kind of get to know each other

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.610 
all kind of get to know each other
really<00:02:19.400> well<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.970> David<00:02:20.329> as<00:02:20.510> kind<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:20.959> kind<00:02:21.530> of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
really well and David as kind of kind of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.729 
really well and David as kind of kind of
a<00:02:21.739> unique<00:02:21.920> style<00:02:22.400> he<00:02:22.760> skates<00:02:23.030> big<00:02:23.570> stuff<00:02:24.049> like

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
a unique style he skates big stuff like

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.039 
a unique style he skates big stuff like
all<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.190> crazy<00:02:25.400> stuff<00:02:25.579> but<00:02:26.209> it's<00:02:26.329> it's<00:02:26.720> weird

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
all the crazy stuff but it's it's weird

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.319 
all the crazy stuff but it's it's weird
because<00:02:27.260> he<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.709> do<00:02:27.860> everything<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.700> tabari

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
because he can do everything and tabari

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.840 
because he can do everything and tabari
is<00:02:29.570> kind<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.079> same<00:02:30.260> way<00:02:30.320> like<00:02:30.860> can<00:02:31.579> jump

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
is kind of the same way like can jump

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.759 
is kind of the same way like can jump
down<00:02:31.970> some<00:02:32.209> huge<00:02:32.420> stuff<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.989> then<00:02:33.110> skate<00:02:33.620> some

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
down some huge stuff and then skate some

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.710 
down some huge stuff and then skate some
a<00:02:33.890> knee<00:02:33.950> pads

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
a knee pads

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.930 
a knee pads
so<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.440> don't<00:02:36.070> know<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.190> think<00:02:36.310> they<00:02:36.580> kind<00:02:36.760> of

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
so I don't know I think they kind of

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.030 
so I don't know I think they kind of
skates<00:02:37.750> similar<00:02:38.170> actually<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:40.770> while<00:02:41.770> making

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
skates similar actually a while making

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.480 
skates similar actually a while making
the<00:02:42.460> familia<00:02:43.330> video<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.890> whole<00:02:44.920> thing<00:02:45.310> was

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
the familia video the whole thing was

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.640 
the familia video the whole thing was
fun<00:02:45.700> man<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.150> real<00:02:46.240> like<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.630> was<00:02:46.750> just<00:02:46.870> me<00:02:47.530> and

for this project a good time skating
with<00:03:01.840> friends<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.380> happened<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.190> work<00:03:03.340> out

with friends and happened to work out
the<00:03:04.450> last<00:03:04.750> trick<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.440> Tabari<00:03:05.860> had<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.670> his

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
the last trick that Tabari had in his

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.449 
the last trick that Tabari had in his
little<00:03:07.300> section<00:03:07.810> was<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.440> back<00:03:08.740> nose<00:03:08.980> went<00:03:09.250> down

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
little section was a back nose went down

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.120 
little section was a back nose went down
it<00:03:10.209> was<00:03:10.240> a<00:03:10.510> 10<00:03:11.320> stair<00:03:11.830> rail<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.950> was<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
it was a 10 stair rail and that was the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.800 
it was a 10 stair rail and that was the
first<00:03:15.160> relative<00:03:15.670> our<00:03:15.970> he's<00:03:16.150> ever<00:03:16.300> done<00:03:16.510> he's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
first relative our he's ever done he's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.020 
first relative our he's ever done he's
never<00:03:17.050> voiced<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.500> around<00:03:17.740> before<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.370> don't

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
never voiced it around before I don't

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.780 
never voiced it around before I don't
know<00:03:19.120> how<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:19.330> can<00:03:19.660> bag<00:03:19.840> notes<00:03:20.110> monorail<00:03:20.790> not

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
know how you can bag notes monorail not

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.270 
know how you can bag notes monorail not
skate<00:03:22.090> rails<00:03:22.300> so<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.050> think<00:03:23.830> that<00:03:23.980> was<00:03:24.190> really

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
skate rails so I think that was really

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.350 
skate rails so I think that was really
cool<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.850> got<00:03:25.390> lucky<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.900> don't<00:03:26.170> know<00:03:27.209> I'm<00:03:28.209> gonna

out<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.750> lot<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:34.990> spots<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:35.920> hasn't<00:03:36.070> been

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
out of a lot of spots so it hasn't been

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.530 
out of a lot of spots so it hasn't been
working<00:03:36.400> too<00:03:36.610> good<00:03:36.640> but<00:03:37.000> we're<00:03:37.120> trying<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.450> get

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
working too good but we're trying to get

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.000 
working too good but we're trying to get
photos<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.260> we're<00:03:38.440> trying<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.680> flip<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:38.950> was

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
photos and we're trying to flip that was

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.210 
photos and we're trying to flip that was
up<00:03:39.220> if<00:03:39.430> we<00:03:39.760> were<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.030> win<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.750> would<00:03:41.260> probably

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
up if we were to win I would probably

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.699 
up if we were to win I would probably
try<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:42.730> move<00:03:43.420> out<00:03:43.630> west<00:03:43.840> during<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.380> winter

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709

try and move out west during the winter
I've<00:03:45.250> never<00:03:45.400> even<00:03:45.580> thought<00:03:45.850> about<00:03:45.910> that<00:03:46.420> far

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
I've never even thought about that far

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.270 
I've never even thought about that far
