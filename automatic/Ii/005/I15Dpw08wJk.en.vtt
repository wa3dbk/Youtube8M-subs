00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
husband found well the main reason is

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.450 
husband found well the main reason is
because<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.869> case<00:00:26.080> assortments<00:00:26.769> for<00:00:27.039> series

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
because the case assortments for series

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.150 
because the case assortments for series
four<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.930> both<00:00:29.080> Target<00:00:29.500> and<00:00:29.590> Toys<00:00:29.650> R<00:00:29.800> Us<00:00:30.010> do

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
four for both Target and Toys R Us do

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.950 
four for both Target and Toys R Us do
not<00:00:30.310> include<00:00:30.640> this<00:00:30.789> figure<00:00:31.090> because<00:00:31.750> that

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
not include this figure because that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.900 
not include this figure because that
there<00:00:32.140> is<00:00:32.320> an<00:00:32.500> extra<00:00:32.890> exclusive<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.640> series

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
there is an extra exclusive and series

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.150 
there is an extra exclusive and series
four<00:00:34.150> which<00:00:34.449> is<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.780> armored<00:00:35.140> packs<00:00:35.380> sum<00:00:36.040> of

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
four which is the armored packs sum of

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.190 
four which is the armored packs sum of
Toys<00:00:36.370> R<00:00:36.520> Us<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.910> Target<00:00:37.329> have<00:00:37.480> an<00:00:37.600> extra<00:00:37.960> armor

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
Toys R Us and Target have an extra armor

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.049 
Toys R Us and Target have an extra armor
pack<00:00:38.380> limiting<00:00:39.280> what<00:00:39.489> they<00:00:39.640> can<00:00:39.760> put<00:00:39.940> in<00:00:40.000> the

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
pack limiting what they can put in the

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.119 
pack limiting what they can put in the
case<00:00:40.270> but<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.140> also<00:00:41.290> doesn't<00:00:41.620> make<00:00:41.770> any<00:00:41.920> sense

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
case but it also doesn't make any sense

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.190 
case but it also doesn't make any sense
because<00:00:42.309> they<00:00:42.640> included<00:00:43.120> two<00:00:43.360> of<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.840> George

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
because they included two of the George

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.229 
because they included two of the George
figures<00:00:44.649> in<00:00:44.920> each<00:00:45.040> case<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:45.910> they<00:00:46.030> could<00:00:46.149> have

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
figures in each case so they could have

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.819 
figures in each case so they could have
easily<00:00:46.420> taken<00:00:46.750> away<00:00:47.050> one<00:00:47.230> of<00:00:47.289> the<00:00:47.379> George<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
easily taken away one of the George and

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.229 
easily taken away one of the George and
put<00:00:47.980> one<00:00:48.160> of<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.340> elite<00:00:48.579> generals<00:00:48.789> in<00:00:49.090> there

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
put one of the elite generals in there

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.420 
put one of the elite generals in there
so<00:00:49.899> that<00:00:49.930> basically<00:00:50.440> made<00:00:50.950> this<00:00:51.129> figure

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
so that basically made this figure

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.010 
so that basically made this figure
harder<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:51.969> find<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:52.600> shouldn't<00:00:52.899> really

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
harder to find and it shouldn't really

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.319 
harder to find and it shouldn't really
be<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.440> hard<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.739> find<00:00:53.920> anyways<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:55.210> that's

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
be that hard to find anyways so that's

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.750 
be that hard to find anyways so that's
mainly<00:00:55.870> McFarland's<00:00:56.680> marketing<00:00:57.190> problems

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
mainly McFarland's marketing problems

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.430 
mainly McFarland's marketing problems
but<00:00:58.570> anyways<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.180> let's<00:01:01.480> go<00:01:01.840> over<00:01:02.020> this<00:01:02.140> figure

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
but anyways so let's go over this figure

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.249 
but anyways so let's go over this figure
here<00:01:02.649> as<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.190> can<00:01:03.250> see<00:01:03.839> really<00:01:04.839> nice<00:01:04.989> and

let's<00:01:45.729> go<00:01:45.880> over<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.180> awesome<00:01:46.540> new<00:01:46.570> figure<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
let's go over this awesome new figure so

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.789 
let's go over this awesome new figure so
of<00:01:48.549> course<00:01:48.820> he<00:01:49.270> is<00:01:49.390> using<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.229> same<00:01:50.439> exact

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
of course he is using the same exact

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.039 
of course he is using the same exact
elite<00:01:51.340> mold<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:52.000> McFarlane<00:01:52.540> has<00:01:52.689> been<00:01:52.869> using

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
elite mold that McFarlane has been using

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.109 
elite mold that McFarlane has been using
for<00:01:53.350> all<00:01:53.470> their<00:01:53.740> elites<00:01:54.040> in<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.369> reach<00:01:54.850> line

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
for all their elites in the reach line

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.910 
for all their elites in the reach line
so<00:01:55.390> far<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:56.259> only<00:01:56.439> thing<00:01:56.560> that's<00:01:56.710> different

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
so far the only thing that's different

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.819 
so far the only thing that's different
obviously<00:01:57.369> is<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.180> extra<00:01:58.869> armor<00:01:59.200> seeing<00:01:59.530> like

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
obviously is the extra armor seeing like

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.370 
obviously is the extra armor seeing like

same exact thing that we've seen already
the<00:02:12.640> gold<00:02:12.819> is<00:02:13.209> really<00:02:13.510> fantastic<00:02:13.780> they<00:02:14.349> did<00:02:14.500> a

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
the gold is really fantastic they did a

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.110 
the gold is really fantastic they did a
nice<00:02:14.739> job<00:02:14.890> blending<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:15.730> together

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120

they<00:02:38.140> did<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.459> accessories<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.060> this

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
they did that the accessories that this

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.750 
they did that the accessories that this
figure<00:02:40.599> includes<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.129> main<00:02:42.400> one<00:02:42.579> which

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
figure includes so the main one which

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.490 
figure includes so the main one which
you<00:02:42.879> can<00:02:43.000> see<00:02:43.150> right<00:02:43.299> here<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.780> Figueroa

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
you can see right here is the Figueroa

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.920 
you can see right here is the Figueroa
gun<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.400> big<00:02:45.579> problem<00:02:45.940> about<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.599> that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
gun the big problem about this is that

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.349 
gun the big problem about this is that
it's<00:02:47.260> really<00:02:47.650> hard<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:48.160> get<00:02:48.280> into<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.849> elites

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
it's really hard to get into the elites

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.390 
it's really hard to get into the elites
hand<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.349> one<00:02:50.530> thing<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.799> would<00:02:50.859> recommend

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
hand the one thing I would recommend

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.670 
hand the one thing I would recommend
doing<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.760> boil<00:02:52.239> up<00:02:52.480> some<00:02:52.510> hot<00:02:52.720> water<00:02:53.109> or<00:02:53.440> just

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
doing is boil up some hot water or just

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.530 
doing is boil up some hot water or just
go<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.829> your<00:02:54.010> faucet<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.700> let<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> water<00:02:55.299> get

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
go to your faucet and let the water get

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.530 
go to your faucet and let the water get
really<00:02:55.840> hot<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.260> then<00:02:56.739> put<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.239> hand<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.420> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
really hot and then put the hand of the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.449 
really hot and then put the hand of the
elite<00:02:58.810> under<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.230> water<00:02:59.470> for<00:02:59.739> about<00:02:59.829> I'd<00:03:00.250> say

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
elite under the water for about I'd say

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.490 
elite under the water for about I'd say
30<00:03:00.700> seconds<00:03:01.120> or<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.109> will<00:03:02.260> make<00:03:02.349> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
30 seconds or so and that will make the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.530 
30 seconds or so and that will make the
plastics<00:03:02.950> off<00:03:03.129> and<00:03:03.459> then<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.030> can<00:03:04.060> easily

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
plastics off and then you can easily

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.690 
plastics off and then you can easily
move<00:03:04.659> it<00:03:04.810> into<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.319> feel<00:03:05.650> rug<00:03:05.890> gun<00:03:06.040> itself<00:03:06.430> so

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
move it into the feel rug gun itself so

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.280 
move it into the feel rug gun itself so
I<00:03:06.879> would<00:03:07.269> recommend<00:03:07.629> doing<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.959> if<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.170> do

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
I would recommend doing that if you do

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.170 
I would recommend doing that if you do
buy<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.500> figure<00:03:08.950> but<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.700> filler<00:03:09.970> gun

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
buy this figure but the filler gun

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.330 
buy this figure but the filler gun
itself<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.690> really<00:03:10.930> nice<00:03:11.079> it's<00:03:11.409> smaller<00:03:12.069> than

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
itself is really nice it's smaller than

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.309 
itself is really nice it's smaller than
the<00:03:12.430> Ava<00:03:12.609> 31<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.390> does<00:03:13.540> have<00:03:13.720> more<00:03:13.900> detail

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
the Ava 31 but it does have more detail

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.069 
the Ava 31 but it does have more detail
I<00:03:14.530> really<00:03:15.069> like<00:03:15.250> these<00:03:15.400> little<00:03:15.900> fuel<00:03:16.900> rod

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
I really like these little fuel rod

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.899 
I really like these little fuel rod
canisters<00:03:17.620> they're<00:03:18.099> in<00:03:18.220> already<00:03:18.730> called

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
canisters they're in already called

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.220 
canisters they're in already called
these<00:03:19.060> they're<00:03:19.420> kind<00:03:19.599> of<00:03:19.659> like<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.870> shells

can see out of this seeing that these

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.589 
can see out of this seeing that these
little<00:03:57.669> guard<00:03:57.879> things<00:03:58.120> appearing<00:03:58.480> which

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
little guard things appearing which

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.659

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
cover his eyes but I think that's a

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.270 
cover his eyes but I think that's a
little<00:04:01.510> bit<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.870> flaw<00:04:02.139> on<00:04:02.169> McFerrin<00:04:02.889> spart

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
seeing that I don't think it's supposed

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.330 
seeing that I don't think it's supposed
to<00:04:04.660> cover<00:04:04.840> up<00:04:05.019> their<00:04:05.109> eyes<00:04:05.290> but<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.310> a

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
to cover up their eyes but it is a

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.800

armor pieces they're really large
actually<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:55.870> makes<00:04:55.990> this<00:04:56.110> figure<00:04:56.410> look<00:04:56.620> even

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
actually it makes this figure look even

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.050 
actually it makes this figure look even
taller<00:04:57.040> than<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:58.200> supposed<00:04:59.200> to<00:04:59.290> be<00:05:00.060> you're

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
taller than it is supposed to be you're

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.970 
taller than it is supposed to be you're
all<00:05:01.180> compared<00:05:01.570> here<00:05:01.720> with<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.050> steel<00:05:02.560> ODST

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
all compared here with the steel ODST

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.980 
all compared here with the steel ODST
which<00:05:03.370> is<00:05:03.490> also<00:05:03.790> from<00:05:03.970> series<00:05:04.300> four<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:04.930> you

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
which is also from series four so you

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.630 
which is also from series four so you
can<00:05:05.110> see<00:05:05.230> it's<00:05:05.380> an<00:05:05.470> extremely<00:05:05.920> large<00:05:06.220> figure

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
and I really like the high thought of it
