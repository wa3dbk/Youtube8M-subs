 To San system Alphard 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:13.500
 I installed Car Security Golf

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.200
 The door lock turns on the system 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.990

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.990
 Acrylic indicator is shining 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.740

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.390

 If you are taking medicine and your key is now closer to the sliding door 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.909
 It is a function that the slide door opens automatically 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.270
 Even after this, we are linked after the goal 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:02.679
 There will never be an alarm 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:07.590
 There are so many questions here 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:10.630
