 in the particular residence adore themselves 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.860
 France in Tel Aviv 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.300
 sir christophe bigot we are 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.800
 together today to prepare the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.800
 recipe of the galette des rois 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.390
 this recipe we will do the 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.700
 frangipane 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.470
 So what is the stuffing of the galette des 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.950
 kings so for this one we have 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.960
 need 100 g of ointment butter than 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:10.370
 we put in a cul-de-poule ouzou 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:12.760
 symbol 100 g almond powder and 100 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.760
 g sugar 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 and then using a whip we 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.580
 let's go work the ointment butter with 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.180
 these three ingredients we are going 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.260
 corpore the egg yolks one by one I 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.790
 advocates breaking the eggs in a 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.180
 bowl to be able to look if there is no 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.220
 of cost which is then added another 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.590
 preparation 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.940
 here is an egg so and then we 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.500
 let's add a second offer so 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.150
 when you finished us this process there 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.040
 so you can add the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.740
 ingredients you want 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.320
 I like or add vanilla 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.320
 Freche is a little rum 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.229
 so we have the frangipane that is 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.950
 ready in the fridge now we go 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.950
 switch to puff pastry 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.520
 then using a circle or or a 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.150
 bowl a little smaller than the width of 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.610
 the puff pastry 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.380
 we're going to make a notch on the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:39.910
 paste we go water and the outline 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:41.230
 with an egg yolk so then when 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.840
 you have your golden puff pastry 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.110
 all around we will proceed to the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:03:01.720
 drop of the frangipane of the dough 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:03:03.580
 of almond we lowered the cream 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.690
 of almond on the puff pastry the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.150
 first puff pastry 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.930
 we will now put the bean 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:16.570
 in in the marzipan like these 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.870
 and we will cover it slightly with 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.970
 almond cream so then we go 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.190
 prepare the second dough-based 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:30.970
 flaky then put it on top and 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:34.530
 cover it with gilding have deposited so 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.370
 the second disc on frangipane 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:44.950
 so with the fingers we are going to close 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:47.320
 very gently the edges so we 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.660
 let's cut with the same disc with 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.660
 the same diameter as before 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.420
 so then with a cookie cutter we go 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.240
 cut slightly all around the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:09.160
 slab for can have a pretty shape 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:11.620
 alveolar so we have shaked and the 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:17.310
 King's galette tour 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.310
 we will then gilded generously 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.350
 the cake is removed from the fridge 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.140
 the rest you can see that the yellow 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.550
 of egg with the puff pastry and 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.740
 so now we will add a 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.740
 second layer of egg yolk 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.260
 we will find the center of the 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:45.070
 slab of kings to have a point of 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.890
 landmark to make the rosette and also 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:58.870
 to allow the evacuation of steam 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:05:00.670
 of water here is the cake of kings who 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:10.150
 so lend with the decorations we have 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:12.370
 seen a few days so I leave you 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.520
