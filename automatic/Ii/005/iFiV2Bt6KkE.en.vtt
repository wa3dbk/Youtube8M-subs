00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.380
 alessa a horse is called from at &amp; s now 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.090
 Six years old and that was ours today 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.520
 first tournament I am actually one 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.779
 real beginners in the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.939
 workstation I now have the trailer 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.349
 only three times before you train 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.110
 does not drive health until now 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.040
 impaired and now I want to 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.040
 every case 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.330
 So the workstation of course, something completely 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.519
 special no race 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.199
 disadvantaged the movement is not so 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.170
 important as for example a normal one 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.089
 Dressage all have the same 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.500
 Conditions are assessed the same 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.030
 that's really my name is lothar 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.989
 I am the judge on the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.269
 tournament length pulled 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.159
 We are not great dressage exams 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.190
 there are the basics of the three 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.570
 steps trot and gallop 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.070
 and just the permeability of the horses 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.549
 and permeable the horses are the more 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.810
 that will be more pleasant for the notes 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.150
 builds up then also of beginners 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.150
 find beginners and master 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 content of the judgment with the newcomers 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.970
 take care that they are even 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.740
 that the desy's tempi 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 work equally and that the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.120
 Obstacles are correct and clean 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.470
 so be a bit after 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.180
 cradle figures respectively after 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.820
 Ridden lines are ridden 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.890
 That's the right thing for the newcomers 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.960
 because the obstacles are not there 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:53.550
 difficult as with the beginners 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:56.460
 advanced measure of beginners 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.290
 Testing with devices makes the e1 as lightweight 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 by actually had only once 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.810
 no expectations at all that one 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.910
 rides a bike and stays decent 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.340
 hires and that worked well 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.350
 I am very satisfied for one more 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.970
 as satisfied you can be so as 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.890
 worked very well in the field 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.730
 you can still work on it but it 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:24.310
 is still young that this kind of 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.060
 riding pretty cool to have in 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.940
 moment yes I think that's good because it is 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.760
 what else and it is coming off 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.570
 this long-established dressage 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.400
 and spring tests it does not stop 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.080
 only the riders moment then more 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.650
 fun 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.650
 that's politics
