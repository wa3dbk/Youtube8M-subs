pool<00:00:21.789> there<00:00:22.789> are<00:00:22.880> a<00:00:22.939> lot<00:00:23.060> of<00:00:23.090> reasons<00:00:23.359> that<00:00:23.750> we

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
pool there are a lot of reasons that we

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.140 
pool there are a lot of reasons that we
didn't<00:00:24.619> need<00:00:24.769> it<00:00:24.830> anymore<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:25.519> we'll<00:00:25.760> go<00:00:25.910> into

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
didn't need it anymore and we'll go into

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.390 
didn't need it anymore and we'll go into
those<00:00:26.300> as<00:00:26.539> we<00:00:26.689> go<00:00:26.840> forward<00:00:27.170> but<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:28.099> biggest

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
those as we go forward but the biggest

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.269 
those as we go forward but the biggest
one<00:00:28.550> was<00:00:28.580> cost<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.449> lack<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.750> utility<00:00:30.529> the

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
one was cost and lack of utility the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.070 
one was cost and lack of utility the
pool<00:00:31.750> was<00:00:32.750> costing<00:00:33.290> us<00:00:33.500> about<00:00:34.900> $100<00:00:35.900> a<00:00:35.930> month

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
pool was costing us about $100 a month

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.030 
pool was costing us about $100 a month
on<00:00:36.620> average<00:00:37.490> in<00:00:38.480> chemicals<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.590> electricity

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
on average in chemicals and electricity

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.270 
on average in chemicals and electricity
and<00:00:40.430> water<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.450> we<00:00:42.290> weren't<00:00:42.560> using<00:00:42.950> it<00:00:43.250> very

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
and water and we weren't using it very

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.390 
and water and we weren't using it very
much<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:44.660> our<00:00:44.870> our<00:00:45.470> backyard<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.190> very

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
much and so our our backyard is very

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.180 
much and so our our backyard is very
small<00:00:46.820> anyway<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.140> swimming<00:00:48.530> pool<00:00:48.710> takes<00:00:49.010> up

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
small anyway the swimming pool takes up

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.330 
small anyway the swimming pool takes up
about<00:00:49.690> three-quarters<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.720> it<00:00:51.020> or<00:00:51.110> more<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.190> I

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
about three-quarters of it or more and I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.250 
about three-quarters of it or more and I
thought<00:00:52.550> maybe<00:00:52.790> we<00:00:52.940> can<00:00:53.180> put<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.780> better

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
thought maybe we can put that to better

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.730 
thought maybe we can put that to better
use<00:00:56.470> now<00:00:57.470> access<00:00:58.040> is<00:00:58.220> a<00:00:58.250> major<00:00:58.550> problem<00:00:58.970> for<00:00:59.240> us

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
use now access is a major problem for us

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.250 
use now access is a major problem for us
we<00:01:00.740> have<00:01:00.980> a<00:01:01.010> large<00:01:01.700> cemetery<00:01:02.390> directly<00:01:02.900> behind

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
we have a large cemetery directly behind

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.260 
we have a large cemetery directly behind
the<00:01:03.440> house<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.159> we<00:01:04.309> have<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:06.520> deck<00:01:07.520> blocking

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
the house and we have a deck blocking

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.090 
the house and we have a deck blocking
the<00:01:08.540> west<00:01:08.990> side<00:01:09.260> entrance

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
the west side entrance

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.780 
the west side entrance
and<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:12.260> east<00:01:12.440> side<00:01:12.680> seems<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.460> be<00:01:13.580> the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
and so the east side seems to be the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.910 
and so the east side seems to be the
very<00:01:13.820> best<00:01:14.030> place<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:14.570> go<00:01:14.870> in<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.350> can<00:01:15.530> see<00:01:15.770> in

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
very best place to go in you can see in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.390 
very best place to go in you can see in

that<00:02:19.540> whole<00:02:19.840> Phil<00:02:20.230> took<00:02:20.920> five<00:02:21.730> loads<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.710> sand

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.100 

load<00:02:26.770> was<00:02:27.190> 9<00:02:27.520> cubic<00:02:28.030> yards<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.720> dump<00:02:28.930> truck

and then another three loads of sand

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.670 
and then another three loads of sand
alone<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:37.360> kind<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.720> projects<00:02:38.200> pretty<00:02:38.440> easy

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
alone this kind of projects pretty easy

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.770 
alone this kind of projects pretty easy
if<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.220> let<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> machinery<00:02:39.940> do<00:02:40.300> all<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> work

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
if you let the machinery do all the work
