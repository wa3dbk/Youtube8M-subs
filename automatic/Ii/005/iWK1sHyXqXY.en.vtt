00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
wanna do right here is between those two

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.520 
wanna do right here is between those two
steps<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.179> shot<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.960> want<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.200> stand

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
steps that I just shot you want to stand

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.799 
steps that I just shot you want to stand
on<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.009> first<00:00:14.309> step<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:15.240> first<00:00:15.480> step

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
on the first step that the first step

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349 
on the first step that the first step
that<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.080> shot<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.340> want<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> move<00:00:17.699> left

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
that I shot and you want to move left

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.269 
that I shot and you want to move left
towards<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.170> second<00:00:19.590> step<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.920> there<00:00:20.130> will

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
towards that second step and there will

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.160 
towards that second step and there will
be<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> gap<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.029> between<00:00:21.420> both<00:00:21.600> those<00:00:21.869> steps

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
be a gap in between both those steps

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.109 
be a gap in between both those steps
they'll<00:00:22.380> cause<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> fall<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.580> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
they'll cause you to fall like that and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.779 
they'll cause you to fall like that and
as<00:00:25.019> you're<00:00:25.320> falling<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.070> want<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> move<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
as you're falling you want to move to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.429 
as you're falling you want to move to
the<00:00:26.910> left<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.449> don't<00:00:27.720> end<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the left so you don't end up on the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.019 
the left so you don't end up on the
right<00:00:28.619> side<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.130> wall<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.580> when<00:00:29.910> you're

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
right side of that wall and when you're

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.400 
right side of that wall and when you're
on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.330> side<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.689> wall<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.230> only

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
on the right side of the wall the only

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.549 
on the right side of the wall the only
way<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:31.800> kills<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:33.329> use<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> sniper<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
way to get kills is to use a sniper and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.590 
way to get kills is to use a sniper and
that's<00:00:34.770> look<00:00:35.700> through<00:00:35.850> your<00:00:35.910> sights<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.420> look

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that's look through your sights to look

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
that's look through your sights to look
through<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> wall<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.219> move<00:00:38.340> left

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
through the wall but if you move left

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
through the wall but if you move left
you'll<00:00:38.879> be<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> other<00:00:39.300> side<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.809> as

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
you'll be on the other side of one as

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.260 
you'll be on the other side of one as
you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.190> shoot<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> floor<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you can see you can shoot the floor you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.290 
you can see you can shoot the floor you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
there if you want to kill yourself you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
there if you want to kill yourself you
gotta<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:02.879> frag<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.359> there<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.809> think

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
gotta for your frag right there I think

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.600 
gotta for your frag right there I think
it'll<00:01:04.320> kill<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.220> cuz<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.519> only

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it'll kill you I don't know cuz I only

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.870 
it'll kill you I don't know cuz I only
use<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> sniper<00:01:06.119> class<00:01:07.490> but<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.760> that's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
use the sniper class but I think that's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.440 
use the sniper class but I think that's
how<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.180> kill<00:01:09.540> yourself<00:01:11.420> yeah<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
how you would kill yourself yeah and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
how you would kill yourself yeah and
right<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.140> I'm<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.260> looking<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:14.189> how<00:01:14.280> far

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
right here I'm just looking see how far

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
right here I'm just looking see how far
you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.760> actually<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.470> see

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you can actually see so you can see

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.170 
you can actually see so you can see
pretty<00:01:16.830> damn<00:01:17.100> far<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
pretty damn far and that's if you have a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.320 
pretty damn far and that's if you have a
sniper<00:01:18.420> probably<00:01:19.290> your<00:01:19.380> best<00:01:19.530> chance

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
sniper probably your best chance

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.609 
sniper probably your best chance

can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> way<00:01:28.229> back<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:28.680> spawn

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
can see all the way back and there spawn

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.410 
can see all the way back and there spawn
damn<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:30.960> good<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
damn it's really good you can see if you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.120 
damn it's really good you can see if you
had<00:01:33.540> enemy<00:01:33.960> snipers<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.009> only

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
had enemy snipers up there but the only

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
had enemy snipers up there but the only
problem<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> can't<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.630> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
problem is you can't go down there as it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
problem is you can't go down there as it
goes<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:38.759> die<00:01:38.939> because

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
goes because you you will die because

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.319 
goes because you you will die because
you<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> enter<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.439> boundary<00:01:41.009> area<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
you have to enter that boundary area and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.030
