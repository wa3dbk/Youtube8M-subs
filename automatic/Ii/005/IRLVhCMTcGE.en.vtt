00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720 

this<00:00:00.210> is<00:00:00.359> an<00:00:00.510> example<00:00:00.870> of<00:00:01.610> animations<00:00:02.610> using

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
this is an example of animations using

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.280 
this is an example of animations using
f5<00:00:03.710> I've<00:00:04.710> already<00:00:04.980> pre-loaded<00:00:05.839> an<00:00:06.839> animation

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
f5 I've already pre-loaded an animation

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.100 
f5 I've already pre-loaded an animation
of<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.680> surface<00:00:08.340> dew<00:00:08.519> points<00:00:08.940> animations<00:00:09.900> are

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
of the surface dew points animations are

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.860 
of the surface dew points animations are
a<00:00:10.139> useful<00:00:10.410> way<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.940> look<00:00:11.940> off<00:00:12.179> into<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.570> future

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
a useful way to look off into the future

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.330 
a useful way to look off into the future
and<00:00:13.349> pick<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> specific<00:00:14.849> system<00:00:15.660> or

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
and pick out a specific system or

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.470 
and pick out a specific system or
environment<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.820> might<00:00:17.970> want<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.330> home

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
environment that you might want to home

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.040 
environment that you might want to home
in<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.560> example<00:00:20.039> i<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> use

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
in on for example i like to use

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.019 
in on for example i like to use
something<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.439> where<00:00:23.279> I'm<00:00:23.430> animating

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
something like this where I'm animating

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.990 
something like this where I'm animating
dew<00:00:24.210> points<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> future<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.789> see

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
dew points into the future and I can see

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.529 
dew points into the future and I can see
when<00:00:27.269> moisture<00:00:27.599> gets<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.260> Minnesota<00:00:29.539> when

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
when moisture gets up in Minnesota when

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.120 
when moisture gets up in Minnesota when
I<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> certain<00:00:31.679> amount<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> moisture

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
I see that a certain amount of moisture

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.670 
I see that a certain amount of moisture
gets<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.809> pause<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> can

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
gets here then I can pause and I can

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.490 
gets here then I can pause and I can
look<00:00:35.070> at<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.480> time<00:00:36.480> period<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.930> more<00:00:37.079> detail

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
look at that time period in more detail

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.470 
look at that time period in more detail
and<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.579> means<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.239> there's<00:00:39.390> going

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and see if that means that there's going

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.990 
and see if that means that there's going
to<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.629> severe<00:00:40.020> weather<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.760> means

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
to be severe weather or what that means

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
to be severe weather or what that means
exactly<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.710> an<00:00:43.800> animation

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
exactly so that's what an animation

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.279 
exactly so that's what an animation
looks<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.750> show<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.079> how

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
looks like I'm going to now show you how

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.770 
looks like I'm going to now show you how
to<00:00:46.350> set<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.739> an<00:00:46.860> animation<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.940> time<00:00:48.210> strip<00:00:48.600> up

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to set up an animation the time strip up

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.950 
to set up an animation the time strip up
here<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.440> menu<00:00:50.039> bar<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.520> how<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> control

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
here in the menu bar is how you control

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200 
here in the menu bar is how you control
your<00:00:52.170> animation<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:53.489> now<00:00:53.610> I'm<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.000> turn

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
your animation for now I'm going to turn

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
your animation for now I'm going to turn
it<00:00:54.390> off<00:00:54.629> by<00:00:54.960> hitting<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.500> button<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it off by hitting the on button and that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
it off by hitting the on button and that
shuts<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> animation<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.230> wanted<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
shuts the animation off if I wanted to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.380 
shuts the animation off if I wanted to
create<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> new<00:00:59.039> animation<00:00:59.789> let's<00:00:59.969> start<00:01:00.270> over

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
create a new animation let's start over

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
create a new animation let's start over
as<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.170> didn't<00:01:01.500> create<00:01:01.770> anything<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.430> far

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
as if we didn't create anything so far

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.189 
as if we didn't create anything so far
the<00:01:03.149> first<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.539> we're<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the first thing we're going to want to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.010 
the first thing we're going to want to
do<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.589> we're<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.519> pick<00:01:05.939> our<00:01:06.150> model<00:01:06.840> in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
do is we're just we pick our model in

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.500 
do is we're just we pick our model in
our<00:01:07.320> forecast<00:01:07.860> period<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> forecast

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
our forecast period now the forecast

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.940 
our forecast period now the forecast
period<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:10.080> isn't<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> matter<00:01:10.710> at

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
period actually isn't going to matter at

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
period actually isn't going to matter at
this<00:01:11.100> point<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.580> pick<00:01:11.790> anything<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this point you can pick anything just to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
this point you can pick anything just to
get<00:01:13.290> things<00:01:13.470> started<00:01:13.820> let's<00:01:14.820> say<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.240> wanted

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
get things started let's say we wanted

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.310 
get things started let's say we wanted
to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:16.920> jet<00:01:17.580> stream<00:01:17.909> animation<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.170> we're

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to do a jet stream animation so we're

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.530 
to do a jet stream animation so we're
going<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> share<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.610> bring<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:20.939> 300

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
going to share will bring up 300

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.810 
going to share will bring up 300
millibar<00:01:22.020> wind<00:01:22.290> speed<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
millibar wind speed and then they do the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
millibar wind speed and then they do the
animation<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> time<00:01:25.170> strip

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
animation you go up to the time strip

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.499 
animation you go up to the time strip
and<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> select<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.610> start<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.030> end<00:01:27.240> period

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and you select your start and end period

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.539 
and you select your start and end period
right<00:01:28.470> now<00:01:28.500> I've<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.070> namm<00:01:29.280> worth

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
right now I've got the namm worth

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.719 
right now I've got the namm worth
computer<00:01:30.210> model<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.979> father<00:01:32.189> started<00:01:32.579> can

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
computer model so the father started can

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.670 
computer model so the father started can
go<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.880> 80<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.360> hours<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.170> i<00:01:34.290> wanted<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> do

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
go is 80 for hours so if i wanted to do

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.010 
go is 80 for hours so if i wanted to do
that<00:01:34.710> i<00:01:34.860> start<00:01:35.310> off<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.610> 0<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> 84<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.960> i

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that i start off at 0 and go to 84 if i

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469 
that i start off at 0 and go to 84 if i
wanted<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> start<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.490> tomorrow<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
wanted to start and just do tomorrow I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.190 
wanted to start and just do tomorrow I
could<00:01:40.320> go<00:01:40.439> 24<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:43.649> 48<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> slot<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
could go 24 to 48 I can do a slot in the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.340 
could go 24 to 48 I can do a slot in the
future<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.670> any<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.259> let's<00:01:49.259> just

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
future I can do any of that let's just

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.819 
future I can do any of that let's just
do<00:01:49.560> 0<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.369> 84<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.290> then<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.439> start<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
do 0 to 84 and then to start the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
do 0 to 84 and then to start the
animation<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.490> push<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.149> off<00:01:54.420> button<00:01:54.930> which

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
animation you push this off button which

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.340 
animation you push this off button which
will<00:01:55.350> change<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.750> now<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.170> going

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
will change it to be on now it's going

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
will change it to be on now it's going
to<00:01:58.409> take<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.799> time<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> animate<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.000> has

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
to take a little time to animate it has

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.350 
to take a little time to animate it has
to<00:02:00.570> download<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.590> files<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:03.149> has

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
to download all of the files and it has

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.230 
to download all of the files and it has
to<00:02:03.689> take<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.860> data<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> render<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.000> image

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
to take that data and render an image

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.660 
to take that data and render an image
from<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:07.350> process<00:02:07.649> takes<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.310> lot<00:02:08.459> longer

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
from it that process takes a lot longer

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.820 
from it that process takes a lot longer
than<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.360> pulling<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.750> images<00:02:10.259> off<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
than just pulling up images off for the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.480 
than just pulling up images off for the

that for each time period if you look at
the<00:02:22.860> upper<00:02:23.160> left<00:02:23.370> you'll<00:02:23.790> see<00:02:23.880> 15<00:02:24.630> hour

forecast<00:02:25.110> 18<00:02:25.920> hour<00:02:26.010> forecast<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.240> that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
forecast 18 hour forecast so that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.960 
forecast 18 hour forecast so that
increments<00:02:28.110> as<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.590> does<00:02:28.800> each<00:02:29.130> frame<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.850> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
increments as it does each frame of the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.360 
increments as it does each frame of the
animation<00:02:30.740> when<00:02:31.740> it's<00:02:31.890> done<00:02:32.070> with<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
animation when it's done with the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.700 
animation when it's done with the
animation<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.120> will<00:02:33.270> immediately<00:02:33.510> start<00:02:34.230> now

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
animation it will immediately start now

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.580 
animation it will immediately start now
there<00:02:35.100> are<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.220> few<00:02:35.340> things<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.670> keep<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.030> mind

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
there are a few things to keep in mind

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.700 
there are a few things to keep in mind
you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.770> do<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> constraint<00:02:38.640> time<00:02:39.300> period<00:02:39.780> so

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
you can do the constraint time period so

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.810 
you can do the constraint time period so
if<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.630> went<00:02:42.630> up<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:43.050> your<00:02:43.860> time<00:02:44.130> strip<00:02:44.520> and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
if you went up to your time strip and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.940 
if you went up to your time strip and
you<00:02:44.970> went<00:02:45.180> from<00:02:45.360> 24<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:45.990> 48<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.740> would<00:02:46.830> only

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you went from 24 to 48 you would only

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.310 
you went from 24 to 48 you would only
have<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> day's<00:02:47.490> worth<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.820> animating<00:02:48.450> that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
have a day's worth of animating that

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.380 
have a day's worth of animating that
will<00:02:49.470> be<00:02:49.590> useful<00:02:49.830> because<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:51.030> maybe<00:02:51.240> don't

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
will be useful because you maybe don't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.740 
will be useful because you maybe don't
want<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.290> whole<00:02:52.500> model<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.300> also<00:02:54.480> be

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
want the whole model and it also be

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.380 
want the whole model and it also be
faster<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.290> load<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.010> pick<00:02:56.280> specific<00:02:56.880> time

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
faster to load if you pick specific time

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.810 
faster to load if you pick specific time
3<00:02:59.360> also<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.630> faster<00:03:01.200> if<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.650> don't<00:03:01.920> load<00:03:02.430> any

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
3 also it's faster if you don't load any

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.840 
3 also it's faster if you don't load any
labels<00:03:03.390> or<00:03:03.660> outlining<00:03:04.410> on<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:05.250> graphic<00:03:05.700> if

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
labels or outlining on the graphic if

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.300 
labels or outlining on the graphic if
you're<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.690> for<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.050> data<00:03:07.710> it's<00:03:08.190> a

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
you're just in it for the data it's a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.880 
you're just in it for the data it's a
lot<00:03:08.490> quicker<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.900> do<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.560> just

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
lot quicker to to do it with just

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.090 
lot quicker to to do it with just
shading<00:03:11.790> or<00:03:11.940> just<00:03:12.510> being<00:03:12.690> contoured<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
shading or just being contoured and the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.030 
shading or just being contoured and the
reason<00:03:14.430> being<00:03:14.460> is<00:03:14.910> when<00:03:15.210> you<00:03:15.720> have<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:16.230> shaded

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
reason being is when you have a shaded

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.180 
reason being is when you have a shaded
map<00:03:17.340> without<00:03:17.700> lines<00:03:18.270> or<00:03:18.720> labels<00:03:19.190> you're

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
map without lines or labels you're

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.630 
map without lines or labels you're
actually<00:03:20.430> overlaying<00:03:21.500> two<00:03:22.500> layers<00:03:22.770> onto<00:03:23.250> one

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
actually overlaying two layers onto one

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.560 
actually overlaying two layers onto one
map<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.720> you're<00:03:26.000> creating<00:03:27.000> twice<00:03:27.240> as<00:03:27.420> much

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
map so you're creating twice as much

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.230 
map so you're creating twice as much
work<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.140> create<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.590> animation<00:03:28.760> also<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
work to create the animation also the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.450 
work to create the animation also the
animation<00:03:31.020> is<00:03:31.170> only<00:03:31.410> going<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.710> be<00:03:31.800> as<00:03:31.920> fast<00:03:32.220> as

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
animation is only going to be as fast as

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.670 
animation is only going to be as fast as
your<00:03:32.610> processor<00:03:33.240> is<00:03:33.360> able<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.690> handle<00:03:34.110> because

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
your processor is able to handle because

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.400 
your processor is able to handle because
this<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.160> not<00:03:35.340> images<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.210> is<00:03:36.420> vector<00:03:37.020> data

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
this is not images this is vector data

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.880 
this is not images this is vector data
it's<00:03:38.280> actually<00:03:39.020> drawing<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.230> bunch<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.620> shapes

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
it's actually drawing a bunch of shapes

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.100 
it's actually drawing a bunch of shapes
on<00:03:41.190> your<00:03:41.490> map<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:42.090> takes<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.540> little<00:03:42.690> bit<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
on your map it takes a little bit to

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.870 
on your map it takes a little bit to
animate<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> if<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:43.860> have<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.010> slower<00:03:44.250> computer

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
animate it if you have a slower computer

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.410 
animate it if you have a slower computer
but<00:03:45.150> if<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:46.110> zoom<00:03:46.140> in<00:03:46.760> on<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.820> portion<00:03:48.270> of<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
but if you zoom in on a portion of the
