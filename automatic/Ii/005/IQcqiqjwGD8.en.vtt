the<00:00:14.190> project<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.630> reintroduce<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the project is to reintroduce the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.250 
the project is to reintroduce the
Eastern<00:00:17.010> indigo<00:00:17.400> snake<00:00:17.730> into<00:00:18.539> South<00:00:18.750> Alabama

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
Eastern indigo snake into South Alabama

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.900 
Eastern indigo snake into South Alabama
and<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:19.920> started<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.550> connector

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
and so we have started here in connector

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.590 
and so we have started here in connector
National<00:00:21.240> Forest<00:00:21.600> because<00:00:23.180> with<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.480> we

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
National Forest because with what we

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.450 
National Forest because with what we
have<00:00:24.720> seen<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.410> best<00:00:25.619> habitat<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.369> we

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
have seen this the best habitat that we

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.160 
have seen this the best habitat that we
have<00:00:26.580> available<00:00:26.670> right<00:00:27.150> now<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.779> plus

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
have available right now is here plus

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.230 
have available right now is here plus
it's<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.529> large<00:00:28.890> piece<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> landscape<00:00:29.699> that's

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it's a large piece of landscape that's

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.659 
it's a large piece of landscape that's
being<00:00:30.449> managed<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.470> longleaf<00:00:31.980> restoration

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
being managed for longleaf restoration

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.549 
being managed for longleaf restoration
that's<00:00:32.969> very<00:00:33.120> important<00:00:33.750> that's<00:00:34.140> that's<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that's very important that's that's a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.889 
that's very important that's that's a
key<00:00:34.770> part<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.719> have

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
key part in all of this is that we have

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.889 
key part in all of this is that we have
to<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:38.040> good<00:00:38.430> longleaf<00:00:38.969> restoration<00:00:39.600> taking

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to have good longleaf restoration taking

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.819 
to have good longleaf restoration taking
place<00:00:40.140> because<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.670> eastern<00:00:42.030> indigo<00:00:42.360> snake

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
place because the eastern indigo snake

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.250 
place because the eastern indigo snake
is<00:00:44.420> an<00:00:45.710> ecological<00:00:46.710> element<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> longleaf

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is an ecological element of the longleaf

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.310 
is an ecological element of the longleaf
pine<00:00:49.739> ecosystem<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:51.390> indigo<00:00:51.660> snake<00:00:51.870> project

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
pine ecosystem the indigo snake project

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
pine ecosystem the indigo snake project
is<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.590> exciting<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.489> us<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
is really exciting for us because it's a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.200 
is really exciting for us because it's a
project<00:00:54.690> that's<00:00:54.809> trying<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> reintroduce

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
project that's trying to reintroduce

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.369 
project that's trying to reintroduce
threaten<00:00:57.210> snake<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.719> hasn't<00:00:58.020> been<00:00:58.079> seen<00:00:58.320> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
threaten snake that hasn't been seen in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.430 
threaten snake that hasn't been seen in
Alabama<00:00:58.920> since<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> 1950s<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.230> it's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
Alabama since the 1950s and so it's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
Alabama since the 1950s and so it's
setting<00:01:01.920> precedents<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.640> science<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.239> also

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
setting precedents for science and also

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
setting precedents for science and also
for<00:01:03.660> conservation<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> state<00:01:04.979> so

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
for conservation here in the state so

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.370 
for conservation here in the state so
we're<00:01:05.549> proud<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> part<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.840> are

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
we're proud to be a part of that and are

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
we're proud to be a part of that and are
glad<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.590> society<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.400> conservation

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
glad that society for conservation

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.429 
glad that society for conservation
biology<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.720> involved<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.350> this

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
biology can be involved with this

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.950 
biology can be involved with this
project<00:01:10.790> being<00:01:11.790> an<00:01:11.909> undergraduate<00:01:12.299> that's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
project being an undergraduate that's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
project being an undergraduate that's
amazing<00:01:13.229> experience<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.130> something

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
amazing experience and not something

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.440 
amazing experience and not something
you're<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.030> very<00:01:15.060> many

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you're going to get to do very many

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.940 
you're going to get to do very many
places<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> very<00:01:17.580> endangered<00:01:17.850> snake<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
places it's a very endangered snake and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.499 
places it's a very endangered snake and
you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.369> real<00:01:20.790> lucky<00:01:21.060> experience

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you know it's a real lucky experience

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
you know it's a real lucky experience
even<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> see<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.290> much<00:01:22.920> less<00:01:22.950> touch<00:01:23.430> one

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
even get to see one much less touch one

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
even get to see one much less touch one
what's<00:01:24.119> important<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.080> put<00:01:25.350> these

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
what's important that we put these

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.219 
what's important that we put these
snakes<00:01:25.890> back<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.689> they<00:01:27.900> used<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
snakes back because we know they used to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
snakes back because we know they used to
be<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:28.799> records<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.659> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
be here there's records of this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.670 
be here there's records of this

be<00:01:55.400> worthwhile<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:57.170> have<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.890> important

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
be worthwhile to have this important

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.869 
be worthwhile to have this important
