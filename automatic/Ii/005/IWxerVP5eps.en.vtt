endurance conditioning all this stuff

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.880 
endurance conditioning all this stuff
rolled<00:00:27.310> into<00:00:27.460> one<00:00:27.609> what<00:00:28.569> can<00:00:28.779> we<00:00:28.929> do<00:00:29.169> if<00:00:29.589> we

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
rolled into one what can we do if we

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.769 
rolled into one what can we do if we
took<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:30.159> up<00:00:30.339> a<00:00:30.460> notch<00:00:30.489> and<00:00:30.970> that's<00:00:31.449> exactly

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
took it up a notch and that's exactly

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.170 
took it up a notch and that's exactly
why<00:00:32.170> we<00:00:32.200> have<00:00:32.410> two<00:00:32.830> very<00:00:33.190> different<00:00:33.310> dumbbell

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
why we have two very different dumbbell

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.300 
why we have two very different dumbbell

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
ourselves challenged equally we find

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.539 
ourselves challenged equally we find
that<00:01:04.929> we're<00:01:05.079> always<00:01:05.259> asymmetrically<00:01:06.189> loading

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
that we're always asymmetrically loading

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.279 
that we're always asymmetrically loading
so<00:01:06.759> basically<00:01:07.179> going<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.329> take<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.600> 100<00:01:08.079> and

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
so basically going to take this 100 and

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
shoulder stays squeezed back together we

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.539 
shoulder stays squeezed back together we
turn<00:01:21.280> around<00:01:21.869> walk<00:01:22.869> back<00:01:23.170> this<00:01:23.799> hundred<00:01:24.310> pound

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
turn around walk back this hundred pound

and I come back now I'm going to show

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.560 
and I come back now I'm going to show
you<00:01:45.920> another<00:01:46.920> variation<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.299> put

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you another variation that you can put

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.569 
you another variation that you can put
incorporate<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.259> well<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:50.369> can

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
incorporate as well we can

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.670 
incorporate as well we can
asymmetrically<00:01:51.329> load<00:01:51.509> right<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.960> left<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.590> we

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
asymmetrically load right to left but we

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.700 
asymmetrically load right to left but we
can<00:01:52.829> also<00:01:53.039> asymmetrically<00:01:53.970> load<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.560> down

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
can also asymmetrically load up and down

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.359 
can also asymmetrically load up and down
a<00:01:55.979> vertical<00:01:56.340> displacement<00:01:58.399> looks<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.580> this

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.430 

right<00:02:05.689> just<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:24.059 

low<00:02:11.800> ceilings<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:22.470> wanna<00:02:23.470> hit<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.709> ceiling<00:02:23.980> on

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
low ceilings I wanna hit the ceiling on

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.920 
low ceilings I wanna hit the ceiling on
the<00:02:24.130> way<00:02:24.220> back<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.270> get<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.510> point

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the way back but you get the point

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.670 
the way back but you get the point
that<00:02:26.860> was<00:02:27.010> pretty<00:02:27.250> heavy<00:02:27.520> for<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:29.290> dumbbells

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
that was pretty heavy for the dumbbells

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.460 
that was pretty heavy for the dumbbells
but<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:31.120> can<00:02:31.300> light<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.959> challenge

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
but you can light it up and challenge

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.380 
but you can light it up and challenge
yourself<00:02:32.770> accordingly<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:34.000> there<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.270> go
