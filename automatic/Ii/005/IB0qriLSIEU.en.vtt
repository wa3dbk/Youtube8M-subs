adapter that comes with the controller
this<00:02:53.770> set<00:02:54.010> actor<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.370> made<00:02:54.550> in<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.790> way<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.000> it

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
this set actor is made in a way so it

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.449 
this set actor is made in a way so it
makes<00:02:55.510> sure<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.780> no<00:02:56.200> cables<00:02:56.680> interfere<00:02:57.250> with
