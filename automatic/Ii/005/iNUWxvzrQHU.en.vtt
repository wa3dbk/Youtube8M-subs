 for those who use 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.219
 generates a doubt and is to start charging eventually for four stool 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:40.639
 for that application 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.030
 good is not that we with the blackberry messenger that is the system 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.310
 that these leaks of tens and thousands blackberry messenger 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.039

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.960
 While they have data service with the hostel 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.800
 that communication remains unlimited free 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.889
 instead of having certain limits with what the text with the blackberry 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.680
 messenger you can allow as you say with your family that you are 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.770
 in Latin America to be in contact not only against that but also with

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.630
 a guy who does iphone consumer business that creative guy and the detroit 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.509
 he's a guy he likes best 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.939
 the middleman and is a little more and quino than the rest of the expedition 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.379
 so 1 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.730
 percent bonus 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.410

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.370
 some kind of recovery for the blackberry addicts because already many 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.539

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.789
 the third country 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.659
 azad bono maybe it can be sat some kind of interesting application 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.169

 I want the problems of these devices is that they allow us to be connected 

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:26.839
 all the time even when 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.749
