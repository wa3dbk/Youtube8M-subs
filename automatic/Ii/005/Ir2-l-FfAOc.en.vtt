wire goes on the ring and the bare

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.719 
wire goes on the ring and the bare
copper<00:02:02.880> growler<00:02:03.420> goes<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> sleeve<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.640> you

copper growler goes on the sleeve so you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.869 
copper growler goes on the sleeve so you
want<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.149> test<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.110> ends<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> your<00:02:07.530> new<00:02:07.879> your

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.390 
our black there and the white there now
I<00:02:22.180> should<00:02:22.420> also<00:02:22.450> mention<00:02:22.720> before<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.620> solder

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
I should also mention before you solder

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.089 
I should also mention before you solder
your<00:02:24.640> wires<00:02:24.849> on<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.900> put<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.470> into<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
your wires on that you put this into the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.340 
your wires on that you put this into the
strain<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.880> leaf<00:02:28.030> thing<00:02:28.690> out<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.050> end<00:02:29.200> and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
strain and leaf thing out the end and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.250 
strain and leaf thing out the end and
then<00:02:30.220> once<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:30.610> all<00:02:30.760> together<00:02:30.940> just<00:02:31.480> slide

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
then once it's all together just slide

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.430 
then once it's all together just slide
this<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.680> screw<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.100> together<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:35.140> that's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
this on and screw it together and that's

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.110 
this on and screw it together and that's
what<00:02:35.680> looks<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.069> after<00:02:36.520> it's<00:02:36.640> all<00:02:36.819> screwed

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
what looks like after it's all screwed

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.370 
what looks like after it's all screwed
together<00:02:37.800> right<00:02:38.800> now<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.640> part<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.030> done<00:02:40.380> now

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
together right now that part is done now

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.580

here okay there we have Yule one it now
to<00:03:08.890> put<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.160> new<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.459> now<00:03:10.360> when<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.600> put

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
to put the new one in now when you put

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.780 
to put the new one in now when you put
these<00:03:10.959> in<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.410> don't<00:03:11.590> know<00:03:11.739> if<00:03:11.799> it's<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.640> can

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
these in I don't know if it's you can

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.880 
these in I don't know if it's you can
see<00:03:12.819> or<00:03:13.150> not<00:03:13.299> but<00:03:14.019> you'll<00:03:14.140> see<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.380> one<00:03:14.650> lead

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
see or not but you'll see that one lead

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.729 
see or not but you'll see that one lead
is<00:03:15.160> just<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:16.299> slightly<00:03:16.989> longer<00:03:17.350> than<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
is just the slightly longer than the

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.039 
is just the slightly longer than the
other<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:18.730> shorter<00:03:19.150> lead<00:03:19.299> is<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.720> negative

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
other the shorter lead is your negative

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.650 
other the shorter lead is your negative
lead<00:03:20.320> these<00:03:20.799> one<00:03:20.950> on<00:03:21.070> DC<00:03:21.400> current<00:03:21.760> there's

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
lead these one on DC current there's

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.199 
lead these one on DC current there's
also<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:23.380> don't<00:03:24.130> think<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.519> want<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.730> focus<00:03:24.940> on

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
also I don't think you want to focus on

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.449 
also I don't think you want to focus on
it<00:03:25.329> there's<00:03:25.480> also<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.870> flat<00:03:26.739> edge<00:03:26.950> on<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.310> one

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
it there's also a flat edge on the one

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.789 
it there's also a flat edge on the one
side<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.030> want<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.049> sure<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.320> put<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.769> put

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
side you want to sure you put you put

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.400 
side you want to sure you put you put
these<00:03:30.040> in<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> right<00:03:30.519> way<00:03:30.640> because<00:03:31.380> they're<00:03:32.380> a

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
these in the right way because they're a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.190 
these in the right way because they're a
die<00:03:32.620> open<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.220> only<00:03:33.400> allow<00:03:34.269> current<00:03:34.720> flow<00:03:34.989> in

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
die open the only allow current flow in

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.020 
die open the only allow current flow in
one<00:03:35.410> direction<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.250> make<00:03:36.430> sure<00:03:36.459> goes<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
one direction so make sure goes in the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.220 
one direction so make sure goes in the
right<00:03:37.180> direction<00:03:37.359> otherwise<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.959> will<00:03:38.049> not

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
right direction otherwise it will not

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.849 
right direction otherwise it will not
light<00:03:38.440> up<00:03:39.690> okay<00:03:40.690> well<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:40.989> got<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.440> LEDs

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
light up okay well I got the LEDs

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.699 
light up okay well I got the LEDs
hardened<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:43.269> let's<00:03:43.480> put<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.140> circuit<00:03:44.500> board

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
hardened so let's put the circuit board
