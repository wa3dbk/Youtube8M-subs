off<00:00:25.410> bundles<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.430> quite<00:00:26.670> easy<00:00:26.699> at<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> moment

off bundles is quite easy at the moment
but<00:00:27.720> i<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.740> updated<00:00:29.310> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
but i think it's going to be updated so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.359 
but i think it's going to be updated so
that<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.789> becomes<00:00:29.880> tougher<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.920> like

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
that it becomes tougher so I think like

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.520 
that it becomes tougher so I think like
