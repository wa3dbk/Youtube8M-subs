shower after watching a review because

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
shower after watching a review because
of<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.000> intro<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.750> review<00:02:28.050> was<00:02:28.170> good<00:02:28.380> but

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
of the intro but the review was good but

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.100 
of the intro but the review was good but
the<00:02:28.710> intro<00:02:28.980> kind<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.810> little<00:02:30.810> too<00:02:30.900> much

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the intro kind of was a little too much

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.600 
the intro kind of was a little too much
for<00:02:31.320> me<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.980> agreed

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
for me and I agreed

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.410 
for me and I agreed
so<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:34.110> intro<00:02:34.440> went<00:02:34.680> from<00:02:34.830> being<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.490> to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
so the intro went from being that to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.650 
so the intro went from being that to
being<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.980> skip<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.820> button-down<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:41.660> now

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
that picture of my friend Matt was when

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.000
