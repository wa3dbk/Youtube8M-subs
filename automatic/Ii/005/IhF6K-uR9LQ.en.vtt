think the design of the shoulder joint
definitely<00:01:01.670> conflicts<00:01:02.090> with<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.300> smooth

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
terms of articulation though it's very

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.730 
terms of articulation though it's very
it's<00:01:41.600> similar<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.990> what<00:01:42.110> we've<00:01:42.259> seen<00:01:42.290> from<00:01:42.560> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
it's similar to what we've seen from the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.859 
it's similar to what we've seen from the
SRC<00:01:43.250> lineup<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:43.700> you've<00:01:43.820> got<00:01:43.969> the<00:01:44.149> great

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
SRC lineup so you've got the great

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.740 
SRC lineup so you've got the great

arm<00:01:59.450> that<00:02:00.229> i<00:02:00.259> think<00:02:00.500> looks<00:02:00.950> better<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.310> works

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
arm that i think looks better and works

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.370 
arm that i think looks better and works
better<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.210> goes<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:02.600> an<00:02:02.719> older<00:02:02.990> styling

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
better this goes with an older styling

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.539 
better this goes with an older styling
that<00:02:03.500> has<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.740> sort<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.009> cutaway<00:02:04.340> feature

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
that has that sort of cutaway feature

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.789 
that has that sort of cutaway feature
which<00:02:04.789> is<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.240> does<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.630> job<00:02:05.840> but<00:02:06.140> it's<00:02:06.320> it's

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
which is it does the job but it's it's

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.710 
which is it does the job but it's it's
definitely<00:02:07.070> not<00:02:07.399> as<00:02:07.579> good<00:02:07.700> as<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.000> newer

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
definitely not as good as the newer

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.720 
definitely not as good as the newer
renditions<00:02:09.310> everything<00:02:10.310> else<00:02:10.430> is<00:02:10.580> pretty

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
renditions everything else is pretty

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.980 
renditions everything else is pretty
much<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.940> same<00:02:11.180> though<00:02:11.390> i<00:02:11.420> mean<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.720> got<00:02:11.840> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
much the same though i mean you got the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.740 
much the same though i mean you got the
great<00:02:12.230> torso<00:02:12.590> joint<00:02:12.860> with<00:02:13.340> the

extendable click although it's not as

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.120 
extendable click although it's not as
extending<00:02:17.270> as<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.420> thought<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.020> would<00:02:18.230> be<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
extending as I thought it would be the

Mazinger he doesn't quite hold up to the

good<00:02:49.790> for<00:02:50.180> his<00:02:50.330> age

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690

the<00:02:50.870> one<00:02:51.020> thing<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.290> will<00:02:51.500> say<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.130> there

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
the one thing I will say is that there

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.610 
the one thing I will say is that there
are<00:02:52.760> parts<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.150> seem<00:02:53.390> kind<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.870> loose<00:02:54.230> I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
are parts that seem kind of loose I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.110 
are parts that seem kind of loose I
don't<00:02:55.010> know<00:02:55.070> if<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.280> actually<00:02:55.489> loose<00:02:55.880> though

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
don't know if it's actually loose though

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.030 
don't know if it's actually loose though
I<00:02:56.150> mean<00:02:56.360> like<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:56.959> arm<00:02:57.170> for<00:02:57.260> example<00:02:57.350> it's

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
I mean like this arm for example it's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.750 
I mean like this arm for example it's
really<00:02:58.489> easy<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.850> nudge<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.570> and<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.890> move

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
really easy to nudge and and and move

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.910 
really easy to nudge and and and move
around<00:03:01.880> but<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.420> thing<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:02.630> it'll<00:03:03.170> stay<00:03:03.650> where

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
around but the thing is it'll stay where

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.580 
around but the thing is it'll stay where
I<00:03:03.950> want<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.610> stay<00:03:04.820> but<00:03:05.360> see<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.350> kind

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
I want it to stay but see that it kind

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.030 
I want it to stay but see that it kind
of<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:06.830> falls<00:03:07.070> out<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:08.120> hips<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:09.040> hips

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
of just falls out the hips the hips

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.560 
of just falls out the hips the hips
aren't<00:03:10.370> loose<00:03:10.610> at<00:03:10.850> all<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.239> they're<00:03:11.390> very

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
aren't loose at all but they're very

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.050 
aren't loose at all but they're very
again<00:03:11.989> they're<00:03:12.170> very<00:03:12.200> easy<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.769> nudge<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.459> I

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
again they're very easy to nudge and I

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.940 
again they're very easy to nudge and I
just<00:03:14.330> don't<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.570> if<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.350> gonna<00:03:15.739> get

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
just don't know if that's gonna get

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.470 
just don't know if that's gonna get
worse<00:03:16.130> over<00:03:16.430> time<00:03:16.640> or<00:03:16.910> if<00:03:17.000> that's<00:03:17.150> just<00:03:17.239> how

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
worse over time or if that's just how

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.810 
worse over time or if that's just how
the<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:18.200> qualities<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.829> figure<00:03:19.040> now<00:03:19.340> he

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
the the qualities of this figure now he

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.120 
the the qualities of this figure now he
also<00:03:20.060> comes<00:03:20.329> with<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.540> tamashii<00:03:21.200> stage<00:03:21.650> adapter

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
also comes with a tamashii stage adapter

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.620 
also comes with a tamashii stage adapter
which<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.370> can<00:03:22.489> just<00:03:22.670> plug<00:03:22.880> right<00:03:22.910> here<00:03:23.329> and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
which you can just plug right here and
