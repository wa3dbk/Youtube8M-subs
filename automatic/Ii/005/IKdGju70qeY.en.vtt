00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.649
 return your fingers to a new video 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.480
 good news the truth enough 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.620
 interesting good first of all much 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.240
 people are asking me about the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.610
 analysis of the order to have a bit of 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.860
 patience I basically want to get out 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.409
 the few pieces that I have left 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.980
 directly for good to do platinum 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:21.470
 and the analysis together and not doing there are two 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.060
 videos wasting time because I eat 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.079
 I say in a single video it fits 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.689
 perfectly in good news quite 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.550
 strange because it comes from a page 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.890
 Russian yes I'm not wrong and the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.860
 translation and so on can be a 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 little deceptive and all this images 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.050
 you have them in the description no 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.789
 provoke in the video because they are 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.829
 filtered totally or it seems that they are 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.850
 filtered so say they are images of 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.010
 the robberies and others are images of in 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.780
 as I am reading here in the other 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.149
 google translator because I do not Russian 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.320
 I understand a shit what makes good 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.670
 that images have been found that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.910
 will use on the blackboard 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.980
 planning of robbery missions themselves 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.629
 we analyze them well, obviously, we 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.910
 we realize that in new vehicles and 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.170
 some new weapons too if i'm not 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.450
 wrong 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.920
 of new masks and others for example 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.100
 we have an armored vehicle that has 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.979
 machine gun on top we have motorcycles 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.450
 I think they are new also good we see 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.450
 a prison there other that supposes and 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.570
 we will have a mission whatsoever that 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.280
 another new weapon and other planes that do not 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.350
 I know if any of them will be new york 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.930
 vehicles because I understand little car 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.310
 down the whole also the black car 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.289
 this one that was armored also that 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.640
 it seems pretty cool is the car in 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.320
 first person geography of flying 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.909
 pretty good we have a series of 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.909
 images as I say they tell us that 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.369
 there will be new weapons and vehicles 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.950
 new so it's good I do not know if they are 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.600
 real if they are not real someone has 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.390
 taken the trouble to do this 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.980
 quite pretty flippant not because 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.550
 it seems pretty 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.080
 real the truth so well I do not know if not 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.580
 they are straining it or not I have said many 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.580
 times in the gta news are the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.260
 harder to define if they are true or 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.590
 If they are lies or the ones that cost me the most 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.930
 they are very difficult to know if the as 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.020
 real or something false so only 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.330
 we can wait and speculate and until 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.950
 the most gta experts as they talk and 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.360
 others so good you can put the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.640
 comments what you think about all this 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.380
 the robberies as you know then that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.540
 rumored to arrive in the 24 then 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.770
 enough would already be announced 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.120
 I imagine that rockstar will not be so 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.010
 silly not announce good minus one week 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.870
 before but it will come anyway 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.900
 before the game was released I started in 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.640
 on March 17th I believe or the 17th a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.560
 battlefield or I remember right now 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.420
 just the two of you or I do not know 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.100
 so good any more guys we are 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.690
 in the next video nothing to keep an eye 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.690
 the images that are pretty cool
