00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hi everyone samsung i hope that 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.259
 you are all very well friends - 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 listen to it goes nickel and today we 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.379
 will meet for episode number 3 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.030
 of our shopping series above all 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.200
 first we will start with the small 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.219
 technique that I promised you so 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.960
 it's pretty simple you just have to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.940
 follow what I'm going to do 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.379
 you put money players so 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.630
 here and in fixing the price you put 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.619
 200 credit maximum so it's really 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.550
 very simple for those who do not have 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.890
 a lot of credit so if you have 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.600
 between them I do not have 400 credit and 800 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.439
 credit you can do this technique 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.720
 she is really good 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 look at it angie fresnes who costs who 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.750
 will leave maybe 1,400 credit with 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.239
 the cost a bit more with its 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.230
 stats there and then in addition it is noted 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.530
 74.2 general it's really a very good 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.480
 player 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.530
 why did you devour small 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.969
 pearls like that good little ones 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.870
 business like that you can that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.469
 you can always simply 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.960
 take 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.329
 it's really very easy to do 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 a frankly look at another newspaper 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.039
 to diakity 350 credit while to cost 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.930
 a little more expensive than that with his stats 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.309
 here I say that but frankly believe 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.079
 me it works really very lenient 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.910
 reason you saw it you saw well 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.239
 that for me it works so I do not see 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.309
 Why 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.090
 for you it would not work so 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.920
 here you put you put you bet 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.810
 200-250 credit maximum and after you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.890
 look for the player and you see a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.780
 look of the nac beyond even a hack 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.310
 be-200 credit me i want to remind you 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.020
 well mine I bought it from his credit 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.700
 is frozen sold 350 credit so certainly 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.350
 it's really very very little but when 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.580
 you have five on credit bah it's 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.470
 nickel it just works well 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 my heart this is not a lot of you 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.530
 profits certainly but that's it was 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.299
 This walking technique to those who 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.290
 do not have a lot of credit 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.970
 here you are not going to do this 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.850
 technique while you have 50 thousand 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.170
 credit also not a little late and one where 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.520
 do I mean it's the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.079
 people who have 50 minutes credit you not 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 does technical recipe because I 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.020
 do not think they would like to win 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 without credit by a player so 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.079
 so that's a technique for those 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.640
 who do not have a lot of credit there 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.470
 enlists dunn who is really very good there 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.659
 has very good stats and I played it 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.579
 at bolton 3 if I'm not mistaken that I'm 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.720
 that I'm not wrong at the swan 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.250
 so that's really a technique 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.630
 which is highly recommended we helped and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.850
 denilson frankly we really have 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.350
 good deals in this in this 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.909
 So this technology also Opare 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.079
 worried that is selling at 400 credit you 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.369
 can see it at 200 credit here we are 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.000
 you double you double your credits 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.409
 quite simply 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.509
 it's a technique that will try to 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.710
 you double your credits then if you 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.540
 have a little more credit people you if 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.600
 you have at home about 800 crazy 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.920
 1000 credits ac 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.340
 terra you can simply 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.720
 increase the sum in instead of 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.940
 put 200 credit you can put 500 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.430
 credits where you can put m 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 I spend absentee credit for example so 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.959
 this is really a technique 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.300
 effective and it brings you credits 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.890
 quite easily but 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.330
 frankly this series she is well 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.620
 that I will repeat myself but she is 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.940
 well just if you have very little 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.500
 credit and if you start for example 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.980
 a series of purchases 90 like me 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.959
 for example 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.760
 so here I am I started with this 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.720
 technique there and I did well 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.790
 I think you saw him in the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.850
 teeth the pros but the episodes so 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.720
 here it is an effective technique and it 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.110
 does not take much time 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.940
 simply 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.470
 unfortunately the market bugs and beugin 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.330
 pu at the moment with the teams' exit 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.410
 of season and all that finally short I 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.640
 you had also put a shot of tipp-ex 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.470
 on my credits for not you if 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.910
 politiken here we will resume our 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.530
 adventure right away we sold 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.180
 some Brazilian players with 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.880
 especially also we also sold 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.739
 velasquez we still have some 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.630
 players before juninho draxler and to 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.769
 When all of this was bought from 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.330
 Brazilian players with particular 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.799
 jackson and and alex 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.900
 so that's it worked rather well 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.739
 with them with this kind of player so the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.450
 I thought I was going 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.980
 continue with with those days there with 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.350
 these players there I my voice by 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.670
 a little good spin at the same time 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.230
 you see a little bit of the trick of the day 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.150
 so that's the sales chair 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.500
 during happy hour so why 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.370
 Charente during the happy 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.260
 hour simply because a lot 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.970
 many people open up 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.380
 during happy hours and that's 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.040
 really easy to catch 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.840
 good deals 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.799
 because people are in a hurry to 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.299
 sell their players and sometimes they 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.370
 can they can put their players 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.489
 much cheaper than usual 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.450
 so here's before I do not know 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.650
 has money players who are 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.260
 really well known for example I know 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.030
 not a player like what am I 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.470
 can say maybe to gondar that they have 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.239
 about at a little over 10000 credit 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.859
 they will go to put on fairly quickly 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.170
 he wanted to put up to 5000 hop credit 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.390
 you chopper May 5 credit up 5000 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.590
 profit credit so voila this is 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.790
 pretty simple so here is enough 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.310
 recommended to do charente 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.350
 during the happy hour of times per share 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.400
 against sometimes it's a little bit that can in 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.019
 squeezing target 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.579
 if you want to bet on players who 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.290
 have just come out in the team of the 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.799
 week it is very very complicated 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.510
 pay attention 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.170
 so here it is a little tip I 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.700
 advise you but you have to do 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.140
 especially attention in the action before 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.920
 be very careful because we 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.510
 can make credits quite easily 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.120
 So here we come back in our adventure 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.380
 and we have 8000 4.78 credit so that's 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.790
 for quite a bit we sold a few 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.990
 a few dozen and a few days at 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.850
 brazil is with including trachsler 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.440
 so we still have two 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.639
 lavender digesters and we left 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.700
 proud of charente on players 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.919
 money that works pretty well too so 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.540
 we have a we have a diameter of players who 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.730
 play west ham playing in a boat 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.250
 the ex is a Senegalese and we caught him 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.070
 in central offensive midfield and you go 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.840
 see that which costs that 4900 credit 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.820
 is ours we bought it I believe in 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.229
 2500 credit if I'm wrong we're gonna 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.600
 check all that right now 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.100
 2500 credit plus he has rock in style 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.139
 we will try to resell so a little 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.510
 more shit we'll try dornach 5200 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.720
 credit relationship that's going to sell that's going 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.550
 make a good profit has in our in 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.900
 our pocket we will say that like that 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.610
 ancient have ape made the little 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.610
 technical of the beginning of his 50 credits on 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.220
 sees 450 credit so that's about 190 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.990
 after-tax profit credit 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.639
 here we are, do not forget also 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.070
 count the tax it's like that and it's 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.750
 so it's pretty important I want 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.660
 to say that to you because that's it 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.919
 there is we are also flying with this tax 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.630
 they are stealing us in the footsteps 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.330
 of theft in taxes they rob us 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.440
 everywhere frankly it's thieves 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.289
 there are only eight heroes we will try 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.470
 to sell at 3500 credit that we bought 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.820
 in central offensive midfield and the last 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.400
 game based and malak we will try 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.270
 to resell at 4700 credit so that's it 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.860
 that's how that ends 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.030
 episode on the other hand is to sell his 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.320
 players fast enough for the 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.270
 next episode we'll see that 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.130
 way in the next episode any case 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.050
 I hope I liked this video and 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.940
 if you simply want more 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.260
