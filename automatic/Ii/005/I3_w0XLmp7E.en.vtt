00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
9 base reviews and so far it's been

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.740 
9 base reviews and so far it's been
holding<00:00:31.280> up<00:00:31.369> perfectly<00:00:32.239> no<00:00:32.450> one's<00:00:32.599> ever

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
holding up perfectly no one's ever

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.470 
holding up perfectly no one's ever
gotten<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.520> center<00:00:34.789> of<00:00:34.850> my<00:00:34.969> base<00:00:35.180> or

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
gotten to the center of my base or

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.360 
gotten to the center of my base or
gotten<00:00:36.020> most<00:00:36.140> of<00:00:36.289> our<00:00:36.379> resources<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.220> it's

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
gotten most of our resources so it's

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.890 
gotten most of our resources so it's
been<00:00:37.550> looking<00:00:37.790> out<00:00:37.850> very<00:00:38.060> well<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:38.540> I've<00:00:38.870> got

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
been looking out very well and I've got

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.410 
been looking out very well and I've got
my<00:00:39.200> town<00:00:39.770> hall<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.790> corner<00:00:41.060> obviously

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
my town hall in the corner obviously

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.200 
my town hall in the corner obviously
because<00:00:41.690> it's<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.930> farming<00:00:42.230> base<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:43.430> I'll

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
because it's a farming base and I'll

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.490 
because it's a farming base and I'll
just<00:00:44.360> kind<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.840> hold<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.079> here<00:00:45.230> for<00:00:45.380> a<00:00:45.410> little

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
just kind of hold it here for a little

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.940 
just kind of hold it here for a little
bit<00:00:45.620> you<00:00:45.829> guys<00:00:45.980> get<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.190> good<00:00:46.370> look<00:00:46.489> at<00:00:46.700> it<00:00:46.730> and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
bit you guys get a good look at it and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.770 
bit you guys get a good look at it and
it's<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.489> thing<00:00:49.670> I<00:00:49.730> like<00:00:49.850> about<00:00:49.880> is<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:50.540> it's

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
it's the thing I like about is that it's

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.810 
it's the thing I like about is that it's
symmetrical<00:00:51.489> mostly<00:00:52.489> for<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.730> most<00:00:52.880> part<00:00:53.030> and

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
symmetrical mostly for the most part and

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.630 
symmetrical mostly for the most part and
you<00:00:55.820> can<00:00:55.969> see<00:00:56.149> here<00:00:56.329> I've<00:00:56.480> got<00:00:56.660> two<00:00:57.640> small

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
you can see here I've got two small

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.170 
you can see here I've got two small
little<00:00:59.420> squares<00:00:59.870> on<00:01:00.230> each<00:01:00.950> side<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:01.460> that

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
little squares on each side and that

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.160 
little squares on each side and that
that's<00:01:02.300> because<00:01:02.600> that's<00:01:02.750> right<00:01:02.960> with<00:01:03.110> the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
that's because that's right with the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.450 
that's because that's right with the
wall<00:01:03.320> breakers<00:01:03.680> go<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:03.950> they<00:01:04.009> put<00:01:04.189> them<00:01:04.280> down

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
wall breakers go and they put them down

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.550 
wall breakers go and they put them down
and<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:05.210> gives<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.509> Tesla's<00:01:05.960> time<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.350> take

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
and that gives a Tesla's time to take

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.840 
and that gives a Tesla's time to take
them<00:01:06.740> out<00:01:06.860> before<00:01:07.040> they<00:01:07.219> can<00:01:07.399> actually<00:01:07.700> get<00:01:07.790> to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
them out before they can actually get to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.749 
them out before they can actually get to
the<00:01:08.119> main<00:01:09.020> walls<00:01:09.289> to<00:01:09.590> get<00:01:09.740> into<00:01:10.549> where<00:01:10.670> the

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
the main walls to get into where the

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.289 
the main walls to get into where the
resources<00:01:10.880> are<00:01:11.359> and<00:01:12.819> i'll<00:01:13.819> show<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.060> guys<00:01:14.240> a

speed this up so you guys don't have to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.080 
speed this up so you guys don't have to
wait<00:01:30.469> the<00:01:30.799> full<00:01:30.829> two<00:01:31.520> minutes<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.759> did<00:01:34.939> have

wait the full two minutes and I did have

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.639 
wait the full two minutes and I did have
a<00:01:35.119> level<00:01:35.389> 6<00:01:35.539> dragon<00:01:35.929> which<00:01:36.049> probably<00:01:36.319> helped

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
a level 6 dragon which probably helped

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.889 
a level 6 dragon which probably helped
me<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.950> lot<00:01:37.219> but<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.149> still<00:01:38.450> don't<00:01:38.569> think<00:01:38.689> he

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
me a lot but I still don't think he

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.149 
me a lot but I still don't think he
buddy<00:01:39.079> got<00:01:39.200> into<00:01:39.349> the<00:01:39.409> middle<00:01:39.619> of<00:01:39.740> how<00:01:39.889> heavily

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
buddy got into the middle of how heavily

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.940 
buddy got into the middle of how heavily
defended<00:01:40.459> this<00:01:40.729> is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.810 

and<00:01:47.049> for<00:01:48.049> some<00:01:48.200> reason<00:01:48.229> most<00:01:48.619> people<00:01:48.770> skip<00:01:49.670> the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
and for some reason most people skip the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.459 
and for some reason most people skip the
Town<00:01:50.000> Hall<00:01:50.030> they<00:01:50.360> don't<00:01:50.509> even<00:01:50.630> look<00:01:50.990> at<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.350> in
