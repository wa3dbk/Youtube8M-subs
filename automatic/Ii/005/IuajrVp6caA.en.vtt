00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.320
 that also this motor world we find 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.629
 now in workshops express your clients 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.570
 more than protects below we are going to 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.099
 state how the flow is applied and also 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.770
 demonstrate in product effectiveness 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.630
 the post that it includes is a liquid for 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.939
 the cleaning of all types of engine to 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.919
 gasoline or diesel and it's a free product 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.079
 of alcohol and chlorine therefore no 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.160
 will weaken the new oil or 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.290
 engine walls 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.390
 now we will do a test to see your 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.219
 effectiveness although then we're going 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.660
 to measure the compression of each sense 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.780
 to know how the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.780
 engine 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.690
 as you can see the cylinders are marking 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.059
 an unequal way whatever the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.760
 oil mark but clean your engine 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.190
 with the andy fraser protect will happen 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.379
 that affecting you in the consumption of 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.449
 fuel since your engine does not have a 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.120
 balanced force now we proceed to 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.160
 apply the engine touch protect 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.290
 one of the advantages of using the in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.840
 Protec books is an easy application 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.090
 without machines you can manage once 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.729
 You can apply to the engine in your 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.100
 home or office and go to the workshop more 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.659
 close to changing your oil this bottle 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.149
 yields up to an eight- cylinder engine 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.310
 we also tested a car 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.500
 diesel to see the effectiveness of this 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.899
 provoke this holy faith says the camera 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.330
 apply the year and flower we bounce the oil 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.070
 old now we throw him again and we go 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.990
 to show you how to brand the clean oil 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970
 on the rod this motor says because 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.860
 here we move this diesel engine the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.170
 rod comes out clean can inflate is from 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.000
 protect wash is going to keep clean 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.009
 and the engine obviously we are also going to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.170
 have clean after 15 minutes and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.539
 applied the engine georg we return to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.580
 gasoline car and we change the oil 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.170
 old for the new one and we did it again 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.240
 pressure testing of cylinders 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 because as they also saw in engine 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.409
 diesel here the gasoline engine has 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 imperfect that the variant will indicate 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.280
 that the engine is clean or that here 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.170
 we can really know if not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.050
 they changed the oil on the engine flow 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.540
 Seprotec removes dirt and grime 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.670
 remains of used oil from the interior d 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.190
 Lubrication and lubrication system 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.110
 dissolves carbon deposits in the rings 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.120
 of the piston and in the upper area of the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.460
 cylinder and returns to the engine its power 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.110
 and performance the engine flush of protect 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.330
 you can find it in melo 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.810
 parts distributor service 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.450
