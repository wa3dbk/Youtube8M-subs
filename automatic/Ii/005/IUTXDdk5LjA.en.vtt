00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello to all with the heating costs tip the bank 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.049
 tajan diagram second video 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.359
 for an application for iphone os x 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.159
 always on the match 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.589
 ultimately 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:21.629
 so here we will make sure that for example when you launch a 

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:23.710
 application any 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.339
 shopkeepers twice as hilarious 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.599
 however remove it at the time you need to be supported but not 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.879
 still on the application here and after 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.500
 the red logo linden pursues easy 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.410
 Prince displays so the then marked CE automatically appears to enjoy it 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.490
 of weight it will automatically appear and after you have escaped on the logo 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.670
 red here 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.830
 so it's a small gesture to something 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.580
 what did it pull me that accelerates a lot to others 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.910
 and who would inherit much lends offer 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.640
 Bravo 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.370
 approaching a year 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 the group makes it much easier 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 so what if we're still in cydia 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.390
 we will go on cydia and then we will find them percent of the application of his 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.330
 trouble 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.260
 excludes osteoarthritis 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.340
 so simple 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.210
 seeing how to handle 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.890
 like however 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.350
 if you have a little understanding of the support system 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.130
 we add pavements more files according to his CEO to a goal 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.760
 installations in progress 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.030
 imagine that these sources the probe internet site 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.020
 and that for example we were instructed to collect something that 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.960
 account 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.650
 so the device 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.180
 here you have to enter this address as you do not worry i will traps 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.920
 of their hen scored on the video 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.550
 so your skin 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.380
 a base for export 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.660
 why simply 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.190
 a lot of slow motion 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.750
 you have the chance to score under the video normally 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.770
 many had just changed 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.840
 added 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.650
 and there you are told the source 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.940
 a fake on the ground 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.940
 it's worth my shot right tf1 was in extensive research 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.600
 it is normally paid all consoles 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.860
 I would rather say too much so it's the one of fractures to the shoulder points 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.210
 a report to others 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.589
 to install it 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:09.929
 it's simply 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.089
 when you go to launches an application for example and you have the 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.269
 close or lying in these things happen to close it 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.700
 we learned that you have hosted twice and if you have directly 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.359
 moving music 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.290
 So it's a success to make the point fr I tell you next time 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.839
 for a small video
