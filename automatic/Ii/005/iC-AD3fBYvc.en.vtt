because<00:04:40.140> I<00:04:40.320> have<00:04:40.440> blaze<00:04:40.680> kick<00:04:40.920> on<00:04:41.070> this

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
because I have blaze kick on this

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.770 
because I have blaze kick on this
genesect<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:41.820> would<00:04:42.060> have<00:04:42.150> been<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.690> would

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
genesect so I would have been it would

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.060 
genesect so I would have been it would
have<00:04:42.840> been<00:04:42.960> over<00:04:43.110> for<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.470> other<00:04:43.590> Jenna<00:04:43.890> said

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
have been over for that other Jenna said

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.520 
have been over for that other Jenna said
you<00:04:44.190> know<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:45.630> wouldn't<00:04:45.930> even<00:04:45.990> be<00:04:46.140> nope

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
you know like it wouldn't even be nope

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.620 
you know like it wouldn't even be nope
it<00:04:46.740> wouldn't<00:04:47.340> even<00:04:47.370> be<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.640> match<00:04:47.850> I<00:04:48.180> thing

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
it wouldn't even be a match I thing

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.850 
it wouldn't even be a match I thing
would<00:04:48.750> be<00:04:48.840> dead<00:04:49.020> or<00:04:49.140> eight<00:04:49.290> right<00:04:49.500> now<00:04:49.650> if<00:04:49.770> he

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
would be dead or eight right now if he

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.220 
would be dead or eight right now if he
had<00:04:49.980> stayed<00:04:50.220> in<00:04:50.420> so<00:04:51.420> he<00:04:51.540> brings<00:04:51.690> out<00:04:51.870> piggly

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
had stayed in so he brings out piggly

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.600 
had stayed in so he brings out piggly
the<00:04:52.260> man<00:04:52.500> was<00:04:52.650> when<00:04:52.800> he<00:04:52.950> has<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.070> Mamoswine<00:04:53.490> as

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
the man was when he has a Mamoswine as

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.020 
the man was when he has a Mamoswine as
well<00:04:53.820> so<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:56.190> is<00:04:56.220> where<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.550> gets<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:56.970> is

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
well so this is where it gets this is

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.970 
well so this is where it gets this is
where<00:04:57.090> it<00:04:57.270> gets<00:04:57.330> rough<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:58.290> I<00:04:58.320> have<00:04:58.470> leftovers

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
where it gets rough so I have leftovers

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.290 
where it gets rough so I have leftovers

using<00:05:02.220> leftovers<00:05:02.820> doesn't<00:05:03.150> matter<00:05:03.270> right<00:05:03.450> I

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
using leftovers doesn't matter right I

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.100 
using leftovers doesn't matter right I
was<00:05:05.310> hoping<00:05:05.460> here<00:05:05.820> for<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.090> critical<00:05:06.750> hit

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
was hoping here for the critical hit

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.930 
was hoping here for the critical hit
because<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.500> knew<00:05:07.740> if<00:05:07.890> I<00:05:08.010> was<00:05:08.190> gonna<00:05:08.310> get<00:05:08.580> earth

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
because I knew if I was gonna get earth

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.090 
because I knew if I was gonna get earth
quaked<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:09.570> was<00:05:09.690> gonna<00:05:09.810> be<00:05:09.990> really<00:05:10.350> bad<00:05:10.680> for<00:05:10.740> me

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
quaked it was gonna be really bad for me

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.910 
quaked it was gonna be really bad for me
and<00:05:11.480> look<00:05:12.480> at<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.630> it's<00:05:13.050> really<00:05:13.380> bad<00:05:13.560> for<00:05:13.590> me

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
and look at that it's really bad for me

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.600 
and look at that it's really bad for me

mean<00:07:13.380> there<00:07:13.560> was<00:07:13.650> a<00:07:13.680> really<00:07:14.010> good<00:07:14.280> chance<00:07:14.430> i

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640 
mean there was a really good chance i

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.030 
mean there was a really good chance i
was<00:07:14.700> gonna<00:07:14.790> be<00:07:14.970> a<00:07:15.000> Charizard<00:07:15.420> y<00:07:15.480> so<00:07:15.960> that's<00:07:16.860> why

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
was gonna be a Charizard y so that's why

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.800 
was gonna be a Charizard y so that's why
I<00:07:17.070> went<00:07:17.280> for<00:07:17.400> crunch<00:07:17.610> I<00:07:17.790> mean<00:07:18.000> you<00:07:18.210> know<00:07:18.330> you

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
I went for crunch I mean you know you

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.630 
I went for crunch I mean you know you
have<00:07:18.930> to<00:07:19.050> predict<00:07:19.380> that<00:07:19.440> before<00:07:19.860> you<00:07:19.980> use<00:07:20.610> it

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
have to predict that before you use it

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.660 
have to predict that before you use it
so<00:07:21.240> I<00:07:21.510> could<00:07:22.470> go<00:07:22.740> for<00:07:22.770> the<00:07:22.980> stab<00:07:23.190> waterfall

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670 
so I could go for the stab waterfall
