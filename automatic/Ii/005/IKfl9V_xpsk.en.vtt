 with your help I will try to get to 12 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.600
 This is what happened today and it is very important 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.830
 play 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.800
 tank 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.660

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.250
 for the sight of parts of course on 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.020
 a sight but it hurts us 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.720
 look here you just look different 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.030

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.470
 Prerequisites of course to this well, as here 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.900
 finally flashed a stellar attack 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.920
 bracket a pity that the match Slovan 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.850
 look at go 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.390

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.290
 just further shoot CSKA where is he 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.040

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.000
 output 1 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.629
 put the collar on and 30 to here's how 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.970
 everything went badly it started 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.629
 most draw is great but in the end 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.879
 and did not score again and immediately gave catch 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.769
 changing the square this in just came out with 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.000
 benches just fit right away 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.960
 machine 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.190
 Shilov 120 blows he threw dad then 9 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.050

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.270
 dry out river washer turned gate 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.270
 fed koval himself there took the puck 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.030
 dangerous blue 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.579
 these washers 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.069
 vanessa cities copyright rebound 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.930
 bad shot on front 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.280
 completing horrible there would be no happiness 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.499
 happiness is not an accurate cast and that's it 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.469
 sly puck bounced tigar Dubrovsky 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:13.299
 no one expected here at last and 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.099
 most implemented yes let's 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.709
 watch how it all looked with 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.890
 tactical camera throw see not 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.120
 not exactly who is the question 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.120
 and made at the peak 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.440
 well reacted to 1 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.440
 well, does not bite 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.500
 Dubrovsky 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.160
 but 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:46.280
 gear is not quite comfortable big 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.870
 recovered thin and throw on the defender 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.840
 Alexander 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.799
 Vanya again for some reason give sleep to kill 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.319
 spike sends the puck to gate 41 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.120
 implement in armeyka from Petersburg still 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.890
 one deletion in our team 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.680
 all classic throw finish 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.140
 the attacker won the fight against the defender 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.120
 Now we look there in my spike 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.739
 so does that pain and chitin 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.950
 my stumbled see saw this simple 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:19.680
 recycle code is back and should 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.480
 play 5 of the way men's 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.930
 identity 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.930
 he leads
