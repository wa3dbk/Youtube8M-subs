00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
wanted to be an artist even when I was

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.750 
wanted to be an artist even when I was
in<00:00:19.500> high<00:00:19.650> school<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.980> guess<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> was

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
in high school I guess because it was

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.790 
in high school I guess because it was
pretty<00:00:21.660> much<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.050> only<00:00:22.080> thing<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.529> good<00:00:22.650> at

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
pretty much the only thing I was good at

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.260 
pretty much the only thing I was good at
it<00:00:22.950> was<00:00:23.100> either<00:00:23.190> that<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.460> skateboarding<00:00:24.150> and

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
it was either that or skateboarding and

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.000 
it was either that or skateboarding and
I<00:00:24.360> wasn't<00:00:24.570> good<00:00:25.200> enough<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.740> skateboarding

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
I wasn't good enough at skateboarding

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.970 
I wasn't good enough at skateboarding
the<00:00:26.450> series<00:00:27.450> public<00:00:27.750> sculpture<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.320> titled<00:00:28.800> in

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the series public sculpture I titled in

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
the series public sculpture I titled in
response<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.759> a<00:00:30.060> lot<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.450> this<00:00:30.570> kind<00:00:30.720> of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
response to a lot of this kind of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.540 
response to a lot of this kind of
rhetoric<00:00:30.930> in<00:00:31.259> like<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.650> fine<00:00:31.890> art<00:00:32.099> world<00:00:32.220> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
rhetoric in like the fine art world that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.590 
rhetoric in like the fine art world that
like<00:00:32.699> public<00:00:33.510> sculpture<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:35.330> jewelry<00:00:36.330> for

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
like public sculpture is jewelry for

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.960 
like public sculpture is jewelry for
buildings<00:00:36.989> or<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.739> know<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.370> lacks

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
buildings or you know that it lacks

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.280 
buildings or you know that it lacks
meaning<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.699> personality<00:00:41.699> and<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.420> kind<00:00:43.230> of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
meaning and personality and I kind of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.270 
meaning and personality and I kind of
subscribed<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.580> so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:46.070> thought<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
subscribed to that and so I thought of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.160 
subscribed to that and so I thought of
this<00:00:47.519> work<00:00:47.790> as<00:00:48.059> sculpture<00:00:48.719> made<00:00:48.870> by<00:00:49.110> the

know<00:00:51.390> without<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> intention<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.320> making<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
know without the intention of making it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.250 
know without the intention of making it
but<00:00:52.950> that<00:00:53.219> by<00:00:53.969> photographing<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.050> putting

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
but that by photographing it and putting

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.840 
but that by photographing it and putting
it<00:00:55.350> within<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.680> context<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> framed

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it within that context that it framed

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.600 
it within that context that it framed
these<00:00:57.420> things<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.500> sculptures<00:00:59.129> made<00:00:59.370> by<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
these things as sculptures made by the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.529 
these things as sculptures made by the
public<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.270> photo<00:01:00.690> series<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.590> all

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
public the photo series was all

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.029 
public the photo series was all
photographs<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.719> things<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.320> had<00:01:04.470> gone<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
photographs of things that had gone I

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.730 
photographs of things that had gone I
guess<00:01:05.820> wrong<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.450> some<00:01:06.690> way<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.530> urban

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
guess wrong in some way in the urban

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.029 
guess wrong in some way in the urban
environment<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:09.000> photograph<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> car

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
environment like a photograph of a car

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.770 
environment like a photograph of a car
door<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.520> got<00:01:11.640> opened<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> bicycle<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
door that got opened into a bicycle that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
door that got opened into a bicycle that
pinned<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.410> against<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> bus<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
pinned it up against a bus or like a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.230 
pinned it up against a bus or like a
bent<00:01:15.570> post<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> coffee<00:01:17.250> cup<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.729> these

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
bent post with a coffee cup on it these

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.679 
bent post with a coffee cup on it these
moments<00:01:18.479> were<00:01:18.720> things<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:20.570> meant<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
moments were things that are meant to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.080 
moments were things that are meant to
serve<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> specific<00:01:22.409> purpose<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.460> either

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
serve a specific purpose get either

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
serve a specific purpose get either
twisted<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.020> bent<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> shape<00:01:25.860> into

twisted or bent out of shape into

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.969 
twisted or bent out of shape into
serving<00:01:27.150> us<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.510> different<00:01:28.170> purpose<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> one

that's<00:01:29.159> more<00:01:29.369> personal<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.090> guess<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.479> that's

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that's more personal I guess one that's

that's more personal I guess one that's
more<00:01:32.450> directed<00:01:33.450> by<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> individual<00:01:34.140> as

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
more directed by the individual as

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.010

noticing<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> snail<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.329> thinking

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
noticing the snail and then thinking

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
noticing the snail and then thinking
wait<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> minute<00:02:04.259> that's<00:02:04.380> meaningful<00:02:04.950> there's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
wait a minute that's meaningful there's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.770 
wait a minute that's meaningful there's
something<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.000> weird<00:02:06.060> about<00:02:06.390> those<00:02:06.600> two

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
something really weird about those two

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.690 
something really weird about those two
things<00:02:06.960> together<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.530> first<00:02:07.950> photograph<00:02:08.399> was

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
things together the first photograph was

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.270 
things together the first photograph was
a<00:02:08.729> photograph<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:10.040> scaffolding<00:02:11.040> that<00:02:11.070> had

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
a photograph of scaffolding that had

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.979 
a photograph of scaffolding that had
blown<00:02:11.489> down<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.940> windstorm<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.870> was<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
blown down in a windstorm and it was a

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.390 
blown down in a windstorm and it was a
picture<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.560> think<00:02:13.799> anyone<00:02:14.130> who<00:02:14.250> had<00:02:14.370> a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
picture that I think anyone who had a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.620 
picture that I think anyone who had a
camera<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.730> their<00:02:14.880> pocket<00:02:14.910> would<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:15.360> taken

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
camera in their pocket would have taken

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.020 
camera in their pocket would have taken
I<00:02:15.780> wasn't<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.350> photographer<00:02:17.160> I'd<00:02:17.670> carry<00:02:17.910> this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
I wasn't a photographer I'd carry this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.550 
I wasn't a photographer I'd carry this
camera<00:02:18.390> around<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.720> was<00:02:18.870> slightly

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
camera around but I was slightly

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.990 
camera around but I was slightly
indifferent<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> way<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.670> made<00:02:20.880> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
indifferent to the way that I made the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.650 
indifferent to the way that I made the
photographs

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
photographs

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.809 
photographs
I<00:02:21.870> only<00:02:22.500> ever<00:02:22.620> took<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.130> picture<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.610> things

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
I only ever took one picture of things

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.790 
I only ever took one picture of things
because<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.989> was<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.319> about<00:02:25.470> making<00:02:25.739> a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
because it was just about making a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.260 
because it was just about making a
record<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.340> thing<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.790> wasn't<00:02:27.000> about

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
record of this thing it wasn't about

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.790 
record of this thing it wasn't about
framing<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.900> wasn't<00:02:28.140> about<00:02:28.260> composite

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
framing it wasn't about composite

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.350 
framing it wasn't about composite
it<00:02:28.980> wasn't<00:02:29.190> about<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.370> second<00:02:29.820> thought<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.270> was

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
it wasn't about a second thought it was

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.540 
it wasn't about a second thought it was
about<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:31.560> thing<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.130> wasn't<00:02:32.310> about<00:02:32.490> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
about that thing it wasn't about the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.910 
about that thing it wasn't about the
photograph<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.090> was<00:02:33.210> about<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.690> thing<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.170> a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
photograph it was about that thing and a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.680 
photograph it was about that thing and a
way<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.250> putting<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.970> thing<00:02:36.210> in<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.450> different

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
way of putting that thing in a different

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.900 
way of putting that thing in a different
context<00:02:37.250> Photography<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.550> kind<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
context Photography was just kind of the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.410 
context Photography was just kind of the
easiest<00:02:39.150> way<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:40.170> series<00:02:41.210> picture<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.330> earth

easiest way the series picture the earth

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.500 
easiest way the series picture the earth
spinning<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.870> space<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.670> title<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.360> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
spinning in space the title of that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.750 
spinning in space the title of that
series<00:02:46.020> came<00:02:46.290> from<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:47.040> book<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.550> had

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
one is really weird an existential and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.100 
one is really weird an existential and
it<00:03:08.400> there's<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.030> page<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.900> says

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110

it there's one page in it that says
picture<00:03:10.500> our<00:03:10.680> earth<00:03:10.980> spinning<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.640> space<00:03:11.910> and

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
picture our earth spinning in space and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.970 
picture our earth spinning in space and
it<00:03:12.420> has<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.810> picture<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:13.620> blackness

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
it has this picture of just blackness

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.570 
it has this picture of just blackness
with<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:15.090> earth<00:03:15.270> which<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.230> thought<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.550> a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
with the earth which I thought that is a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.340 
with the earth which I thought that is a
crazy<00:03:18.090> thing<00:03:18.300> for<00:03:18.540> kidnap<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.990> think<00:03:19.140> about

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
crazy thing for kidnap to think about

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.290 
crazy thing for kidnap to think about
that's<00:03:19.770> really<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.640> big<00:03:21.480> thought<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.290> know<00:03:22.410> and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
that's really a big thought you know and

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.490 
that's really a big thought you know and
that<00:03:24.300> was<00:03:24.480> what<00:03:24.660> sort<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:24.990> directed<00:03:25.350> this

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
that was what sort of directed this

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.650 
that was what sort of directed this
series<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:25.950> photographs<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.610> do<00:03:27.150> think<00:03:27.600> that

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
series of photographs I do think that

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.690 
series of photographs I do think that
there<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.290> meaning<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.950> objects<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.490> we

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
there is meaning in objects that we

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.370 
there is meaning in objects that we
derive<00:03:29.940> meaning<00:03:30.240> from<00:03:30.390> objects<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.170> the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
derive meaning from objects that the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.750 
derive meaning from objects that the
everyday<00:03:31.710> objects<00:03:32.100> around<00:03:32.340> us<00:03:32.550> especially

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
everyday objects around us especially

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.940 
everyday objects around us especially
and<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:35.459> we<00:03:36.120> are<00:03:36.330> on<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:36.870> planet<00:03:37.470> that's

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
and that we are on this planet that's

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.560 
and that we are on this planet that's
spinning<00:03:38.220> around<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.550> Sun<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.060> totally

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
spinning around the Sun and it's totally

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.650 
spinning around the Sun and it's totally
insane<00:03:39.860> like<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.190> when<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.820> can<00:03:42.060> connect
