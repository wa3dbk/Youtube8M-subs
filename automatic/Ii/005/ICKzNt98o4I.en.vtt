because for instance take a game like
like<00:02:27.970> like<00:02:28.390> final<00:02:28.810> fantasy<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.440> final

fantasy 13 that is a multi player but

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.740 
fantasy 13 that is a multi player but
that<00:02:33.010> was<00:02:33.220> able<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.580> be<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.910> 360<00:02:34.420> why

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
that was able to be on the 360 why

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.770 
that was able to be on the 360 why
because<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:36.370> they<00:02:36.580> were<00:02:36.640> trying<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.300> reach

because what they were trying to reach

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.140 
because what they were trying to reach
their<00:02:38.140> objective<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:39.040> quality<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.790> when<00:02:40.060> I'm

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
their objective in quality and when I'm

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.240 
their objective in quality and when I'm
talking<00:02:40.480> about<00:02:40.540> quality<00:02:41.260> I'm<00:02:41.680> not<00:02:41.980> just

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
talking about quality I'm not just

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.130 
talking about quality I'm not just
talking<00:02:42.400> about<00:02:42.610> visual<00:02:43.180> quality<00:02:43.660> I'm<00:02:43.780> talking

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
talking about visual quality I'm talking

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.870 
talking about visual quality I'm talking
about<00:02:44.350> everything<00:02:44.890> frames<00:02:45.250> per<00:02:45.459> second

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
about everything frames per second

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.680 
about everything frames per second
everything<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.450> whole<00:02:46.630> deal<00:02:46.959> um<00:02:48.690> physics

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
everything the whole deal um physics

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.890 
everything the whole deal um physics
everything<00:02:50.440> um<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:52.090> game<00:02:54.060> was<00:02:55.060> possible<00:02:55.720> on

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
everything um in a game was possible on

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.520 
everything um in a game was possible on
both<00:02:56.410> consoles<00:02:57.099> that's<00:02:57.940> why<00:02:58.150> they<00:02:58.299> did<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.569> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
both consoles that's why they did it the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.030 
both consoles that's why they did it the
ps3<00:03:00.130> version<00:03:00.160> was<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.849> one<00:03:01.060> blu-ray<00:03:01.410> but<00:03:02.410> the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
ps3 version was on one blu-ray but the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.229 
ps3 version was on one blu-ray but the
360<00:03:03.910> version<00:03:03.940> was<00:03:04.480> on<00:03:04.630> DVDs<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:06.910> mean<00:03:07.120> it's

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
360 version was on DVDs so I mean it's

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.140 
360 version was on DVDs so I mean it's
it's<00:03:07.450> not<00:03:07.750> it's<00:03:08.049> not<00:03:08.290> about<00:03:08.650> blue<00:03:08.980> red<00:03:09.190> it's

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
it's not it's not about blue red it's

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.720 
it's not it's not about blue red it's
not<00:03:10.599> about<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.620> architecture<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.459> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
not about the architecture of the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.840 
not about the architecture of the
console<00:03:13.180> either<00:03:13.739> now<00:03:14.739> when<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.280> think<00:03:15.400> about

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
console either now when I think about

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.259 
console either now when I think about
architecture<00:03:16.810> I'm<00:03:17.019> thinking<00:03:17.859> about<00:03:17.950> okay<00:03:18.489> you

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
architecture I'm thinking about okay you

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.690 
architecture I'm thinking about okay you
have<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.660> program<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:22.150> game<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:24.130> way<00:03:24.430> in

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
have to program a this game this way in

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.699 
have to program a this game this way in
order<00:03:24.880> for<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.420> work<00:03:25.570> on<00:03:26.049> this<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.650> this

order for it to work on this on this
console<00:03:27.579> same<00:03:28.359> thing<00:03:28.630> with<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.109> console<00:03:29.620> you

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
console same thing with this console you

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.280 
console same thing with this console you
have<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.950> program<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:30.790> way<00:03:31.060> using<00:03:31.930> this

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
have to program it this way using this

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.840 
have to program it this way using this
type<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.620> code<00:03:32.950> in<00:03:33.130> order<00:03:33.220> for<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.519> work<00:03:33.670> on

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
that console what people are trying to

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.809 
that console what people are trying to
get<00:03:37.569> at<00:03:37.750> from<00:03:37.989> my<00:03:38.260> understanding<00:03:38.500> when<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.459> hear

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
get at from my understanding when I hear

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.569 
get at from my understanding when I hear
things<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.269> that<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.889> this<00:03:42.130> game<00:03:42.310> can't

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
things like that that a this game can't

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.500 
things like that that a this game can't
play<00:03:42.790> on<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.239> has<00:03:43.959> nothing<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.620> do<00:03:45.239> with<00:03:46.239> the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
play on that has nothing to do with the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.319 
play on that has nothing to do with the
what's<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.049> architecture<00:03:47.799> or<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.850> factor<00:03:49.269> of

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
what's the architecture or the factor of

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.770 
what's the architecture or the factor of
blu-ray<00:03:50.109> it's<00:03:50.980> about<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:52.030> objective<00:03:52.630> that

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
blu-ray it's about the objective that

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.120 
blu-ray it's about the objective that
they're<00:03:52.959> trying<00:03:53.139> to<00:03:53.440> reach<00:03:53.680> with<00:03:53.920> quality<00:03:54.609> um

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
they're trying to reach with quality um

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.620 
they're trying to reach with quality um
membro<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.220> said<00:03:57.579> quality<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.150> not<00:03:58.329> just

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
membro I said quality is not just

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
membro I said quality is not just
visible<00:03:59.079> it's<00:03:59.859> the<00:04:00.549> whole<00:04:00.760> deal<00:04:01.030> it's<00:04:01.359> I<00:04:01.690> mean

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
visible it's the whole deal it's I mean

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.650 
visible it's the whole deal it's I mean
it's<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:03.400> everything<00:04:03.850> how<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.060> game<00:04:04.329> runs

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
it's it's everything how the game runs

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.590 
it's it's everything how the game runs
all<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.109> physics<00:04:05.680> everything<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.600> that's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
all the physics everything and that's

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.090 
all the physics everything and that's
that's<00:04:07.870> pretty<00:04:08.170> much<00:04:08.350> all<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.590> wanted<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.010> say

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
that's pretty much all I wanted to say

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.849 
that's pretty much all I wanted to say
maybe<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:10.060> like<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.109> said<00:04:11.319> maybe<00:04:11.560> I'm<00:04:11.739> just

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
maybe I like I said maybe I'm just

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.410 
maybe I like I said maybe I'm just
misinterpreting<00:04:12.579> what<00:04:12.609> you're<00:04:12.910> saying<00:04:13.209> your

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
misinterpreting what you're saying your

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.240 
misinterpreting what you're saying your
video<00:04:13.720> maybe<00:04:14.049> you're<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:14.410> misinterpreting

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
video maybe you're just misinterpreting

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.140 
video maybe you're just misinterpreting
what<00:04:15.660> people<00:04:16.660> mean<00:04:17.039> by<00:04:18.039> this<00:04:18.100> game<00:04:18.639> can't<00:04:18.910> run

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
what people mean by this game can't run

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.230 
what people mean by this game can't run
on<00:04:19.180> there<00:04:19.510> but<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.289> just<00:04:21.250> felt<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.640> go<00:04:21.940> throw

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
on there but I just felt that go throw

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.990 
on there but I just felt that go throw
this<00:04:22.360> quick<00:04:22.690> video<00:04:23.409> out<00:04:23.770> there<00:04:23.800> saying<00:04:24.370> that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
this quick video out there saying that

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.650 
this quick video out there saying that
but<00:04:25.870> um<00:04:26.020> but<00:04:26.670> yeah<00:04:27.670> I<00:04:27.700> mean<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:28.120> that's<00:04:28.330> my

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
but um but yeah I mean that that's my

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.680 
but um but yeah I mean that that's my
understanding<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:31.120> phrase<00:04:31.390> when

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
understanding of of that phrase when

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.560 
understanding of of that phrase when
people<00:04:31.990> say<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:33.460> know<00:04:33.490> like<00:04:34.270> when<00:04:34.540> I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
people say that you know like when I

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.340 
people say that you know like when I
look<00:04:34.840> at<00:04:34.990> infamous<00:04:35.440> 2<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.790> hear<00:04:37.090> that

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
look at infamous 2 and I hear that

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.810 
look at infamous 2 and I hear that
especially<00:04:38.350> if<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.590> developer<00:04:38.860> says<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.670> or

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
especially if a developer says that or

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.960 
especially if a developer says that or
something<00:04:40.150> like<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:41.560> know<00:04:41.760> imma<00:04:42.760> be

something like that you know imma be

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.530 
something like that you know imma be
like<00:04:43.180> well<00:04:43.420> okay<00:04:43.450> that<00:04:44.260> means<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:45.240> if<00:04:46.240> this

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
like well okay that means that if this

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.280 
like well okay that means that if this
game<00:04:46.840> were<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.770> be<00:04:48.070> on<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:49.060> 360<00:04:49.750> or<00:04:49.930> anything

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
game were to be on the 360 or anything

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.670 
game were to be on the 360 or anything
it<00:04:50.530> would<00:04:51.040> be<00:04:51.220> diminished<00:04:51.850> greatly<00:04:52.180> or<00:04:52.720> it

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
it would be diminished greatly or it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.890 
it would be diminished greatly or it
would<00:04:53.860> be<00:04:54.130> diminished<00:04:54.730> in<00:04:54.940> somewhat<00:04:55.720> in

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
would be diminished in somewhat in

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.220 
would be diminished in somewhat in
quality<00:04:56.680> whether<00:04:57.580> it's<00:04:57.850> in<00:04:58.000> graphics<00:04:58.630> physics

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
for something that's that the that the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.890 
for something that's that the that the
place<00:05:27.040> that<00:05:27.070> you<00:05:27.370> can<00:05:27.550> do<00:05:27.760> in<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.000> 360<00:05:28.630> can't

place that you can do in the 360 can't

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.590 
place that you can do in the 360 can't
because<00:05:29.350> of<00:05:29.620> certain<00:05:30.010> limitations<00:05:30.850> then

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
because of certain limitations then

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.260 
because of certain limitations then
that's<00:05:31.900> why<00:05:32.229> it<00:05:32.919> has<00:05:33.250> nothing<00:05:33.760> to<00:05:33.970> do<00:05:34.120> with

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
that's why it has nothing to do with

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.090 
that's why it has nothing to do with
anything<00:05:34.510> else<00:05:34.870> that's<00:05:35.650> nothing<00:05:35.919> to<00:05:35.950> do<00:05:36.070> a

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
anything else that's nothing to do a

anything else that's nothing to do a
blu-ray<00:05:36.669> nothing<00:05:37.450> like<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:38.500> has<00:05:38.770> to<00:05:39.010> do

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
blu-ray nothing like that it has to do

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.990 
blu-ray nothing like that it has to do
