00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
bird pooped on our windows and the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.929 
bird pooped on our windows and the
windows<00:03:16.200> are<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.500> huge<00:03:16.889> and<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.400> streaked

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
windows are like huge and like streaked

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.399

down<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.510> whole<00:03:18.629> thing<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.109> there's<00:03:19.230> no<00:03:19.290> way

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
down the whole thing and there's no way

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.229 
down the whole thing and there's no way
for<00:03:19.469> us<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.739> cleave<00:03:20.129> it<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.760> was<00:03:20.849> hoping<00:03:21.180> that

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
for us to cleave it so I was hoping that

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.520 
for us to cleave it so I was hoping that
the<00:03:21.389> rain<00:03:21.540> would<00:03:21.689> clean<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:21.959> off<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.169> little<00:03:22.319> bit

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
the rain would clean it off a little bit

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.259 
the rain would clean it off a little bit
but<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.859> did<00:03:23.040> not<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.459> I'd<00:03:23.579> like<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.909> blinds
