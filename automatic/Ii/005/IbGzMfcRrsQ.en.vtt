00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.780
 episode let's see how it works out and 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.400
 first of all guys tell you that I 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.140
 you can support a lot by leaving me handy 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.670
 up because remember that each half 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.200
 above supposed a line that comes 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.559
 it really costs nothing and helps 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.420
 very much before explaining why good 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.010
 Why we are going to read this skin 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.430
 of the rules to start as soon as 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.600
 possible we are in the 7 dynamic gamers 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.550
 and let's see here what it says is 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.950
 banned champion spam or surroundings 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.720
 respect these users do not insult this 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.910
 server there are no administrators is 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.610
 prohibited from using hacks or mentioning 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.090
 some allows you to do everything you are in 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.220
 an ultra hardcore 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.720
 ok let's be careful luckily 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.670
 we are going to have everything recorded and before 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.050
 nothing send a service made an envelope 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.910
 all very strong because he has been the one 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.800
 he has given me this food and we are going to take 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.570
 and to an address now well more at night 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.310
 without fit to luck but if 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.290
 ruiz or it comes because it will defend us what 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.970
 soon as possible 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.220
 well let's explain what the skin 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.900
 you will see been recording before then the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.119
 I also apologize to all people 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.580
 that were in the previous video but 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.830
 I had bad luck and it seems that I did not 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.110
 found no food during the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.810
 recording of the video and the dead blow 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 and then said let's see how kind 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.040
 You'll upload a three - minute video one 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.630
 video three minutes that have died with no 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.940
 have food as we are going to raise that is 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.190
 that it was not worth it then what 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.979
 them yes or catch the skin of my hand the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.509
 corner sorry my brother's account and 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.700
 put me then to record then as before 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.110
 possible then the chapter because the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.170
 I really wanted to 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.580
 record it because in the other in the other 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.530
 video I mentioned that there were people who 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.230
 they started recording and died in the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.420
 first episode because 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.280
 no're careful and you're tidbits 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.760
 and it seems that it has happened to me what 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.720
 same thing that happened to me in the previous one but 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.340
 now let's try this episode 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.810
 do not go out much better right now 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.800
 we have food then what are we going to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.240
 try then to get wood for 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.410
 make us the sword the pisco we are going to 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.320
 take nine of stones to make us the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.030
 stone peak in the sword and the lazio 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.190
 so to take more than as soon as possible 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.330
 we have to be very careful with 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.100
 the zombies because we had stretches of 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.980
 then we have started quite a bit 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.720
 wrong now the series because in the other 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 episode we died for food and this 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.720
 we are starting at night so very 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.720
 bad luck we have 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.260
 we have here and now and there was not a 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.590
 spider to each disappears 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.440
 agree not matter 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.910
 well here we have stone with this we 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.910
 we can do something and we have a table 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.450
 fast I do not want to die so fast either 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.730
 remember that you can not recover here 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.060
 nothing to say you can not recover 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.330
 hearts to not be unless you 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.430
 get apples or have 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.590
 positions of life or get your head 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.560
 of some person then that's why I 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.020
 really liked this kind of way 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.220
 game because it 's quite difficult but the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.810
 truth is that before I stayed very 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.520
 frustrated when it comes to see that no 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.800
 get no food and jaime dead 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.180
 at the moment the truth that I already had iron 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.780
 So I had to do it. He called me the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.780
 pants 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.140
 then this would be basically what 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.010
 let's try later to go do what 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.450
 best possible 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.909
 Ours is possible that we can in 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.440
 this chapter and the rest we will try 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.760
 record off camera get 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.620
 we extend that iannone from him to 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.450
 get him 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.549
 the warts notify is to be able to be 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.810
 potions we're going to need watermelons and we 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.549
 we find watermelon, we will try 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.239
 exchange it with other users who 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.580
 let's find how many good we already have 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:57.320
 well enough we have a nothing 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.660
 well there is an archer you have to have 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.510
 very much very much very much 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.000
 be careful with the archers because the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.340
 archers are whiskas and archers are 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.310
 alice bastards and not want to die not 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.290
 I want to die for an archer 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.370
 and you are doing a super training 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.690
 serious 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.000
 we take this lame this but a zombie me 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.590
 it seems that a zombie comes with oars to 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.180
 here we are going to try to look for some cave 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.430
 I do not want to make the chapter either 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.590
 very long because good is going to be a 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.860
 Test chapter to see if you like it 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.440
 and if not then I will not continue uploading here 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.250
 there is a little person here a little person 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.250
 seen a person here 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.659
 good boy we're here back no 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.189
 you have been able to see death because it has 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.259
 came the bone mounted on a ship that 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.870
 what I was going to do is take a boat 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.039
 and kill him but I 've stayed my face 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.469
 with the head or the one that has caught before 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.879
 they sent another woman that good risks 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:55.189
 alliance so we're not going to go to 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.330
 for him because he's ally good guys ya 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.009
 we are here back and look at what 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.839
 found good was long no this no 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.909
 it's just coming out here because because 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:04.219
 it pleases the wing and it burns me and I 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:08.870
 I'm going to die, I'm dying, I'm dying 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:13.240
 my god oh my god what the palm and I 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:17.349
 it was three hearts and ready 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.960
 let's take it and look at it it made noise 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.599
 it is also in the last ones that now 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.500
 we have started well I found here 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:29.580
 is this little cave I will see if 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.199
 contains some here the coal 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.849
 you have to be careful because neither 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:38.270
 I want to die then I do not want that 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:41.230
 finish the chapter 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.230
 perfect 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.450
 I do not know how long we will take video 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.390
 let's try to collect a few 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.950
 materials if we found iron then 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.620
 It would be great because with him I want 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.940
 good we do we already do 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.480
 golden apples with it then 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.960
 we recover life and it gives me a little bit of bad 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.850
 roll I want transfer risotto 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.850
 following on plan I'm here 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:18.060
 did not see anything good let's see we're going to 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.060
 catch everything studied here 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.090
 where yes we can first chapter we 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.300
 is going pretty well the bad is the 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.509
 life that already a blow and we die enough 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.520
 fast but good we already have a head 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:32.560
 with this head we can not do 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.169
 a golden head so to speak not with 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.950
 him or what we find but it seems to me 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.840
 me you will not find anything gold 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.710
 oh my god and I do not want to be the 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.200
 very long chapter as I was saying 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.750
 how much I do not take you anymore 17 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.670
 we need 24 so that it covers the back 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:54.050
 we need 24 to make us the 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.400
 equipment and then go completitos and already what 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.690
 has already said for the next chapter not 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.690
 I will go with this account and with mine 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.009
 here 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:13.889
 what is this 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.520
 more and more facts let's explain here 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.520
 that here 

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:23.020
 there is nothing a path that is being the 

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:25.389
 first I will put this like this 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.099
 no problem of a kripper I have 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.319
 seen it 's clippers two attempts again 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:31.810
 we will look for problems of 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.190
 moment and good guys I think we're going to 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.780
 leave the chapter here because we have 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.400
 a good time and I do not know if you're going 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.280
 to like a lot in the next episode 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.900
 Well, I'm going to try to make ourselves better 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.580
 life or something we already have with the other 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.840
 count and magical is to remember that I 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.280
 you can support a lot leaving not 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.509
 foreigners because remember that also 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.520
 after taking a stand from a store that 

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:49.960
 live really does not cost anything we see 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.639
 in the next episode and I hope there's 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.639
 very much liked chao chao
