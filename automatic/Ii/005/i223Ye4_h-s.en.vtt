00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
male version but i copied it twice so it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.330 
male version but i copied it twice so it
still<00:01:15.390> appears<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.710> really

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
still appears that because it really

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
still appears that because it really
essentially<00:01:17.969> it's<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.329> same<00:01:18.570> thing<00:01:18.899> for<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
essentially it's the same thing for the
