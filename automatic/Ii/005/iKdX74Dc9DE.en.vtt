 crepe and pasta called the picacho 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.509

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.309
 years I lived in my mother's paddle 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.350
 He told me to sleep early because 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.780
 tomorrow I would begin my story as 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.300
 Pokémon trainer I woke up I went to the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.760
 professor oak's laboratory and there I 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.129
 I found my rival who was also starting 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.370
 his adventure he would also choose his 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.620
 initial pokemon the teacher had 3 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.720
 because balls we check them all but 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.059
 none had a pokemon and the teacher 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.460
 He told us before, other children were 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.440
 they had taken the teacher told my 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.080
 rival that in a few moments would bring 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.629
 another pokemon called and I saw me sad me 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.270
 I was not able to reach an initial pokemon 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.400
 fire type grass or water the teacher 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.740
 He took out a fourth black ball poke not 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.689
 I put a lot of attention because I just 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.850
 I wanted a pokemon to fight with and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.850
 live unforgettable moments but at 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.259
 get the teacher to that pokemon 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.350
 he quickly made a face of anger and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.080
 contempt I told him my name and that I 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.280
 I would be your new coach and friend 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.500
 Pikachu gave him back 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.810
 but he told me that that pikachu does not 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.640
 he liked to be inside his poke ball and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 we went with my mother and she told me that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.780
 Be careful with pikachu instead of 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.000
 to tell me to take good care of him 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 she told me not to neglect me ao 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.890
 pikachu would do something bad to me I did not understand 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.780
 very well and we left the village paletta in 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.000
 pikachu coaches beat very fast to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.340
 your opponents but after that the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.710
 pokemon fainted pikachu followed 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 attacking the pokemon bloodily 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.270
 weak he told pikachu to leave him 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.429
 but this one did not pay attention to me I tried 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.940
