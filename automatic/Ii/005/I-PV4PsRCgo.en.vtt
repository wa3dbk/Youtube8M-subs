level we had to invent this there was a

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.890 
level we had to invent this there was a
lot<00:00:38.890> of<00:00:39.190> discovery<00:00:39.820> involved<00:00:40.480> this<00:00:40.660> was<00:00:40.780> the

I think the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.570 
I think the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train
project<00:00:53.860> has<00:00:53.950> been<00:00:54.100> one<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.460> most

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
project has been one of the most

we've pulled in people from dozens of
different<00:01:00.520> disciplines<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.640> process<00:01:07.090> of

then<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:12.640> became<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:13.150> sculpture<00:01:13.780> scanned<00:01:14.320> into

then it became a sculpture scanned into
the<00:01:14.620> computer<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:15.790> our<00:01:15.970> engineers<00:01:16.540> started

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
the computer then our engineers started

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.780 
the computer then our engineers started
doing<00:01:17.230> some<00:01:17.380> preliminary<00:01:17.560> engineering<00:01:18.340> on

doing some preliminary engineering on
what<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.210> dwarfs<00:01:19.659> were<00:01:19.780> actually<00:01:20.170> gonna<00:01:20.260> be

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
what the dwarfs were actually gonna be

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.090 
what the dwarfs were actually gonna be
capable<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.950> doing<00:01:21.330> then<00:01:22.330> we<00:01:22.630> worked<00:01:23.380> with<00:01:23.800> our

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
capable of doing then we worked with our

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.130

team at Walt Disney Animation Studios to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.620 
team at Walt Disney Animation Studios to
produce<00:01:26.320> media<00:01:26.740> there's<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:27.640> many<00:01:27.790> new<00:01:28.180> things

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
produce media there's so many new things

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.660 
produce media there's so many new things
that<00:01:28.870> are<00:01:28.930> happening<00:01:28.990> on<00:01:29.620> these<00:01:30.010> Dwarfs<00:01:30.490> we

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
that are happening on these Dwarfs we

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.450 
that are happening on these Dwarfs we
reference<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.840> original<00:01:32.320> movie<00:01:32.650> we<00:01:32.950> really

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
reference the original movie we really

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.570 
reference the original movie we really
studied<00:01:34.060> how<00:01:34.630> those<00:01:34.900> dwarves<00:01:35.350> behaved<00:01:35.920> their

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
studied how those dwarves behaved their

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.090 
studied how those dwarves behaved their
facial<00:01:36.940> features<00:01:37.180> when<00:01:37.870> they're<00:01:38.080> speaking<00:01:38.500> or

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
facial features when they're speaking or

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.010 
facial features when they're speaking or
singing<00:01:39.580> there's<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:40.510> much<00:01:40.659> new<00:01:40.870> technology

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
singing there's so much new technology

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.990 
singing there's so much new technology
out<00:01:41.470> there<00:01:41.620> we<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.400> really<00:01:42.640> make<00:01:42.850> these

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
out there we can really make these

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.490 
out there we can really make these
characters<00:01:43.450> look<00:01:43.659> like<00:01:43.810> they've<00:01:43.960> jumped<00:01:44.380> off

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
characters look like they've jumped off

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.910 
characters look like they've jumped off
the<00:01:44.680> screen

I<00:01:46.720> think<00:01:47.720> our<00:01:47.840> guests<00:01:48.080> are<00:01:48.140> going<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.320> feel

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
I think our guests are going to feel

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.660 
I think our guests are going to feel
like<00:01:48.500> they're<00:01:48.920> experiencing<00:01:49.520> these

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
like they're experiencing these

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.810 
like they're experiencing these
characters<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.170> really<00:01:51.560> unique<00:01:51.770> way<00:01:51.950> seeing

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
characters in a really unique way seeing

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.230 
characters in a really unique way seeing
the<00:01:53.120> fear<00:01:53.540> joy<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.680> people<00:01:55.070> experiencing<00:01:55.760> what

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
the fear joy of people experiencing what

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.410 
the fear joy of people experiencing what
really<00:01:56.510> boils<00:01:56.810> down<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.470> Disney<00:01:58.310> magic<00:01:58.790> 50
