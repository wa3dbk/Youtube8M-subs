00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.419

 It is not so 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.119

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.119
 time to do some private investigations 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.089

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:53.669
 FilmUP 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.370
 I managed to earn enough to allow us a trip to

 egypt to the tomb of nefertiti 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.209
 I knew you could have done it, I can't believe I doubted 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.679
 I'm sorry 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.499
 state of your beautiful words on professionalism you do not make a good if 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:13.659
 you are not paid a real professional does not abandon his wine you notice 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.639

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.979

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.300
 the sun is fine for our team 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.860
 she came on vacation with a servant, traveling for hours 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.860
 here now I was right to take a quarter of the grain 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:46.499
 from moreno 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:48.949
 it should be right behind a room 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.949
 we send no time to lose 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:01.550
 we are not alone an archaeological excavation the lost tomb is no longer forgiving if 

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:05.489
 so it would have made the news because lately we had the 

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:08.619
 time to read the newspapers have a look I like the impression of 

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:11.619
 To know someone 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.080
 I can help 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.430
 my friends we got lost could tell us where we are this is the grave of 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.620
 nefertiti brought to light recently by TV programs apparently we are not the 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.650
 unique ones that interest first the star they are looking for 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.189
 our streets were financed by the government 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:30.969
 for you instead of you 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.449
 given it would have won we are we have been sent here by the museum of the 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:35.779
 ancient artifacts 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.579
 the important organizer shows the weather the exact time it is thorny branches 

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:43.439
 the one in charge of them but if I have patience geronio superiore that you are here 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:46.650
 I am sure he will be delighted 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.870
 video postpaid I wouldn't want to meet that guy in a dark street in the care 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.780
 - lullaby I told you the truth there will be the peter lesca government we will find out between 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.379
 little already we hope 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.949
 so at least if monsters arrive, we know that the government has nothing to do with 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:00.439
 nothing at all 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.489
 the secret house is much worse and if you regret it later 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.400
 benvenutissimi 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.419
 it's nice to meet representatives of the colosseum tickets 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.449
 in fact we all share 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.649
 the same possessive city things in particular we are looking for 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.419
 some ideas will be well known what to expect from your staying at 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.360

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.569
 we would very much like to be passionate about the mystery 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.240
 a very smart move but I think you know the very first thing you are looking for believes 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.279
 really my friend and I also think it's tim.it 

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:40.819
 you did the gourmet judge pushes like it was won 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.580
