00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
different as a very is minimal cueing so

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.150 
different as a very is minimal cueing so
you<00:03:41.480> don't<00:03:41.629> need<00:03:41.720> two<00:03:41.870> hands<00:03:42.079> two<00:03:42.260> legs<00:03:42.290> and

you don't need two hands two legs and
the<00:03:43.310> other<00:03:43.340> thing<00:03:43.609> is<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.879> reintroduce

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
game keeping in this particular task

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.150 
game keeping in this particular task
that<00:03:59.900> will<00:04:00.049> be<00:04:00.199> asked<00:04:00.379> to<00:04:00.440> get<00:04:00.650> involved<00:04:01.010> in

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
that will be asked to get involved in

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.339 
that will be asked to get involved in
there's<00:04:01.639> map<00:04:01.910> reading<00:04:02.209> skills<00:04:02.599> there's<00:04:03.199> the

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
there's map reading skills there's the

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.839 
there's map reading skills there's the
use<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.709> ground<00:04:04.069> because<00:04:04.489> obviously<00:04:04.609> we

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
use of the ground because obviously we

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.069 
use of the ground because obviously we
have<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.030> come<00:04:05.180> up<00:04:05.209> around<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.660> ponies<00:04:06.019> you

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
have to come up around the ponies you

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.420 
have to come up around the ponies you
have<00:04:06.199> to<00:04:06.349> know<00:04:06.530> where<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.709> winds<00:04:07.099> coming<00:04:07.310> from

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
have to know where the winds coming from

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.580 
have to know where the winds coming from
so<00:04:07.910> many<00:04:08.449> of<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.780> skills<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.230> guys<00:04:09.410> have

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
so many of the skills the guys have

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.199 
so many of the skills the guys have
actually<00:04:09.739> being<00:04:10.370> taught<00:04:10.639> in<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.819> military

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
actually being taught in the military

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.569 
actually being taught in the military
are<00:04:11.389> transferable<00:04:12.139> it's<00:04:12.739> just<00:04:13.040> finding<00:04:13.280> ways

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
are transferable it's just finding ways

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.539 
are transferable it's just finding ways
of<00:04:13.760> doing<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.449> so<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:14.989> think<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:16.039> this<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:16.519> a

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
of doing it so I think that this is a

working alongside we've come up and we

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.420 
working alongside we've come up and we
have<00:05:47.210> done<00:05:47.450> initial<00:05:48.080> ground<00:05:48.290> Ricky's<00:05:48.680> had<00:05:49.400> a

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
have done initial ground Ricky's had a

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.600 
have done initial ground Ricky's had a
look<00:05:49.810> mapped<00:05:50.810> out<00:05:51.050> coordinated<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.070> area<00:05:52.430> and

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
look mapped out coordinated the area and

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.030 
look mapped out coordinated the area and
now<00:05:53.570> it's<00:05:53.750> just<00:05:53.900> putting<00:05:54.080> implementing<00:05:54.920> it

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
now it's just putting implementing it

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.500 
now it's just putting implementing it
basically<00:05:55.400> is<00:05:55.760> getting<00:05:56.180> out<00:05:56.270> there<00:05:56.300> and

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
basically is getting out there and

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.900 
basically is getting out there and
bringing<00:05:57.020> these<00:05:57.200> these<00:05:57.710> horses<00:05:57.980> in<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.760> whole

bringing these these horses in the whole

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.230 
bringing these these horses in the whole
idea<00:05:59.090> of<00:05:59.390> this<00:05:59.600> is<00:05:59.810> to<00:06:00.020> curb<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.920> breeding<00:06:01.340> to

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
idea of this is to curb the breeding to

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.380 
idea of this is to curb the breeding to
reduce<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.170> numbers<00:06:03.620> so<00:06:04.250> that<00:06:04.460> is<00:06:04.760> a<00:06:05.030> number

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
reduce the numbers so that is a number

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.600 
reduce the numbers so that is a number
