that soon you'll basically see just how

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.830

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it just takes a really long time to do

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.669 
it just takes a really long time to do
anything<00:01:45.330> well<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.500> top<00:01:46.619> of

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679

weapon<00:02:29.820> it's<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.870> little<00:02:30.990> ridiculous<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
weapon it's a little ridiculous that you

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.080

can<00:02:32.070> do<00:02:32.190> stuff<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.550> but<00:02:32.790> that's<00:02:32.940> how<00:02:33.060> it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
can do stuff like that but that's how it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.590 
can do stuff like that but that's how it
works<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:34.350> then<00:02:34.740> there's<00:02:35.370> carbon<00:02:36.000> fiber<00:02:36.270> for

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
works and then there's carbon fiber for

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.870 
works and then there's carbon fiber for
like<00:02:36.750> no<00:02:36.990> perks<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:37.860> some<00:02:38.460> other<00:02:38.580> gun

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880

like no perks and then some other gun
for<00:02:39.210> only<00:02:39.390> 50<00:02:39.870> kills<00:02:40.050> with<00:02:40.170> no<00:02:40.260> attachments

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
actually even know what it's called at

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.720 
actually even know what it's called at
all<00:03:10.050> but<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.410> essentially<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> rail<00:03:11.280> gun<00:03:11.310> it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
all but it's essentially a rail gun it

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.490 
all but it's essentially a rail gun it
shoots<00:03:11.910> one<00:03:12.240> shot<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.660> then<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.050> pop

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
shoots one shot and then you have to pop

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.080 
shoots one shot and then you have to pop
a<00:03:13.530> new<00:03:13.770> little<00:03:14.070> mag<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.550> or<00:03:14.700> pop<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> new

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
a new little mag in it or pop a new

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.940 
a new little mag in it or pop a new
bullet<00:03:15.270> in<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.320> very<00:03:16.470> strong<00:03:16.740> weapon

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
bullet in it it's a very strong weapon

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.340 
bullet in it it's a very strong weapon
it's<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.310> one-shot<00:03:17.490> kill<00:03:17.850> from<00:03:18.030> pretty<00:03:18.810> good

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
it's a one-shot kill from pretty good

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.980 
it's a one-shot kill from pretty good
range<00:03:19.950> not<00:03:20.490> very<00:03:20.760> far<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.330> it's<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.570> pistol<00:03:21.900> you

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
range not very far but it's a pistol you

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.360 
range not very far but it's a pistol you
can't<00:03:22.170> expect<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.650> be<00:03:22.770> incredibly<00:03:23.160> far

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
can't expect it to be incredibly far

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.250 
can't expect it to be incredibly far
however<00:03:24.060> there<00:03:24.240> is<00:03:24.330> an<00:03:24.450> attachment<00:03:24.690> for<00:03:25.140> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
however there is an attachment for it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.440 
however there is an attachment for it
that<00:03:25.800> is<00:03:25.950> essentially<00:03:26.459> an<00:03:26.610> upgraded<00:03:27.150> barrel

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
that is essentially an upgraded barrel

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.900 
that is essentially an upgraded barrel
that<00:03:27.570> makes<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.870> farther<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:29.430> that's<00:03:29.610> not<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
that makes it farther so that's not the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.810 
that makes it farther so that's not the
biggest<00:03:30.209> deal<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:31.500> ends<00:03:32.070> up<00:03:32.160> being<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.640> much

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
biggest deal it ends up being a much

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.550 
biggest deal it ends up being a much
better<00:03:33.060> pistol<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.810> used<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.470> a

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
better pistol and I used it just a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.080 
better pistol and I used it just a
little<00:03:34.590> bit<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.980> see<00:03:35.160> what<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.459> was<00:03:35.580> like<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.000> I

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
little bit to see what it was like and I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.790 
little bit to see what it was like and I
was<00:03:36.120> significantly<00:03:36.840> better<00:03:37.019> in<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.680> may

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
was significantly better in it you may

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.440 
was significantly better in it you may
also<00:03:37.950> be<00:03:38.070> wondering<00:03:38.430> why<00:03:38.550> I'm<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:39.000> laying<00:03:39.269> all

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
also be wondering why I'm a laying all

the X button to reload a little bit

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.530

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
would lose a perk they don't have the

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.830 
would lose a perk they don't have the
sight<00:06:16.430> of<00:06:16.460> Hamburg<00:06:16.910> so<00:06:17.090> it<00:06:17.180> wouldn't<00:06:17.510> be<00:06:17.570> there

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
sight of Hamburg so it wouldn't be there

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.810 
sight of Hamburg so it wouldn't be there
and<00:06:18.050> without<00:06:18.500> that<00:06:18.710> if<00:06:19.490> they<00:06:19.700> would

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
and without that if they would

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.610 
and without that if they would
essentially<00:06:20.120> not<00:06:20.540> have<00:06:20.750> quick<00:06:21.020> reloads<00:06:21.410> for

anyone at all and it may become

anyone at all and it may become
something<00:06:23.600> that<00:06:23.840> people<00:06:24.080> don't<00:06:24.200> really<00:06:24.410> like

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
something that people don't really like
