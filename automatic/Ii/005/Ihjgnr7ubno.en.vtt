just depends on how big you want it to
be<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.489> making<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> larger<00:00:51.239> puff<00:00:51.510> like

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
be when I'm making a larger puff like

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.600 
be when I'm making a larger puff like
for<00:00:52.110> rolling<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.530> large<00:00:52.739> pieces<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> fondant

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
for rolling out large pieces of fondant

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
for rolling out large pieces of fondant
I<00:00:53.789> usually<00:00:54.390> put<00:00:54.629> about<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> cup<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.770> if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I usually put about a cup in there if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
I usually put about a cup in there if
it's<00:00:56.579> gonna<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.940> smaller<00:00:57.360> say<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.230> rolling

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it's gonna be smaller say for rolling

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
it's gonna be smaller say for rolling
out<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:59.039> pieces<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.760> gum<00:01:00.329> paste<00:01:00.539> flowers

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
out little pieces of gum paste flowers

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.470 
out little pieces of gum paste flowers
or<00:01:01.320> petals<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> might<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> couple

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
or petals then I might just do a couple

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
or petals then I might just do a couple
tablespoons<00:01:04.280> once<00:01:05.280> you've<00:01:05.430> got<00:01:05.580> your

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
tablespoons once you've got your

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.399 
tablespoons once you've got your
cornstarch<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.740> carefully<00:01:07.740> take<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:07.979> top<00:01:08.400> off

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
cornstarch in carefully take the top off

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.090 
cornstarch in carefully take the top off
lift<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> out<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.549> all<00:01:11.700> falls<00:01:12.000> down

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
lift it out so that it all falls down

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910 
lift it out so that it all falls down
and<00:01:14.810> then<00:01:15.810> you're<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> tie<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> knot<00:01:16.680> in

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and then you're going to tie a knot in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.320 
and then you're going to tie a knot in
the<00:01:17.100> top<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.180 

once<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.080> get<00:01:23.230> you're<00:01:23.380> not<00:01:23.560> you're<00:01:24.070> gonna

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
once you get you're not you're gonna

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.090 
once you get you're not you're gonna
actually<00:01:24.490> open<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.180> up<00:01:25.330> again<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:26.770> time

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
actually open it up again and this time

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.750 
actually open it up again and this time
come<00:01:27.520> around<00:01:27.760> again<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.860> keeps<00:01:30.220> too

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
come around again this just keeps too

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.670 
come around again this just keeps too
much<00:01:30.970> excess<00:01:31.420> cornstarch<00:01:32.080> from<00:01:32.290> coming<00:01:32.590> out

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
much excess cornstarch from coming out

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.790 
much excess cornstarch from coming out
at<00:01:32.770> one<00:01:32.950> time<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:35.140> you're<00:01:35.380> going<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.530> tie

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
at one time and then you're going to tie

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.930 
at one time and then you're going to tie
another<00:01:36.190> knot

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.820 

then<00:01:43.570> you'll<00:01:43.780> take<00:01:43.930> your<00:01:43.990> scissors<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.800> just

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
then you'll take your scissors and just

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.100

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
trim some of that excess off there now

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.590 
trim some of that excess off there now
you've<00:01:50.260> got<00:01:50.410> your<00:01:50.530> pop<00:01:50.710> as<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:52.000> can<00:01:52.180> see<00:01:52.390> they

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
you've got your pop as you can see they

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.540 
you've got your pop as you can see they
can<00:01:52.660> get<00:01:52.930> quite<00:01:53.200> messy<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:53.920> keep<00:01:54.310> mine

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
can get quite messy so I keep mine

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.400 
can get quite messy so I keep mine
stored<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.300> little<00:01:55.570> container<00:01:55.930> when<00:01:56.230> not

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
stored in a little container when not

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.040

using but when I am ready to use it you

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.250 
using but when I am ready to use it you
