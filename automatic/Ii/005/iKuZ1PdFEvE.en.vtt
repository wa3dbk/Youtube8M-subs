worry about the pesticides but I found
in<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.199> alternative<00:00:19.770> field<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.490> nutrition

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
in the alternative field and nutrition

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.029 
in the alternative field and nutrition
that<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.930> actually<00:00:22.109> cause<00:00:22.350> problems

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
that it can actually cause problems

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
that it can actually cause problems
there<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.369> people<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.510> exposed

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
there are people that that are exposed

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.710 
there are people that that are exposed
to<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:25.289> pesticides<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.340> they<00:00:27.240> don't<00:00:27.510> do

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to these pesticides and they don't do

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.960 
to these pesticides and they don't do
well<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.109> them<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.830> mimics<00:00:29.070> hormones<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.939> the

well with them it mimics hormones in the
body<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:30.660> cause<00:00:30.840> confusion<00:00:31.759> it<00:00:32.759> acts<00:00:33.120> like

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
body can cause confusion it acts like

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.190 
body can cause confusion it acts like

practice to help people not be exposed
to<00:00:41.879> pesticides<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.809> least<00:00:42.960> limit<00:00:43.410> their

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
to pesticides or at least limit their

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.090 
to pesticides or at least limit their
exposure<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.719> use<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> guide<00:00:46.440> by<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
exposure is to use a guide by the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700 
exposure is to use a guide by the
Environmental<00:00:47.820> Working<00:00:47.850> Group<00:00:48.530> what<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.649> do

Environmental Working Group what they do

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.319 
Environmental Working Group what they do
is<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.340> check<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> level<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
is they actually check the level of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.770 
is they actually check the level of
pesticides<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.140> produce<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.629> has

peppers celery so the way that I apply

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.539 
peppers celery so the way that I apply
this<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.140> practice<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
this in practice is if I'm going to the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.289 
this in practice is if I'm going to the
store<00:01:35.820> let's<00:01:36.600> say<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> bin<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
store let's say that there's a bin of

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.940 
store let's say that there's a bin of
organic<00:01:39.299> strawberries<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.049> there's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.650> bin

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
organic strawberries and there's a bin

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.359 
organic strawberries and there's a bin
of<00:01:41.159> commercial<00:01:41.970> strawberries<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.720> I'm<00:01:43.619> don't

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
of commercial strawberries and I'm don't

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.620 
of commercial strawberries and I'm don't
know<00:01:44.520> whether<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.149> spend<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> extra

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
know whether I want to spend the extra

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
know whether I want to spend the extra
money<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.229> organic<00:01:46.680> well<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> look<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.549> my

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
money for organic well I look at my

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.050 
money for organic well I look at my
sheet<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.229> strawberries<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.430> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
sheet and I see that strawberries if you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120 
sheet and I see that strawberries if you
get<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> commercial<00:01:51.899> variety<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.710> level<00:01:53.040> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
get the commercial variety the level of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.969 
get the commercial variety the level of
pesticide<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.060> high<00:01:54.299> you're<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.799> be

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
pesticide is so high you're going to be

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.859 
pesticide is so high you're going to be
poisoned<00:01:56.640> even<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> wash<00:01:57.479> them<00:01:57.719> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
poisoned even if you wash them it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.300 
poisoned even if you wash them it
doesn't<00:01:58.049> matter<00:01:58.320> you're<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.130> get

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
you might not get as much nutrition

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.199 
you might not get as much nutrition
depending<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.410> who<00:02:40.650> pays<00:02:40.860> for<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.280> study<00:02:41.580> some

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
depending on who pays for the study some

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.300 
depending on who pays for the study some
studies<00:02:42.600> say<00:02:42.780> organic<00:02:43.110> has<00:02:43.410> more<00:02:43.709> nutrition

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
studies say organic has more nutrition

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.850 
studies say organic has more nutrition
some<00:02:44.640> say<00:02:44.910> it's<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.540> same<00:02:45.840> as<00:02:45.870> commercial<00:02:46.470> but

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
some say it's the same as commercial but

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.229 
some say it's the same as commercial but
it<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.100> depends<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.520> who's<00:02:47.700> paying<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
it just depends on who's paying for the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.070 
it just depends on who's paying for the
study<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> changes<00:02:49.140> week<00:02:49.350> by<00:02:49.560> week<00:02:49.770> I

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
study and it changes week by week I

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.240 
study and it changes week by week I
personally<00:02:52.080> believe<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.560> makes<00:02:52.739> sense<00:02:52.980> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
personally believe it makes sense that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.250 
personally believe it makes sense that
there's<00:02:53.670> more<00:02:54.000> nutrition<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.840> organic

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
there's more nutrition and organic

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.020 
there's more nutrition and organic
produce<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:55.830> that's<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.610> discussion

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
produce but that's really a discussion
