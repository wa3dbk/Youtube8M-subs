so just it's right in front of the big

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.410 
so just it's right in front of the big
building<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.870> on<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> big<00:01:46.530> building<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.010> the

southwestern side just go ahead and
climb<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.070> there<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.250> grab<00:01:50.430> it

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.610 

and<00:02:04.700> easier<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.360> hack<00:02:05.570> into<00:02:05.780> Abstergo<00:02:06.410> smell

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
and easier to hack into Abstergo smell

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.180 
and easier to hack into Abstergo smell
all<00:02:06.800> right<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.160> now<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.400> do<00:02:07.760> this<00:02:08.210> one<00:02:09.190> to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
all right and now to do this one to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.610 
all right and now to do this one to
locate<00:02:10.580> hidden<00:02:11.270> images<00:02:11.630> some<00:02:11.810> three<00:02:12.080> pictures

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
locate hidden images some three pictures

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.750 
locate hidden images some three pictures
and<00:02:13.390> they<00:02:14.390> are<00:02:14.450> all<00:02:14.660> fairly<00:02:15.590> easy<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.370> find<00:02:16.610> if

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
and they are all fairly easy to find if

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.560 
and they are all fairly easy to find if
you<00:02:16.850> know<00:02:16.970> where<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.120> look

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.180 

the<00:02:20.570> first<00:02:20.840> one<00:02:21.020> is<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> barrel<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.040> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
the first one is in the barrel of the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.840 
the first one is in the barrel of the
soldiers<00:02:22.580> gun<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.710> second<00:02:25.070> one<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.790> a

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
soldier's head crouched to the left so

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.470 
soldier's head crouched to the left so
I'll<00:02:31.250> get<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.120> minute<00:02:33.880> there<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.030> is

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
I'll get it in a minute there it is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.050 
I'll get it in a minute there it is
