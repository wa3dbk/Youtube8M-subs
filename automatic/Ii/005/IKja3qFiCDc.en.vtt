00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 and welcome to my 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.700
 model railways component 9 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.690
 So you see how it always has 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.849
 a lot has been done 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:17.359
 here forward, I now turn the piece 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.910
 built so that here the old man from there 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.779
 here can drive yard 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.269
 I already have one here 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.550
 bit begun to build namely 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.539
 from down here to up here in the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.600
 Medium in the middle went into the middle 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 bullet, so to speak 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 and then I have here as just still 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.230
 continue to build and this stretch here 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.550
 but continue building up 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.770
 so that's synonymous problems and forth 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.570
 asks then I have something else built and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.969
 Although this wall had mine here 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.469
 father still and here but carton of 2 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.879
 mm plates and I have them here then 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.960
 built up 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.030
 here are the track so that chrysler 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:12.409
 have to go and then you can go here 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.390
 drive so long and tunnels here and 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.770
 thanks to a user of my youtube 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 account that had me namely 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
 suggested that he still car me 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
 system should build 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.250
 I will only do that now 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.890
 I'm not down there in the facilities 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.340
 will build half 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:36.060
 but I will build this here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.220
 up here then then so long here then should 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.610
 Nevertheless , mountains should still be here anyway 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.439
 here about as high 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.020
 and then I should stop here so a circle 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.399
 and back on so long data again 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.130
 crass and here and then in between 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.439
 times so the cars came then even long 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.570
 I do not know how to drive 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.460
 but definitely it is definitely 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.040
 that has happened and mine 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.420
 I have that now too 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.670
 changed here depends only just now 1 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.500
 also changed because one had 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.250
 written that not together 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.990
 should couple 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.250
 because that is otherwise somehow problems 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.670
 I have now changed've 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.190
 I made both 110 thanks for that 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.340
 still okay that 's it 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.900
 again 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.530
 yes I hope you liked it and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.530
 Until next time
