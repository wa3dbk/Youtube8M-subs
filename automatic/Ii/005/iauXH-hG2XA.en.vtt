00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
probably about two years ago we were in

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.280 
probably about two years ago we were in
the<00:01:45.860> midst<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.220> planning<00:01:46.430> for<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.850> run<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.290> it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
seemed every couple weeks we were

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.630 
seemed every couple weeks we were
getting<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.330> notification<00:01:50.690> that<00:01:51.520> someone<00:01:52.520> had

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
could end it becomes a family thing as

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.720 
could end it becomes a family thing as
well<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.580> think<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.920> individual<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.700> a

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
well I think the individual is a

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.150 
well I think the individual is a
survivor<00:03:27.210> but<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:28.140> family<00:03:28.590> becomes<00:03:28.980> a

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
survivor but the family becomes a

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.150 
survivor but the family becomes a
survivor<00:03:29.820> as<00:03:30.120> well<00:03:30.330> our<00:03:30.660> survivors<00:03:31.410> as<00:03:31.980> i

this before and radiation was very
difficult<00:04:02.700> for<00:04:03.030> me<00:04:03.300> but<00:04:04.310> because<00:04:05.310> I'm<00:04:05.460> such<00:04:05.640> an

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
difficult for me but because I'm such an

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
active person I couldn't do too much

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.610 
active person I couldn't do too much
then<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:08.940> was<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> good<00:04:09.540> month<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.989> radiation

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
then it was a good month of radiation

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.310 
then it was a good month of radiation
and<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:12.209> can<00:04:12.390> imagine<00:04:12.480> your<00:04:13.050> your<00:04:13.410> skin<00:04:13.739> being

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.630 
and you can imagine your your skin being
burnt<00:04:16.820> beyond<00:04:17.820> recognition<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:19.520> we<00:04:20.520> were

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
burnt beyond recognition and we were

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.850 
burnt beyond recognition and we were
with<00:04:20.790> a<00:04:20.910> little<00:04:21.120> bit<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.270> cream<00:04:21.630> after<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.440> you

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
with a little bit of cream after and you

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.560 
with a little bit of cream after and you
would<00:04:23.010> heal<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.550> then<00:04:23.669> you'd<00:04:23.940> be<00:04:24.300> hit<00:04:24.450> again

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
would heal and then you'd be hit again

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.020 
would heal and then you'd be hit again
with<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.200> next<00:04:25.350> day<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.550> every<00:04:26.880> day
