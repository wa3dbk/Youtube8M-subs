00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
fun having people rooting for you than

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
fun having people rooting for you than
rooting<00:01:43.170> against<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.070> had<00:01:44.250> plenty

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
rooting against you and they had plenty

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.770 
rooting against you and they had plenty
to<00:01:44.820> root<00:01:45.030> for

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.780 

ten<00:01:48.780> years<00:01:49.080> after<00:01:49.140> his<00:01:49.560> big<00:01:49.920> win<00:01:50.160> in<00:01:50.340> Akron

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
ten years after his big win in Akron

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
ten years after his big win in Akron
Marshall<00:01:51.360> won<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> tournament<00:01:52.230> of<00:01:52.290> champions

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
Marshall won the tournament of champions

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.270 
Marshall won the tournament of champions
again<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.780> 1986<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.440> seemed<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.830> have<00:01:55.980> spent

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
again in 1986 and seemed to have spent

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.760 
again in 1986 and seemed to have spent
an<00:01:56.400> entire<00:01:56.790> decade<00:01:57.150> always<00:01:57.960> staying<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.500> step

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
an entire decade always staying one step

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.450 
an entire decade always staying one step
ahead<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.450> Marshall<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.260> ahead<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
ahead I think that Marshall was ahead of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.360 
ahead I think that Marshall was ahead of
his<00:02:02.640> time<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:03.060> terms<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.660> being<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.800> power

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
his time in terms of being a a power

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
I had such tremendous ball role but his
