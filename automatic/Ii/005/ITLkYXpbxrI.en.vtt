00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.709 
of 1 by 4 bricks so that was that was
very<00:02:01.219> interesting<00:02:02.219> there's<00:02:03.000> probably<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
very interesting there's probably a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.309 
very interesting there's probably a
solid<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.680> feet<00:02:04.979> row<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.430> 2<00:02:06.210> 4<00:02:06.540> 6<00:02:07.020> 8<00:02:07.350> 10<00:02:07.829> 11<00:02:08.489> oh

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
solid you feet row is 2 4 6 8 10 11 oh

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.790 
solid you feet row is 2 4 6 8 10 11 oh
crap<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.560> probably<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.550> good

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
crap that's probably a good

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.460 
crap that's probably a good
I'd<00:02:14.800> say<00:02:17.100> 400<00:02:18.270> probably<00:02:19.270> one<00:02:19.540> my<00:02:19.660> force<00:02:19.900> okay

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
I'd say 400 probably one my force okay

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.200 
I'd say 400 probably one my force okay
so<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.220> lot<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.400> orange<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.910> don't<00:02:22.120> know<00:02:22.180> I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
so just a lot of orange I don't know I

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.270 
so just a lot of orange I don't know I
thought<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.570> was<00:02:22.660> kind<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.840> cool<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:24.070> then

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
thought that was kind of cool and then

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.920 
thought that was kind of cool and then
there<00:02:24.820> were<00:02:25.030> some<00:02:25.270> bricks<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.600> had<00:02:25.750> left
