00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
first question then when would you use a

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.360 
first question then when would you use a
stiff<00:00:37.879> Rick<00:00:38.059> a<00:00:38.469> very<00:00:39.469> nice<00:00:39.620> question<00:00:40.100> from<00:00:40.250> a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
stiff Rick a very nice question from a

stiff Rick a very nice question from a
because<00:00:40.609> i<00:00:40.670> don't<00:00:40.940> use<00:00:41.120> stiff<00:00:41.420> links<00:00:41.719> very

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
because i don't use stiff links very

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.819 
because i don't use stiff links very
often<00:00:42.320> i<00:00:42.440> do<00:00:42.500> use<00:00:42.800> combi<00:00:43.190> links<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.519> lot<00:00:44.829> it's

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
often i do use combi links a lot it's

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.590 
often i do use combi links a lot it's
strange<00:00:46.100> on<00:00:46.399> this<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:46.729> many<00:00:46.909> people<00:00:47.269> do<00:00:47.390> well

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.550 
to use a little bit of combination that
i<00:02:48.940> use<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> stiff<00:02:49.480> part<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.960> cut<00:02:50.200> down<00:02:50.290> on<00:02:50.350> the

i use a stiff part to cut down on the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
more naturally do you think the braid
