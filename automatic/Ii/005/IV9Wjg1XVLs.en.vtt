it in this in this glass cup and it's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
it in this in this glass cup and it's
not<00:01:19.710> because<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> can't<00:01:20.270> deal<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> color

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720

it's actually because it sticks to the
glass<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.509> becomes<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:27.960> very<00:01:28.770> difficult
