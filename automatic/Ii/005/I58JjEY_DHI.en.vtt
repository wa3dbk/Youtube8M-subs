00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to all so today I 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.940
 find to finally offer my cake 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.589
 resigns marriage since very 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.940
 recently I attended a wedding so 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.559
 I shot you a little video 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.090
 I really hope it will please you and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.670
 I propose you to switch right away 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.289
 at the preparation part then for 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.760
 start on the body coming out of the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.710
 shower I of course apply my body 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.910
 blow in the vanilla shadow lift 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.529
 and from laura mercier 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.330
 if you follow my blog you know that 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.279
 I am completely obsessed with this 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.539
 range right now so I'll you 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.920
 leave the article in info bar if 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.750
 you never want to know a little more 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.880
 before particular events I like 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.980
 well applied masks very effective 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.020
 that works almost instantly and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850
 for marriage I opted for glam 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.960
 glow in the super fashion version so 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.820
 it's the white version 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.170
 it's gone for makeup then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.570
 obviously I start by applying a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 foundation for the wedding and the and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.050
 the future for art in ice gliders 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.270
 so it's the day before 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.559
 it's a base that you go very 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.789
 hard to find in France I you 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.579
 will still allow time in bar 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.170
 information to pass on sites that the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.520
 propose this base I find it 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.629
 also miraculous because she 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.489
 leaves on the skin an aspect 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.760
 completely velvety skin look 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.500
 baby 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 so for the foundation maj opted 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.189
 for the hd format of make up for ever 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.170
 that I mixed with the clim stroke of 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.970
 mac then at make up for ever actually 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 I am located a little between two shades 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.600
 so it's a bit boring I mix 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 the 107 waiting to reach is that a 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.170
 big get really stack the good 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.299
 hue for my skin tone 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.439
 i love to mix the premium of mc that 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.640
 I introduced you to one of my 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.110
 latest favorite videos while 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 just because it gives the bottom of 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.650
 dyes a completely bright aspect 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.780
 allows to work better and I find 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.400
 that it changes and the skin dries my skin has 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.020
 less likely to dehydrate during 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.700
 of day 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.039
 so then I apply the prologue 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.420
 anti their mac at the dark circles 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.109
 little redness really for 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.109
 perfect the complexion 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.560
 and ample gesture produced with the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.600
 experience close to rice technics 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.920
 so for girls 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.630
 all the work of thyme I apply the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.130
 powder razorsharks urban ticket 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.659
 unfortunately this powder has been 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.920
 discontinue to my greatest misfortune 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.390
 because I almost finished them 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.740
 by the way if you know of udders 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.570
 I'm interested so do not hesitate to 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.790
 leave in info bar 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.170
 for the eyebrows nothing amazing I 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.580
 do as usual you must have seen 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.619
 this step 25 million times 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.270
 now I use the raw cua de make 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.720
 up for ever being 25 with a 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.720
 beveled brush 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.890
 then I put a bottle in my 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.220
 eyebrows to get a more result 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.710
 Turrell 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.240
 and finally I apply the fixer gel for 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.800
 the eyebrows of laurent Mercier that 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.110
 I find it extraordinary because he 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.890
 leave no lumps of finished tights 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.890
 or anything 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.160
 it's gone 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.360
 eyes then you will see added 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.670
 for a make-up anyway natural 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.080
 but very bright so in the hollow 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.540
 I applied the eyeshadow tease 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.540
 from the pallet urban decay liquid 2 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.160
 I really worked at 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.750
 level of the hollow at the corner 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.550
 external but quite natural 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.940
 with a brush fades hour enough 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.940
 provided 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.739
 then I used a pigment actually 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.209
 from at make up store then you can 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.500
 get the make up store products 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.700
 will leave you a binder info bar if 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.620
 it really interests you but this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.870
 pigment is so crazy that for 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.080
 weddings it's just the ideal chili 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.080
 so it's lines is sloping pimkie 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.810
 I apply it with a small brush 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.810
 precise at the level of my eyelid 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.050
 to enlarge the look I also 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.310
 applied this 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.430
 pigments at the level of the eyelashes 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.430
 lower 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.260
 and for the inner corner no surprises 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.240
 but really no surprises 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.580
 I will apply the diamond touch lighthouse 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.209
 and iphone cover so with a small 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.209
 precise brush 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.670
 it's really strong 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.670
 do not prefer 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.290
 so to avoid keeping you 45 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.909
 minutes I applied my eyeliner I 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.439
 already know a video about it 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.269
 so I'll leave her talking 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.099
 if you ever want to see that and I have 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.060
 also applied mascara so 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.220
 now we will go to make-up 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.039
 worship 1 for the account or ring I 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.320
 used my favorite product right now 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.009
 it's the multiple of nazes in hues 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.199
 Altai 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.669
 so it's a multiple maths so I 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.990
 have you detailed the whole process on 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.550
 the blog if you want to know a little 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.229
 more but it's extremely simple 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.300
 of use and rendering is 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.669
 extraordinary so what I do is 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.169
 that I draw a line on the bone 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.509
 which passes in the center of my cheeks you 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.250
 know where we're drawing the touring tale and 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.080
 then with a brush provided he 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.310
 seems like it's the 109.2 brush at 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.289
 heiva but I would add a small 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.280
 gesture annotation we can everything and you 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.169
 see that the result is 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.780
 completely crazy completely diffuse 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.639
 hyper natural and frankly we can not 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.169
 not guess that you had to contouring 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.210
 so much the result is natural 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.060
 then for the blush I opted for a 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.380
 favorite medoc of the moment because that's 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.090
 a bluff that goes with everything finally 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.560
 it's the clinics ginger pop you 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.889
 know the little blocks in the form of 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.889
 flower 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:12.909
 I apply them with the blue brush 

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:12.909
 contours of chénéville cosmetics 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.409
 and finally highlighter I opted for the 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.580
 offense of nazes that are in my 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.810
 pallet guy bourdin but that is 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.580
 also emerged in another 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.039
 pallet so if I find it where the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.330
 stressful info bar 7 highlighter 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.729
 is just magic 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.680
 it gives infinite skin tinged with 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.720
 doll and I love it 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.860
 for the lips I did not want to bother 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.150
 with a lipstick that I was going 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.289
 having to replicate every time 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.740
 I was going to drink something you eat 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.840
 Something 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.930
 so I opted for a gloss that's the 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.729
 ping 513 from armani I wore them 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.380
 in a lot of my videos these 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.729
 lately you have been 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.360
 many to ask me what I wore 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.800
 on the lips 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.630
 whenever I have infinite bright 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.949
 lips a little more pulpy than 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.600
 usually but at the same time some 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.380
 very natural thing that really gives 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.830
 pretty lips 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.870
 it was this grace he is awesome because 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.800
 that they do not stick it holds well it is 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.800
 wonderful 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.600
 so for the hairstyle nothing very 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.340
 complicated I decided to make some 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.960
 loops simply because it's 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.919
 effective and it's a bit small 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.570
 princess hairstyle 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.830
 I had you chimay a video the year 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.850

 black wedges but which are 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.659

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.060
 and graphic on the foot while staying 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:58.490
 and loses gangs 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.439
 then I found my dress on the site 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.050
 of asos so again there will be a 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.520
 link info bar it's a dress that I 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.719
 really is very very pretty because 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.759
 whether it is at the level of the chest 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:11.240
 under the chest or even at the level of 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:13.729
 drape that falls everything is super lightweight 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.960
 hyper feminine and at the same time I do not 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.090
 do not know alain aspect a little bit 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.469
 modern and elegant and finally knowing 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.849
 that we were not in the middle of summer 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:21.500
 might have said before a little 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:23.120
 little wind et cetera I preferred to opt 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.479
 for a vest especially for the end of the 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.310
 evening 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.379
 so I found a cap vest on 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.430
 Asos of black color I did not opt 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.810
 for another color because when 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.400
 we have skull in her dress it's very 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.349
 difficult to find exactly the same 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.029
 cream if we come across a color a little 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:37.129
 more pink have a little more belgian it can 

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:38.719
 to be atrocious so I preferred to opt for 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:40.520
 black to remind the shoes and 

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:42.080
 some small stones that were at 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.430
 level of dress ornaments 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.110
 I hope from the bottom of my heart that this 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.279
 video will have pleased you because I have to 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.029
 to confess that I have a little trouble 

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:48.500
 with the assembly 

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:50.210
 in any case I make you lots of kisses 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.690
 and I hope I can find you very 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.529
 soon 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.529
 bye
