00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.430 
longest layer which is 18 is more
straight<00:00:59.420> because<00:00:59.900> this<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.260> natural

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
straight because this is natural

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.759 
straight because this is natural
straight<00:01:00.860> so<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.909> 18<00:01:02.299> is<00:01:02.479> straighter<00:01:02.869> doesn't
