this but I don't see a lot of detail as
to<00:00:52.020> how<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> easier<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:52.890> yourself<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
to how to make it easier on yourself to

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.569 
to how to make it easier on yourself to
defeat<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> toko<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> capture<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> toka<00:00:56.399> or

tame<00:00:58.500> otoko<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> guess<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.969> main

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
tame otoko so I guess that is the main

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.540 
tame otoko so I guess that is the main
focus<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.109> video<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.160> guess<00:01:02.340> more

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
focus of this video and I guess more

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.759 
focus of this video and I guess more
specifically<00:01:03.229> those<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.619> just

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
specifically those that are just

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
specifically those that are just
arriving<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> island<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.090> low<00:01:06.390> level

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
arriving at the island a very low level

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.039 
arriving at the island a very low level
but<00:01:07.159> anyways<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.850> urge<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.720> soon

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
but anyways I know the urge is as soon

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.260 
but anyways I know the urge is as soon
as<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.650> ship<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.820> rush<00:01:12.030> this

reason<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.150> twofold<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
reason for that is really twofold one it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.230 
reason for that is really twofold one it
has<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> large<00:01:28.439> area<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> effect<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.640> -<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> does

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
a good amount of damage and the reason

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.069

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.999 
able to tame it or whatever so bubble
bath<00:01:56.579> kind<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.969> alleviates<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:58.170> its<00:01:58.409> it

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
bath kind of alleviates that with its it

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
bath kind of alleviates that with its it
has<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> fan-like<00:01:59.520> pattern<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.540> said

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
has a fan-like pattern and like I said

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.910 
has a fan-like pattern and like I said
it<00:02:00.840> does<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.200> damage<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it does a lot of damage so that

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280 
it does a lot of damage so that
alleviates<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.610> problem<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.119> secondly<00:02:04.020> if

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
alleviates that problem and secondly if

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.319 
alleviates that problem and secondly if
you<00:02:04.590> decide<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:04.979> rush<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.640> island<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.090> soon<00:02:06.240> as

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
you decide to rush the island as soon as

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
show up on the world map and then I go

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.449 
show up on the world map and then I go
and<00:02:26.879> attack<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.359> and<00:02:27.510> then<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.680> use<00:02:28.980> bubble<00:02:29.310> bath

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459

and I either tame it or I defeat it and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.429 
and I either tame it or I defeat it and
then<00:02:32.939> you'll<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.180> you'll<00:02:33.629> obviously<00:02:33.720> be<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> lot

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
then you'll be you'll obviously be a lot

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.349 
then you'll be you'll obviously be a lot
higher<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.400> save<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.939> you<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:36.030> keep

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
higher you can save and you can keep

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.849 
higher you can save and you can keep
doing<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:36.720> over<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.139> over<00:02:37.200> again<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.769> so

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
doing that over and over again and so

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.589 
doing that over and over again and so
you'll<00:02:38.010> level<00:02:38.189> up<00:02:38.400> high<00:02:38.579> enough<00:02:38.879> where<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
you'll level up high enough where you

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.390 
you'll level up high enough where you
can<00:02:39.720> fight<00:02:40.079> every<00:02:40.439> mob<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.859> the<00:02:40.980> island<00:02:41.370> that

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
can fight every mob on the island that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.920 
can fight every mob on the island that
you<00:02:41.579> won't<00:02:41.760> need<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:41.939> worry<00:02:42.209> about<00:02:42.269> reloading

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
you won't need to worry about reloading

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.020 
you won't need to worry about reloading
your<00:02:42.989> saves<00:02:43.290> all<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.530> time<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.040> then<00:02:44.639> that'll

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
your saves all the time and then that'll

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.059 
your saves all the time and then that'll
alleviate<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.480> problem<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.319> then<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:46.920> can

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
alleviate that problem and then you can

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.740 
alleviate that problem and then you can
just<00:02:47.250> keep<00:02:47.370> fighting<00:02:47.609> tacos<00:02:48.150> whenever<00:02:48.599> you

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
just keep fighting tacos whenever you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.050 
just keep fighting tacos whenever you
get<00:02:48.959> low<00:02:49.530> level<00:02:49.889> familiars<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.669> you<00:02:50.819> want<00:02:51.000> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
get low level familiars that you want to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.119 
get low level familiars that you want to
level<00:02:51.209> up<00:02:51.329> quickly<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.989> that's<00:02:52.500> essentially

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
level up quickly and that's essentially

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.390 
level up quickly and that's essentially
that<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:54.329> guys<00:02:55.049> are<00:02:55.169> gonna<00:02:55.260> hate<00:02:55.530> me<00:02:55.769> but<00:02:55.799> I
