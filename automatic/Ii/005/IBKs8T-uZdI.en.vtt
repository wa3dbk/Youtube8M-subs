00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 it's everyone I hope you 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.110
 go well today I make you a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.270
 video that was asked me full full 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.340
 full full full full of times and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.900
 I am actually a lot of people 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.969
 would be a hairstyle that can be for 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.740
 sport for the beach or for the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.360
 wholesale pool is a hairstyle where 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.240
 you do not need to do your 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.770
 hair at all but you have when 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.449
 even a tiny twist is enough 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
 simple I do it on purpose it's very very 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.170
 easy to do because I imagine that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 when we are a sport we do not want 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.920
 to do my hair for my honor necessarily 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.230
 we want it to be rather simple 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.450
 so that's all stupid but I think 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.079
 it can go pretty much to all 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.210
 hair types 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.710
 I hope in any case if you do it 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 at home and you have a star g 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.260
 do not hesitate to carve me you put 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.820
 marion blutch in the comments and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.559
 like that I see what you did 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 and I can tell you bravo it's too much 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.950
 beautiful we will leave immediately 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.950
 a picture of the result 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.210
 so I start by making a tail of 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.899
 horse very high if you want it 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.260
 be perfect 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.949
 you take a brush of course 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 me is the holidays 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.290
 so no brush and to be sure 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.670
 not to be bothered by the whole 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.070
 day I'm going to tie it up with a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 silicone elastic if you have 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.149
 not or if you like to go to obviously 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.380
 you put a normal elastic I 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.450
 am not a fan because to remove them 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.220
 it does not hurt but if I want to be 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
 sure my hairstyle hold all the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.299
 same day a ponytail 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.220
 I put that and I know it's not okay 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.380
 move second step split in two 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.670
 or if you are misled separately 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.590
 three years four years five what you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.869
 want and there with each party I will 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.670
 do a braid so if you separate 4 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.080
 you do 4s it is separated into two 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.459
 you do braids and I'm going 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.690
 try checker juice that both 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.360
 parts are the same length where he 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.679
 on apples and there is a braid all 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.569
 the time there is no pre-school there 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.549
 there is nothing technical 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.549
 fastoche of the address 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.700
 you're chopped up with a little rubber band 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.700
 and we do the same with treated water 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.340
 so that can be a hairstyle too 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.710
 not with both but if you actually 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.240
 than a genre if you line up 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.380
 horse and a truce me I find that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.940
 can not be bad when I play sports 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.040
 on the other hand I do not really like having the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.090
 hair that is kind of engage it all 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.650
 we had hot who type it is not very 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.940
 nice warm so I prefer to do 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.349
 something raised but it can be a 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.480
 another option now that I loved 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.330
 distress I will come gently to them 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.519
 lay them around each other in 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.140
 Let's actually do a little bun 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.989
 tac the tips that are not very pretty 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.260
 we're going to the wrestlers below 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:40.480
 and down and once you have that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.700
 hello there we fix everything with 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.590
 bun tweezers like that if you have 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.880
 very fine hair you maybe that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.880
 it will hold with tongs like that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.069
 very simple so painted her buns I 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.519
 shows you how it set the 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.880
 feet of the bar to slide them 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.959
 in the row that is the lowest and you 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.930
 do not take a lot of hair 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.670
 then you poke the skull and once 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.760
 that you are the perpendicular of the 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.299
 skull you stay stung feet and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.560
 you slip see the head of the bank 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.120
 business that badly if we do several 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.630
 so once only be once but the 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.150
 head of the epfr 90 ° and then you 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.530
 push tac I do the same I you 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.380
 shows my feet well I take my 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:32.829
 hair down I prick the skulls 90 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.850
 degrees I sink and a third in 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.530
 three months I still have small 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.269
 hair like that who are hyper sucks 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.280
 so either if I really want to be 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:45.609
 quiet I take small tongs 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:49.200
 flat and I attach either I leave kind 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.730
 it's natural even fate 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.600
 baby hair like andy bell 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.100
 billere if you want to help hold 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.560
 also you can put some gel 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.700
 or a little wax on it there is not 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.410
 of miracle solution but I never 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.980
 found the thing that they hope for everything 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.120
 hold and there we can say good there is 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.290
 a funny shape and you see the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.540
 technique what are you arranging for 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.030
 surely pinturault and there we can say 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.519
 that I am quiet for I had it 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.190
 did to my niece our day was held 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.260
 three days and she these donuts slept 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.180
 on it and so do not worry 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.430
 not normally you are quiet if 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.530
 you have it fixed it should be great 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.970
 hold well and so that's the first 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.010
 version but we can also do a 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.140
 version in pancake years and doing a 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.490
 much more 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.560
 suddenly it will be much larger 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.860
 it will be less severe however 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.060
 may not be as good and there is 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.830
 chances actually that it fits but 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.090
 that it's messy so if you like 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.520
 well, I'll show you if you 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.440
 do not like you stay with this 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.979
 technical and that I sweat a little low 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.140
 you are really his degree so I had 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.659
 just pin facts and I have them 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.150
 braids and so banking consists of 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:02.650
 man pulled up side up 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.390
 every drop of wicks you hold 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:10.020
 the elastic up and you pull the side of 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.979
 the wick up 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.610
 more or less depending on the facts you 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:18.060
 I want to do a little bit higher 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.060
 yes a little better 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.200
 and so once we have these two traits 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.950
 stan keke by the same thing I do 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.950
 exactly the same thing 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.140
 and that was a bit less pull 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.520
 like that even if it's not very very 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.380
 different I hope you like it 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.280
 tutelle who asked me sports pool 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.690
 sea ​​etc 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.160
 I do big kisses I hope it 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.000
 okay and you take good care of yourself 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.000
 I kiss you
