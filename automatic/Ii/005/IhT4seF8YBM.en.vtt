it<00:02:02.700> does<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.060> bit<00:02:03.119> boring<00:02:03.689> after<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> while

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
it does get a bit boring after a while

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.959 
it does get a bit boring after a while
but<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.950> defense<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.460> should<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.820> must

but my defense here should have must

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.880 
but my defense here should have must
have<00:02:06.090> been<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> bit<00:02:06.570> bare<00:02:06.780> couldn't<00:02:07.530> most<00:02:07.680> reach

have been a bit bare couldn't most reach

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
have been a bit bare couldn't most reach
idea<00:02:08.220> clearer<00:02:08.520> instead<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.300> standing

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
idea clearer instead of a just standing

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.720 
idea clearer instead of a just standing
often<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.140> hey<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.830> win<00:02:11.009> 3-1<00:02:11.310> at<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> end<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
often but hey do win 3-1 at the end of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.380 
often but hey do win 3-1 at the end of
the<00:02:11.819> day<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> forgot<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.599> actually<00:02:12.989> recall

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the day I forgot to actually recall

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.750 
the day I forgot to actually recall
the<00:02:13.510> person<00:02:13.900> had<00:02:14.020> gotten<00:02:14.460> man<00:02:15.460> in<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.640> match

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
the person had gotten man in the match

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.640 
the person had gotten man in the match
which<00:02:16.000> was<00:02:16.030> actually<00:02:16.390> Adrian<00:02:17.080> somehow<00:02:17.620> I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
which was actually Adrian somehow I

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.250 
which was actually Adrian somehow I
don't<00:02:17.860> know<00:02:18.069> how<00:02:18.280> he<00:02:19.060> didn't<00:02:19.930> actually<00:02:20.050> do

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
don't know how he didn't actually do

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.080 
don't know how he didn't actually do
anything<00:02:20.440> against<00:02:20.740> me<00:02:20.830> but<00:02:21.100> nor<00:02:21.550> dare<00:02:21.880> other

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
anything against me but nor dare other

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.370 
anything against me but nor dare other
players<00:02:22.360> apart<00:02:22.630> from<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.810> one<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:22.959> scored

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
players apart from the one that scored

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.260 
players apart from the one that scored
so<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.010> guess<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.400> might<00:02:24.580> be<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.850> reason<00:02:25.150> he

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
so I guess I might be in the reason he

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.960 
so I guess I might be in the reason he
did<00:02:25.450> get<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.750> but<00:02:26.110> hey<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:27.370> he<00:02:27.550> only<00:02:27.640> comes<00:02:27.880> from

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
did get it but hey so he only comes from

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.380 
did get it but hey so he only comes from

not that much to me on TV and with seven
contract<00:02:34.990> he<00:02:35.140> could<00:02:35.170> last<00:02:35.650> me<00:02:35.860> quite<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.070> few

actually used him but as you see here
his<00:02:41.440> stats<00:02:41.709> aren't<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.250> best<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.640> must<00:02:42.850> admit

his shooting of 69 is not like top class
but<00:02:46.900> at<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.230> end<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.560> day<00:02:47.739> it's<00:02:48.070> if<00:02:48.520> they

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
but at the end of the day it's if they

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.449 
but at the end of the day it's if they
can<00:02:49.300> perform<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:50.050> me<00:02:50.200> then<00:02:50.739> I'm<00:02:50.890> I'll<00:02:51.250> be

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.670 
happy enough but like 83 pace 69
shooting<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.480> not<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.720> good<00:02:55.959> dribbling<00:02:56.530> of

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
shooting it's not that good dribbling of

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.699 
shooting it's not that good dribbling of
83<00:02:57.190> had<00:02:57.430> known<00:02:57.670> for<00:02:57.850> 71<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.660> don't<00:02:59.080> think<00:02:59.500> he's

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
83 had known for 71 I don't think he's

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.410 
83 had known for 71 I don't think he's
that<00:02:59.920> tall<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.519> heading<00:03:00.850> isn't<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.300> come

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
that tall so heading isn't going to come

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.660 
that tall so heading isn't going to come
into<00:03:01.570> play<00:03:02.019> with<00:03:02.440> him<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.800> much<00:03:03.010> but<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
into play with him that much but the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.490 
into play with him that much but the
dribbling<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.090> 83<00:03:04.570> could<00:03:04.840> most<00:03:05.050> be<00:03:05.200> helped<00:03:05.380> me

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
dribbling of 83 could most be helped me

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.600 
dribbling of 83 could most be helped me
out<00:03:05.530> especially<00:03:05.769> if<00:03:06.070> it's<00:03:06.220> your<00:03:06.250> skill

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
out especially if it's your skill

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.360 
out especially if it's your skill
dribbling<00:03:07.000> kind<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.420> trait<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:07.870> yeah<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:08.739> can't

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
dribbling kind of trait so yeah I can't

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.100 
dribbling kind of trait so yeah I can't
wait<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.519> actually<00:03:09.670> use<00:03:10.030> him<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.360> show<00:03:11.050> you

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
kind of this next game some reason I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.400 
kind of this next game some reason I
take<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.209> bit<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.420> time<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.750> actually<00:03:13.900> put<00:03:14.320> him

the<00:03:22.239> best<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.720> kind<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.200> chemistry<00:03:23.650> but<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.940> will

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
the best of kind of chemistry but I will

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.150 
the best of kind of chemistry but I will
actually<00:03:25.660> improve<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:26.140> as<00:03:26.290> time<00:03:26.590> goes<00:03:26.799> on<00:03:26.980> as

which is 1.8 22 k so obviously quite a
bit<00:03:49.600> money<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:50.049> for<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.260> fitness<00:03:50.440> card<00:03:50.820> so
