00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.660

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.240
 so I'm going to insert the disk 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.280

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.280

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.850

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.200

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.200
 i3 core processor 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.870
 that has two separate processors with 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.870
 four cores 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.150
 will run 3.3 gigabytes with 8 gigs of ram 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.469
 a video card 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.469

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.240
