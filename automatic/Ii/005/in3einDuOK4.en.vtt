wood filler and then we're going to
repaint<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.850> distinct<00:02:00.149> colors<00:02:01.310> but<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:04.700> clamp

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
repaint at distinct colors but I clamp

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.190 
repaint at distinct colors but I clamp

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
your work down so it doesn't move around
