00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:18.000
 back in the semifinals something that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:26.410
 honestly very important 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.869
 but frame very nice with one 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.809
 difference between the two seasons 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.510
 our and their real the results 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.820
 that the three of them seem very tangible 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:48.850
 to the seven layers in my opinion in the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.469
 respective expectations we have been 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.329
 intoxicated which I mentioned before 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:58.059
 danteschi mica is not an invention is 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.770
 just what we lived in 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.699
 we intoxicated the expectations there 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.979
 we are put we have gone through moments 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.149
 difficult situations objectively 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.720
 difficult they instead have as one 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.720
 linear growth 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.780
 they did another 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.380
 season without pressure because we say 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.840
 which was the least year they expected a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 invested less in a year zero because 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.640
 we didn't know that with a team and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.840
 so they lived a year without 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:42.980
 pressures not doing well well we 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.520
 for dna of the cantÃ¹ basketball 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.520
 this will never change 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.860
 let 's see what kind of expectation is around 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.350
 and it is right for them to be so in my opinion 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.600
 is the big difference is that during the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.880
 regular season 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.520
 they really enjoyed it and did 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.969
 very well 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.060
 in the team that is indigestible we have 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.819
 a pair worse than 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.040
 that did n't come 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.879
 a team that beat us twice 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.600
 out of three who walked on the face in 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.770
 Italian cup 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.130
 precisely then that this entails I 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.230
 then they touched lightly 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.760
 achieving and in my humble opinion 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.760
 deserved result is excellent 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.670
 but now what happens 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.490
 they pass a little regional 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.260
 we can see the newcomers 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.640
 are not things with Sassari has created a 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:01.940
 earthquake of crazy dates because 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:03.590
 probably herd doing things e 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.880
 astrology had not foreseen this 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.950
 so you not at your eyes have a 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.540
 writing a way the desk jumped 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:18.680
 completely this we will ask account to 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.780
 program and now they some people 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.150
 they have it that we are seven 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.660
 dragged on the muzzle in the MBP of 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.709
 cc right player championship 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.200
 extraordinary 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.019
 in my humble opinion without removing 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.640
 nothing to those who won the ex award 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.670
 profits of the year 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.650
 Alberani did an exceptional job 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.310
 now what happens that they play one 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.030
 playoff series at home controlled by 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.270
 field I feel I see them very well 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.430
 advanced very well loaded and now it 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.000
 they must prove that they are worth what 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.000
 have done that now
