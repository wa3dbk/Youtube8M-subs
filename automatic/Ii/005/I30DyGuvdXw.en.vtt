hey guys it's a proof you ought to
continue<00:00:02.580> our<00:00:02.610> galaxy<00:00:03.000> note<00:00:03.149> coverage<00:00:03.510> today

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
continue our galaxy note coverage today

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.570 
continue our galaxy note coverage today
we'll<00:00:03.899> be<00:00:03.929> taking<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.350> look<00:00:04.380> at<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.890> stem<00:00:05.279> case

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
we'll be taking a look at the stem case

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.309 
we'll be taking a look at the stem case
which<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> faux<00:00:06.210> leather<00:00:06.450> case<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:07.140> it's

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
which is a faux leather case so it's

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.259 
which is a faux leather case so it's
kind<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.500> like<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.680> folio<00:00:08.099> style<00:00:08.370> case<00:00:08.639> has<00:00:09.240> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
kind of like a folio style case has a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.690 
kind of like a folio style case has a
hard<00:00:09.570> plastic<00:00:09.780> backing<00:00:10.349> with<00:00:11.010> leather<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.580> it

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
hard plastic backing with leather on it

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.370 
hard plastic backing with leather on it
and<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.000> front<00:00:12.240> has<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> leather<00:00:12.690> flap<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.230> it

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and the front has a leather flap on it

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.320 
and the front has a leather flap on it

so I wanted to mention something

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.939 
so I wanted to mention something
interesting<00:00:15.809> about<00:00:15.839> sgp<00:00:16.350> stake<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
interesting about sgp stake on the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.620 
interesting about sgp stake on the
galaxy<00:00:17.369> note<00:00:17.400> now<00:00:17.820> most<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.300> should<00:00:18.480> know

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
galaxy note now most of you should know

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.450 
galaxy note now most of you should know
by<00:00:18.660> now<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.770> goddess<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
SUVs actually made cases for those of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.169 
SUVs actually made cases for those of
you<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.039> want<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.279> use<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> phone<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
meant to use as a tablet so if we crack

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920 
meant to use as a tablet so if we crack
on<00:00:34.590> into<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.420> can<00:00:36.420> show<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> case

on into it I can show you the case

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
on into it I can show you the case
itself<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.860> actually<00:00:38.010> retails<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.610> forty

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
itself it actually retails for forty

know which is looks looks out of place

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
know which is looks looks out of place
it's<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.490> actual<00:01:08.700> sticker<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it's just that the actual sticker on the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
it's just that the actual sticker on the
inside<00:01:09.630> seems<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.200> melted<00:01:10.680> during

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
inside seems to have melted during

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
inside seems to have melted during
transit<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.510> all<00:01:12.720> crumbled<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
transit so it's just all crumbled up in

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
transit so it's just all crumbled up in
there<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.909> sticker<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.450> doesn't

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
there it's just a sticker so it doesn't

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.880 
there it's just a sticker so it doesn't
really<00:01:15.720> affect<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.170> case<00:01:16.350> itself<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
really affect the case itself as a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.260 
really affect the case itself as a
little<00:01:17.130> bit<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> bubbling<00:01:17.640> around<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.060> so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
little bit of bubbling around here so

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
little bit of bubbling around here so
just<00:01:18.479> looks<00:01:18.930> kind<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.200> bad<00:01:19.670> now<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> back

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
just looks kind of bad now in the back

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.200 
just looks kind of bad now in the back

little flap is held in by this right
here<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.700> something<00:01:27.360> interesting<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.990> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
here and something interesting is that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.780 
here and something interesting is that
this<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.439> has<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> stand<00:01:29.220> position<00:01:29.430> if

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
this actually has a stand position if

it at this about 85 degree angle which
is<00:04:21.359> good<00:04:21.539> for<00:04:21.570> viewing<00:04:22.020> movies<00:04:22.349> that's<00:04:22.620> pretty

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
is good for viewing movies that's pretty

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.500 
is good for viewing movies that's pretty
much<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.010> because<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:23.640> can<00:04:23.760> see<00:04:23.970> it's<00:04:24.450> very

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
much it because you can see it's very

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.800 
much it because you can see it's very
top-heavy<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.349> when<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:25.590> tap<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:25.830> it

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
top-heavy so when you tap on it

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.510 
top-heavy so when you tap on it
just<00:04:27.050> tend<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.320> shake<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.560> lot<00:04:27.889> so<00:04:28.160> I<00:04:28.190> wouldn't

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
just tend to shake a lot so I wouldn't

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.010 
just tend to shake a lot so I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:28.730> playing<00:04:29.090> games<00:04:29.389> on<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.750> just

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
recommend playing games on it just

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.230 
recommend playing games on it just
watching<00:04:30.230> a<00:04:30.470> movie<00:04:30.500> now<00:04:31.400> like<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.000> said<00:04:32.030> before

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
watching a movie now like I said before

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.090 
watching a movie now like I said before
this<00:04:32.540> is<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.720> pretty<00:04:32.960> sick<00:04:33.230> case<00:04:33.530> but<00:04:33.800> with<00:04:33.950> that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
this is a pretty sick case but with that

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.980 
this is a pretty sick case but with that
thickness<00:04:34.370> comes<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.150> lot<00:04:35.270> of<00:04:35.389> protection<00:04:35.510> so

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
thickness comes a lot of protection so

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.510 
thickness comes a lot of protection so
you'll<00:04:36.169> get<00:04:36.350> great<00:04:36.530> shock<00:04:36.889> absorption<00:04:37.250> from

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
you'll get great shock absorption from

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.860 
you'll get great shock absorption from
the<00:04:37.700> leather<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.180> then<00:04:38.570> a<00:04:38.630> hard

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
the leather and then a hard

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.240 
the leather and then a hard
polycarbonate<00:04:39.080> plastic<00:04:39.830> well<00:04:39.950> a<00:04:39.980> lot<00:04:40.220> of

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
polycarbonate plastic well a lot of

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.830 
polycarbonate plastic well a lot of
rigidity<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.790> also<00:04:41.270> some<00:04:41.480> more<00:04:41.600> shock

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
rigidity and also some more shock

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.629 
rigidity and also some more shock
absorption<00:04:42.230> so<00:04:42.740> for<00:04:43.190> those<00:04:43.250> of<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:43.580> want

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
absorption so for those of you that want

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.040 
absorption so for those of you that want
a<00:04:43.790> protective<00:04:44.210> case<00:04:44.360> for<00:04:44.419> your<00:04:44.660> device<00:04:44.840> is

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
a protective case for your device is

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.680 
a protective case for your device is
probably<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.680> way<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.830> go<00:04:45.950> now<00:04:46.669> it<00:04:46.790> is<00:04:46.850> $45

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
probably the way to go now it is $45

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.610 
probably the way to go now it is $45
which<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:47.930> little<00:04:48.080> bit<00:04:48.169> more<00:04:48.320> expensive

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
which is a little bit more expensive

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.590 
which is a little bit more expensive
than<00:04:48.889> other<00:04:49.040> cases<00:04:49.370> but<00:04:50.090> at<00:04:50.180> least<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.450> comes

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
than other cases but at least it comes

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.909 
than other cases but at least it comes
in<00:04:50.720> three<00:04:50.900> different<00:04:50.930> color<00:04:51.350> models<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:51.860> you

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
in three different color models and you

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.500 
in three different color models and you
know<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.160> your<00:04:52.280> device<00:04:52.460> is<00:04:52.520> protected<00:04:53.240> so

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
know that your device is protected so

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.990 
know that your device is protected so
you<00:04:53.960> can<00:04:54.110> pick<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.350> up<00:04:54.410> in<00:04:54.590> black<00:04:54.889> brown<00:04:55.730> which

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
you can pick it up in black brown which

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.879 
you can pick it up in black brown which
we<00:04:56.150> have<00:04:56.300> right<00:04:56.450> here<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.930> also<00:04:57.260> dark<00:04:57.560> green

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
we have right here and also dark green

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.740 
we have right here and also dark green
so<00:04:58.220> if<00:04:58.520> you're<00:04:58.700> interested<00:04:58.850> in<00:04:59.060> a<00:04:59.330> protective

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
so if you're interested in a protective

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.960 
so if you're interested in a protective
case<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.169> features<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.770> viewing<00:05:01.460> angle<00:05:01.790> then

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
case that features a viewing angle then

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.490 
case that features a viewing angle then
this<00:05:02.060> is<00:05:02.120> probably<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.450> way<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.750> but

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
this is probably the way to go but

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.780 
this is probably the way to go but
personally<00:05:03.950> I'm<00:05:04.040> not<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.160> huge<00:05:04.340> fan<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.610> these

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
personally I'm not a huge fan of these

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.310 
personally I'm not a huge fan of these
cases<00:05:05.030> because<00:05:05.479> they're<00:05:05.570> annoying<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:06.080> use

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
cases because they're annoying to use

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.770 
cases because they're annoying to use
and<00:05:06.620> they're<00:05:06.950> actually<00:05:07.190> pretty<00:05:07.310> bulky<00:05:07.610> so<00:05:08.120> any

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
and they're actually pretty bulky so any

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.300 
and they're actually pretty bulky so any
case<00:05:08.990> if<00:05:09.200> you<00:05:09.229> guys<00:05:09.410> like<00:05:09.620> this<00:05:09.770> case<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.220> do

a business style professional case

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.760 
a business style professional case
that's<00:05:13.820> well-built<00:05:14.270> but<00:05:15.050> for<00:05:15.350> other<00:05:15.500> users

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
that's well-built but for other users

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.290

that want any more minimalistic stock

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.090 
that want any more minimalistic stock
cases<00:05:17.720> probably<00:05:17.930> not<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.260> route<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.590> go<00:05:18.740> so

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
cases probably not the route to go so

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.650 
cases probably not the route to go so
