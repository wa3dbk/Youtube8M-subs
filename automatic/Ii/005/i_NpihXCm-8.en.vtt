00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
earlier the handiest we think is what

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.090 
earlier the handiest we think is what
we'll<00:02:17.540> do<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.780> we'll<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.050> pop<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.770> like<00:02:18.920> that

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
we'll do is we'll just pop it like that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.949 
we'll do is we'll just pop it like that
and<00:02:19.250> then<00:02:19.340> we<00:02:19.430> take<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.610> off<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.959> generates

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
and then we take it off it generates

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.710 
and then we take it off it generates
something<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.920> nice<00:02:22.310> shape<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.570> good
