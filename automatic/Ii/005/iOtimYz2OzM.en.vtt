00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.300
 1 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.150
 how was the contest that very 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.610
 we had good weather 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.490
 apparently the horses are not 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.050
 too poorly worn and we had 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.530
 personally only one horse to 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.350
 so be a little pk10 all is well 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.720
 this year little trouble to the networks 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.670
 probably the weather yes the weather 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.930
 was favorable and exhausted very good the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.489
 does it have more days before and 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.320
 series has surely relaxed a little 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.739
 more and my faith in the contest good 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.260
 ambience 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.440
 ah bah we our role is to protect 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.670
 the horses that is to say that we are there 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.970
 to guarantee their good health that they do not 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.339
 are not put in danger and so we 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.540
 check them before departure 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.240
 and at the end of the event 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.540
 and we have the power to stop them 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.220
 being tested to prevent them from 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.430
 end up with pathologies 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.440
 or severe with large lesions 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.040
 our role is solely protective 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.510
 for horses so evolution I have 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.890
 not really the numbers in mind for 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.520
 tell you if it's happening 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.680
 also develop yahia there is a core of 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.060
 base an activity that goes well we have 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.970
 had yesterday young unemployed we saw 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.780
 full of young horses in perfect condition 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:44.320
 very nice voice of young riders on 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.510
 see that it stays at least that 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.230
 keeps up properly and 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.060
 personally I think it's a 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.460
 activity that will have to be very much 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.240
 develop in the future since it is going 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.940
 well in the spirit of being in the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.210
 nature with animals while doing 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.909
 sporting practice and having 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.920
 sensations that are still 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.780
 stimulating and enjoyable because when 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.269
 galloping or when trotting in 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.629
 full nature in tortuous paths 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:20.400
 with varied terrain 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:23.819
 it's still an intense activity and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.819
 rewarding and 1 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.069
 I am a judge who has failed federation 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.409
 three-star international equestrian and 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.650
 so I'm just screaming on the 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.090
 first proof effect had a star that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.129
 happened today where there was 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.900
 about fifteen starters we managed 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.090
 also with all veterinarians 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.890
 the french ffe race at free speed 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.900
 so we had about thirty horses 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.810
 would actually act the one star this is the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.400
 first step of the endurance events 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.900
 I would say it's the beginning of 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.099
 endurance in reality every 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.269
 races that take place before 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.639
 it's a preparation race of 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.250
 horse education qualification there 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.750
 we are at the gate 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.810
 if I pass well there is for 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.060
 the international on 90 km we will be able 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.150
 then went on 120 and on 160
