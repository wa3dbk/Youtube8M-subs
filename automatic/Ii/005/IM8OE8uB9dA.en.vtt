00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 millions of defeated with the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.250

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.420
 tells us that the challenge has ended 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.210
 but that in particular we have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.460
 achieved the quantities for which then 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.740
 they have already given us in our awards that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.180

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.190
 continue with these guys first that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.410
 nothing I will read here what it says in 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.420
 the screen and such and remember that the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.940

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.210
 surprise attack is worth so are the 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.760
 results of the surprise attack challenge 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.850
 Remember the second week of the month of 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.400
 May and well they say more or less like that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.190

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.500

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.230
 premium and the ultra rare envelope now plays 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.580

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.920
 it looks more like a tongue twister than anything else 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.250
 and it's that I have a hard time 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.120
 pronounce he sees he came and if he 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.670
 demonstrated stage and he defeats you and yes 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.269

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.980

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.659
 so let's see how it is coming 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.549
 until today we are going to start the 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.849

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.269
 the right foot and that this is worth it 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.459
 please, well, guys, let's go there 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.079
 Let's see what brings this to me well 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.670
 Well, I'll tell you what is not the 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.000
 not much better day of my life 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.010
 because then we have here appearance of 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.859
 weapon for a model only be if I do not 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.409
 I'm wrong, it must be for him 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.860
 first be believe I think it's for 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.560
 throw normal is a blue camouflage 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.890
 that's what it's called and we have virtual 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.650
 for one of the engineers would be 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.480
 doubting if it's for the plumber or for 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.760
 some other but I'm going more to the plumber 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.830
 we have the virtual one here and we have 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.320
 here zombie latrine for 3 5 stars 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.490
 I omitted challenge a pirate map reedit by 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.620
 team for 2 use my vampire for 5 a 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.060
 auto revive by 2 and a zombie coat 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.400
 pardos go is not the best thing in the world 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.260
 but what will be more worth to me of 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.420
 here are the stars issue challenge of 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.330
 truth ok let's go for the second about 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.930
 I hope that here he goes back a bit 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.700
 the theme of the vital video because I do not know 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.810
 I feel good normally it is now 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.810
 feel disillusioned 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:11.860
 and layers of real eyes ok I think it's 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.230
 all this is of the aspects 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.190
 most unpleasant accessories forgiveness that 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:23.210
 I've seen it looks super weird not in 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.300
 definitively I would not use it looks bad I think 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.600
 me although we have here are that probes 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.669
 Spatial diamond and hat 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.990
 diamond hats ok 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.000
 I think that hat does go a long way 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.160
 good for carnivorous though these 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.289
 two is not the big deal and especially 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.850
 of this first one that no no no in 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.320
 definitive has not been anything to my liking 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.000
 but good guys remember that the 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.620
 objective of these videos is that you 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.479
 tell me here the bottom part that 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.220
 you have come to them in your envelopes 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.750
 they have done better than me, I think that 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.820
 anyone can do better than me and 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.860
 I'm really lucky that neither 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.510
 even I can believe it but good 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.940
 leave in the comments how they have gone 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.949
 to you regarding your envelopes if 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.600
 They have fared better if you have fared worse 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.070
 that was also leave me a 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.840
 comment is simply and simply 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.610

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.090

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.530

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.530
 in a future remember 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.150
 remember that I do not know what I was going to say 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.830
 but anyway here I say goodbye 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.260
