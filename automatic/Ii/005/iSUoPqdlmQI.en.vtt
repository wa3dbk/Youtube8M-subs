00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.200
 Hello dear angel friends welcome 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.289
 a sunny day I win the victory 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.360
 now for 23 hours and try 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.129
 desperate for a thick bar or one 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
 whirling on the hook has to get up 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.480
 not worked like it is in now 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.250
 Most of the time, many people go to sleep 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.410
 nonsensical but also meaningful things 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.400
 through the head and from a meaningful 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.739
 thing is this contribution we 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.170
 now best with an animal experiment 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 I would like to start today 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 Contribute to an animal experiment you 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.550
 also like to be able to adjust at home 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.620
 everything you need for one 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.170
 Dachshell kindly has become today 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.180
 as a sample then provided 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:15.750
 is still a sharp stop needed and 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:17.310
 a delicious piece sausage first 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 the proband gets his eyes 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.759
 connected so that he next 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.759
 does not see 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:33.799
 what happend to leave while 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.950
 waiting blindfolded today 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.929
 I will this piece so on the meadow 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.250
 place the wind the sausage 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.250
 smell to the dog bears 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.140
 I am now about 20 meters from 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.090
 dachshund away and will like this sausage 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.680
 said to place in the meadow 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.600
 but with the difference a piece of it 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.200
 on the ground 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.950
 and a piece of it increases on this 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 as I said the wind now carries the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.140
 smell the dachshund interested me 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:21.190
 actually only which piece of sausage the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.810
 dog first time fully dressed up 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:31.590
 made for the book with high-stretched 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.590
 Reward and now the box is looking for 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.710
 who actually sausages on the stick 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.710
 found fine 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.260
 experiment succeeded animal unharmed 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.120
 now actually turns to the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.120
 ask what do I want to say 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.770
 just like the aar , the dachshund keeps 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.470
 in his natural environment he in 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.360
 Ground level on both have an extreme 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.120
 good nose, of course, much better 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.850
 as and customer still has the dachshund 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.560
 First, the sausage increases above that 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.060
 discovered soil and there it is 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.160
 of course for us alone the question 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.930
 why do not we offer the kÃ¶lner 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.420
 simply a piece over the ground 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.090
 I have a few simple ones for that 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.980
 montage no matter if I'm with pose or with 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.260
 the reason lead directly on the ground angel 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.540
 I always pull small ones now 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.489
 buoyancy just before the hook on 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.420
 four times 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.980
 These then raise the bait and the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.870
 worm or bait fish or whatever 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.120
 hangs on the hook now depends on 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.730
 piece about a basic way I 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.739
 have set and since much 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.459
 more effective than directly on the ground 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.560
 lure fish 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.329
 because he is not in danger somewhere 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.250
 to disappear into plants the worm has 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.190
 no chance to bury yourself in the ground 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.200
 or somehow pressed under stones 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.780
 So the bait is right in 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.820
 Water gives a super lock trail in the water 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.979
 water abgraben there a little flow 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.320
 is and the fish can be mine 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.110
 opinion is much easier than finding 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.220
 I use buoyancy either 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.130
 these little styrofoam beads 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.400
 trout pond no matter whether the green 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.080
 red or yellow pink are under water in the 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.270
 is dark in all that no matter what 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.820
 color that have or would it be 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.470
 bit of natural market likes to take 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.169
 just a piece of what he means a 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.940
 postings on the canopy 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.979
 advantage here is I can show that 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.060
 to turn off quickly or as needed 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.830
 fix again 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.060
 here at this share the directly on 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.180
 there is a draw 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.460
 a bit of problems there you have to always 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.460
 tie the knot at the back 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.940
 And that's how it looks in the water 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.550
 From the buoyant body keeps the boom 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.110
 from the ground opposite here in the 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.510
 conventional assembly there is now 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.720
 Woven under the stone hides that 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.070
 Last stay posen montage or that 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.480
 The reason remains in the basic assembly 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.760
 The whole thing is prevented by the 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.640
 buoyant body pulled to the surface 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.500
 and the bait can be great here now 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.560
 lure effectively 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.450
 Give his big stuff to the water and 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.340
 the first big one passes by 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.480
 Do not swim past the cooler 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.530
 but will find it guaranteed 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.090
 and now I wish you a lot of fun 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.630
 while trying and catching sympathy 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.260
 gaal 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.260
