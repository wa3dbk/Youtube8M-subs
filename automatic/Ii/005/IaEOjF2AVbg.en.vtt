00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.890 
to a a really polished look it's not to
over-accessorize<00:04:37.460> its<00:04:37.819> having<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.360> key<00:04:38.599> piece

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
over-accessorize its having a key piece

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.379 
over-accessorize its having a key piece
like<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.139> key<00:04:39.469> bag<00:04:39.710> or<00:04:40.039> you<00:04:40.550> know<00:04:40.669> key<00:04:40.969> earrings

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
like a key bag or you know key earrings

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.719 
like a key bag or you know key earrings
or<00:04:41.689> you<00:04:41.990> know<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.379> statement<00:04:42.830> ring<00:04:43.250> but<00:04:43.280> not<00:04:43.610> to

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.189 
or you know a statement ring but not to
overdo<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.569> think<00:04:44.780> that's<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.050> most

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
overdo it I think that's the most

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.320 
overdo it I think that's the most
important<00:04:45.710> thing<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.949> to<00:04:46.039> find<00:04:46.219> a<00:04:46.400> combination

I<00:05:06.469> think<00:05:06.680> every<00:05:06.889> style<00:05:07.189> has<00:05:07.370> a<00:05:07.400> correct<00:05:07.909> way<00:05:08.479> to

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
I think every style has a correct way to

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.080 
I think every style has a correct way to
execute<00:05:09.229> it<00:05:09.349> and<00:05:09.469> if<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.770> can<00:05:10.310> execute<00:05:10.639> that

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
execute it and if you can execute that

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.899 
execute it and if you can execute that
look<00:05:11.949> specific<00:05:12.949> to<00:05:13.099> your<00:05:13.219> style<00:05:13.520> then<00:05:13.789> it

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
look specific to your style then it

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.600 
look specific to your style then it
that's<00:05:14.060> great

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.370 

well<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.640> think<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:18.000> fashion<00:05:18.690> represents

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
well I think that fashion represents

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.940 
well I think that fashion represents
well<00:05:20.420> everything<00:05:21.420> it<00:05:21.600> defines<00:05:22.020> an<00:05:22.260> era

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
well everything it defines an era

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.340 
well everything it defines an era
actually<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.940> you<00:05:24.270> know<00:05:24.390> the<00:05:24.600> clothing<00:05:25.110> the
