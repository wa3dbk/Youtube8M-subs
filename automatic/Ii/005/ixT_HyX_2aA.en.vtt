00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
suggests that at one point this was

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.729 
suggests that at one point this was
actually<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.820> plan<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.360> motor<00:00:54.570> mama<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
actually the plan for motor mama if you

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.119 
actually the plan for motor mama if you
look<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.809> like<00:00:57.809> enemy<00:00:58.230> swapper<00:00:58.649> program

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
look in the like enemy swapper program

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.950 
look in the like enemy swapper program
if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> run<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> enemy<00:01:00.059> swapper<00:01:00.510> there's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
if you run the enemy swapper there's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
if you run the enemy swapper there's
actually<00:01:01.379> elements<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.010> relate<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.789> raid

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
actually elements that relate to a raid

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.380 
actually elements that relate to a raid
fight<00:01:03.719> such<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.409> Mama's<00:01:05.250> raid<00:01:05.519> bikers<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.330> I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
fight such as Mama's raid bikers or I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
fight such as Mama's raid bikers or I
think<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:06.990> actually<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.470> Mama's<00:01:08.040> raid

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
think there's actually a Mama's raid

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.840 
think there's actually a Mama's raid
bike<00:01:08.610> too<00:01:09.030> however<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.200> swap<00:01:10.470> these

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
bike too however if you swap these

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.730 
bike too however if you swap these
elements<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:13.290> show<00:01:13.530> up

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
elements in they actually don't show up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.830 
elements in they actually don't show up
and<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.340> anything<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.570> kind<00:01:15.780> of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and don't do anything so that's kind of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960 
and don't do anything so that's kind of
a<00:01:15.930> shame<00:01:16.170> there<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.220> there's<00:01:17.460> other<00:01:17.640> other

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
a shame there but there's other other

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.210 
a shame there but there's other other
evidence<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> suggest<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.320> she<00:01:20.070> was

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
evidence to suggest that she was

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039 
evidence to suggest that she was
originally<00:01:20.820> planned<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> raid<00:01:21.600> boss<00:01:21.810> as

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
well just look at the entire scope of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
well just look at the entire scope of
this<00:01:24.869> entire<00:01:25.229> area<00:01:25.560> leading<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> her<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
this entire area leading up to her and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.929 
this entire area leading up to her and
then<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> overall<00:01:28.380> size<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> arena<00:01:29.610> as

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.539 
then the overall size of the arena as
well<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.229> mini<00:01:31.470> boss<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.009> seems<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
well for just a mini boss it seems a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.380 
well for just a mini boss it seems a
little<00:01:32.670> over<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.060> top

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
little over the top

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.810 
little over the top
especially<00:01:34.290> since<00:01:34.470> motor<00:01:34.740> mama<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.460> easy

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

the<00:01:42.270> first<00:01:42.509> execute<00:01:43.079> otherwise<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.799> would

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the first execute otherwise it would

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980 
the first execute otherwise it would
have<00:01:44.009> taken<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.369> her<00:01:44.490> bike<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:45.119> hit<00:01:45.360> but

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
have taken out her bike in one hit but

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.030 
have taken out her bike in one hit but
you'll<00:01:46.140> notice<00:01:46.439> something<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you'll notice something kind of

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880 
you'll notice something kind of
interesting<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:47.790> after<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.680> don't<00:01:49.680> go

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
interesting actually after I don't go

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550 
interesting actually after I don't go
ahead<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.460> kill<00:01:50.729> her<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.329> execute<00:01:51.899> but

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
ahead and kill her with this execute but

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830 
ahead and kill her with this execute but
you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.490> non<00:01:53.880> slag<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> execute

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you can see that one non slag to execute

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.810 
you can see that one non slag to execute
pushed<00:01:55.140> over<00:01:55.590> power<00:01:55.740> level<00:01:56.100> eight<00:01:56.280> motor<00:01:56.549> mama

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
pushed over power level eight motor mama

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.810 
pushed over power level eight motor mama
to<00:01:57.450> half<00:01:57.659> health<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:58.740> good<00:01:58.890> but

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to half health that's not very good but

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
to half health that's not very good but
you<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> she's<00:02:00.840> also<00:02:01.079> very

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
you can see that she's also very

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.649 
you can see that she's also very
susceptible<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.369> borer<00:02:02.759> she's<00:02:03.479> actually

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
susceptible to borer she's actually

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
susceptible to borer she's actually
supposed<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> second<00:02:05.070> stage<00:02:05.399> there

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
supposed to have a second stage there

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.119 
supposed to have a second stage there
where<00:02:06.210> she<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.659> without<00:02:07.229> her<00:02:07.500> bike<00:02:07.680> but<00:02:07.979> it's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
where she is without her bike but it's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.430 
where she is without her bike but it's
still<00:02:08.280> firing<00:02:08.729> rockets<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.200> Bohr

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
still firing rockets at you but Bohr

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.830 
still firing rockets at you but Bohr
took<00:02:10.709> care<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:12.000> perhaps<00:02:12.209> that's<00:02:12.599> one

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
took care of that so perhaps that's one

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.760 
took care of that so perhaps that's one
of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:12.989> reasons

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
of the reasons

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.580 
of the reasons
I they<00:02:14.220> actually<00:02:14.670> took<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.660> raid<00:02:15.930> portion<00:02:16.440> of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
I they actually took the raid portion of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.770 
I they actually took the raid portion of
motor<00:02:16.890> mama<00:02:17.160> out<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.730> game<00:02:17.940> or<00:02:18.270> removed

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
motor mama out of the game or removed

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.350 
motor mama out of the game or removed
that<00:02:19.080> raid<00:02:19.440> fight<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:20.070> do<00:02:20.790> think<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.300> were

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
that raid fight I do think they were

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.850 
that raid fight I do think they were
actually<00:02:21.720> supposed<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.050> be<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.380> raid<00:02:22.620> bosses

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
actually supposed to be to raid bosses

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.670 
actually supposed to be to raid bosses
in<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.400> DLC<00:02:23.670> though<00:02:24.180> by<00:02:24.660> repeat<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.320> motor

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
in this DLC though by repeat and motor

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.590 
in this DLC though by repeat and motor
mama<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.670> would<00:02:26.820> have<00:02:26.880> made<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.090> DLC<00:02:27.570> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
mama and it would have made the DLC a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.260 
mama and it would have made the DLC a
lot<00:02:27.900> better<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.440> me<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:28.980> there<00:02:29.550> was<00:02:29.760> actually

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
lot better for me if there was actually

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.300 
lot better for me if there was actually
a<00:02:30.330> second<00:02:30.720> raid<00:02:30.870> boss<00:02:31.080> because<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:31.920> kind<00:02:32.220> of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
a second raid boss because I kind of

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.400 
a second raid boss because I kind of
don't<00:02:32.460> like<00:02:32.520> pyro<00:02:32.910> Pete<00:02:33.180> he's<00:02:33.450> pretty<00:02:33.720> boring

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
don't like pyro Pete he's pretty boring

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.530 
don't like pyro Pete he's pretty boring
overall<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.310> wasn't<00:02:35.820> too<00:02:35.940> big<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> fan<00:02:36.390> of

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
overall and I wasn't too big a fan of

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.140 
overall and I wasn't too big a fan of
the<00:02:36.660> rest<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:37.080> DLC<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:37.710> well<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.910> what<00:02:39.090> do

the rest of this DLC as well so what do
you<00:02:39.240> guys<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.140> why<00:02:41.040> why<00:02:41.430> exactly<00:02:41.700> do

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
you guys think do you why why exactly do

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.790 
you guys think do you why why exactly do
you<00:02:42.240> think<00:02:42.330> motor<00:02:42.780> mama<00:02:43.020> might<00:02:43.290> have<00:02:43.410> been<00:02:43.560> cut

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
you think motor mama might have been cut

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.070 
you think motor mama might have been cut
from<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.100> game<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> raid<00:02:44.790> boss<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.360> how

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
from the game as a raid boss and how

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.540 
from the game as a raid boss and how
does<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.260> make<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.620> feel<00:02:46.650> exactly<00:02:47.400> because

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
does that make you feel exactly because

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.730 
does that make you feel exactly because
for<00:02:48.210> me<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:48.450> kind<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.660> irritating<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.680> I

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
for me it's kind of irritating but I

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.810 
for me it's kind of irritating but I
know<00:02:49.860> there<00:02:50.130> are<00:02:50.220> other<00:02:50.340> people<00:02:50.670> out<00:02:50.760> there

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
know there are other people out there

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.270 
know there are other people out there
that<00:02:51.180> aren't<00:02:51.330> quite<00:02:51.960> as<00:02:52.230> into<00:02:52.500> raids<00:02:52.770> as<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.160> am

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
that aren't quite as into raids as I am

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.670 
that aren't quite as into raids as I am
so<00:02:53.520> does<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.790> make<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> difference<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.720> just

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
