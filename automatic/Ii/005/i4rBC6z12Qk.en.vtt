00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the arts community a kind of from the

50s to the 70s the pieces from the 1970s
and<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.460> I've<00:01:32.579> been<00:01:32.729> thinking<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
and so I've been thinking about a way to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.090 
and so I've been thinking about a way to
sort<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> cement<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.150> exhibition<00:01:36.659> in

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
sort of cement the exhibition in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
sort of cement the exhibition in
collaborative<00:01:38.100> work<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.299> were<00:01:39.479> artists<00:01:40.409> who

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
collaborative work that were artists who

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
collaborative work that were artists who
are<00:01:40.590> creating<00:01:40.890> generative<00:01:41.280> platforms<00:01:41.939> for

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
are creating generative platforms for

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.370 
are creating generative platforms for
other<00:01:42.780> artists<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.680> create<00:01:44.040> manifest<00:01:44.790> work<00:01:45.380> so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
other artists to create manifest work so

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.760 
other artists to create manifest work so
I<00:01:46.409> really<00:01:46.710> liked<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> idea<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.430> linking

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
I really liked the idea of linking

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
I really liked the idea of linking
emerging<00:01:49.770> artists<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.270> history<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.720> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350

place<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.450> try<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> encapsulate<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
place and really try to encapsulate the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:16.240 
place and really try to encapsulate the
spirit<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.219> De<00:01:57.000> Rosa
