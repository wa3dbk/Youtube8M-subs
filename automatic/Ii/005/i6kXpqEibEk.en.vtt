00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
it up close I left the forge finish on

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.939 
it up close I left the forge finish on
this<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.930> it's<00:00:54.930> pretty<00:00:55.140> close<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> first

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this and it's pretty close to the first

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
this and it's pretty close to the first
one<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.280> made<00:00:56.640> obviously<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.170> correct

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
one I made obviously it's it's correct

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
one I made obviously it's it's correct
and<00:00:58.800> cleaner<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.270> bit

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and cleaner it's just a little bit

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
and cleaner it's just a little bit
shorter<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.260> left<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.680> turn<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
shorter but I left the turn just the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.960 
shorter but I left the turn just the
same<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.409> it's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.589> very<00:01:05.519> nice<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.939> very

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
same and it's a very nice it's very

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
same and it's a very nice it's very
sharp<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.869> works<00:01:07.080> very<00:01:07.290> good<00:01:07.470> i<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:07.740> have

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
sharp it works very good i don't have

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.469 
sharp it works very good i don't have
the<00:01:08.130> lander<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.490> handle<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.390> of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the lander and handle on it kind of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
the lander and handle on it kind of
actually<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:09.990> pretty<00:01:10.290> annoying<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> took<00:01:11.400> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
actually is pretty annoying so I took it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.270 
actually is pretty annoying so I took it
off<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> fits<00:01:13.049> good<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> draws<00:01:13.860> nice

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
off but it fits good and it draws nice

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.510 
off but it fits good and it draws nice
and<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.290> gouges<00:01:16.799> quite<00:01:17.070> well<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and it's in it it gouges quite well and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.590 
and it's in it it gouges quite well and
I<00:01:18.180> left<00:01:18.420> mine<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.900> more<00:01:19.140> open<00:01:20.420> because<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
I left mine a little more open because I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.149 
I left mine a little more open because I
can<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.840> spoons<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.590> well<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
can do spoons with it as well but if I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.999 
can do spoons with it as well but if I
want<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.369> dig<00:01:23.580> bowls<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.210> can't<00:01:24.900> even<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.740> around

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
want to dig bowls I can't even go around

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.190 
want to dig bowls I can't even go around
an<00:01:26.159> axe<00:01:26.340> handle<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> shape<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.810> way<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
an axe handle and shape it that way if I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
an axe handle and shape it that way if I
have<00:01:28.320> our<00:01:28.470> make<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:29.850> more

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
have our make one so it's a little more

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.960 
have our make one so it's a little more
versatile<00:01:30.479> than<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.930> keeping<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.560> real<00:01:31.710> tight
