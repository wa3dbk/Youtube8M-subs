after a few miles

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.339 
after a few miles
these<00:00:11.460> blinkers<00:00:11.910> get<00:00:12.090> pretty<00:00:12.360> fast<00:00:12.660> that's

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
these blinkers get pretty fast that's

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.930

is oh you can start at the index look
under<00:00:38.210> turn<00:00:39.210> signal<00:00:40.489> see<00:00:41.489> there's<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
under turn signal see there's a lot of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.450 
under turn signal see there's a lot of
information<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.690> turn<00:00:43.050> signals<00:00:43.559> I'm<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.430> a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
I've got a new one this new one is

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.200 
I've got a new one this new one is
electronic<00:01:59.940> it's<00:02:00.940> got<00:02:02.130> inside<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.370> it<00:02:03.490> but<00:02:04.090> you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
electronic it's got inside of it but you

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.580 
electronic it's got inside of it but you
really<00:02:04.270> can't<00:02:04.660> see<00:02:04.900> very<00:02:05.080> well<00:02:06.180> or<00:02:07.500> there's<00:02:08.500> a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
really can't see very well or there's a

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.770 
really can't see very well or there's a
circuit<00:02:09.010> board<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:12.000> there's<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.180> relay<00:02:13.600> in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
circuit board and there's a relay in

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.970 
circuit board and there's a relay in
there<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.390> there's<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.200> capacitor

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
there and it and there's a capacitor

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.550 
there and it and there's a capacitor
this<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> really<00:02:19.090> good<00:02:19.300> flasher<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:22.560> is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
this is a really good flasher this is

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.740 
this is a really good flasher this is
the<00:02:23.680> oh<00:02:23.710> one<00:02:25.080> these<00:02:26.080> oh<00:02:26.320> these<00:02:27.190> old<00:02:27.250> style<00:02:27.880> I'm

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
the oh one these oh these old style I'm

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.180 
the oh one these oh these old style I'm
gonna<00:02:28.930> take<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.200> apart<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.740> can<00:02:29.890> see<00:02:30.040> how

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
gonna take it apart so you can see how

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.110 
gonna take it apart so you can see how
it<00:02:30.250> works

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.400 

let's<00:02:34.120> take<00:02:34.420> much<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.870> take<00:02:35.020> something<00:02:35.320> like

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
let's take much to take something like

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.910 
let's take much to take something like
this<00:02:35.590> apart<00:02:36.630> he's<00:02:37.630> got<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> cheap<00:02:38.560> aluminum

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
this apart he's got a cheap aluminum

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.520 
this apart he's got a cheap aluminum
housing<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:43.390> hot<00:02:43.630> as<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> pistol<00:02:43.960> right

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
housing on it it's hot as a pistol right

00:02:44.530 --> 00:03:07.710 
housing on it it's hot as a pistol right
now

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.119 

when<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.780> get<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.050> out<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.320> here<00:03:09.440> now

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.839 

see<00:03:16.129> this<00:03:16.430> one<00:03:16.640> here<00:03:17.530> what<00:03:18.530> happens<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.069> the

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
see this one here what happens is the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.250 
see this one here what happens is the
current<00:03:20.209> goes<00:03:20.360> through<00:03:20.390> this<00:03:20.750> piece<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.140> metal

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
current goes through this piece of metal

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.729 
current goes through this piece of metal
it's<00:03:21.590> made<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:22.040> two<00:03:22.660> two<00:03:23.660> kinds<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.260> metal<00:03:24.590> and

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
it's made of two two kinds of metal and

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.330 
it's made of two two kinds of metal and
the<00:03:25.610> they<00:03:26.209> heat<00:03:26.480> up<00:03:26.510> at<00:03:26.900> different<00:03:27.170> rates<00:03:27.590> so

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
the they heat up at different rates so

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.800 
the they heat up at different rates so
when<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.610> electricity<00:03:29.000> goes<00:03:29.420> through<00:03:29.450> it

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
when the electricity goes through it

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.740 
when the electricity goes through it
it's<00:03:30.019> on<00:03:30.230> it's<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.709> dead<00:03:30.950> short<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:32.599> light

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
it's on it's a dead short the light

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.380 
it's on it's a dead short the light
comes<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.290> as<00:03:33.860> soon<00:03:34.130> as<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.400> gets<00:03:34.519> hot<00:03:34.730> the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
comes on as soon as it gets hot the
