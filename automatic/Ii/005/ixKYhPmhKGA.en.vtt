00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.090 
excellent break downs on the surf but
unfortunately<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.289> don't<00:00:22.500> always<00:00:22.830> provide

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
unfortunately you don't always provide

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.189 
unfortunately you don't always provide
players<00:00:23.609> with<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.939> solution<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> fix

players with a solution on how to fix
certain<00:00:25.410> problems<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.490> what<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.849> done<00:00:27.060> today

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
certain problems so what I've done today

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.390 
certain problems so what I've done today
is<00:00:27.420> I've<00:00:27.449> taken<00:00:27.869> three<00:00:28.380> common<00:00:28.830> problems<00:00:29.250> with

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
is I've taken three common problems with

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.580 
is I've taken three common problems with
the<00:00:29.580> serve<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> low<00:00:31.050> contact

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the serve and that is a low contact

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.400 
the serve and that is a low contact
point<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.550> inability<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.270> turn<00:00:33.690> efficiently

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
point the inability to turn efficiently

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
point the inability to turn efficiently
and<00:00:34.530> rotate<00:00:35.010> using<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.520> shoulders<00:00:36.000> so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and rotate using the shoulders so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.360 
and rotate using the shoulders so
players<00:00:36.570> tend<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> arm<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> ball<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> thirdly

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
players tend to arm the ball and thirdly

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.069 
players tend to arm the ball and thirdly
that's<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:39.059> using<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> ground<00:00:39.780> reaction

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that's not using the ground reaction

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.080 
that's not using the ground reaction
forces<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.890> using<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> entire<00:00:41.520> kinetic

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
forces and using the entire kinetic

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
forces and using the entire kinetic
chain<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.690> legs<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:43.800> I've<00:00:43.920> done

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
chain with your legs and what I've done

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040 
chain with your legs and what I've done
is<00:00:44.280> I've<00:00:44.430> shown<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> give<00:00:45.960> you

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.940 

in<00:01:35.660> this<00:01:35.870> first<00:01:36.110> drill<00:01:36.440> here<00:01:36.590> we're<00:01:36.740> really

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
in this first drill here we're really

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.740 
in this first drill here we're really
working<00:01:37.190> on<00:01:37.430> using<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.820> kinetic<00:01:38.240> chain<00:01:38.270> and

that you're jumping but the fact that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.109 
that you're jumping but the fact that
you're<00:01:54.410> pushing<00:01:54.650> down<00:01:55.010> so<00:01:55.040> fast<00:01:55.610> into<00:01:56.000> the

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
you're pushing down so fast into the

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.520 
you're pushing down so fast into the
ground<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.600> you're<00:01:56.720> like<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.930> rubberband

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
ground that you're like a rubberband

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.260 
ground that you're like a rubberband
that's<00:01:57.770> just<00:01:57.950> going<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.160> explode<00:01:58.550> up<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.060> over

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
anything here you can put down a stick

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.240 
anything here you can put down a stick

on a different view here this really
gives<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.480> an<00:02:11.600> idea<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:12.200> where<00:02:12.920> I'm<00:02:13.100> jumping

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
gives you an idea of where I'm jumping

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.289 
the side and what again we're just
really<00:03:23.530> isolating<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> upper<00:03:24.760> body<00:03:24.970> and

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
really isolating the upper body and

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.629 
really isolating the upper body and
working<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.200> rotation<00:03:26.920> or<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.099> twist

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
working on the rotation or the twist

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.819 
working on the rotation or the twist
along<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.090> vertical<00:03:28.569> axis<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.170> what<00:03:29.650> that's

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
along the vertical axis and what that's

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.349 
along the vertical axis and what that's
going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.069> do<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.340> really<00:03:30.639> promote<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.150> power

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
going to do is really promote the power

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.660 
going to do is really promote the power
and<00:03:31.690> stops<00:03:32.349> players<00:03:32.739> from<00:03:32.889> using<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:33.519> the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
and stops players from using just the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.240 
and stops players from using just the
shoulder<00:03:34.150> or<00:03:34.329> elbow<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.959> create<00:03:35.260> spin<00:03:35.739> or

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
shoulder or elbow to create spin or

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.180 
shoulder or elbow to create spin or
drive<00:03:36.700> onto<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.180> ball<00:03:37.389> and<00:03:37.659> again<00:03:38.290> here<00:03:38.799> we

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
drive onto the ball and again here we

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.830 
drive onto the ball and again here we
really<00:03:39.519> want<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.790> emulate<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.329> great<00:03:40.540> players

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
really want to emulate the great players

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.360 
really want to emulate the great players
like<00:03:40.930> Pete<00:03:41.319> Sampras<00:03:41.829> who<00:03:41.950> were<00:03:42.069> able<00:03:42.340> to

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
like Pete Sampras who were able to

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.009 
like Pete Sampras who were able to
generate<00:03:42.849> so<00:03:43.090> much<00:03:43.269> turn<00:03:43.599> that<00:03:43.750> they<00:03:43.870> had

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
generate so much turn that they had

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.839 
generate so much turn that they had
they're<00:03:44.169> almost<00:03:44.500> their<00:03:44.620> entire<00:03:44.650> back<00:03:45.280> facing

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
they're almost their entire back facing

00:03:45.849 --> 00:04:09.390 
they're almost their entire back facing
the<00:03:45.970> opponent

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.920 

okay<00:04:10.400> this<00:04:10.610> third<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.000> final<00:04:11.060> drill<00:04:11.660> really

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
okay this third and final drill really

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.810 
okay this third and final drill really
works<00:04:12.260> on<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.500> contact<00:04:13.040> point<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.400> your<00:04:13.520> surf

with<00:04:28.160> your<00:04:28.280> racket<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.880> that's<00:04:29.360> going<00:04:29.540> to

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
with your racket and that's going to

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.780
