at 111 BPM I got four or five repeats in

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
at 111 BPM I got four or five repeats in
there<00:01:40.830> might<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.160> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.490> high<00:01:41.640> but

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
there might be a little high but

00:01:41.670 --> 00:02:05.080 
there might be a little high but
whatever<00:01:42.360> set<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:42.960> your<00:01:43.050> liking

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090

remember you're hearing me pick the
clean<00:02:08.160> strings<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.910> you're<00:02:09.030> getting<00:02:09.240> clean

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
clean strings so you're getting clean

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.910 
clean strings so you're getting clean
tone<00:02:09.720> mixed<00:02:09.960> in<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.350> because<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.650> coming

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
tone mixed in there because it's coming

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.890 
tone mixed in there because it's coming
here<00:02:11.070> through<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> microphone<00:02:11.820> when<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:12.630> pick

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
here through the microphone when I pick

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.530 
here through the microphone when I pick
it<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.260> you're<00:02:13.440> not<00:02:13.560> hearing<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.980> pure<00:02:14.190> tone

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
it so you're not hearing the pure tone

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.880 
it so you're not hearing the pure tone
the<00:02:15.540> cover<00:02:15.780> will<00:02:15.990> sound<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.350> little<00:02:16.560> more<00:02:16.740> a

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the cover will sound a little more a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.120 
the cover will sound a little more a
little<00:02:17.130> better<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.290> that's<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.770> delay

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130

there we go
that's<00:03:24.820> essentially<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.390> tone

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.450 

turn<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.520> delay<00:03:37.730> off<00:03:38.350> that's<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.470> just<00:03:39.650> drive

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
turn the delay off that's to just drive

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:49.270

Oh

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.130 

now<00:03:58.920> for<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.090> sustainer<00:04:00.570> part<00:04:00.930> we're<00:04:01.050> going

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
now for the sustainer part we're going

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.660 
now for the sustainer part we're going
to<00:04:01.200> leave<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:02.070> delay<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:04.020> drive<00:04:04.920> on<00:04:05.190> the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
to leave the delay and the drive on the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.030 
to leave the delay and the drive on the
whole<00:04:05.850> time<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.390> thickens<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.500> sound<00:04:07.770> it

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
whole time it thickens the sound it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.130 
whole time it thickens the sound it
gives<00:04:08.460> it<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.640> nice<00:04:08.730> tone<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:09.930> don't<00:04:10.050> have

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
gives it a nice tone so you don't have

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.020 
gives it a nice tone so you don't have
to<00:04:10.200> make<00:04:10.320> any<00:04:10.440> changes<00:04:10.470> there<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.160> do<00:04:11.310> have<00:04:12.000> a

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
to make any changes there I do have a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.480 
to make any changes there I do have a
block<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> volume<00:04:13.140> block<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.530> reduces<00:04:14.370> the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
block a volume block that reduces the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.670 
block a volume block that reduces the
volume<00:04:14.640> for<00:04:15.030> this<00:04:15.120> sustainer<00:04:15.540> because<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.049> for
