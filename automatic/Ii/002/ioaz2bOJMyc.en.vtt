most<00:00:09.990> important<00:00:10.559> steps<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.130> like<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.460> use

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
most important steps that I like to use

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.789 
most important steps that I like to use
for<00:00:11.790> creating<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> perfect<00:00:12.450> cat<00:00:12.929> eye<00:00:12.960> there's

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
for creating the perfect cat eye there's

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.990 
for creating the perfect cat eye there's
a<00:00:13.889> number<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.219> ways<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.910> achieve

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
a number of ways that you can achieve

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.040 
a number of ways that you can achieve
the<00:00:15.360> same<00:00:15.540> look<00:00:15.809> two<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.800> my<00:00:17.010> favorites<00:00:17.490> are

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
the same look two of my favorites are

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.470 
the same look two of my favorites are
firstly<00:00:19.050> by<00:00:19.230> taking<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> pencil<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.480> creating

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
firstly by taking a pencil and creating

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.019 
firstly by taking a pencil and creating
a<00:00:21.539> line<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.080> continues<00:00:22.859> along<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.820> bottom

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
a line that continues along the bottom

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.320 
a line that continues along the bottom
lash<00:00:24.330> line<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.910> straight<00:00:26.910> from<00:00:26.939> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
lash line and out straight from that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.880 
lash line and out straight from that
line<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.840> that's<00:00:27.990> always<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.500> line<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
line because that's always the line that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
line because that's always the line that
we<00:00:28.980> want<00:00:29.220> them<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.789> lied<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.150> follow<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
we want them that I lied to follow and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.130 
we want them that I lied to follow and
then<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.279> line<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.239> your<00:00:33.510> base<00:00:33.780> line

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
then you use that line as your base line

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
then you use that line as your base line
to<00:00:34.829> create<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.399> eyeliner<00:00:35.820> however<00:00:36.600> today<00:00:36.719> I'm

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.209 
going to show you how to use scotch tape
to<00:00:38.879> create<00:00:39.000> your<00:00:39.180> baseline<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.040> want

going to give you the perfect angle for

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.510 
going to give you the perfect angle for
your<00:00:50.940> eyeliner<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> sometimes<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
your eyeliner I like to sometimes go in

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.279 
your eyeliner I like to sometimes go in
with<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> pencil<00:00:53.940> first<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:54.899> me<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
with a pencil first look down for me and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
with a pencil first look down for me and
just<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.489> along<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.030> line<00:00:58.640> just<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> get<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
just go along that line just to get the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.210 
just go along that line just to get the
basic<00:01:01.370> angle<00:01:02.539> for<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> eyeliner<00:01:07.100> next<00:01:08.100> I'm

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
basic angle for the eyeliner next I'm

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
basic angle for the eyeliner next I'm
going<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.909> nas<00:01:09.360> gel<00:01:09.869> liner

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
going to go in with this nas gel liner

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.300 
going to go in with this nas gel liner
which<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> give<00:01:10.890> us<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.130> more

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
which is going to give us a more

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
which is going to give us a more
waterproof<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.090> long-lasting<00:01:12.479> effect<00:01:18.350> now

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
waterproof and long-lasting effect now

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.870 
waterproof and long-lasting effect now
that<00:01:19.530> I've<00:01:19.619> created<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.130> base<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.700> take

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that I've created the base we can take

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
that I've created the base we can take
off<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> tape<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> line<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.890> see

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
off the tape and see the line and see

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.230 
off the tape and see the line and see
whether<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> alter<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.090> either

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
whether we need to alter it in either

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.899 
whether we need to alter it in either
direction<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> feel<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
direction so I feel like this can

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.460 
direction so I feel like this can
actually<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.330> little<00:01:27.630> thicker<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.110> top<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
actually be a little thicker on top I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
actually be a little thicker on top I
always<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.860> start<00:01:29.310> dinner<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.030> then

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
always like to start dinner and then

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
always like to start dinner and then
build<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.780> build<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.079> build<00:01:31.170> look<00:01:32.100> down<00:01:32.310> for

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
build and build and build look down for

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.410 
build and build and build look down for
me<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.900> go<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.380> higher

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
me so this one can go a little higher

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
me so this one can go a little higher
because<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.780> eyes<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.079> definitely<00:01:37.470> handle

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
because your eyes can definitely handle

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.899 
because your eyes can definitely handle
it<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> normally<00:01:43.799> when<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.399> an<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.670> like

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it so normally when you do an I like

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
it so normally when you do an I like
this<00:01:45.090> there's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> lot<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.659> cleanup<00:01:46.170> involved

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this there's a lot of cleanup involved

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.200 
this there's a lot of cleanup involved
today<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.189> turned<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.729> good<00:01:47.909> first

that on both sides in exactly the same

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.280 
that on both sides in exactly the same
angle<00:03:37.950> you'll<00:03:38.400> always<00:03:38.760> get<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.060> same<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.420> so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
angle you'll always get the same I so

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.900 
angle you'll always get the same I so
