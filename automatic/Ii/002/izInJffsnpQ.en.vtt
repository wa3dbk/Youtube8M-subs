inch<00:03:13.900> mild<00:03:14.500> steel<00:03:16.290> now<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.560> type<00:03:17.769> of<00:03:17.799> shear

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
inch mild steel now this type of shear

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.339 
inch mild steel now this type of shear
is<00:03:18.370> particularly<00:03:18.849> good<00:03:19.239> for<00:03:19.480> cutting<00:03:20.140> out

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
is particularly good for cutting out

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.979 
is particularly good for cutting out
shapes<00:03:24.299> with<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.329> results<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.959> that

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
shapes with the results of that

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.409 
shapes with the results of that
beginning<00:03:26.620> I'm<00:03:27.040> particularly<00:03:27.639> pleased<00:03:28.090> with

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
beginning I'm particularly pleased with

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.150 
beginning I'm particularly pleased with
this<00:03:28.599> Harbor<00:03:29.380> Freight<00:03:29.709> throat<00:03:30.370> less<00:03:30.579> shear

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
this Harbor Freight throat less shear

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.860 
this Harbor Freight throat less shear
gives<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.310> good<00:03:33.579> clean<00:03:34.389> cut

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.770 

this<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.800> three<00:03:39.099> and<00:03:39.129> a<00:03:39.280> half<00:03:39.489> inch<00:03:39.780> Heydrich

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
this is a three and a half inch Heydrich

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.860 
this is a three and a half inch Heydrich
bar<00:03:41.110> cutter<00:03:41.849> as<00:03:42.849> you<00:03:42.970> can<00:03:43.120> see<00:03:43.360> I've<00:03:43.599> got<00:03:43.810> a

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
bar cutter as you can see I've got a

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.320 
bar cutter as you can see I've got a
measuring<00:03:44.349> device<00:03:44.470> set<00:03:45.099> up<00:03:45.250> here<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.090> can

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
measuring device set up here so I can

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.490 
measuring device set up here so I can
measure<00:03:46.540> different<00:03:47.260> lengths<00:03:49.349> here<00:03:50.349> I'm

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
measure different lengths here I'm

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.890 
measure different lengths here I'm
cutting<00:03:50.709> off<00:03:50.980> some<00:03:51.370> five<00:03:51.640> sixteenths<00:03:52.360> round

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
cutting off some five sixteenths round

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:02.580 
cutting off some five sixteenths round
stock<00:03:54.569> good<00:03:55.569> square<00:03:55.870> cut<00:04:01.080> with<00:04:02.080> some<00:04:02.290> three

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
stock good square cut with some three

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.699 
stock good square cut with some three
sixteenths<00:04:03.840> mild<00:04:04.840> steel

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.780 

so<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.519> can<00:04:09.670> adjust<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:11.099> cut<00:04:12.099> off<00:04:12.250> some<00:04:12.519> flat

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
so I can adjust this cut off some flat

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.250 
so I can adjust this cut off some flat
stock<00:04:13.120> here

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.200 

now<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.320> could<00:04:20.560> set<00:04:20.800> up<00:04:20.920> the<00:04:21.160> 5<00:04:21.550> inch<00:04:21.790> grizzly

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
now you could set up the 5 inch grizzly

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.700 
now you could set up the 5 inch grizzly
shear<00:04:22.570> or<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.290> 12<00:04:23.590> inch<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:25.410> put<00:04:26.410> in<00:04:26.560> a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
shear or the 12 inch and put in a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.190 
shear or the 12 inch and put in a
measuring<00:04:27.340> device<00:04:27.370> such<00:04:28.060> as<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.390> have<00:04:28.660> here

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
measuring device such as I have here

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.750 
measuring device such as I have here
I<00:04:29.230> paid<00:04:30.220> $90<00:04:30.940> for<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.330> in<00:04:31.920> 1973<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.430> today

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
I paid $90 for this in 1973 and today

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.990 
I paid $90 for this in 1973 and today
it's<00:04:34.030> $500<00:04:35.040> which<00:04:36.040> is<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.220> little<00:04:36.610> hard<00:04:36.820> to

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
it's $500 which is a little hard to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.959 
it's $500 which is a little hard to
justify<00:04:37.390> for<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> home<00:04:38.200> shop

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:46.969
