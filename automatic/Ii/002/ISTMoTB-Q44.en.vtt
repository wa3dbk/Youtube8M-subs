00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.440 
that's all that's not like it's all sort
of<00:02:44.109> thing<00:02:44.260> that's<00:02:44.410> because<00:02:45.030> super<00:02:46.030> important

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
of thing that's because super important

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.059 
of thing that's because super important
yeah<00:02:46.900> i<00:02:47.109> thought<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.470> way<00:02:47.590> i<00:02:47.620> always<00:02:47.829> think<00:02:47.950> of

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
yeah i thought the way i always think of

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.520 
yeah i thought the way i always think of
that<00:02:48.160> matchup<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.549> like<00:02:48.900> more<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.109> than<00:02:50.230> almost

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
that matchup is like more so than almost

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.080 
that matchup is like more so than almost
any<00:02:50.920> other<00:02:51.010> match<00:02:51.549> from<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> game<00:02:51.910> and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
any other match from the game and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.430 
any other match from the game and
certainly<00:02:52.420> any<00:02:52.629> other<00:02:52.750> top-tier<00:02:53.109> matchup

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
certainly any other top-tier matchup

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.660 
certainly any other top-tier matchup
it's<00:02:53.590> almost<00:02:53.709> like<00:02:53.859> %<00:02:54.190> doesn't<00:02:54.370> really<00:02:54.489> matter

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
it's almost like % doesn't really matter

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.940 
it's almost like % doesn't really matter
it<00:02:54.910> doesn't<00:02:55.120> exactly<00:02:55.540> box<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.260> get<00:02:56.440> puffed<00:02:56.769> it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
it doesn't exactly box can get puffed it

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.970 
it doesn't exactly box can get puffed it
to<00:02:57.549> 60<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:57.970> like<00:02:58.329> two<00:02:58.599> seconds<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.230> puff<00:02:59.769> can

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
to 60 in like two seconds and puff can

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.220 
to 60 in like two seconds and puff can
kill<00:03:00.159> Fox<00:03:00.430> at<00:03:00.609> zero<00:03:00.819> so<00:03:01.209> it's<00:03:01.690> all<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> grabs

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
kill Fox at zero so it's all the grabs

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.699 
kill Fox at zero so it's all the grabs
exactly<00:03:02.680> exactly<00:03:03.069> so<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.480> like<00:03:05.140> just<00:03:05.409> a
