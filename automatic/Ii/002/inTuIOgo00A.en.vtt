00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 servus and hello on my youtube 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.350
 channel today I want you one 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.349
 useful free program 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.889
 Imagine the ideal for saving 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.660
 full hd videos is suitable 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.320
 I'm talking about windows live movie here 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.020
 Maker that's free on the internet 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.119
 is available and from microsoft for free 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.740
 offered on the internet for download 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.009
 if you create one of the video here 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.399
 you often have the problem with the normal 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.020
 export 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.020
 that the hd is not in complete 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.579
 complete format is displayed that is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.510
 of course not for full hd videos 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.520
 just of advantage 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.579
 That's why I want you now 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 show you how easy 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.960
 full hd videos with the videos movie 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 can save maker 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.899
 just implement a video and here 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.379
 build your own visual effects or 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.150
 with animations 1 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.790
 then you click here on the top left 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 where did you publish the movie ? 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.280
 when a video opens open 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.259
 here is a new bar and you can do that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.270
 Save video in full-hd 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.080
 Now I would have to see if I can 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.000
 quickly a video on my hard drive 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.470
 Let's see if you like a test 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.780
 but I have already seen that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.060
 what example videos very well 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.570
 this video clip is now online here 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.460
 to see 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.799
 and I want to do that now as full hd 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 save then click here on the top left 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.399
 on it and say film release film 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.549
 Do not be silent after you 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.520
 publish but save film 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.159
 now I see high resolution up here 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 I click on if I use the mouse 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.829
 I can already see that about them 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.820
 data pixel aspect ratio entered 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.710
 Now click on it here if one 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.209
 a movie and click on save 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.600
 already the video is in full-hd 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.570
 saved 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.940
 and can be for youtube or other things 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.630
 One thing is natural to use 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.000
 clear 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.040
 the videos where you get here in the videos 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.810
 live movie maker should be implemented 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.750
 Of course, also recorded in HD 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.680
 Otherwise, of course, that brings 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.610
 do not export much in hd 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.700
 I hope I have you a bit 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.860
 helped with this video and would be nice 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.080
