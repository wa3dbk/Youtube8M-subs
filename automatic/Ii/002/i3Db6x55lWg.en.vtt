00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
going to go on to the next plugin which
is<00:01:51.720> leaper<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.290> custom<00:01:52.890> coded<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.220> plugin

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
is leaper I custom coded this plugin

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060 
is leaper I custom coded this plugin
because<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:56.040> of

you ever wanted to double jump like a
boss<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> shop<00:02:01.439> own<00:02:01.619> network<00:02:01.950> well

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
boss like in the shop own network well

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.080 
boss like in the shop own network well
now<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:05.159> coded<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.759> plugin

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
now you can from so I coded this plugin

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.779 
now you can from so I coded this plugin
to<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.899> an<00:02:07.110> exact<00:02:07.500> replica<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> shop<00:02:08.640> own

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to be an exact replica of the shop own

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.530 
to be an exact replica of the shop own
Network<00:02:09.119> double<00:02:09.750> jump<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.180> won't<00:02:12.180> find

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
Network double jump so you won't find

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.460 
Network double jump so you won't find
actually<00:02:12.930> well

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
actually well

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.320 
actually well
this<00:02:13.590> doesn't<00:02:13.890> include<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.220> XP<00:02:14.670> bar<00:02:15.150> or

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
this doesn't include the XP bar or

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.480 
this doesn't include the XP bar or
whatever<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.890> pretty<00:02:17.070> much<00:02:17.130> double

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
whatever but you can pretty much double

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.240 
whatever but you can pretty much double
jump<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> exact<00:02:18.330> same<00:02:18.600> parameters<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:19.620> you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
jump the exact same parameters as you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.920 
jump the exact same parameters as you
could<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.640> shock<00:02:20.850> though<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.780> useful

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
could in shock though so this is useful

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.330 
could in shock though so this is useful
if<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.560> hub<00:02:22.740> server<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.220> want

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
if you have a hub server and you want

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.950 
if you have a hub server and you want
people<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.580> get<00:02:23.640> around<00:02:23.760> quickly<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.450> also

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
people to get around quickly I also

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.020 
people to get around quickly I also
increase<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.620> walk<00:02:25.920> speed<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.670> course<00:02:26.910> you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
increase the walk speed of course you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.840 
increase the walk speed of course you
can<00:02:27.120> customize<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.140> config<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:29.040> you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
can customize that in the config so you

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.850 
can customize that in the config so you
can<00:02:29.970> set<00:02:30.150> faster<00:02:30.540> walk<00:02:30.720> speed<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.260> true<00:02:31.650> or

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
can set faster walk speed as to true or

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.460 
can set faster walk speed as to true or
not<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.820> even<00:02:33.270> included<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.870> sound<00:02:34.110> effect

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
not and I even included a sound effect

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.720 
not and I even included a sound effect
so<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.700> put<00:02:35.940> bat<00:02:36.180> tick<00:02:36.510> sound<00:02:36.810> effect<00:02:37.050> on

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
so if you put bat tick sound effect on

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.900 
so if you put bat tick sound effect on
true<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.210> then<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.990> did<00:02:40.140> slash<00:02:40.380> reload<00:02:40.910> weird

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
true and then I did slash reload weird

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.840 
true and then I did slash reload weird
then<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.900> turn<00:02:43.080> my<00:02:43.200> volume<00:02:43.320> up<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.700> hear

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
then I turn my volume up you can hear

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.520 
then I turn my volume up you can hear
the<00:02:47.970> flapping<00:02:48.180> sound<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:49.110> that's<00:02:49.260> pretty

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530

like it'll track their IP addresses and
it'll<00:03:48.540> come<00:03:48.959> up<00:03:49.049> with<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> little<00:03:49.290> database

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
it'll come up with a little database

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.520 
it'll come up with a little database
within<00:03:50.160> your<00:03:50.310> server<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:51.380> stored<00:03:52.380> locally

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
that it works I think it's because I'm

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.749 
that it works I think it's because I'm
using<00:05:09.479> localhost<00:05:10.199> yeah<00:05:10.979> that's<00:05:11.400> it

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
using localhost yeah that's it

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.089 
using localhost yeah that's it
I'm<00:05:11.849> hosting<00:05:12.720> this<00:05:12.870> on<00:05:13.050> my<00:05:13.139> local<00:05:13.349> computer<00:05:13.620> so

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
I'm hosting this on my local computer so

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.120 
I'm hosting this on my local computer so
it<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:15.090> know<00:05:15.120> like<00:05:15.509> not<00:05:15.720> remember<00:05:16.650> localhost

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
it you know like not remember localhost

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.670 
it you know like not remember localhost
IP<00:05:17.340> address<00:05:17.669> so<00:05:17.970> makes<00:05:18.389> sense<00:05:18.630> yeah<00:05:19.500> because

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
IP address so makes sense yeah because

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.920 
IP address so makes sense yeah because
you<00:05:20.099> know<00:05:20.160> yeah<00:05:20.360> doing<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.389> lot<00:05:21.570> of<00:05:21.599> testing
