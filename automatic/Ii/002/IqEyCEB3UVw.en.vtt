00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.120
 brother yes good but look first that 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.890
 I want to show descendants white the 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.600
 great encyclopedia of the world says something 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.280
 very interesting that you just found 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.530
 the Serie 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.270
 the names of the months as the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.880
 we know now comes in the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.670
 Roman calendar since you do not know by 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.810
 who they call the months and know 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.790
 roberto why because I do not know why he 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.459
 they put names to be able to organize 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.580
 to know what month they lived then 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.650
 they looked for idol names of gods or 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.450
 they called it that in honor of the planets 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.280
 they did that because otherwise they did not know 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.530
 what day although month they were living not 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.860
 Look January is named after the god 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.170
 Roman Janusz and February is named after 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.060
 a Roman goddess called Hebrew who 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.340
 I protected from fevers but I did not 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.830
 like to have a fever and March because 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.470
 so called March is named after the 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.840
 Roman god Mars and April is called 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.300
 because the word comes from spring 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.180
 because for the Romans April is 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.400
 spring and not fall like here and may and 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.440
 June the month of May is called that because 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.169
 the Romans wanted to pay homage to maya 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.510
 mercury mom and june is called like that 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.479
 by the Roman goddess juno wife of 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.610
 jupiter july by july caesar and august 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.940
 for the august emperor but now we 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.840
 lack 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.220
 September, October, November and December 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.210
 September is called that way by 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.150
 Septem number 7 in your language already and 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.060
 October then it is opted for the number 8 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.130
 and November do not see by the 9th and 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.320
 December is named for the number 10 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.540
 that later to stop to stop me 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.660
 say nothing December is called without by 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.070
 camps on the 10th which is my favorite number 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.710
 How many things that we always learn with 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.710
