match<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:55.110> notice<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.530> some<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.860> gameplay

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
match you notice I some of this gameplay

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
match you notice I some of this gameplay
we<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.579> increased<00:01:56.939> manager<00:01:57.479> functionality

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
we have increased manager functionality
