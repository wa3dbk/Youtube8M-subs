iPhone<00:00:12.420> 4<00:00:13.250> wireless<00:00:14.250> hotspot<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:14.820> no<00:00:15.179> luck

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
iPhone 4 wireless hotspot with no luck

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.410 
iPhone 4 wireless hotspot with no luck
I've<00:00:16.859> seen<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> couple<00:00:17.460> videos<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:18.029> YouTube

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
I've seen a couple videos on YouTube

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.540 
I've seen a couple videos on YouTube
saying<00:00:18.949> showing<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.160> can<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.400> done

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
saying showing that it can be done

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.609 
saying showing that it can be done
nobody<00:00:21.539> else<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.779> explaining<00:00:22.199> how<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.500> done

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
nobody else you explaining how it's done

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.689 
nobody else you explaining how it's done
so<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.920> thought<00:00:23.100> I'd<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.250> give<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.550> quick

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
so I thought I'd just give you a quick

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.599 
so I thought I'd just give you a quick
little<00:00:23.880> rundown<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.710> trouble<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.160> with<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
little rundown the trouble is with the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.919 
little rundown the trouble is with the
iPhone<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.689> only<00:00:27.779> understands<00:00:28.410> ASC

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
iPhone is that it only understands ASC

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.819 
iPhone is that it only understands ASC
III<00:00:30.929> code<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> SSID<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.840> ps3<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
III code for the SSID and the ps3 that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.290 
III code for the SSID and the ps3 that
makes<00:00:35.010> any<00:00:35.190> sense

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
makes any sense

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.530 
makes any sense
so<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> did<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.500> renamed<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.730> SSID<00:00:39.180> when

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
so what I did is I renamed the SSID when

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.150 
so what I did is I renamed the SSID when
I<00:00:39.600> try<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.809> log<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> wars<00:00:40.530> Wi-Fi

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I try to log on to the wars Wi-Fi

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
I try to log on to the wars Wi-Fi
hotspot<00:00:41.610> as<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.480> ASC<00:00:43.469> III<00:00:44.430> code<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> basically

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
hotspot as the ASC III code so basically

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.819 
hotspot as the ASC III code so basically
I<00:00:46.980> rename<00:00:47.309> my<00:00:47.520> iPhones<00:00:48.000> name<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.620> letter

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
I rename my iPhones name just one letter

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.220 
I rename my iPhones name just one letter
a<00:00:50.750> just<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.170> instance<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.649> easy<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:54.030> I

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
a just for instance it's easy then I

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.590 
a just for instance it's easy then I
turn<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> wireless<00:00:55.500> hotspot<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.239> search<00:00:57.239> for

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
turn the wireless hotspot on search for

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
turn the wireless hotspot on search for
the<00:00:57.840> wireless<00:00:58.170> networks<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> ps3<00:00:59.390> picked

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the wireless networks on the ps3 picked

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.740 
the wireless networks on the ps3 picked
up<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> SSID<00:01:02.149> still<00:01:03.149> weapon<00:01:03.449> coded

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
up a as the SSID still weapon coded

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.920 
up a as the SSID still weapon coded
that's<00:01:03.960> fine<00:01:04.199> does<00:01:04.379> matter<00:01:05.630> when<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
that's fine does matter when you get to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
that's fine does matter when you get to
the<00:01:06.990> SSID<00:01:07.409> page<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.189> basically<00:01:08.700> has<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the SSID page and it basically has a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460 
the SSID page and it basically has a
little<00:01:09.299> arrow<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.780> right-hand<00:01:09.960> side<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
little arrow on the right-hand side that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.380 
little arrow on the right-hand side that
doesn't<00:01:10.619> exist<00:01:11.040> which<00:01:11.250> should<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.240> into

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
doesn't exist which should be to go into

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
doesn't exist which should be to go into
the<00:01:12.479> next<00:01:12.600> thing<00:01:12.720> after<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.500> confirm<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the next thing after you confirm the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.300 
the next thing after you confirm the
SSID<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.299> would<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.630> come<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.310> an

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
SSID it would want come up with the an

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
SSID it would want come up with the an
error<00:01:17.490> message<00:01:17.700> saying<00:01:17.880> only<00:01:18.360> accepts<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.020> SC

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
error message saying only accepts a SC

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.280 
error message saying only accepts a SC
by<00:01:19.920> characters<00:01:20.750> by<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.810> basically<00:01:22.110> that's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
by characters by so basically that's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.270 
by characters by so basically that's
what<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.650> you're<00:01:22.770> gonna<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> into<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
what you do you're gonna put it into a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.410 
what you do you're gonna put it into a
SS<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.790> SC<00:01:24.330> o--<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> character<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.729> 65

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
SS a SC o-- I character for a it is 65

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.569 
SS a SC o-- I character for a it is 65
space<00:01:28.380> 41<00:01:29.310> space<00:01:30.439> 101<00:01:31.579> space<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:34.579> character

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
space 41 space 101 space and character

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.469 
space 41 space 101 space and character
then<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> hash<00:01:36.509> tag<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.170> 65<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> semicolon

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
then a hash tag then 65 then a semicolon

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.730 
then a hash tag then 65 then a semicolon
so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> mean<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.110> pretty<00:01:40.170> available

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
so I mean these are pretty available

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.440 
so I mean these are pretty available
ones<00:01:40.890> online<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.939> look<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.210> there

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
ones online you can just look up there

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.889 
ones online you can just look up there
is<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:43.079> SC<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.159> codes<00:01:44.630> they'll<00:01:45.630> give<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
is a SC on one codes they'll give you a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.800 
is a SC on one codes they'll give you a
rundown<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.320> each<00:01:46.770> code<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.340> each<00:01:47.399> letter

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
rundown of each code for each letter

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
rundown of each code for each letter
just<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.170> simple<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.530> use<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.950> once<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
just it's simple just use it once on the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.690 
just it's simple just use it once on the
a<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> found<00:01:51.360> after<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.290> once

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
a because I found after you do this once
