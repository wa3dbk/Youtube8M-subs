00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
a little bit I got off right here and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.580 
a little bit I got off right here and
this<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.269> why<00:04:08.540> it's<00:04:08.690> real<00:04:08.840> important<00:04:09.349> try<00:04:09.530> to

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
this is why it's real important try to

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.949 
this is why it's real important try to
stay<00:04:09.889> it's<00:04:10.700> close<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.329> right<00:04:11.480> around<00:04:11.660> this

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
stay it's close to right around this

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.809 
stay it's close to right around this
edge<00:04:12.230> as<00:04:12.500> possible<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:13.069> not<00:04:13.190> do<00:04:13.370> like<00:04:13.549> I<00:04:13.760> did

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
edge as possible to not do like I did

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.490 
edge as possible to not do like I did
and<00:04:14.239> I<00:04:14.299> guess<00:04:14.359> me<00:04:14.720> making<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.079> mistake

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
and I guess me making a mistake

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.379 
and I guess me making a mistake
you<00:04:16.220> know<00:04:16.340> just<00:04:16.639> shows<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.150> why<00:04:17.329> you

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
you know just shows you why you

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.649 
you know just shows you why you
shouldn't<00:04:18.099> cuz<00:04:19.099> I<00:04:19.190> got<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:19.579> big<00:04:20.419> piece<00:04:20.630> of

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
shouldn't cuz I got this big piece of

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.719 
shouldn't cuz I got this big piece of
plastic<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.380> took<00:04:21.620> out<00:04:21.829> it's<00:04:22.099> not<00:04:22.220> gonna<00:04:22.520> fake

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
plastic I took out it's not gonna fake

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:23.680

much<00:04:22.940> on<00:04:23.150> me

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
much on me

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.720 
much on me
but<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.050> point<00:04:24.260> is<00:04:24.410> if<00:04:24.740> I<00:04:24.920> got<00:04:25.130> it<00:04:25.280> too<00:04:25.430> close

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
but the point is if I got it too close

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
and it'd be a very weak point okay I

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:59.550 
Ian well I didn't have handy the exact
proper<00:04:47.480> bit<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:48.800> my<00:04:49.490> holes<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.970> little<00:04:50.420> tight

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:08.550

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
the clamp okay our billet adapter and

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.000 
the clamp okay our billet adapter and
filter<00:06:16.700> is<00:06:16.760> installed<00:06:17.419> you<00:06:18.230> can<00:06:18.290> see<00:06:18.620> like<00:06:18.860> I

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
filter is installed you can see like I

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.210 
filter is installed you can see like I
said<00:06:19.250> no<00:06:19.430> but<00:06:19.580> our<00:06:19.850> adapter<00:06:20.419> has<00:06:20.570> a<00:06:20.630> barbed

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
said no but our adapter has a barbed

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.980 
said no but our adapter has a barbed
arianna<00:06:22.220> so<00:06:22.550> your<00:06:22.700> filter<00:06:23.060> won't<00:06:23.240> slide<00:06:23.690> off

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
arianna so your filter won't slide off

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.930 
arianna so your filter won't slide off
and<00:06:24.440> you<00:06:24.800> don't<00:06:24.950> have<00:06:25.160> to<00:06:25.340> worry<00:06:25.520> about<00:06:25.640> the

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
and you don't have to worry about the

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.970 
and you don't have to worry about the
front<00:06:26.090> sliding<00:06:26.510> off<00:06:26.810> because<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.350> transition

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
front sliding off because the transition

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.430 
front sliding off because the transition
is<00:06:28.100> so<00:06:28.310> short<00:06:28.640> and<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.510> box<00:06:29.780> holds<00:06:30.230> it<00:06:30.320> in

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
is so short and the box holds it in

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.810
