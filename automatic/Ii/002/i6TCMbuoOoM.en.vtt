00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.980
Leo Ferronato a guy from Brasil who study
the crop circle phenomenon have seen often

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.310
crop circles in Brasil, he had heard that
mobile phones stopped working when you try

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.070
to enter them.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.630
However, what happened is ... recently they have discovered two crop circles in the cornfields

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.059
of Schönefeld(just outside of Berlin).

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:45.629
As you can see here, and the thing is they
are investigating if it's man made or extraterrestrial.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:58.610
One of them is Sarika Sinha, she's really
wondering if a UFO can create a crop circle

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:07.150
just by landing. During her previous visit,
she wanted to have her guide proof that they

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.710
are not made by pranksters. According to the guide, the police had cordoned off the area

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.940
after the crop circles had emerged and flew helicopters around. That does not seem like

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.940
the normal course of business, says Sinha.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.320
Crop circles have been documented in the seventies and appearing especially on motorways or airports.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.720
The search for extraterrestrial life recently
received a boost when the Russian billionaire

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.730
Yuri Milner donated 1 million dollars to
the search for aliens. With the money, scientists

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.560
can rent large telescopes.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.690
Physicist Stephen Hawking will act as advisor for the program. He said that it should find

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:07.040
other examples of life in an infinite universe. “We live, we are intelligent, we must know

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.110
it,” he said. The program should provide
a breakthrough, hence the name ‘Breakthrough

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.870
Listen’.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.480
In the article i've included an audio file
where they take you in their adventure, recorded

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.170
while examining the corn fields just outside Berlin.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.590
