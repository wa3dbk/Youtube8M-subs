tuned<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.800> rather<00:00:29.490> than<00:00:29.670> start<00:00:30.119> taking

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
tuned to and rather than start taking

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
tuned to and rather than start taking
damage<00:00:30.599> from<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.830> let<00:00:32.070> him<00:00:32.099> get

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
damage from it it's like let him get

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670 
damage from it it's like let him get
going<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:32.969> stuff<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.450> decided<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.140> mug<00:00:34.530> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
going and stuff I decided just mug it

going and stuff I decided just mug it
right<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.809> have<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.170> end<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
right there and have that be the end of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.869 
right there and have that be the end of
it<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.710> he's<00:00:38.219> gonna<00:00:38.370> play<00:00:38.550> an<00:00:38.640> armored

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it so he's gonna play an armored

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.310 
it so he's gonna play an armored
transport<00:00:39.390> which<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> card<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
transport which is a card that when I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.660 
transport which is a card that when I
first<00:00:40.590> saw<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.800> spoiled<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.340> wasn't<00:00:41.610> too

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
first saw it spoiled I wasn't too

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
first saw it spoiled I wasn't too
excited<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> play<00:00:43.140> with

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
excited about but the more I play with

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.959 
excited about but the more I play with
it<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.530> more<00:00:43.710> I've<00:00:43.860> learned<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.370> respect<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
it the more I've learned to respect it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.819 
it the more I've learned to respect it
and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.719> feel<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.379> pretty<00:00:46.530> decent

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and I feel like it's a pretty decent

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.040 
and I feel like it's a pretty decent
card<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.760> way<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.719> just

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
card so one way that it is actually just

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.720 
card so one way that it is actually just
becomes<00:00:49.350> awesome<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> madcap

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
becomes awesome is if you put a madcap

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
becomes awesome is if you put a madcap
skills<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.480> mean<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.920> just

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
skills on it I mean that that just

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.709 
skills on it I mean that that just
basically<00:00:53.520> means<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.879> they<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.300> jump

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
basically means that they have to jump

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.299 
basically means that they have to jump
with<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.110> creatures<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:55.770> ever<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
with two creatures if they ever want to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
with two creatures if they ever want to
block<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.329> never<00:00:57.510> kill<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
block it and they can never kill it in

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.439 
block it and they can never kill it in
combat<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.890> thought<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.280> my<00:00:59.520> Basilica<00:01:00.180> guards

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
combat I thought I my Basilica guards

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.760 
combat I thought I my Basilica guards
would<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> good<00:01:00.870> way<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> deal<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.620> but

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
would be a good way to deal with it but

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
would be a good way to deal with it but
it<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.039> didn't<00:01:02.250> work<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.550> luckily<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.629> me

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it just didn't work out luckily for me

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.399 
it just didn't work out luckily for me
though<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:05.750> ground<00:01:06.750> assault<00:01:07.140> here

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
though I do have a ground assault here

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.560 
though I do have a ground assault here
and<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> something<00:01:08.310> an<00:01:08.700> issue<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and this is something an issue with a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.899 
and this is something an issue with a
little<00:01:09.990> bit<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.140> sequencing<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.490> played<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
little bit of sequencing so I played a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.929 
little bit of sequencing so I played a
mugging<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.450> turn<00:01:12.689> two<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.530> kill<00:01:13.799> his<00:01:14.250> scar

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
mugging on turn two to kill his scar

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.640 
mugging on turn two to kill his scar
guildmage<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.110> played<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> ground

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
guildmage but then I played the ground

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.670 
guildmage but then I played the ground
assault<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.500> kill<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.500> thing

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
assault here to kill the the the thing

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.840 
assault here to kill the the the thing
that<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.860> could've<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.189> killed<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> arm<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
that I could've just killed the arm of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.429 
that I could've just killed the arm of
the<00:01:23.880> armored<00:01:24.600> transport<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.110> madcap

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the armored transport with the madcap

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.590 
the armored transport with the madcap
skills<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.310> instead<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.090> doing<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
skills on it so instead of doing it that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.140 
skills on it so instead of doing it that
way<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.780> could<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.170> actually<00:01:28.970> curved<00:01:29.970> out

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
way I could have actually curved out

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.120 
way I could have actually curved out
better<00:01:30.390> if<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.049> had<00:01:31.259> played<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> ground

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
better if I had played the ground

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
better if I had played the ground
assault<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.520> two<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.869> mugging<00:01:34.170> on

know if that actually would have ended
up<00:01:45.840> working<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:47.329> especially<00:01:48.329> since<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
up working out especially since it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.630 
up working out especially since it
worked<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.320> fine<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.890> since<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.369> got<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
worked out fine here since I just got to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.749 
worked out fine here since I just got to
extort<00:01:51.000> him<00:01:52.310> unfortunately<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> wasn't<00:01:53.640> able

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
extort him unfortunately I wasn't able

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.249 
extort him unfortunately I wasn't able
to<00:01:54.030> extort<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> Sun<00:01:54.780> home<00:01:54.899> guildmage

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to extort with the Sun home guildmage

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.830 
to extort with the Sun home guildmage
since<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.829> used<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:56.909> only<00:01:57.119> white<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.630> didn't

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
since it used my only white and I didn't

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
since it used my only white and I didn't
have<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.079> prism<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.890> maybe<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.310> would

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
have that prism out so maybe it would

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
have that prism out so maybe it would
have<00:01:59.520> ended<00:01:59.700> up<00:02:00.240> working<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.020> anyway

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
have ended up working out but anyway

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.649

warm<00:02:46.400> light<00:02:46.520> infantry<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:48.350> would<00:02:48.440> have

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
warm light infantry and that would have

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.570 
warm light infantry and that would have
been<00:02:48.590> fine<00:02:48.830> but<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.040> didn't<00:02:49.280> feel<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.400> playing

locking<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:55.160> 23<00:02:55.700> would<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.000> been<00:02:56.120> fine<00:02:56.360> and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
locking the 23 would have been fine and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.020 
locking the 23 would have been fine and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
might seem a little aggressive to attack

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.110 
might seem a little aggressive to attack

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
here is a risky scenario for me since if

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.840 
here is a risky scenario for me since if
he<00:03:41.600> just<00:03:42.079> attacks<00:03:42.380> with<00:03:42.560> everything<00:03:42.980> normally

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
that to do and that would put me in a

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.550 
that to do and that would put me in a
bad<00:04:15.739> position<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:17.140> anyway<00:04:18.140> I'm<00:04:18.229> just<00:04:18.410> gonna

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
but he decides not to attack so that is

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.659 
but he decides not to attack so that is
definitely<00:04:21.200> pretty<00:04:21.590> useful<00:04:21.799> for<00:04:22.070> me<00:04:22.160> so

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
if I had drawn a land I would have been

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.750 
if I had drawn a land I would have been
able<00:04:32.420> to<00:04:32.600> play<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:32.930> Sarah<00:04:33.560> talk<00:04:33.800> with<00:04:34.250> extort

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040

alarm<00:04:37.340> fire<00:04:37.580> with<00:04:37.850> extort<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:39.650> mean<00:04:39.980> at

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
alarm fire with extort and I mean at

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.620 
alarm fire with extort and I mean at
this<00:04:40.190> point<00:04:40.280> five<00:04:40.640> alarm<00:04:40.910> fire<00:04:41.060> is<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.360> little

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
this point five alarm fire is a little

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.370 
this point five alarm fire is a little
bit<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.810> overkill<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.470> mean<00:04:43.040> I<00:04:43.540> two<00:04:44.540> triggers<00:04:45.230> on

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
bit of overkill I mean I two triggers on

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.690 
bit of overkill I mean I two triggers on
that<00:04:45.530> thing<00:04:45.770> once<00:04:45.920> my<00:04:46.070> dudes<00:04:46.280> deal<00:04:46.490> some

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700

that thing once my dudes deal some
damage<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.240> I'm<00:04:47.720> going<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.930> take<00:04:48.110> him<00:04:48.320> all<00:04:48.530> the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
damage and I'm going to take him all the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.490 
damage and I'm going to take him all the
way<00:04:48.680> down<00:04:48.950> to<00:04:48.980> five<00:04:49.820> life<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.420> swing<00:04:51.020> up<00:04:51.200> with<00:04:51.470> a

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
way down to five life I swing up with a

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.440 
way down to five life I swing up with a
nine<00:04:51.800> point<00:04:51.980> swing<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.670> apply<00:04:52.910> Gil<00:04:53.120> gain<00:04:53.300> and

nine point swing it apply Gil gain and

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.760 
nine point swing it apply Gil gain and
then<00:04:53.540> pass<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:53.930> then<00:04:54.020> all<00:04:54.140> I've<00:04:54.290> got<00:04:54.440> left<00:04:54.470> is
