00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:03.670
 there is a definition while I find interesting 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.990
 m I do not think that's the definition behind any other definition 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.959
 and I found it interesting as 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.869
 and that's the very definition of soul an American company that has 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.550
 spent in a decade 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.679
 a little one wrote a book called what we did and greece 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.880
 for m and this book explains why men make art 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.220
 the idea is that 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.609
 1 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.199
 the late rto 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.939
 in France dacia 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.059
 in shanghai it's weird it's that it does but that patient 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250
 but hey it's like that learns 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.810
 so she explains m like that 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.940
 if you have a useful object like a bowl 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.340
 if you put a decoration on it makes this special flight 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.250
 sometimes having this idea 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.930
 a man that I find interesting 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.420
 I found myself imagine a little 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.590
 m the role of the artist 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.370
 developing with that idea so that the fed is considering so I have you 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.530
 explained m 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.280
 it is very good 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.680
 so at first it was like that it was 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 to meet him 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 the special object by putting their record 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.240
 and then as 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.900
 announcements to quote the country 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.690
 he returned special subjects in a club like elsewhere 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.170
 in the caves to the self for example 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.490
 the procession 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.140
 when the animals were it was because in the cave 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990
 l 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.790
 it made the subject 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.320
 the special animal 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 I could say the same it goes on like that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.720
 artemisia gentileschi which 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.499
 she was making the salinas that were mixed and social 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.250
 painting them 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 m 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.080
 jack ury davide 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.870
 before the specials 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.870
 winger 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.490
 it was 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.029
 of art it marked as special the subject because it was perfect 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.050
 then m stereo 20th century I'm like that I do not know how 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.840
 it developed this idea but at one point it was not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.650
 make the price special 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.190
 or if it was that but it was also to make the subject and andré subject 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.729
 and then understand them 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.429
 the elements of the arcp and social 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.479
 the elements of the query that say it well I mean the artist 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.439
 himself 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.179
 his style 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.819
 a late move 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.870
 a color the things is that here 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.479
 we gather all that to make art 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:38.289
 there these things become special was made special by that 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.099
 so I quote as an example the audience 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.219
 when cubism started to begin 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.649
 it is not very much appreciated by the public but with each painting 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.789
 Publicist 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:57.509
 the public will have been made special say that every table contribute 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.099
 ap 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.489
 no putting into play 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.879
 cubism allard 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.319
 also see, unfortunately, as an example we must fear 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.509
 I do not know when, but it's still that's how we are 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.489
 United States 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.599
 a nose he made his color sand 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.669
 the plain kiener 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.889
 luc chatel with every painting that made blue dancing with its wounds 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.889
 he made those of color 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.529
 and then more recently I would not say I do not really know how that got 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:29.529
 start 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.129
 m manon allard it's not nothing 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.969
 in this letter make the object is to make the subject between the elements of 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.099
 dollars special 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.189
 born now is also make anything special 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.819
 for me 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.719
 I quote as an example 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.149
 al knowing that the cup at the act 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:50.839
 I do not know if you have it in France 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.169
 why in other countries than the United States a man 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.789
 a year ago this movement socrates 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.059
 social practice 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.109
 and artists they are gay 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.299
 who are part of this movement 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.299
 it's always like that but often at larçay m 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.519
 areva special 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.170
 an illegal activity 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.579
 the daily el pais 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.680
 like for example taking a pot with his friends 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.819
 we can take 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.469
 a pot with his friends and it's not art 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:25.659
 but there were 6 years and one is an artist in the socrates movement 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.880
 and we say we say then that take this port with friends 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.800
 those two there 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 well it becomes art 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.210
 and I admit that 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.610
 I can see how to recognize it as special 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.830
 an object or a subject like the elements of art 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.610
 m 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.669
 but make anything special salmonella that pushes me a little 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.590
 premium requested 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.729
 m 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.729
 it starts with shovels this summer 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:00.930
 a few days west to find ham among these sites 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.529
 various acts as an artist 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:04.610
 tomorrow 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.240
