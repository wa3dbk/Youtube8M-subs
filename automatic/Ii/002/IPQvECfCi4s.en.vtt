00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
a look at it to move so um it's like

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.290 
a look at it to move so um it's like
half<00:00:40.079> attack<00:00:40.530> based<00:00:40.860> half<00:00:41.340> strategy<00:00:42.059> based

half attack based half strategy based
thunder<00:00:42.750> wave<00:00:42.870> obviously<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:43.920> annoying

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
thunder wave obviously can get annoying

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
thunder wave obviously can get annoying
but<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.230> watch<00:00:46.379> out

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
but really what you have to watch out

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.880 
but really what you have to watch out
for<00:00:46.620> um<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.600> strategic<00:00:48.899> side<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> light

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
for um on the strategic side is a light

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.430 
for um on the strategic side is a light
stream<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.000> using<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.629> special

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
stream because if you're using a special

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
stream because if you're using a special
attacker<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.039> will<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.969> your

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
attacker that will have all of your

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.310 
attacker that will have all of your
special<00:00:54.360> attacking<00:00:54.930> moves

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
special attacking moves

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
special attacking moves
fortunately<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.430> using<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.149> earthquake<00:00:57.780> for

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
fortunately I'm using a earthquake for

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.750 
fortunately I'm using a earthquake for
my<00:00:58.530> strategy<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.160> won't<00:00:59.370> need<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> worry

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
my strategy so I won't need to worry

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.299 
my strategy so I won't need to worry
about<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.180> yet<00:01:00.840> also<00:01:01.109> has<00:01:01.440> brick<00:01:01.829> rake<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
about that yet also has brick rake and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
about that yet also has brick rake and
charge<00:01:02.730> beam<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.210> its<00:01:03.329> arsenal<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.019> well

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
charge beam in its arsenal and well

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.050 
charge beam in its arsenal and well
there's<00:01:04.920> brick<00:01:05.220> break<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> physical

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
there's brick break it's a physical

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.990 
there's brick break it's a physical
fighting<00:01:06.390> attack<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.490> unless<00:01:08.490> you're<00:01:08.700> sending

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
fighting attack so unless you're sending

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.490 
fighting attack so unless you're sending
out<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> normal<00:01:09.750> type<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.140> shouldn't<00:01:10.439> be

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
out like a normal type that shouldn't be

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.890 
out like a normal type that shouldn't be
too<00:01:10.680> much<00:01:10.799> trouble<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.250> charge<00:01:11.729> beam<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.330> most

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
too much trouble but charge beam on most

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.719 
too much trouble but charge beam on most
of<00:01:13.020> its<00:01:13.200> Pokemon<00:01:13.590> half<00:01:13.830> charge<00:01:14.159> me<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:14.549> what

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
of its Pokemon half charge me now what

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.499 
of its Pokemon half charge me now what
it<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.509> an<00:01:15.600> interesting<00:01:15.810> move<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.409> um<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
it is it's an interesting move it's um a

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.550 
it is it's an interesting move it's um a
special<00:01:18.509> attacking<00:01:18.930> move<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
special attacking move it's not that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
special attacking move it's not that
powerful<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> has<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> 70%<00:01:21.000> chance<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
powerful but it has a 70% chance of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.080 
powerful but it has a 70% chance of
boosting<00:01:22.170> their<00:01:22.259> special<00:01:22.710> attack<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
boosting their special attack so it's a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.179 
boosting their special attack so it's a
smart<00:01:24.450> idea<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.960> knock<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.500> his<00:01:25.650> Pokemon<00:01:26.070> as

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
smart idea to knock out his Pokemon as

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.679 
smart idea to knock out his Pokemon as
quickly<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.700> possible<00:01:27.180> because<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
quickly as possible because if you

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.719 
quickly as possible because if you
dawdle<00:01:27.960> around<00:01:28.140> too<00:01:28.500> long<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.430> enough

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
dawdle around too long they get enough

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
dawdle around too long they get enough
charge<00:01:30.030> beam<00:01:30.270> boosts<00:01:30.780> their<00:01:30.960> special<00:01:31.320> taxing

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
charge beam boosts their special taxing

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.899 
charge beam boosts their special taxing
you're<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.220> high<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.670> gonna<00:01:32.759> make

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you're really high and it's gonna make

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
you're really high and it's gonna make
the<00:01:33.030> battle<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.450> whole<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:33.960> harder<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> think

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the battle a whole lot harder so I think

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.010 
the battle a whole lot harder so I think
the<00:01:35.670> best<00:01:35.850> strategy<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the best strategy is just go for the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.600 
the best strategy is just go for the
damage<00:01:37.320> right<00:01:37.470> away<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.950> knock<00:01:38.130> them<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.430> as

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
damage right away and knock them out as

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.600 
damage right away and knock them out as
fast<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.299> possibly<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:41.430> looked

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
fast as you possibly can and it looked

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.069 
fast as you possibly can and it looked
like<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> worked<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.180> pretty<00:01:42.479> well<00:01:42.630> against

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
like it worked out pretty well against

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.520 
like it worked out pretty well against

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
go ahead and switch to star after so I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.190 
go ahead and switch to star after so I
can<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> nice<00:01:50.970> close<00:01:51.299> combat<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:52.049> it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
can get a nice close combat on it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.899 
can get a nice close combat on it
because<00:01:52.409> I'll<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.740> super<00:01:53.070> effective<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.610> it

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
because I'll be super effective and it

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.539 
because I'll be super effective and it
should<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.270> able<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> knock<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:55.009> now<00:01:56.070> um

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
should be able to knock it out now um

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.270 
should be able to knock it out now um
his<00:01:57.270> ambipom<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:58.049> kind<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.439> interesting<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
his ambipom is kind of interesting and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.810 
his ambipom is kind of interesting and
I'm<00:01:59.820> gonna<00:01:59.939> put<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.329> its<00:02:00.479> moves<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.219> level<00:02:02.219> 47

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
I'm gonna put up its moves here level 47

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.359 
I'm gonna put up its moves here level 47

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.980 
shockwave agility nastyplot and baton
pass<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.210> kind<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.420> an<00:02:06.540> interesting

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
pass now it's kind of an interesting

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.550 
pass now it's kind of an interesting
strategy

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
strategy

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
strategy
normally<00:02:08.310> ambipom<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> physical

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
normally ambipom is like a physical

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.210 
normally ambipom is like a physical
attacker<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.709> fast<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
attacker because it's really fast and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.520 
attacker because it's really fast and
that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.890 
that
works<00:02:11.830> pretty<00:02:11.950> well<00:02:12.100> but<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.150> strategy<00:02:13.420> here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
works pretty well but the strategy here

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.110 
works pretty well but the strategy here
is<00:02:13.930> he<00:02:14.350> has<00:02:14.440> nastyplot<00:02:15.100> which<00:02:15.550> uses<00:02:15.910> its

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
is he has nastyplot which uses its

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.150 
is he has nastyplot which uses its
special<00:02:16.540> attack<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.840> levels<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.830> agility

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
special attack to levels and agility

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.100 
special attack to levels and agility
which<00:02:18.430> boosts<00:02:18.700> its<00:02:18.880> speed<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.270> levels<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
which boosts its speed to levels and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.900 
which boosts its speed to levels and
then<00:02:20.620> from<00:02:20.830> there<00:02:21.069> if<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.340> uses<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.700> Thanh

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
then from there if it uses the Thanh

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.020 
then from there if it uses the Thanh
pass<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.740> exchange<00:02:23.740> those<00:02:24.340> stat<00:02:24.670> boosts

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
pass it can exchange those stat boosts

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.780 
pass it can exchange those stat boosts
to<00:02:25.060> another<00:02:25.330> Pokemon<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.650> what<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.190> trying<00:02:27.640> to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
to another Pokemon so what you trying to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.970 
to another Pokemon so what you trying to
do<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.150> boost<00:02:28.390> its<00:02:28.690> speed<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.290> special<00:02:29.739> attack

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
do is boost its speed and special attack

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.160 
do is boost its speed and special attack
up<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:30.940> convert<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.420> over<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:32.020> one<00:02:32.140> of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
up and then convert that over to one of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.750 
up and then convert that over to one of
his<00:02:32.319> other<00:02:32.440> stronger<00:02:33.010> Pokemon<00:02:33.400> which<00:02:33.550> can

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
his other stronger Pokemon which can

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.820 
his other stronger Pokemon which can
really<00:02:34.060> give<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.900> lot<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.170> trouble<00:02:35.560> so

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
really give you a lot of trouble so

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.580 
really give you a lot of trouble so
again<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.239> really<00:02:37.930> smart<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.350> be<00:02:38.470> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
again this is really smart to be to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.080 
again this is really smart to be to
knock<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.860> out<00:02:38.920> as<00:02:39.040> quickly<00:02:39.069> as<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.610> can<00:02:39.819> and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
knock it out as quickly as you can and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.940 
knock it out as quickly as you can and
that's<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.660> did<00:02:40.810> with<00:02:40.900> close<00:02:41.140> combat<00:02:41.410> so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
that's what I did with close combat so

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.130 
that's what I did with close combat so
basically<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:43.600> all<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.900> spokeman

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
basically this is with all the spokeman

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.900 
basically this is with all the spokeman
they're<00:02:44.530> all<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> threat<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.220> know<00:02:45.459> boost<00:02:45.700> up

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
they're all a threat you know boost up

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.430 
they're all a threat you know boost up
their<00:02:46.030> stats<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.570> stuff<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:46.959> really<00:02:47.260> just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
their stats and stuff so really just

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.900 
their stats and stuff so really just
have<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.620> go<00:02:47.830> for<00:02:48.040> damage<00:02:48.400> right<00:02:48.610> away<00:02:48.850> you

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.390 
don't want to be messing around too long

strongest Pokemon all the way up at
level<00:03:01.720> 49<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.800> extremely<00:03:03.610> high<00:03:03.790> compared<00:03:04.300> to

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360

the pokel and I have now just like the
other<00:03:07.060> pokemon<00:03:07.540> has<00:03:07.720> charged<00:03:08.110> me<00:03:08.350> but<00:03:08.470> also<00:03:08.590> a

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
other pokemon has charged me but also a

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.410 
other pokemon has charged me but also a
thunder<00:03:09.250> fang<00:03:09.370> which<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.700> another<00:03:10.000> electric

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
thunder fang which is another electric

thunder fang which is another electric
type<00:03:10.569> move<00:03:10.780> only<00:03:11.019> physical<00:03:11.590> based<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.040> then

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
type move only physical based and then

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.340 
type move only physical based and then
it<00:03:12.760> does<00:03:12.910> crunch<00:03:13.330> so<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.840> have<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.050> watch<00:03:14.170> out

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
it does crunch so you have to watch out

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
it does crunch so you have to watch out
for<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.620> if<00:03:14.739> you're<00:03:14.860> using<00:03:14.980> something<00:03:15.280> like

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
for that if you're using something like
