00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.520
 hey people here is the kelvin and in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.980
 This film about a little over again 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.380
 I also talk about a few topics 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.769
 have made notes and that I am in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.960
 My last vacation came on it 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.810
 on this topic and indeed I have in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.150
 his magazine again something to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.400
 read this topic and then have me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.240
 inspired felt a little to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
 to make video 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.099
 it is a topic which is absolutely right now 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.170
 be ridiculed and many of you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.390
 they will not think now though 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.880
 why are you talking about this topic 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.649
 but something of unnecessary it brings 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.780
 Nothing 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.030
 people i would not talk about though 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.530
 I do not think it damn important 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 and if it was not damned 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.660
 will find it effective and that's about it 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.620
 the topic water water for more 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 productivity 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.809
 i was with military instructors for ten years 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.210
 and there were really situations there 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.579
 where we have taken care that the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.439
 Recruit enough drink it even became 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.409
 ordered to drink because very many 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.659
 forget to take liquid 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.850
 and I'm not about the fitness 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 or something else , of course 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.450
 enough water too much with the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.920
 I have to do physical constitution 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.350
 I do not want to give fitness tips right now 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.570
 but from the perspective of an office worker 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.159
 or from the perspective of a photographer 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.500
 Speaking at the computer he sits 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.450
 is on the way, etc 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.509
 and I want to give you the tip always 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.939
 to penetrate much 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.960
 in order to make you feel better and 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.000
 be more productive 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 as said many will prove it if 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.890
 what is your reason for that? 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.710
 there is more important point 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.299
 if he drinks a lot yes then shows 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.369
 he definitely you do not feel so good 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.399
 For example, many people get 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.299
 headache yes why do you get 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.100
 a headache 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.750
 that was also a phase where I am at 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.090
 military has often noticed 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.549
 that is if you do not drink enough 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.740
 then you often get a headache and 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.440
 especially if maybe something out there 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.479
 is colder or not so warm 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.790
 then you just push too little and you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.180
 you have to know one thing 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.160
 at the moment when the need comes 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.190
 to have a drink yes in the moment 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.490
 where you get thirsty it is actually 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.040
 already so late for this request 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.740
 Water is a warning signal that one 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.470
 just now water is needed because of that 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.120
 my tip always penetrates before you 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.130
 the thirst is for the body 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.600
 to fill with memory yes for example 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.310
 I also wrote down everything 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.870
 important is what I have learned 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.430
 I did not invent that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.720
 for example, a glass in the morning 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.670
 water should drink because just the whole 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.350
 night the body just drunk nothing 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.940
 and that's why when you're in the day 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.100
 you should start drinking water 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.600
 By the way, a lot of tips as well 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.940
 me from my personal trainer 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.640
 Andreas has also read from 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.610
 other athletes 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.450
 there is also recommended for example the 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.580
 Water stimulates the circulation of the blood 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.530
 and makes us more powerful one should 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.620
 before a physical load of water 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.820
 drink and so on as I said 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.560
 I do not want this fitness 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.880
 but I just want you 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.680
 They remembered that they too 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.300
 during the day 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.610
 especially when you are sitting at the computer 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.140
 just drinks too little and feels 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.540
 then sometime not so good 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.709
 with me there was also live earlier 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.600
 that was how it stood more and more 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.450
 maybe it could be because of that 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.800
 I did not drink enough and 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.570
 even if he is smiled at this topic 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.130
 or many of you say well now 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.720
 that's not important, I'm 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.800
 I'm not an athlete myself 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.470
 had to drink a lot 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.239
 think about it, if you have enough 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.730
 drinks and what happens if you 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.500
 drinking enough is easy 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.090
 more efficient and productive so 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.440
 These are normal things that one 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.019
 scientifically proven and 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.239
 take so remember Licher road 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.940
 always having a bottle with me 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.130
 here, too , all my drinks 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.410
 next to it and I'll stop then 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.330
 always that at lunchtime 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.640
 already drank my 1 2 liter and 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.020
 then again at noon enough so me 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.550
 look already that I very much 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.310
 I drink even if I'm not athletic 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.900
 have activity and I always try 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.470
 to drink if I do not thirst 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.980
 have 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.660
 because one thinks the thirst is one 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.690
 Warning signal then it is already too late 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.040
 ok thinks about it as i was told 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.760
 it's important to talk about this topic 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.680
 to speak 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.000
 also likes to post your comments or 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.610
 maybe you have a few others 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.830
 tips to be more productive in everyday life 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.750

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.220

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.430
 In this sense, videos reunite
