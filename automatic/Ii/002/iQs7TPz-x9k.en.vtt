speed<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> ring<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.469> that's<00:00:43.770> gonna<00:00:43.920> cause

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
speed in the ring so that's gonna cause

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
but it's gonna cause the employee

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690 
but it's gonna cause the employee
problems<00:00:46.590> begin<00:00:46.860> because<00:00:47.070> he's<00:00:47.370> had<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> face

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
problems begin because he's had to face

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.819 
problems begin because he's had to face
it's<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> while<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.050> always

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
it's not like in a while but always

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.490 
it's not like in a while but always
gonna<00:00:50.070> adapt<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.850> course<00:00:51.090> he's<00:00:51.870> gonna<00:00:52.140> go

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
gonna adapt and of course he's gonna go

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
gonna adapt and of course he's gonna go
and<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.739> his<00:00:52.829> thing<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:53.850> there's<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and do his thing so I think if there's a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.910 
and do his thing so I think if there's a
chance<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.719> him<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.289> either<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> them<00:00:55.800> out

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
chance to him can either one of them out

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
chance to him can either one of them out
of<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.910> he'd<00:00:57.090> get<00:00:57.210> Aamir<00:00:57.510> Khan<00:00:57.690> out

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of there I think he'd get Aamir Khan out

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.889 
of there I think he'd get Aamir Khan out
but<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:59.010> Aamir<00:00:59.280> Khan<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.600> bigger

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
but I think Aamir Khan will be a bigger

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.939 
but I think Aamir Khan will be a bigger
threat<00:01:01.109> soon<00:01:01.410> though<00:01:01.710> okay<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> Khan<00:01:03.890> what<00:01:04.890> do

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
threat soon though okay so Khan what do

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.530 
threat soon though okay so Khan what do
you<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.030> got<00:01:06.210> stopped<00:01:06.479> by

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you think of is you know got stopped by

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
you think of is you know got stopped by
Danny<00:01:06.810> Garcia<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.860> think<00:01:07.950> about<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
Danny Garcia what do you think about the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.420 
Danny Garcia what do you think about the
way<00:01:08.549> he's<00:01:08.700> looked<00:01:08.970> since<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.990> fight<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> how

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
way he's looked since that fight and how

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.170 
way he's looked since that fight and how
his<00:01:11.760> form<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> these<00:01:12.479> day

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
his form is these day

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.800 
his form is these day
I<00:01:14.140> think<00:01:15.070> it's<00:01:15.640> hard<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.180> teach<00:01:16.420> an<00:01:16.570> old<00:01:16.690> dog

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
I think it's hard to teach an old dog

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.510 
I think it's hard to teach an old dog
new<00:01:16.990> tricks<00:01:17.530> even<00:01:17.800> though<00:01:17.890> he's<00:01:18.010> young<00:01:18.040> man

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
new tricks even though he's young man

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.450 
new tricks even though he's young man
like<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:19.480> guy<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:19.690> know<00:01:20.020> as<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.350> fighter<00:01:20.680> wild

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
like the guy you know as a fighter wild

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.640 
like the guy you know as a fighter wild
warrior<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.090> he<00:01:22.600> likes<00:01:22.810> trading<00:01:23.170> punches<00:01:23.320> it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
warrior so he likes trading punches it's

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.870 
warrior so he likes trading punches it's
hard<00:01:23.800> to<00:01:23.890> get<00:01:24.010> him<00:01:24.160> out<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.370> so<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.670> know

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
hard to get him out of that so you know

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.390 
hard to get him out of that so you know
who<00:01:25.000> might<00:01:25.150> come<00:01:25.330> in<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.870> don't<00:01:26.140> like<00:01:26.310> three<00:01:27.310> or
