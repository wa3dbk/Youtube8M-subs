00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.090
 hello friends here I have how to correct 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:29.050
 the graphic error 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.599
 in fact they are for years 2 with I want 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.730
 this error we can usually be 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.640
 taking with windows seven and windows 8 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.870
 but here is the good solution for 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.800
 we are going to start it 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.390
 the accessory programs run as 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.730
 administrator notebook 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.960
 once having it open we are going to take 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.090
 the next script 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.090
 that by the way I'll leave it in him 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.380
 in the description of the video 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.200
 it would be this script 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.920
 they have to make sure it's the same 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.640
 just like here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.330
 that would not work 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.450
 in other ways what were 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.759
 well let's file save as 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 unfolds the window to save as 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.890
 We put the name we want for 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.369
 in this case to put proof point pair 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.710
 with that point bat in the termination that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.780
 let's save the video through whatever 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.420
 txt will be point bar 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.700
 remember not I'm just going to save in the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.700
 desk but you usually what 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.369
 you have to save on local disk 07 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.000
 program made by fire or where they have 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.540
 installed in the game 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.520
 I have it installed well in play 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.520
 fact 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 vampires 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.719
 well I've done by country 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.719
 test to save says 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.140
 then we give you to save in the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.510
 desk for you to know 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.640
 what we are creating then we go 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.940
 close and how can they see it appeared test 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.380
 this test is what I already have and what 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.620
 what we have created 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.870
 in the bat file by means of the pad 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.030
 of notes this you already have to have 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.030
 saved you where they have installed 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.150
 the game and the same have to do with 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.030
 the conquero although after that he has 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.710
 another folder where you are also with 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.110
 remained and likewise it has to be the 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.160
 solution as our has been all for 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.319
 today 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.950
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:02.349
 and what they could do subscribe wham 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.349
 or in like reason
