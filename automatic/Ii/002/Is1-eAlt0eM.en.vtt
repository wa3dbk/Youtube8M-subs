00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
highlights all of the enemy equipment

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.969 
highlights all of the enemy equipment
next<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.659> thought<00:01:36.840> I'd<00:01:36.960> quickly<00:01:37.350> touch<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
next I thought I'd quickly touch on the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.010 
next I thought I'd quickly touch on the
range<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.610> engineer<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> range<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
range of engineer and the range of the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.530 
range of engineer and the range of the
black<00:01:40.259> hat<00:01:40.530> PDA<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.159> far<00:01:41.490> less<00:01:41.790> than<00:01:42.060> engineer

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
black hat PDA is far less than engineer

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.870 
black hat PDA is far less than engineer
but<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.710> my<00:01:43.890> buddy<00:01:44.009> c4<00:01:44.640> was

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
but as you can see here my buddy c4 was

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.270 
but as you can see here my buddy c4 was
still<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.509> same<00:01:45.869> doorway<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.070> see

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
still in that same doorway and I can see

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.859 
still in that same doorway and I can see
it<00:01:47.369> almost<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> way<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> back<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
it almost all the way at the back of the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.660 
it almost all the way at the back of the
map<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.619> engineer<00:01:50.009> you'll<00:01:50.220> definitely

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
map so with engineer you'll definitely

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.160 
map so with engineer you'll definitely
not<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> worry<00:01:51.390> about<00:01:51.509> being<00:01:51.780> caught<00:01:52.020> off

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
not have to worry about being caught off

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.840 
not have to worry about being caught off
guard<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.560> claymores<00:01:53.070> baddies<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.640> anything

guard with claymores baddies or anything

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.819 
guard with claymores baddies or anything
like<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.180> now<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> funny<00:01:55.170> part<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.530> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
like that now the funny part about that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.289 
like that now the funny part about that
statement<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.460> even<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> are

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
statement is that even if you are

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
statement is that even if you are
somehow<00:01:57.689> caught<00:01:58.079> off<00:01:58.229> guard<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.770> doesn't<00:01:59.189> even

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
somehow caught off guard it doesn't even

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.789 
somehow caught off guard it doesn't even

claymores there already but I can strafe
right<00:02:30.330> past<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.080> won't<00:02:31.200> explode<00:02:31.650> until

after I'm already by it now lastly with
engineer<00:02:34.740> as<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.100> said<00:02:35.340> you're<00:02:35.580> allowed<00:02:35.670> to

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
engineer as I said you're allowed to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.780 
engineer as I said you're allowed to
re-roll<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.840> booby-trap<00:02:37.440> care<00:02:37.740> packages<00:02:38.280> now

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
re-roll and booby-trap care packages now

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.430 
re-roll and booby-trap care packages now
you<00:02:38.850> can<00:02:39.060> clearly<00:02:39.270> reroll<00:02:39.810> your<00:02:39.990> own<00:02:40.170> care

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
you can clearly reroll your own care

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.560 
you can clearly reroll your own care
packages<00:02:40.920> by<00:02:41.100> double-tapping<00:02:41.490> X<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.450> it's

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
packages by double-tapping X but it's

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.390 
packages by double-tapping X but it's
actually<00:02:42.959> very<00:02:42.990> interesting<00:02:43.920> how<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.160> works

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
actually very interesting how it works

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.880 
actually very interesting how it works
with<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> enemy<00:02:45.150> care<00:02:45.390> package<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:46.800> you

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
with the enemy care package so if you

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.320 
with the enemy care package so if you
manage<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.310> find<00:02:47.520> an<00:02:47.730> enemy<00:02:47.940> care<00:02:48.300> package

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
manage to find an enemy care package

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.510 
manage to find an enemy care package
you're<00:02:48.870> gonna<00:02:48.990> go<00:02:49.170> ahead<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.620> run<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
you're gonna go ahead and run up to it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.920 
you're gonna go ahead and run up to it
and<00:02:50.700> then<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.270> double<00:02:51.540> tap<00:02:51.690> go

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
and then if you want to double tap go

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.930 
and then if you want to double tap go
ahead<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.739> double<00:02:53.130> tap<00:02:53.280> an<00:02:53.430> enemy<00:02:53.730> care

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
ahead you can double tap an enemy care

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.430 
ahead you can double tap an enemy care
package<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.540> then<00:02:54.930> when<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.110> go<00:02:55.230> ahead<00:02:55.320> and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
package and then when you go ahead and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.380 
package and then when you go ahead and
take<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:56.100> leaves<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.610> there<00:02:56.640> for<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.090> enemy

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
take it it leaves it there for the enemy

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.510 
take it it leaves it there for the enemy
but<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.690> actually<00:02:58.140> now<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.320> booby<00:02:58.739> trap<00:02:58.770> so

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
but it's actually now a booby trap so

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.220 
but it's actually now a booby trap so
you<00:02:59.580> get<00:02:59.940> what's<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.270> there<00:03:00.390> care<00:03:00.630> package<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
you get what's in there care package and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.900 
you get what's in there care package and
it<00:03:01.590> explodes<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.190> them<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.580> see<00:03:02.880> right

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
it explodes on them as you see right

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.850 
it explodes on them as you see right
there<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.989> pretty<00:03:04.110> much<00:03:04.230> wraps<00:03:04.470> up<00:03:04.739> this

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
there so that pretty much wraps up this

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.080 
there so that pretty much wraps up this
perk<00:03:05.130> guide<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.520> as<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.700> guys<00:03:05.820> can<00:03:06.030> tell
