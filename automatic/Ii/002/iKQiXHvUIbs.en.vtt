00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.440 

and<00:02:21.220> what<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.640> did<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.020> stuck<00:02:23.320> my<00:02:23.530> tail<00:02:24.450> right

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and what I did is I stuck my tail right

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
there in the beginning of the chain nine

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.900 
there in the beginning of the chain nine
so<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.750> would<00:02:29.020> know<00:02:29.230> not<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.130> go<00:02:30.250> past<00:02:30.490> that

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
so that I would know not to go past that

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.860 
so that I would know not to go past that
so<00:02:31.150> now<00:02:31.210> I'm<00:02:31.300> going<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.510> pull<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.780> out<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.970> we
