00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.009
 you have certainly all recognized a 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.709
 geranium finally its real botanical name 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.630
 a pelargonium is in any case whatever 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:11.059
 either his name he really deserved his 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.250
 title of king of the balconies indeed he 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.349
 blooms continuously and abundantly 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.710
 from May to the first 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.840
 frosts 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.760
 there are a multitude of varieties 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.130
 divided into three groups 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.109
 you have zonal geraniums at port 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.939
 erected like this and you have them 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.189
 Falling port geraniums that are called 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.140
 the ivory geraniums thirst their double 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.150
 or simple flowers like this it 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.670
 exists a whole range of colors you 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.130
 have all the shades of the red of the rose 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.470
 you have orange roses seals 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.690
 white money or even purple 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.070
 stripping too are very decorative 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.840
 they can be simply to 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.630
 like here and you have foliage 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.880
 bicolor see tricolor is very often 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.070
 the leaves are scented yourselves 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.950
 some geraniol that can smell the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.790
 mint the apple the lemongrass see the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.200
 pink or orange 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.720
 it's a plant that you can 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.090
 use in the borders 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.950
 but above all, she does wonders in a pot 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.510
 in tray or gardener that's what I 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.220
 am going to do here because it's a 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.600
 plant that is perennial in his country 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.310
 of origin South Africa 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.930
 but at home she is not at all 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.280
 rustic so we'll take a potty father 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.280
 it is of course for good drainage 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.380
 if you plant it and in the garden 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.790
 greatly enrich the earth with a 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.200
 good potting soil and organic matter 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.620
 it is a greedy plant 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.790
 I'm going to soak her in the water 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.980
 as it is a fragile plant is the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.900
 will of course plant in spring and 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.180
 preference after singles to sonoma 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.260
 to avoid losing 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.010
 plants with small jellies 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.570
 spring and if you want it 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.550
 bloom a lot you put it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.460
 really in a sunny location 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.690
 do not hesitate then to fertilize 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.750
 regularly and water regularly 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.700
 during the entire flowering period the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.210
 only interview will be to eliminate the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.400
 wilted flowers 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.260
 it will stimulate this flowering and 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.700
 delete for aesthetics the leaves 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.100
 damaged 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.630
 after this winter when the frost will arrive I 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.310
 go the flaps of two-thirds she's 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.410
 returned to a bright room and no 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.420
 heated I have a frost-free veranda which 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.700
 is perfect for that and a little 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.650
 tip for the holidays 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.599
 before leaving cut all the flowers 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.940
 your geraniums we will be again 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.319
 covered when you get in 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.300
 geraniums will do wonders in 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.569
 association with all plants 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.069
 summer annuals like the petunias the 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.440
 ten dishes of mine the verbena 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.959
 cascades etc and of course you can 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.470
 also play on colors the hotpot 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.739
 is ready 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.830
 we'll go put it up so I 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.140
 will put it on a skin role first 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.390
 I could overcome it more easily 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.250
 and then like most plants the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.720
 geranium hate having the roots that 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.670
 bathe in the water so that will facilitate 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.709
 the flow and that's my pelargonium 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.900
 puts up it's gone for six months 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.130
 blooming - and I also invite you to 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.130
 discover the perennial geraniums
