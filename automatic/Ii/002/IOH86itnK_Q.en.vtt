the<00:02:12.900> adventure<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:15.210> then<00:02:15.660> just<00:02:16.140> after

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
the adventure and and then just after

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.449

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and it was also my inspiration and that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.460 
and it was also my inspiration and that
was<00:02:25.260> really<00:02:25.470> tough<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:25.920> me<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.400> take<00:02:27.440> how<00:02:28.440> I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
was really tough for me to take how I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.190 
was really tough for me to take how I
got<00:02:29.070> over<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.430> hurdle<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.330> started<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
got over that hurdle is I started to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.490 
got over that hurdle is I started to
think<00:02:31.230> about<00:02:31.940> what<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:32.970> person<00:02:33.900> would<00:02:34.110> want

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
think about what that person would want

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.590 
think about what that person would want
me<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.040> take<00:02:35.370> from<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.880> really<00:02:36.330> sad

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
me to take from this really sad

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.290 
me to take from this really sad
experience<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.540> strength<00:02:41.270> so<00:02:42.270> I

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
experience and it was strength so I

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.660 
experience and it was strength so I
didn't<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.959> start<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.739> running<00:02:44.070> adventure

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
didn't just start the running adventure

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.310 
didn't just start the running adventure
again<00:02:45.090> from<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.380> actually<00:02:47.060> started

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
again from that I actually started

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.920 
again from that I actually started
stronger<00:02:49.320> than<00:02:49.620> before

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:04.309 

I<00:02:55.640> won't<00:02:56.640> be<00:02:56.879> nosy<00:03:00.379> it's<00:03:01.379> about<00:03:01.560> knowing<00:03:03.319> that

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
I won't be nosy it's about knowing that

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.319 
I won't be nosy it's about knowing that
throughout<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:05.099> journey<00:03:05.159> it's<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
throughout this journey it's the

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.630 
throughout this journey it's the
inevitable<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.439> everything's<00:03:08.129> gonna<00:03:08.370> go

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
inevitable that everything's gonna go

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.530 
inevitable that everything's gonna go
wrong<00:03:09.439> I've<00:03:10.439> gone<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.129> wrong<00:03:11.989> oh<00:03:14.239> maybe<00:03:15.239> not

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
wrong I've gone the wrong oh maybe not

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.949 
wrong I've gone the wrong oh maybe not
everything<00:03:15.989> but<00:03:16.260> lots<00:03:17.129> can<00:03:17.519> go<00:03:17.700> wrong<00:03:17.969> and<00:03:18.780> I

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
everything but lots can go wrong and I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.289 
everything but lots can go wrong and I
can't<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.530> away<00:03:19.620> from<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.000> quicker

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
can't get away from that so the quicker

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.490 
can't get away from that so the quicker
I<00:03:21.510> accept<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.150> suppose<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:25.019> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
I accept it then I suppose the the
