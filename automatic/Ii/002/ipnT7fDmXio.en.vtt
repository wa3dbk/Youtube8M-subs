00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the first time you're beating them it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170 
the first time you're beating them it
when<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.920> beat<00:01:41.070> level<00:01:41.100> 3<00:01:41.550> did<00:01:41.730> you<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:41.970> gem

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
when you beat level 3 did you get a gem

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.000 
when you beat level 3 did you get a gem
and<00:01:42.360> when<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> beat<00:01:42.690> level<00:01:42.720> four<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.740> got<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
and when you beat level four you got the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.650 
and when you beat level four you got the
gem<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.370> Frog<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.150> to<00:01:45.210> know<00:01:45.300> I

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
gem in the Frog I just want to know I

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.690 
gem in the Frog I just want to know I
don't<00:01:46.260> see<00:01:46.380> why<00:01:46.650> would<00:01:46.920> work<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.310> way<00:01:47.400> but<00:01:47.460> if

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
don't see why would work that way but if

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.830 
don't see why would work that way but if
it<00:01:47.790> didn't<00:01:48.000> work<00:01:48.120> away<00:01:48.330> that'd<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.720> little

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
it didn't work away that'd be a little

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.750 
it didn't work away that'd be a little
unfair<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.470> opinion<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:50.340> when<00:01:50.580> we

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
unfair in my opinion because when we

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.850 
unfair in my opinion because when we
beat<00:01:50.970> them<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.300> while<00:01:51.480> ago<00:01:51.510> they<00:01:52.080> for<00:01:52.440> level<00:01:52.680> 3

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
beat them a while ago they for level 3

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.130 
beat them a while ago they for level 3
we<00:01:53.010> got<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.160> gem<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.120> then<00:01:54.510> now<00:01:54.660> we<00:01:54.720> would<00:01:55.050> be

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
we got a gem and then now we would be

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.770 
we got a gem and then now we would be
four<00:01:55.440> we<00:01:55.620> get<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> gem<00:01:55.980> in<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.160> frog<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> assume

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
four we get a gem in a frog so I assume

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.360 
four we get a gem in a frog so I assume
if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.350> haven't<00:01:58.620> beat<00:01:58.740> these<00:01:58.920> yet<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
if you haven't beat these yet and you
