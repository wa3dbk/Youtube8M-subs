00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
a coin toss on him but it's not too bad

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.930 
a coin toss on him but it's not too bad
though<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:56.590> after<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.830> decided<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.670> jump

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
though and after that I decided to jump

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.430 
though and after that I decided to jump
into<00:02:59.150> another<00:02:59.330> game<00:02:59.750> but<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.020> time<00:03:00.230> round

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
into another game but this time round

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.300 
into another game but this time round
without<00:03:00.680> gold<00:03:01.100> squad<00:03:01.490> and<00:03:01.670> this<00:03:02.240> was<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
without gold squad and this was the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.950 
without gold squad and this was the
semifinals<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.580> believe<00:03:05.180> off<00:03:05.420> the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
semifinals I believe off the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.480

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
the Premier League squad and this was a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.020 
the Premier League squad and this was a
really<00:03:09.380> good<00:03:09.740> opponent<00:03:10.310> he<00:03:10.640> was<00:03:10.760> playing

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
really good opponent he was playing

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.850 
really good opponent he was playing
defensive<00:03:11.570> also<00:03:11.960> defensive<00:03:12.380> not<00:03:12.530> too<00:03:12.710> sure

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
defensive also defensive not too sure

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.590 
defensive also defensive not too sure
which<00:03:13.070> one<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.340> them<00:03:13.490> but<00:03:13.790> he<00:03:13.970> had<00:03:14.090> no<00:03:14.300> players

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
which one of them but he had no players

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.450 
which one of them but he had no players
up<00:03:14.780> on<00:03:14.900> conocer<00:03:15.380> anything<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.280> it

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
up on conocer anything like that and it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.100 
up on conocer anything like that and it
was<00:03:16.550> just<00:03:16.700> really<00:03:16.790> difficult<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.690> break<00:03:17.900> him

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
was just really difficult to break him

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.660 
was just really difficult to break him
down<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.590> he<00:03:18.980> did<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.160> really<00:03:19.250> good<00:03:19.610> job

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
down and he did a really good job

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.150 
down and he did a really good job
defending<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:20.570> at<00:03:20.660> halftime<00:03:20.870> not<00:03:21.650> much<00:03:21.890> stuff

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
defending so at halftime not much stuff

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.790 
defending so at halftime not much stuff
happen<00:03:22.580> but<00:03:23.180> it's<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.510> same<00:03:23.750> half<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.320> worst

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
happen but it's the same half the worst

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.340 
happen but it's the same half the worst
thing<00:03:25.130> happened<00:03:25.640> basically<00:03:26.120> because<00:03:26.690> he

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
thing happened basically because he

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.320 
thing happened basically because he
didn't<00:03:27.590> create<00:03:27.740> too<00:03:27.800> much<00:03:28.040> either<00:03:28.310> but<00:03:28.490> he

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
didn't create too much either but he

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.360 
didn't create too much either but he
would<00:03:29.480> find<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.810> bit<00:03:30.020> of<00:03:30.110> space<00:03:30.380> take<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.010> long

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
would find a bit of space take a long

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.330 
would find a bit of space take a long
shot<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.970> went<00:03:32.510> in<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.890> first<00:03:34.070> time<00:03:34.310> I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
shot and went in and the first time I

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.770 
shot and went in and the first time I
just<00:03:34.550> couldn't<00:03:34.820> break<00:03:35.060> him<00:03:35.090> down<00:03:35.270> and<00:03:35.690> that

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
just couldn't break him down and that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.180 
just couldn't break him down and that
was<00:03:35.900> kind<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.350> picture<00:03:36.710> of<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.920> second

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
was kind of the picture of the second

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.800 
was kind of the picture of the second
half<00:03:37.280> as<00:03:37.430> well<00:03:37.610> I<00:03:37.820> just<00:03:38.210> couldn't<00:03:38.450> break<00:03:38.630> down

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
half as well I just couldn't break down

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.540 
half as well I just couldn't break down
his<00:03:38.960> defense<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.500> my<00:03:39.620> defenders<00:03:40.160> they<00:03:40.310> just

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
his defense and my defenders they just

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.150 
his defense and my defenders they just
didn't<00:03:41.090> really<00:03:41.330> overall<00:03:42.320> just<00:03:42.590> didn't<00:03:42.890> really

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
didn't really overall just didn't really

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.130 
didn't really overall just didn't really
play<00:03:43.370> as<00:03:43.490> I<00:03:43.520> want<00:03:43.760> them<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:43.940> never<00:03:44.720> really<00:03:44.990> got

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
play as I want them to never really got

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.840 
play as I want them to never really got
the<00:03:45.260> good<00:03:45.410> touches<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.950> good<00:03:46.130> passes<00:03:46.640> and

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
the good touches the good passes and

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.280 
the good touches the good passes and
this<00:03:47.060> was<00:03:47.270> kind<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.600> picture<00:03:47.959> offered<00:03:48.200> but

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290

this was kind of a picture offered but
luckily<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.920> wouldn't<00:03:49.190> score<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.610> but<00:03:50.180> yeah

stats he had quite a few more shots than

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.520 
stats he had quite a few more shots than
me<00:04:13.400> after<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:13.760> went<00:04:13.880> up<00:04:14.090> one<00:04:14.300> nil<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.810> tried<00:04:15.350> to

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
me after I went up one nil I tried to

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.140 
me after I went up one nil I tried to
push<00:04:15.740> forward<00:04:16.040> but<00:04:16.370> couldn't<00:04:16.700> really<00:04:16.850> create

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
push forward but couldn't really create

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150 
push forward but couldn't really create
anything<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.600> he<00:04:17.690> could<00:04:18.109> get<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.709> few<00:04:18.920> chances

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
anything and he could get a few chances

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.710 
anything and he could get a few chances
on<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.670> counter<00:04:20.060> attacks<00:04:20.330> but<00:04:20.510> nonetheless

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
on the counter attacks but nonetheless

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.290 
on the counter attacks but nonetheless
we<00:04:21.470> got<00:04:21.650> our<00:04:21.799> third<00:04:22.010> loss<00:04:22.220> as<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.490> said<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.180> that

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
we got our third loss as I said and that

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.420 
we got our third loss as I said and that
means<00:04:23.570> we<00:04:23.990> did<00:04:24.290> not<00:04:24.470> reach<00:04:24.710> nine<00:04:24.979> which<00:04:25.220> one

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
means we did not reach nine which one

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.870 
means we did not reach nine which one
got<00:04:25.640> six<00:04:25.940> wins<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:26.540> we

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
got six wins so we

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.730

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
little fake shall we find a bit of space

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.530 
little fake shall we find a bit of space
Quincy<00:05:43.050> you'll<00:05:43.590> get<00:05:43.890> a<00:05:43.920> go<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.280> make<00:05:44.760> it<00:05:44.970> 2-1

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
Quincy you'll get a go to make it 2-1

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.780 
Quincy you'll get a go to make it 2-1
and<00:05:45.810> that<00:05:46.290> is<00:05:46.470> pretty<00:05:46.680> much<00:05:46.800> how<00:05:47.100> the<00:05:47.130> game<00:05:47.490> and

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
and that is pretty much how the game and

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.250 
and that is pretty much how the game and
so<00:05:48.030> it<00:05:48.120> was<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.330> game<00:05:48.600> where<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:48.870> ended<00:05:49.170> up

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
so it was a game where I ended up

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.590 
so it was a game where I ended up
trailing<00:05:49.650> in<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.520> first<00:05:50.670> half<00:05:51.090> and<00:05:51.240> it<00:05:51.360> took<00:05:51.510> a

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
trailing in the first half and it took a

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.720 
trailing in the first half and it took a
long<00:05:51.840> time<00:05:51.900> before<00:05:52.350> I<00:05:52.680> got<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:53.010> equalizer<00:05:53.460> and

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
long time before I got the equalizer and

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.640 
long time before I got the equalizer and
eventually<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.180> would<00:05:54.510> also<00:05:54.780> get<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.290> second

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
eventually I would also get the second

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.010 
eventually I would also get the second
goal<00:05:55.680> win<00:05:56.010> the<00:05:56.130> game<00:05:56.370> and<00:05:56.580> that<00:05:57.390> is<00:05:57.600> going<00:05:57.930> to

goal win the game and that is going to

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.470 
goal win the game and that is going to
