00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.950
 how about friends how are you subscribers 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.990
 saints welcome to this episode of 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 managers max payne of grand theft auto 5 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.150
 looking for weird stuff 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.150
 I just got this month max payne 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.330
 Well look more experience 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.520
 was to buy a shirt a shirt 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.380
 Hawaiian cut the hair from the outside 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.029
 speak complemente it seems the accompanying 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.640
 see forget that today's video 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:36.430
 let's go and show you how 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.010
 make us with a jet fighter I have already 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.250
 preferred is preferable to go with trevor 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.850
 which is the one that has a lot of skill 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.850
 after 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.430
 I found a better one that is the most can 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.290
 and with anyone you can with any 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.090
 but I'm going to say contribute 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.900
 because since it has a little more than 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.880
 skill with handling aircraft and 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.490
 let's mark the map is exactly 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.100
 here crossing this is a bridge going on 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.770
 this poet is the military 200 we are going to 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 call a taxi to leave us there 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 because to make it shorter 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.770
 I'm going to call a taxi, don elÃ­as 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.290
 and then most likely not 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.210
 brunette always arrive at least in 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.940
 this game does not die nor five 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.300
 seconds targa 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:39.159
 in what part of the city do they study this 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:42.270
 good 31 you see very relievers and the taxi 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.270
 the shortest plot 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.060
 really traveling by taxi is a good 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.659
 option to make missions cut and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.109
 save time on traveling and those things 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 I am very much then here I now have 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.000
 than doing it with a taxi or a vehicle 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.310
 because I need to enter the base and not 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.670
 I will achieve 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.470
 any mother please die in a way 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.429
 parallel 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.739
 i 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.740
 he was not pulling fagot away anymore 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.360
 it matters what good 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.360
 He left the car and what I need 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.220
 the truth behind me pretty 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.130
 and we have to arrive and enter the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.910
 zafarranchos won more 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.390
 if not to dodge for nothing because of 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.990
 Immediately you go up to four stars 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.280
 level of search to anyone you 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.940
 they start looking for everything that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.190
 federal in this case the military in 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.760
 tanks I think there are also 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.950
 and silent so we have here a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.599
 hangar to bring to the fund 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.950
 is the ranchera music of the first year and 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.310
 he loves you 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.460
 or set to these facilities that they 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.130
 fastest possible 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.490
 a monster but you achieve 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.100
 let's go doggy 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.930
 this game I want to shoot favre of 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.240
 shit 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.360
 with the taxi next 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:22.370
 and a lot 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.370
 a fierce and we are safe 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.180
 all right 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.450
 only already a beautiful stolen good 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.450
 we have 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.180
 tragically if you are looking for you can 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.760
 select objective selection 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.480
 automatic cannon 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.480
 of s 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:49.300
 121 good 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.300
 and it also marked 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.750
 clearly you can have it the plane 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.900
 with bam bam and maneuverability 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.550
 naturally you have a fighter plane 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.260
 and it also helped you to explore everything 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.030
 what the jumps of a single trip the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.680
 only problem do not see in problems and there 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.930
 to get more or less the level of 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.330
 search but nothing in a with this plane 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.330
 you move away from people or you take height 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.730
 yesterday I took 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.970
 let's try to 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.289
 to take our plane to the hangar of 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.410
 trevor to see if we can stay 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.410
 with 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.980
 with that action you touch 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.150
 we already lost the policy 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.379
 I'm going to a lot of speed 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.950
 we're going to take and I do not think I made it very 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.090
 Quick 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.090
 will extend message 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:56.820
 good 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.630
 pauli set 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.110
 good cabro 6 as always light 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.110
 favorites
