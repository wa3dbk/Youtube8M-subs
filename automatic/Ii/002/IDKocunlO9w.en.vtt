00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.080
 or the YouTube sales person as 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.620
 have been hoping that super good in this 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.190
 occasion I come to bring you this video 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:34.520
 is to differentiate or to know how 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:38.400
 recognize a true someone else's 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.670
 so I have here is original 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.670
 is the zinc snow or something like that 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.040
 girlfriend 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.630
 this is the original this I have here 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.810
 it's exactly the pink water but in the 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.810
 replica 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.730
 the box on the outside to recognize it from 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.190
 certain way 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.190
 the box is less black than the original 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.990
 the letters are yellow or like a 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.570
 very dirty white and this is white white 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.230
 the serial number of the original 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.010
 is to 53 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.350
 since the replica is 32 to recognize it 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.760
 simply by the box the way more 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.040
 simple clear would be to realize that 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.600
 a replica is clearer the box and more 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.600
 dark of the letters that the original 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.420
 Y 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.760
 ah 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.189
 but since that's hard enough, let's go 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.189
 to open them 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.240
 open 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.290
 the packaging is very similar only 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.210
 the replica that is this is a little more 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.539
 higher than the other 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.990
 a simple way to recognize it is 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.569
 that the sea the original frame is like that 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.629
 a gray with silver sparkles 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.319
 and the replica is only black with certain 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.319
 bright flashes 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.640
 Y 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.630
 and it's very easy to recognize them but if 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.630
 they want to recognize it even easier 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.760
 the two are the same tone this is the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.330
 original this is the replica 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.569
 look at the color is pink is a ros ha 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.980
 opaque and this and this is like image 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:10.560
 also original replica realize 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.620
 not even the color is the same 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.280
 apart see the shape of the angle of the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.600
 original lip 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.600
 and that of the replica 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.100
 This is very curved 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.460
 and this is more planet 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.840
 and so you know the lip 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.690
 simply with seeing the tone they will know 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.790
 that is not the original 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.230
 this is the replica of this and I do not know 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.010
 the color appears absolutely in nothing 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.310
 apart 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.820
 the final macri lip is more chubby 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.820
 than the other 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.750
 more chubby 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.520
 Y 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.070
 and already if they feel that the color is very 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.819
 similar and they doubt that it is a 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.730
 replication this does not fail 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.180
 others smell rich like chocolate or 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.680
 sweet and the replica does not smell 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.680
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.620
 and these are the tips that I can give you 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.530
 Give to recognize an original mac 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.790
 I thought it was more difficult 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.180
 distinguish the truth the replica of a 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.120
 labial but just yesterday I went to 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.880
 buy one to explain how 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.220
 recognize it is because I had a lot of 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.990
 question of how to recognize one and not me 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.200
 they found no video or any 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.030
 review that they tell you how to do it 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.810
 Then I got a very good idea 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.840
 and I hope that it serves them that has 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.930
 helped more nice people from youtube 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.380
 thanks for watching this video I want them 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.380
 bye
