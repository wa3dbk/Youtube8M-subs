00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
pretty cool idea but I don't think that

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.580 
pretty cool idea but I don't think that
really<00:01:23.220> gives<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.939> impact<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:25.080> anything

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
really gives an impact on anything

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.149 
really gives an impact on anything
nothing<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.460> about<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.540> job<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> Holy

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
nothing here about the job or the Holy

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.550 
nothing here about the job or the Holy
players<00:01:29.520> play<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.210> never<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.170> noticed<00:01:31.320> an

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
players play I never really noticed an

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.960 
players play I never really noticed an
impact<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.700> think<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.119> what<00:01:33.650> Kyle

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
impact and I think that's what Kyle

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.460 
impact and I think that's what Kyle
person<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.090> trying<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.450> say<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
person is trying to say is that if you

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.440 
person is trying to say is that if you
do<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.490> should<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.820> an<00:01:38.909> impact<00:01:39.180> on

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
do this you should have an impact on

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840
