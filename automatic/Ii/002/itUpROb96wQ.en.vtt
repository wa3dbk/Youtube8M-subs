he's a awesome session guitar player in

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.790 
he's a awesome session guitar player in
LA<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.179> put<00:00:09.389> them<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.630> all<00:00:09.900> kinds<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.349> TV<00:00:10.769> shows

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
LA you put them on all kinds of TV shows

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.580 
LA you put them on all kinds of TV shows
and<00:00:11.400> movies<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.210> things<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.690> we're<00:00:13.230> checking

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
and movies and things and we're checking

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.369 
and movies and things and we're checking
out<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.120> profiling<00:00:15.120> amp<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.750> basically

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
out this profiling amp and basically

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
out this profiling amp and basically
what<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.710> does<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.609> takes<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.119> digital

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
what it does is it takes a digital

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.370 
what it does is it takes a digital
fingerprint<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.650> your<00:00:20.369> amp<00:00:20.670> head<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.449> copies

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
fingerprint of your amp head and copies

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.380 
fingerprint of your amp head and copies
it<00:00:22.410> into<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> sound<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.670> basically<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.359> have

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it into a sound so basically we have

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.970 
it into a sound so basically we have
like<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> /<00:00:25.109> 13<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:27.119> an<00:00:27.240> RSA<00:00:27.840> 31<00:00:28.650> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
like it / 13 and it's an RSA 31 and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
like it / 13 and it's an RSA 31 and
we're<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.820> make<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.269> basically<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.960> copy

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
we're going to make up basically a copy

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740 
we're going to make up basically a copy
of<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.740> head<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.910> digitally<00:00:33.570> but

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
of that head in here digitally but

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810 
of that head in here digitally but
Michael<00:00:34.410> knows<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.649> lot<00:00:34.829> more<00:00:34.890> about<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.550> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
Michael knows a lot more about it so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
Michael knows a lot more about it so
he's<00:00:36.090> gonna<00:00:36.270> let<00:00:37.079> him<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> take<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> away

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
he's gonna let him got to take it away

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
he's gonna let him got to take it away
yeah<00:00:38.370> alright<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> first<00:00:39.360> thing<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
yeah alright so the first thing that you

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.740 
yeah alright so the first thing that you
probably<00:00:40.170> notice<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.219> ant<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:42.360> lots

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
probably notice with this ant are lots

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.209 
probably notice with this ant are lots
of<00:00:42.899> lights<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.590> kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.829> looks<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
of lights it kind of looks like the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.369 
of lights it kind of looks like the
Starship<00:00:44.640> Enterprise<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.629> it's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
Starship Enterprise but it's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
Starship Enterprise but it's
surprisingly<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.550> simple<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.239> navigate

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
surprisingly very simple to navigate

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.069 
surprisingly very simple to navigate
around<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:50.180> basically<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> break<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.989> up

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
around and basically you can break it up

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.510 
around and basically you can break it up
into<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.320> sections<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.070> break<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.340> up

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
into two sections you can break it up

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.569 
into two sections you can break it up
into<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.760> top<00:00:54.000> hat<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.960> bottom<00:00:55.350> half<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.340> top

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
into a top hat and a bottom half the top

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.119 
into a top hat and a bottom half the top
hat<00:00:56.820> acts<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.539> any<00:00:57.899> amp<00:00:58.199> rig<00:00:58.559> okay<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
hat acts just like any amp rig okay you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.819 
hat acts just like any amp rig okay you
have<00:00:59.340> you<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.149> various<00:01:00.719> stomp<00:01:01.199> pedals<00:01:01.590> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
have you have various stomp pedals that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.030 
have you have various stomp pedals that
you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.390> assign<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.750> each<00:01:04.019> each<00:01:04.530> place<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you can assign to each each place you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
you can assign to each each place you
have<00:01:05.129> four<00:01:05.400> places<00:01:06.299> what<00:01:06.570> you're<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
have four places what you're going to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.179 
have four places what you're going to
stomp<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.890> you're<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.130> to

stomp out of this that you're going to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.030 
stomp out of this that you're going to
sign<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.820> stop<00:01:09.119> pedal<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.689> hey<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
sign a stop pedal for hey that's in this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
sign a stop pedal for hey that's in this
section<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> those<00:01:12.030> stop<00:01:12.210> petals<00:01:12.510> can

and reverb switch generally come after
an<00:01:47.130> amplifier<00:01:47.579> those<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.689> these<00:01:48.840> two

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
an amplifier those are in these two

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.160 
an amplifier those are in these two
buttons<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.729> these<00:01:50.880> two<00:01:50.939> slots<00:01:51.840> here

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
buttons and then these two slots here

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.310 
buttons and then these two slots here
you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.860> space<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.549> an<00:01:53.729> extra<00:01:54.090> mod<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.079> great

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you have space for an extra mod so great

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
you have space for an extra mod so great
we're<00:01:56.040> modulation<00:01:56.430> pedal<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:56.939> example<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
we're modulation pedal for example you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
we're modulation pedal for example you
want<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> put<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> chorus<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.140> there<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.890> here

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
want to put a chorus in there and here

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
want to put a chorus in there and here
you<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.549> space<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> wanted<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you have a space for if you wanted to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.010 
you have a space for if you wanted to
throw<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> crazy<00:02:02.159> distortion<00:02:02.969> after<00:02:03.659> your<00:02:03.780> amp

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
throw a crazy distortion after your amp

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.680 
throw a crazy distortion after your amp
or

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
or

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.870 
or
any<00:02:04.810> other<00:02:04.990> pedal<00:02:05.380> they<00:02:05.950> put<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.220> here<00:02:06.430> okay<00:02:06.820> so

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
any other pedal they put it here okay so

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.080 
any other pedal they put it here okay so
that's<00:02:07.210> basically<00:02:07.600> your<00:02:07.930> amp<00:02:08.320> rig<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.970> then

that's basically your amp rig and then

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.660 
that's basically your amp rig and then
you<00:02:10.150> have<00:02:10.330> these<00:02:10.540> quick<00:02:11.070> knobs<00:02:12.070> which<00:02:12.400> allow

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
adjustment you can do that here without

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.040 
adjustment you can do that here without
having<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.210> navigate<00:02:34.390> any<00:02:34.960> any<00:02:36.120> menus<00:02:37.120> ok

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.810 
having to navigate any any menus ok
that's<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.620> top<00:02:38.800> half<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.310> acts<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:39.700> a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
that's the top half just acts like a

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.420 
that's the top half just acts like a
normal<00:02:40.360> camp<00:02:40.570> stack<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.620> bottom<00:02:42.010> half<00:02:42.220> is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
normal camp stack the bottom half is

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.820 
normal camp stack the bottom half is
also<00:02:43.420> pretty<00:02:43.810> simple<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.440> where<00:02:44.710> it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
also pretty simple this is where it

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.470 
also pretty simple this is where it
tells<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.190> everything<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.210> want<00:02:46.270> to

tells you everything that you want to
know<00:02:46.720> about<00:02:46.750> what<00:02:47.170> you're<00:02:47.290> adjusting<00:02:47.560> these

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
know about what you're adjusting these

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.230 
know about what you're adjusting these
your<00:02:48.670> quick<00:02:48.990> knob<00:02:49.990> adjustments<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.880> an<00:02:52.090> amp

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
your quick knob adjustments on an amp

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.040 
your quick knob adjustments on an amp
for<00:02:52.540> bass<00:02:52.840> treble<00:02:54.120> mints<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.330> prisons<00:02:55.840> as

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
for bass treble mints and prisons as

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.910 
for bass treble mints and prisons as
well<00:02:56.650> as<00:02:56.860> gain<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.520> your<00:02:58.060> output<00:02:58.570> volume<00:02:58.920> for

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
well as gain and your output volume for

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.250 
well as gain and your output volume for
that<00:03:00.130> legally<00:03:00.910> channel<00:03:01.300> so<00:03:01.660> it's<00:03:01.900> actually

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
that legally channel so it's actually

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.980 
that legally channel so it's actually
pretty<00:03:03.040> simple<00:03:03.400> amp<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:04.420> navigate<00:03:04.840> your<00:03:04.930> way

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
pretty simple amp to navigate your way

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.110 
pretty simple amp to navigate your way
around<00:03:05.080> but<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.340> whole<00:03:06.460> thing<00:03:06.520> about<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.030> is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
around but the whole thing about it is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
around but the whole thing about it is
the<00:03:07.150> profiling<00:03:07.690> yeah<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.560> we<00:03:08.770> should

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
the profiling yeah so we should

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.890 
the profiling yeah so we should
basically<00:03:09.280> we're<00:03:09.760> going<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:09.940> plug<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> /

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
basically we're going to plug in the /

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.870 
basically we're going to plug in the /
we're<00:03:11.560> going<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.739> hear<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.190> amp<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.700> then

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
we're going to hear that amp and then

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.979 
we're going to hear that amp and then
it's<00:03:13.060> going<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.239> we're<00:03:13.630> going<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.780> make<00:03:13.930> a

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
it's going to we're going to make a

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.800 
it's going to we're going to make a
sample<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.890> yeah<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.610> like<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.060> patch<00:03:16.390> or

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
sample of it yeah so like a patch or

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.380 
sample of it yeah so like a patch or
exactly<00:03:17.620> okay<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.340> we<00:03:18.459> do<00:03:18.580> is<00:03:18.700> we<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:19.239> we

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
exactly okay so we do is we have but we

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.780 
exactly okay so we do is we have but we
actually<00:03:19.510> have<00:03:19.840> his<00:03:20.080> /<00:03:20.410> going<00:03:21.340> through<00:03:21.610> the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
actually have his / going through the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.460 
actually have his / going through the
amp<00:03:22.000> ok<00:03:22.600> we're<00:03:22.930> going<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.080> listen<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.440> that

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
amp ok we're going to listen to that

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.140 
microphone in front of it the
microphones<00:03:52.290> coming<00:03:52.530> back<00:03:52.680> through<00:03:52.890> an<00:03:52.950> API

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
microphones coming back through an API

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.539 
microphones coming back through an API
preamp<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.659> API<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.200> being<00:03:55.500> returned<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.189> the

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
preamp the API is being returned to the

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.059 
preamp the API is being returned to the
back<00:03:56.849> of<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:58.049> just<00:03:58.230> one<00:03:58.379> big<00:03:58.650> loop

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
back of this so it's just one big loop

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.970 
back of this so it's just one big loop
okay<00:03:59.609> so<00:04:00.329> that's<00:04:00.810> what<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:00.989> amp<00:04:01.409> sounds<00:04:01.829> like

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
okay so that's what that amp sounds like

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.440 
okay so that's what that amp sounds like
now<00:04:02.250> we're<00:04:02.400> actually<00:04:02.519> going<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.819> profile<00:04:03.269> in

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
now we're actually going to profile in

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.869 
now we're actually going to profile in
the<00:04:03.480> profile<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.319> real<00:04:04.590> simple<00:04:04.799> or<00:04:05.790> in

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
the profile that is real simple or in

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.819 
the profile that is real simple or in
the<00:04:05.940> profiling<00:04:06.359> menu<00:04:06.840> we're<00:04:07.379> just<00:04:07.500> going<00:04:07.709> to

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
the profiling menu we're just going to

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.369 
the profiling menu we're just going to
tell<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.639> that<00:04:08.700> it's<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.150> distorted<00:04:09.720> sound<00:04:10.049> so

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
tell it that it's a distorted sound so

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.140 
tell it that it's a distorted sound so
just<00:04:10.709> going<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.889> profile<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.250> distorted<00:04:11.760> sounds

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
just going to profile a distorted sounds

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.210 
just going to profile a distorted sounds
okay<00:04:12.510> then<00:04:12.989> we're<00:04:13.170> going<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.319> hit<00:04:13.500> start

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
okay then we're going to hit start

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.879 
okay then we're going to hit start
profiling<00:04:14.430> with<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.269> button<00:04:15.659> and<00:04:15.840> then<00:04:16.650> you

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
profiling with this button and then you

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:17.990 
profiling with this button and then you
might<00:04:17.039> not<00:04:17.070> be<00:04:17.310> able<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.579> hear<00:04:17.789> it<00:04:17.880> because

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
might not be able to hear it because

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.909 
might not be able to hear it because
you're<00:04:18.359> way<00:04:18.510> over<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.289> amp<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.680> all

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
you're way over there and the amp is all

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.850 
you're way over there and the amp is all
the<00:04:20.430> way<00:04:20.489> in

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.430 

you<00:04:24.860> got<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.160> speaker<00:04:25.490> controller<00:04:25.910> back<00:04:26.440> so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
you got the speaker controller back so

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.840 
you got the speaker controller back so
there's<00:04:27.620> some<00:04:27.740> weird<00:04:27.860> noises<00:04:28.130> going<00:04:28.610> through

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
there's some weird noises going through

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.340 
there's some weird noises going through
it<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:30.410> lasts<00:04:31.220> for<00:04:31.460> about<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.850> know<00:04:31.880> I'm<00:04:32.840> a<00:04:32.900> 30

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
very low pulsating white until I found

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.800 
very low pulsating white until I found
the<00:04:38.990> same<00:04:39.170> and<00:04:39.530> it's<00:04:39.770> going<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.270> end<00:04:41.270> with<00:04:41.570> some

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
the same and it's going to end with some

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.420 
the same and it's going to end with some
big<00:04:42.010> banging<00:04:43.010> noises<00:04:43.490> like<00:04:43.850> that

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:57.550 

in<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.850> moment<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.480> will<00:04:48.600> be<00:04:48.660> done

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.770 

in<00:04:57.830> one<00:04:58.160> moment<00:04:58.340> it<00:04:58.820> will<00:04:58.940> be<00:04:59.060> done<00:04:59.240> does<00:04:59.660> it

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
in one moment it will be done does it

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.510 
in one moment it will be done does it
matter<00:04:59.990> if<00:05:00.139> you<00:05:00.380> play<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.889> sand<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.220> probably

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.850 
matter if you play and sand I probably
don't<00:05:01.669> know<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.350> front<00:05:03.590> end<00:05:03.710> of<00:05:03.800> this

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
don't know this is the front end of this

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.820 
don't know this is the front end of this
is<00:05:04.040> shut<00:05:04.220> off<00:05:04.250> ok<00:05:04.820> so<00:05:04.880> now<00:05:05.270> its<00:05:05.720> profile<00:05:06.200> this

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
is shut off ok so now its profile this

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.220 
is shut off ok so now its profile this
tells<00:05:07.070> us<00:05:07.160> that<00:05:07.310> we<00:05:07.430> profiled<00:05:08.060> ok<00:05:08.360> so<00:05:08.900> when<00:05:09.110> we

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
tells us that we profiled ok so when we

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.600 
tells us that we profiled ok so when we
do<00:05:09.350> is<00:05:09.410> understand<00:05:09.740> me<00:05:09.860> play<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.010> couple<00:05:10.250> chords
