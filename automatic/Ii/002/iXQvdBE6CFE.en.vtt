00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.069
 welcome youtube welcome my 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.349
 subscribers as well as casual viewers 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.769
 as you have seen from the previous video 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.139
 I had a new parcel and did not lie 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.039
 two mora knives 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:25.769
 510 already with my knife 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.539
 I used this as I remind the knife 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.910
 my buddy is still he does not him 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:39.899
 will fall to the rightful owner here and 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:43.260
 worked with his brother and us with a knife 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.600
 the second who went and this knife already 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.250
 did me and then to work and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:01:00.930
 underwent slight changes specifically 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:06.119
 to make it clear using my 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.200
 companion appreciating this clip and and 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.780
 reliability that there are three 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.990
 centimeter to someone centimeter belt 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.909
 clings well also that it can 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.619
 conveniently let's eyebrows on the pants you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.640
 sports that is where there is no time 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.369
 Buy it all appreciated but exactly the way 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.060
 here is a good belt and wants but this one 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.930
 moment I want to be attention here and i am science 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 there is a mount I had already small 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.020
 problems but because the usual trouser 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.290
 leather toner belt comes out here very much 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.900
 heavy 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.170
 Here and so tightly sits that goat 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.870
 that it seems that little pressure on 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.460
 This part on the bottom is needed and 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.760
 this construction is just 3 exactly these 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.710
 here 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.320
 thoughts drove me to what we say 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.140
 small cosmetic changes and so 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.950
 we meet here now 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:15.160
 my model sea 510 is exactly those sorry 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.840
 for which I spoke here I made my 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.590
 suspension as seen 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.470
 this part is standard left i did 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.640
 such as would be external to them if 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.780
 can afford it 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.060
 and I came in this 3 left this 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.510
 part as buller as zhor stiffness 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.820
 insert turned mida 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.450
 Now while I have a big ass 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.300
 loop here and yes of course fast removal 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.000
 This all matters not provides I until 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.920
 This screenshots are not old enough to make such 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.110
 clever clips and heels this is my first 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.090
 work with the skin which let's say not 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.130
 ashamed to show though there is also 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.510
 a bunch of your sins and here I can garden 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.170
 show me my limit 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.799
 which benefit is not the first year and can be seen 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.730
 how easy the biscuit problems is the whole thing 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.730
 hangs himself 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:22.760
 respectively, namely this moment 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:28.359
 I wanted to show you how to 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:32.810
 your court here by the way I want to immediately ask 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.819
 will i leave the color like it is either 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.879
 I have the option of black paint 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.950
 just for skin for exactly for 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.709
 skin staining or mitasu do 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.090
 beautiful 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.230
 write comments because it is like 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.709
 I think about it myself 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.400
 kind of like the skin itself is beautiful 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.840
 the color here has a different side 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.290
 I want it not to stand out much 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.900
 this is my moment on the knife itself 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.719
 but did not sell means it conveniently lies in 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.439
 hand during hard wood work 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:14.620
 we are not on it though again it is not 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:17.780
 then itâ€™s not a crowbar 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.139
 let's say it should be simple usually 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.210
 farm work is permissible in the village 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:31.010
 I already have this knife 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.659
 completed the job of preparing the handle 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.060
 for hammer 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.760
 that is, it was necessary to remove certain 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.650
 layers of wood here to dress 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.720
 chip chip is called the Anatolian part 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.520
 hammer 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.909
 It is all the work on fitting the handle 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.360
 performed with this knife ie work on 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:53.720
 tree estimate is excellent here friends 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.930
 material I have not enjoyed taking 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.250
 small wire again wrong 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.110
 for the test but it was just necessary all over again 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.419
 my knives are a working tool 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.650
 they do n't buy me for beauty and 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.930
 so don't lie just considering 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.400
 works 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.990
 so I say what it is in us 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.150
 work operation by 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.419
 cutting off the rope which was not necessary 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:28.840
 in that place . easy here no problem 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.009
 fits well on the skin is also good in 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.370
 in some cases 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.169
 a day is not enough hardness again 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.240
 I may be too high demands 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.199
 to such 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:43.300
 inexpensive and good and knife present 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:46.660
 the same person apparently my 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.759
 knife valuation worth the money that's who 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.419
 thinks 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:56.729
 for working knife 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:06:03.849
 This is a good option here and I will say this 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:06.310
 mean for working purposes for food for 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:10.060
 work with products it is desirable to take 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:16.479
 there is no such type of Bashar Dasha 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:20.550
 There is a chain from sendrik 12 and 27 as would 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.550
 these are my recommendations my such here 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:29.979
 opinion on this knife fruit per view 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:34.169
 thank you all to leave comments well and 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.169
 I hope there will be a sequel
