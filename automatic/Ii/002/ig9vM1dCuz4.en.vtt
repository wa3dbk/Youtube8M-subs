 happened more than once 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.140

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.690
 map from homer strong place and 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.580
 fired into the rocket into the distance 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.009
 precisely in the distance so that she flew her 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.149
 maximum range and 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.729
 self-destructed then you can 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.190
 sit back pilot and calm 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.820
 there will be no bug flying 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.590
