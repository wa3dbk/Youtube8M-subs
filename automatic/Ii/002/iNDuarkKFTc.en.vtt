00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello my dear friends today once 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.379

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.110
 But I have to give you a match play part 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.290

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.910

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.740
 the binsfelder game is my name 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.359
 favorite example my favorite dish 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520
 Game is the legend of Zelda Twilight 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.590
 princess for the nintendo wii and also 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 both played for the gamecube 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.990
 and I saw no difference 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.939
 only mirrored is the game on 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.009
 In any case, we come to my two 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.320
 favorite station it's zelda the wind 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 waker yes it should be for the wii u 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.149

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.960
 I'll show you some pictures where 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.829
 you can see 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.469
 that's epic so I'm here in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.469
 video from view directly so that's one 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.879
 Presentation of 23 the first 2013 of 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.329
 the ideas and germany channel on 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.210
 youtube 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 now a lot of pictures in it I show 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.719
 these pictures are also from the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.550
 quality of nintendo so therefore have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.019
 I photographed the pictures and set 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.369
 her show you that's her wallet 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.500
 and I will differentiate you now 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.530
 show a moment i watch the whole video 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.270
 continue playing so I see exactly 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.560
 for example pony that is now 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 zeller wind waker from game group and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.240
 now the difference to the eu ok left 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.369
 is view in hd and right of gamecube 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.259
 I already found everything with money 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.680
 pretty nice because it was like I said 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.270
 a kind and graphic I found very much 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.560
 quiet market looks to you now again 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.009
 the view graphic 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.430
 me if the next pictures into it 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.829
 a moment I have to fast forward so 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.710
 then you have the astana team here 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.130
 the vuvuzela demo we have her zelda hd 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.460
 Experiments called yes because it looks exactly 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.409
 again a piece of gamecube and 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:06.750
 now you will see a little bit of 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:09.060
 zelda view wind waker here right epic 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.019
 or what do you say to that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.519
 awesome so I know what you think about it 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.440
 but I think it's just really horny 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.409
 also give new control possibilities 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.909
 and new features so the number like that 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.390
 a little difference to the view and 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.970
 game group 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.930
 so i have to say respect now 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.269
 a photo of itself a few process 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.670
 are still going through a photo of 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.959
 zelda and petras is coming now 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.500
 pirate ship very nice to look at yes 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.120
 and here's left and tetra, after all 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.510
 really cool from what do you say 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.150
 So I think it's awesome and that has one 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.700
 big praise also here behind the woman with 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.430
 the flowers on the head 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.959
 So he really respects so absolute 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.000
 respect he is only i am pleased 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.739
 already on it and I have the once 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.440
 view and then it goes off because you want 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.450
 but ultimately this is what it does 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.750
 which zelda the wind waker after the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.390
 new project what's coming up with autumn 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.890
 move and then he will zelda for it 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.340
 very likely twilight princess 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.340
 come soon yes so there is one more 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.620
 a new yet a new zelda info that 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.090
 new zelda for wii u so after zelda and 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.630
 which one will come again a new one 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.329
 counter 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.040
 it should pass this reallife graphic 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.280
 So it's like on his tour and it's just 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.160

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.260
 a completely new story and will open 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.910
 definitely something for him neither a 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.620
 We do not like skyward 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.919
 sword was a fool for me 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.239
 so good a long development that it 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.370
 Everyone has their own opinion on everyone 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.799
 If there is still a joschi game for 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.290
 the view sometime when exactly it comes 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.840

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.690
 picture for you looks a bit like that 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.040
 how does that mean? 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.769
 Kirby years so for years the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.010

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.840
 its magical and it will be me 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.370
