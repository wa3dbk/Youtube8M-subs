00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello everybody and welcome to one more 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.250
 episode of game theory and today we 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.750
 we will talk about one of the most 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.290
 dark in the saga of the legend of zelda 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.450
 the legend of zelda majora's mask but the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
 what would you say if you said that all 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.160
 your hours spent in the game to prevent 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.670
 that the giant demon-faced light 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.710
 to fall in term it was in vain that link 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 at the beginning of the game he had already died 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.269
 you probably say that I am the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.679
 king of the game or something of the genre but 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.140
 have you heard about the theory of 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.940
 suffering from majora's bent you never 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 You heard about this theory, I'm going 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.710
 explain to you basically what 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 she is well in the world of da land of zelda 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.800
 majora's mask requires five areas 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.039
 main site for lack of rap signal 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.379
 bb and carnavale then basically each 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.079
 The game area has an aspect of 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.910
 loss but the way mps treat the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.980
 mirrors are totally different from a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.690
 in fact the way each 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.270
 character treats his losses is 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.830
 totally similar to the model theory of 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 suffering from ross exchange 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.610
 basically says that when someone is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.630
 confronted with death they spoke for 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.220
 five specific stages anger denial 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.070
 depression negotiation and acceptance 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.600
 adventure of link trade in koh tao de 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.460
 all people are in the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.979
 I realized that despite the fact that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.890
 giant squid left about to collide with 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.680
 they are not even bothering me 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.229
 and they are still planning a party 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.720
 in the midst of this danger of some 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 shapes and says it will cut the nail 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.100
 in pieces which is a perfect example 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.560
 of denial or the first stage of the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.630
 model of queiroz after we have the deco 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.299
 dick so much lack here it takes 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.479
 disappeared and how should you react to it. 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.950
 clearly wanting to kill the monkey and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.079
 any way he comes to the conclusion that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.240
 the monkey is the source of all that is 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.240
 happening and he deserves to die as 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.189
 punishment and innocent monkey Deco 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.079
 just angry and furious wanting 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.210
 to end anything because they no longer 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.930
 Do you know what to do here? 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.240
 phase 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.030
 the rage of phase 3 we have not radio 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.200
 where they meet the goms who have just 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.360
 lose their leader of armani and with 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.180
 we found his ghost he tries 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.519
 negotiate with link to be able to have the body 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.290
 His back he is negotiating to 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.360
 have a little more time to live and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.459
 when the negotiation fails it enters the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.319
 fourth stage depression 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.569
 here when the person realizes that 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.580
 there's a turn for her. 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.010
 has come to an end and people end up 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.200
 excluding alone are things that 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.540
 happens on ebay with the null character 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.430
 But time that ends up losing their eggs. 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.410
 She is a mother who lost her children. 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.630
 just stand there and watch the siame 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.940
 silence and finally after that in which 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.620
 arrives until cane valley valley filled 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.930
 with death but also put with 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.450
 fifth stage acceptance looks at you 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.130
 find a tower that is a symbol in 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.590
 that you have to climb backwards to 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.930
 reaching the sky is where you get the item 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.239
 lighting symbolized by nike air 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.700
 link went through the death valley and 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.680
 all four phases and the quiet of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.489
 whoever says that the theory of 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.989
 suffering is very well embedded in the 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.120
 history of the game but that no one 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.069
 have to do with what he would be 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.170
 suffering for water he started sending 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.209
 I think it says looking for a ship, I would do it. 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.130
 more sense instead of his death he 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.920
 is suffering for having ordered the ship 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.319
 maybe but in my mind is we got something 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.630
 much deeper than that something that 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.930
 Evidence suggests greater nick have 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.000
 died something much more obscure and without me 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.790
 that does not generate simesc is in purgatory 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.100
 that the waiting room of the other world is 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.480
 that the game represents his 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.060
 acceptance about death 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.220
 first we see the name of the place that arrives 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.290
 finish what it may mean to have not 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.209
 which is the same as yes because it is 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.459
 a new proof and it looks like the link 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.799
 find this place is not strange with 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.150
 link finds the whole world when it falls 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.410
 inside a tree trunk and 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.230
 communicate is not aware 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.389
 no astronomical and does not know if the moon is 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.269
 the same as harley the crisis is as follows 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.730
 if you are on planet earth and stay in 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.290
 japan in brazil you will know how many 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.299
 Sometimes we always have a grandmother. 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.280
 question and where it was supposed to 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.620
 to be in that place underground 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.680
 start of sky and remember link sÃ©rgio 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.910
 and got extremely loud and arrived at 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.690
 where we play 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.510
 if so, then we would have 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.790
 and remember how strange it is 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.730
 and when we went out with a 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.190
 kind of travel and lsd some other 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.830
 lucy shop this does not seem to be real 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.200
 explain why several mp6 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.850
 similarities between majora's games 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.070
 mask ocarina of time 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.200
 are characters that never was 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.990
 known on his journey and who 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.030
 had to show up there because he must 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.220
 find these people would facilitate 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.960
 the citation that should have landed and consider 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.940
 the transformation masks for example 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.950
 they all represent characters who 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.960
 had died armani terms 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.530
 the goal that appears in the form of ghost 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.420
 You made me a guitarist who 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.580
 dies in front of you and although you 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.830
 have been to do with the sea that is 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.050
 like that tree that is the dead son 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.580
 deco priest realized that these 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.260
 differences transformations do what 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.600
 they want the form of people who 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.780
 already died what makes us look good 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.090
 attentive with the dealogic optenet song 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.550
 which allows the player to create status 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.260
 icon of your present transformation but 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.090
 is the only brand we can use to 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.890
 create operating conditions deaths 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.530
 why the hell link is able to create a 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.050
 clone of himself then this leads us to 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.780
 question many things about the game 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.150
 Anything else you remember about mexico 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.250
 six months that seller of masks and 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.040
 recalls that the customer finds him 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.230
 first time no one but says me 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.230
 said you ran into the terrible 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.790
 fate is not when he said at the beginning 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.310
 Do you think he's in the game? 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.730
 referring to the linc becoming the deco not 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.340
 is 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.270
 but this speech is repeated later in the 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.820
 game 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.530
 every time the moon beats inside 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.260
 destroying everything 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.720
 Do you hear rap rap mexico 61 and there? 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.450
 Once more, the speech looks like you. 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.490
 found a terrible fate is not the 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.800
 terrible fate is not that they occur 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.680
 involving the ten plus you die 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.030
 because I understand, I would choose 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.300
 specifically talking about that scene 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:28.010
 so summary it could only mean 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.710
 one link thing is dead and accepted it 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.290
 as I always say 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.960
 in the analyzes that I make this game is 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.780
 Magnificent face is very interesting is 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.180
 rich and very worth to be played 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.800
 richness of details and forms of 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.730
 interpret the game 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.390
 which really shows us that this is worth 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.520
 the penalty 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.580
 but remember this is just a theory one 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.680
 theory of games is bound to have you 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.740
 watched this video do not forget to 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.690
 write the channel again leaving the 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.820
 previous theories 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:05.070
 this is it, forget the aik maroto 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.070
 also helps a lot, you talk too much
