00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.059
 in Kenya 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 the tea fields offer an extraordinary palette of greens 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.929
 in aerial photography they form paintings 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.929
 that's what I like as soon as I constantly search 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.500
 my 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.930
 but in my team 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.039
 I am confronted every day with paradoxes 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.819
 which seems insoluble 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.310
 like ccr near the avenue of purchase for example 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.940
 they provide cut flowers for the whole of Europe to more than 6000 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.620
 kilometers from here 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.140
 when the plane to carry them pesticides to cultivate them and the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 pollution of the lake that is training not to mention the pumping for irrigation 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.950
 it's an ecological aberration but it gives employment to Kenyan 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.380
 poorly paid 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.380
 but a job anyway 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.730
 and next to the shantytowns grows like that of nairobi which 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.440
 is today 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 the largest in the world 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.760
 when I left this country 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.890
 I did not imagine that one day I photograph mobile networks 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.570
 but today 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.330
 without being interested in nature 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.260
 it is necessary to be interested eleven men and their impact on the planet 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.680
 the function of the customer in tanzania 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 I needed to film his volcanoes 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.100
 that of language and bc thick smoke that is your primitive composter of the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 land of origin 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.500
 the clemency volcano hoareau all that is not recognized face 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.070
 because France remains more than ever that was happening term 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.700
 it's a symbol of climate change and the current impact of 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.160
 the man on the earth 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.390
 in Kenya 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.010
 there were all the themes that mattered to me 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.590
 loss of biodiversity of globalized agriculture growth 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.510
 of the population of poverty 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.920
 climate change 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.130
 and especially 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.250
 the beauty of the world 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.250
 I observed signs these changes so all the countries of the planet 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.209
 after years of contemplating I want to transmit 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.369
 that's why 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.379
 I went back to all these countries that I made this movie euros 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.219
 I want to share my research but doubts and my discoveries 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.579
 it was my first film I wanted too much to say 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.119
 these three movies and 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.819
 I still have so much image that I want to show now
