00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.540
 who talk about nuclear accident so 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.980

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.459
 obviously down the attendance 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.330
 increase people discover and sometimes 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.090
 even people who were not 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.350

 that's what's it that counts 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.690
