 in the city ​​lido is it starts in the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.440
 disabilities but in my opinion she can 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.850
 to interfere in the winning combination 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.560

 Christmas carols langlois is seen a 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.640
 little chance the filly did not 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.810
 unworthy lately in a race where 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.460

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.740
 his recent third place including jean 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.929
 also rise in five races of 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.310
 Pauline who displays 3 third place 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.630
 in as many public outings and who 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.290
 deserves to see his efforts 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.320
 rewarded with a success 102 and 105 a 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.390
 little later in the day the 308 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.489
 a priori bunker rushes with the entire 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.750
 thibault trust the floch which 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.030
 told me he did not have a good 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.220
 course lately in enghien with this 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.080
 300 fast here he moves with 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.150
 pretensions the lot is in his strings 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.769
 when the king no problem we will play 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.739
 the leading roles according to his 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.630
 mentor the 302 bora of the castle that remains 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.640
 on a convincing success in Toulouse but 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.769
 also the 307 bambi of a hoop 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.140
 will lead the opposition in 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.630
 301 company in this event 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.430
 walked around a horse that is well 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.870
 evolved into its category but that makes 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.570
 proof of a good consistency in his 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.910
 results 308 302 is a little further 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.459
 the 7 and the 1 for possible couple and 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.980
 finally in the sixth I advise you 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.480
 the 604 vénissieux bello and harmony this 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.250
 channel found him a commitment on 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.170
 measure the lot within reach 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.150
 the horse has already won on courses 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.010
 rope right and in my opinion in this lot 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.650
 it will be the horse to beat I will drop 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.450
 however the 606 venezia of May which 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.160
 collects the good results and who 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.580
 should once again ended on the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.830
 podium 604 and 606 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.690
 little word also on the 7th since 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.730
 I could talk to luc rolen ci 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.500
 presents the 710 7 o'clock the horse is 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.880
 at best it's true that he has to leave in 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 second line but no problem at this 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.630
 level what worries her a little more 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.640
 well it's the horse is a small 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.560
 little better rope left said his 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.450
 last performance proved that they 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.340
 could also adapt to this camp 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.860
 the right so i felt ukraine his 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.170
 710 trust store doc provided 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.220
 that this horse negotiates the turns well 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.950
 right hand 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.580
 so for those targeted for agen meeting 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.980
 2 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.100
 the first on the 2nd the 5th the third on the 8th 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.470

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.660
 seventh with the 710 that must be able 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.280
 on the podium the capelle 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.300
 now four favorites to you 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.820
 indicate meeting iii the 412 which is in 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.950

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.510
 worn her donkeys as she is she is on 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.700
 the rising there are only females at 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.140
 start of this race to the lot and its 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.750
 scope in my opinion the victory is 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.670
 400 can dozen bus is in 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.670
 fifth attention to the 500 3 that makes 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.860
 also facing a 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.039

 cagnes-sur-mer first to Toulouse but 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.789
 also 2nd to chartres in my opinion if he 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.360
 rushes on the right leg 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.650
