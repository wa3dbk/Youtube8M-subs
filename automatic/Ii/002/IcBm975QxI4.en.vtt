00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
all it's entirely gaze based controls

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.410 
all it's entirely gaze based controls
and<00:00:42.220> we've<00:00:42.400> also<00:00:42.550> thrown<00:00:42.850> in<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.060> couple<00:00:43.330> of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
and we've also thrown in a couple of

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.510 
and we've also thrown in a couple of
immersive<00:00:43.870> behavior<00:00:44.290> control<00:00:44.739> for<00:00:45.160> example

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
immersive behavior control for example

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.080 
immersive behavior control for example
nodding<00:00:46.210> or<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:47.290> accept<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.860> quest<00:00:48.129> or<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:48.760> move

based<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:52.840> had<00:00:53.110> a<00:00:53.140> go<00:00:53.290> on<00:00:53.440> this<00:00:53.590> yesterday

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
based so I had a go on this yesterday

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.890 
based so I had a go on this yesterday
you<00:00:54.070> participated<00:00:54.850> in<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.090> big<00:00:55.390> indie<00:00:55.660> pitch

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
you participated in the big indie pitch

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.450 
you participated in the big indie pitch
and<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.559> got<00:00:56.680> quite<00:00:56.860> a<00:00:56.890> lot<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.040> positive

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
and you got quite a lot of positive

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.430 
and you got quite a lot of positive
notes<00:00:57.670> off<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.030> back<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.390> it<00:00:58.510> you're<00:00:59.080> kind<00:00:59.350> of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
notes off the back of it you're kind of

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.439 
notes off the back of it you're kind of
sitting<00:00:59.650> in<00:01:00.040> the<00:01:00.400> carpet<00:01:00.760> itself<00:01:01.150> you're<00:01:01.330> not

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
sitting in the carpet itself you're not

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.420 
sitting in the carpet itself you're not
steering<00:01:01.810> it<00:01:01.989> per<00:01:02.170> se<00:01:02.200> but<00:01:02.890> when<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.190> come<00:01:03.340> up

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
steering it per se but when you come up

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.829 
steering it per se but when you come up
to<00:01:03.460> corners<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.059> junctions<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.570> kind<00:01:04.780> of

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
to corners and junctions you kind of

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.840 
to corners and junctions you kind of
look<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.290> turn<00:01:05.470> absolutely<00:01:06.340> that's<00:01:06.670> right

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
look to turn absolutely that's right

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.030 
look to turn absolutely that's right
you're<00:01:07.030> actually<00:01:07.210> on<00:01:07.509> rails<00:01:07.930> as<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.320> go<00:01:08.500> and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
you're actually on rails as you go and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.290 
you're actually on rails as you go and
you're<00:01:09.160> making<00:01:09.280> decisions<00:01:09.850> when<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.060> get<00:01:10.180> two

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
you're making decisions when you get two

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.420 
you're making decisions when you get two
corners<00:01:10.690> and<00:01:11.080> so<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:11.560> do<00:01:11.830> have<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.009> mini-map

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
corners and so you do have a mini-map

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.100 
corners and so you do have a mini-map
overhead<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:13.149> that's<00:01:13.270> represented<00:01:13.990> in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
overhead and that's represented in

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.810 
overhead and that's represented in
constellations<00:01:14.500> because<00:01:15.070> all<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.399> US<00:01:15.640> and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
constellations because all the US and

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.910 
constellations because all the US and
observations<00:01:16.450> if<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.320> use<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.500> mini-map

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
observations if you use the mini-map

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.160 
observations if you use the mini-map
wisely<00:01:18.399> you<00:01:18.490> can<00:01:18.640> see<00:01:18.850> sort<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.720> hazards

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
wisely you can see sort of hazards

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.020 
wisely you can see sort of hazards
coming<00:01:20.830> up<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.070> make<00:01:21.190> decisions<00:01:21.490> on<00:01:21.759> where<00:01:21.940> to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
coming up and make decisions on where to

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.200 
coming up and make decisions on where to
go<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:24.100> reason<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.430> we<00:01:24.610> did<00:01:24.790> on<00:01:24.820> rails

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
go and the reason that we did on rails

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.779 
go and the reason that we did on rails
with<00:01:26.050> what<00:01:26.350> sort<00:01:26.560> of<00:01:26.680> decisions<00:01:27.280> at<00:01:27.399> junctions

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
with what sort of decisions at junctions

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.940 
with what sort of decisions at junctions
is<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.149> reduce<00:01:28.300> any<00:01:28.570> kind<00:01:28.720> of<00:01:28.780> motion

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
is to reduce any kind of motion

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.370 
is to reduce any kind of motion

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
drew me to some virtual reality

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.230 
drew me to some virtual reality
experiences<00:01:32.890> okay<00:01:33.460> well<00:01:33.610> we<00:01:33.789> went<00:01:33.939> hands-on

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
experiences okay well we went hands-on

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.630 
experiences okay well we went hands-on

attempted<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.479> go<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.869> route<00:01:44.049> or<00:01:44.259> is<00:01:44.350> there<00:01:44.439> a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
attempted to go that route or is there a

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.319 
attempted to go that route or is there a
deliberate<00:01:45.009> kind<00:01:45.429> of<00:01:45.520> keeping<00:01:46.060> away<00:01:46.299> from

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
deliberate kind of keeping away from

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.179 
deliberate kind of keeping away from
that<00:01:46.689> sort<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.020> thing<00:01:47.079> in<00:01:47.289> keeping<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.710> all<00:01:47.979> in

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
that sort of thing in keeping it all in

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.749 
that sort of thing in keeping it all in
the<00:01:48.280> eyes<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:50.020> me<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:51.310> made<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.579> game

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
the eyes for me we made this game

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.330 
the eyes for me we made this game
originally<00:01:52.149> put<00:01:52.360> oculus<00:01:52.810> VR<00:01:53.110> gym<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:54.100> that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
originally put oculus VR gym so that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.950 
originally put oculus VR gym so that
required<00:01:54.819> us<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.030> do<00:01:55.299> it<00:01:55.390> although<00:01:55.509> since<00:01:55.780> I'm

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
required us to do it although since I'm

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.670 
required us to do it although since I'm
here<00:01:56.200> just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
here just

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.610 
here just
part<00:01:56.860> of<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:56.980> competition<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:58.500> while<00:01:59.500> there

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
part of the competition and while there

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.990 
part of the competition and while there
was<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> controller<00:02:00.160> that<00:02:00.250> we<00:02:00.460> could<00:02:00.640> use<00:02:00.820> we

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
was a controller that we could use we

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.280 
was a controller that we could use we
found<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.420> there<00:02:01.600> was<00:02:01.660> a<00:02:01.720> lot<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:01.900> elegance

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
found that there was a lot of elegance

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.180 
found that there was a lot of elegance
into<00:02:02.710> keeping<00:02:03.040> things<00:02:03.310> simple<00:02:03.960> sort<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.020> that

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
into keeping things simple sort of that

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.889 
into keeping things simple sort of that
kiss<00:02:06.190> sort<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.730> mentality<00:02:07.420> keep<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.900> seems<00:02:08.080> do

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
and the nice thing about that is that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.699 
and the nice thing about that is that
we're<00:02:11.750> able<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.049> port<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.439> a<00:02:12.470> lot<00:02:12.620> more

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.990 
out there into the world I mean what
time<00:02:25.170> frames<00:02:25.530> are<00:02:25.769> we<00:02:25.830> looking<00:02:26.129> at<00:02:26.220> here<00:02:26.280> um

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
time frames are we looking at here um

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.149 
time frames are we looking at here um
this<00:02:27.390> game<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.810> has<00:02:27.989> been<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.590> month<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
this game that has been a month and

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.490 
this game that has been a month and
development<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.700> far<00:02:29.879> so<00:02:30.120> super<00:02:30.480> immature<00:02:30.690> but

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
development so far so super immature but

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.339 
development so far so super immature but
we<00:02:32.129> achieved<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:32.970> lot<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.299> that<00:02:33.330> time<00:02:33.659> and<00:02:34.019> I

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
we achieved a lot with that time and I

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.199 
we achieved a lot with that time and I
think<00:02:34.409> we<00:02:34.620> go<00:02:34.709> with<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> couple<00:02:35.280> more<00:02:35.430> months<00:02:35.610> we

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
think we go with a couple more months we

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.149 
think we go with a couple more months we
could<00:02:36.330> really<00:02:36.540> bring<00:02:36.659> something<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.620> mark<00:02:38.010> it

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
could really bring something to mark it
