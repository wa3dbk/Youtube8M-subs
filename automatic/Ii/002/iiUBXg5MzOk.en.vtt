own material for like an hour it's
really<00:02:29.510> important<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.170> think<00:02:30.230> suits<00:02:30.650> our

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
really important I think suits our

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
also really fun thing to do yeah like

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.150 
also really fun thing to do yeah like
very<00:02:37.790> important<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:38.870> decided<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.380> because

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
very important we decided to because

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.770 
very important we decided to because
there<00:02:40.280> are<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:40.520> many<00:02:40.820> live<00:02:41.090> acts<00:02:41.330> they're<00:02:41.540> just

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
there are so many live acts they're just

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.150 
there are so many live acts they're just
like<00:02:41.900> sort<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.230> laptop<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.709> controller

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
like sort of the laptop and controller

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.390 
like sort of the laptop and controller
we<00:02:43.400> decide<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:44.060> do<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.600> differently<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> we

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
we decide to do it differently so we

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.150 
we decide to do it differently so we
hooked<00:02:46.520> up<00:02:46.670> with<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> team<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.620> technicians<00:02:48.620> and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
hooked up with a team of technicians and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.920 
hooked up with a team of technicians and
we<00:02:49.430> created<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.970> package<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.510> software<00:02:50.900> and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
we created the package of software and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.979 
we created the package of software and
hardware<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:51.980> ourselves<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.840> wear<00:02:53.840> with

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
hardware for ourselves to wear with

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.170 
hardware for ourselves to wear with
Ableton<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:54.590> all<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.890> clips<00:02:55.310> audio<00:02:55.580> we<00:02:56.030> work

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
Ableton with all the clips audio we work

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.800 
Ableton with all the clips audio we work
here<00:02:57.280> club<00:02:58.280> lighting<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.880> video<00:02:59.209> attached<00:02:59.660> to

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
here club lighting and video attached to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.550 
here club lighting and video attached to
it<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.140> whatever<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:01.070> play<00:03:01.420> lice<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.750> video

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
it so whatever we play lice and video

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.980 
it so whatever we play lice and video
will

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
will

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.290 
will
to<00:03:05.500> be<00:03:05.620> synchronized<00:03:06.070> accordingly<00:03:06.550> that's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
to be synchronized accordingly that's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.820 
to be synchronized accordingly that's
really<00:03:07.510> flexible<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.050> can<00:03:08.080> do<00:03:08.290> away<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:08.620> want

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
really flexible you can do away we want

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.530 
really flexible you can do away we want

to take a high at from home records this
the<00:03:10.890> strokes<00:03:11.890> will<00:03:12.040> close<00:03:12.220> up<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.610> we<00:03:12.820> can

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the strokes will close up and we can

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.850 
the strokes will close up and we can
just<00:03:12.970> Jim<00:03:13.720> round<00:03:13.960> with<00:03:14.170> its<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.440> makes<00:03:14.650> very

interesting<00:03:15.250> for<00:03:15.370> us<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.790> we<00:03:16.210> bring<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.510> bunch

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
interesting for us and we bring a bunch

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.320 
interesting for us and we bring a bunch
of<00:03:17.140> instruments<00:03:17.470> along<00:03:17.860> our<00:03:18.640> lab<00:03:18.910> setup<00:03:19.150> is

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
of instruments along our lab setup is

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.840 
of instruments along our lab setup is
basically<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:20.560> course<00:03:20.770> we<00:03:20.860> have<00:03:20.980> ableton<00:03:21.310> with

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
basically of course we have ableton with

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.460 
basically of course we have ableton with
the<00:03:22.000> whole<00:03:22.180> system<00:03:22.390> running<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.110> it's<00:03:23.260> like

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the whole system running so it's like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.490 
the whole system running so it's like
our<00:03:23.920> computer<00:03:24.400> it's<00:03:24.670> it's<00:03:24.970> talking<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.050> to

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
our computer it's it's talking to the to

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.080 
our computer it's it's talking to the to

studio<00:06:35.550> but<00:06:35.850> we<00:06:35.910> have<00:06:35.940> different<00:06:36.090> setups<00:06:36.660> and

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
studio but we have different setups and

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.710 
studio but we have different setups and
the<00:06:37.800> way<00:06:37.890> we<00:06:38.070> work<00:06:38.310> is<00:06:38.490> very<00:06:38.670> around<00:06:39.180> sketches

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
the way we work is very around sketches

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.230 
the way we work is very around sketches
so<00:06:39.930> we<00:06:40.110> we<00:06:40.560> make<00:06:40.770> lots<00:06:41.610> and<00:06:41.730> lots<00:06:41.910> of<00:06:42.000> lots<00:06:42.120> of

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
so we we make lots and lots of lots of

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.090 
so we we make lots and lots of lots of
sketches<00:06:42.600> which<00:06:42.750> can<00:06:42.900> just<00:06:43.080> be<00:06:43.170> few<00:06:43.470> bar<00:06:43.710> loops

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
sketches which can just be few bar loops

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.350 
sketches which can just be few bar loops
or<00:06:44.340> just<00:06:44.550> like<00:06:44.730> small<00:06:44.940> melody<00:06:45.270> I<00:06:45.300> layers<00:06:45.600> and

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
or just like small melody I layers and

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.270 
or just like small melody I layers and
we<00:06:48.360> think<00:06:48.570> the<00:06:48.720> key<00:06:49.290> of<00:06:49.440> a<00:06:49.530> good<00:06:49.680> track<00:06:49.890> is<00:06:50.070> the

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
we think the key of a good track is the

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.150 
we think the key of a good track is the
actual<00:06:50.610> basic<00:06:51.540> idea<00:06:51.840> of<00:06:51.900> it<00:06:52.170> sometimes<00:06:52.980> you're

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
actual basic idea of it sometimes you're

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.220 
actual basic idea of it sometimes you're
lost<00:06:53.400> traction<00:06:53.730> just<00:06:54.090> like<00:06:54.240> feels<00:06:54.930> like<00:06:55.080> it's

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
lost traction just like feels like it's

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.290 
lost traction just like feels like it's
just<00:06:55.350> like<00:06:55.410> a<00:06:55.500> you<00:06:56.010> know<00:06:56.040> beats<00:06:56.850> building<00:06:57.210> up

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
just like a you know beats building up

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.760 
just like a you know beats building up
and<00:06:57.480> it<00:06:57.540> sounds<00:06:57.840> good<00:06:57.990> but<00:06:58.170> if<00:06:58.260> idea<00:06:58.590> isn't

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
and it sounds good but if idea isn't

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.570 
and it sounds good but if idea isn't
good<00:06:59.040> in<00:06:59.610> the<00:06:59.730> whole<00:07:00.080> the<00:07:01.080> whole<00:07:01.250> track<00:07:02.250> false

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
good in the whole the whole track false

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.100 
good in the whole the whole track false
part<00:07:02.880> so<00:07:03.000> we<00:07:03.090> just<00:07:03.270> make<00:07:03.420> a<00:07:03.450> lot<00:07:03.660> of<00:07:03.690> sketch<00:07:03.960> in

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
part so we just make a lot of sketch in

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.470 
part so we just make a lot of sketch in
a<00:07:04.140> lot<00:07:04.230> of<00:07:04.260> ideas<00:07:04.410> and<00:07:04.830> then<00:07:04.980> after<00:07:05.880> maybe<00:07:06.030> 30

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
a lot of ideas and then after maybe 30

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.210 
a lot of ideas and then after maybe 30
or<00:07:06.600> 40<00:07:06.990> sketches<00:07:07.380> we<00:07:07.500> pick<00:07:07.680> the<00:07:07.860> right<00:07:07.980> the

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
or 40 sketches we pick the right the

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.620 
or 40 sketches we pick the right the
right<00:07:08.250> one<00:07:08.580> we<00:07:08.730> think<00:07:08.940> is<00:07:09.030> the<00:07:09.120> best<00:07:09.270> one<00:07:09.450> and

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
right one we think is the best one and

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.000 
right one we think is the best one and
we<00:07:10.280> work<00:07:11.280> it<00:07:11.400> out<00:07:11.460> together<00:07:11.640> in<00:07:11.880> the<00:07:11.940> studio
