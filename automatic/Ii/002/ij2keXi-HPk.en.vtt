metabolize<00:01:40.400> fats<00:01:40.640> more<00:01:40.820> efficiently<00:01:41.150> okay<00:01:41.600> so

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
metabolize fats more efficiently okay so

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.390 
metabolize fats more efficiently okay so
that's<00:01:42.229> fabulous<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.830> other<00:01:42.979> thing<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.250> a

something<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.240> found<00:02:02.540> fascinating<00:02:02.979> that

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
something that I found fascinating that

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.380 
something that I found fascinating that
I<00:02:04.040> didn't<00:02:04.460> know<00:02:04.549> because<00:02:04.760> I<00:02:04.850> cook<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:05.090> olive

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
I didn't know because I cook with olive

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.139 
I didn't know because I cook with olive
oil<00:02:05.479> all<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.080> time<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.470> say<00:02:06.770> don't<00:02:07.670> cook<00:02:08.000> with

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
oil all the time you say don't cook with

oil all the time you say don't cook with
olive<00:02:08.450> oil<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.929> can<00:02:09.140> be<00:02:09.289> very<00:02:09.319> bad<00:02:09.709> for

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
olive oil that it can be very bad for

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.470 
olive oil that it can be very bad for
you<00:02:10.159> yes<00:02:10.580> that's<00:02:10.729> correct<00:02:10.909> that's<00:02:11.120> something

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
you yes that's correct that's something

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.119 
you yes that's correct that's something
that's<00:02:11.569> very<00:02:11.689> common<00:02:12.409> mistake<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.920> people

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
that's very common mistake that people

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.960 
that's very common mistake that people
tend<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.849> make<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.780> never<00:02:15.260> want<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.799> heat<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
tend to make you never want to heat the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.339 
tend to make you never want to heat the
olive<00:02:17.000> oil<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.659> never<00:02:17.810> want<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.019> burn<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
olive oil you never want to burn the

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.979 
olive oil you never want to burn the
olive<00:02:18.560> oil<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.950> actually<00:02:19.099> turns<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.640> into<00:02:19.989> more

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
olive oil it actually turns it into more

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.929 
olive oil it actually turns it into more
of<00:02:21.019> an<00:02:21.169> oxidized<00:02:21.620> state<00:02:21.919> or<00:02:22.189> more<00:02:22.549> of<00:02:22.579> a<00:02:22.669> trans

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
of an oxidized state or more of a trans

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.080 
of an oxidized state or more of a trans
fat<00:02:23.239> which<00:02:23.569> actually<00:02:23.749> promotes<00:02:24.349> heart

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
fat which actually promotes heart

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.910 
fat which actually promotes heart
and<00:02:25.390> inflammation<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.230> degeneration<00:02:26.739> of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
and inflammation and degeneration of

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.410 
and inflammation and degeneration of
ourselves<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:27.790> when<00:02:27.940> we're<00:02:28.090> talking<00:02:28.209> about

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
ourselves so when we're talking about

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.780 
ourselves so when we're talking about
antioxidants<00:02:28.989> those<00:02:29.920> are<00:02:30.099> good<00:02:30.280> things<00:02:30.310> for

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
antioxidants those are good things for

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.309 
antioxidants those are good things for
us<00:02:30.879> what<00:02:31.030> you're<00:02:31.150> saying<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.200> you

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
us what you're saying is that if you

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.259 
us what you're saying is that if you
cook<00:02:32.590> with<00:02:32.800> olive<00:02:33.160> oil<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.519> oil<00:02:33.550> converts

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
cook with olive oil the oil converts

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.900 
cook with olive oil the oil converts
into<00:02:34.480> something<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.530> oxidized<00:02:36.190> correct

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
into something that is oxidized correct

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.520 
into something that is oxidized correct
and<00:02:37.090> has<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.330> reverse<00:02:37.480> effect<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:38.379> an

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and has the reverse effect of an

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.410 
and has the reverse effect of an
antioxidant<00:02:39.220> correct<00:02:39.459> that's<00:02:39.700> right<00:02:39.760> see<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
antioxidant correct that's right see the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.880 
antioxidant correct that's right see the
reason<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.989> olive<00:02:41.290> oil<00:02:41.349> like<00:02:41.590> when<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.799> get

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
reason the olive oil like when you get

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.920 
reason the olive oil like when you get
extra<00:02:42.099> virgin<00:02:42.400> cold-pressed<00:02:43.150> olive<00:02:43.390> oil<00:02:43.690> is

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
extra virgin cold-pressed olive oil is

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.500 
extra virgin cold-pressed olive oil is
got<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.349> real<00:02:44.650> deep<00:02:44.980> rich<00:02:45.310> kind<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.209> almost

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
got that real deep rich kind of a almost

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.940 
got that real deep rich kind of a almost
a<00:02:46.629> greenish<00:02:47.019> hue<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.349> it<00:02:47.379> is<00:02:47.560> because<00:02:47.799> of<00:02:47.830> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
a greenish hue to it is because of the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.440 
a greenish hue to it is because of the
chlorophyll<00:02:48.370> content<00:02:48.610> what<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.299> actually

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
chlorophyll content what you actually

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.360 
chlorophyll content what you actually
put<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> plate<00:02:50.080> out<00:02:50.230> here<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:51.190> see

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
put a plate out here of it you to see

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.680 
put a plate out here of it you to see
the<00:02:51.489> difference<00:02:51.790> between<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.209> two<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.569> can

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the difference between the two you can

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.330 
the difference between the two you can
see<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.900> difference<00:02:53.170> between<00:02:53.230> these<00:02:53.920> real

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
see the difference between these real

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.740 
see the difference between these real
light<00:02:54.549> on<00:02:54.700> this<00:02:54.879> side<00:02:55.060> correct<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.660> then

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
light on this side correct and then

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.390 
light on this side correct and then
that's<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.049> extra<00:02:56.319> virgin<00:02:56.530> okay<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.099> which

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
that's the extra virgin okay so which

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.160 
that's the extra virgin okay so which
one<00:02:57.579> is<00:02:57.730> better<00:02:57.880> for<00:02:58.000> her<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.420> was<00:02:58.510> saying<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
one is better for her you was saying the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.420 
one is better for her you was saying the
extra<00:02:59.440> virgin<00:02:59.650> which<00:02:59.920> has<00:03:00.040> got<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.280> higher

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
extra virgin which has got the higher

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.100 
extra virgin which has got the higher
chlorophyll<00:03:00.910> content<00:03:01.120> that's<00:03:01.810> what's<00:03:01.989> going

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
chlorophyll content that's what's going

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.930 
chlorophyll content that's what's going
to<00:03:02.170> stimulate<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.680> antioxidant<00:03:03.340> capacities

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
to stimulate the antioxidant capacities

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.150 
to stimulate the antioxidant capacities
and<00:03:04.450> properties<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.440> olive<00:03:05.620> oil<00:03:05.709> has<00:03:05.950> uh

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
and properties that the olive oil has uh

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.089 
and properties that the olive oil has uh
huh<00:03:06.340> okay<00:03:06.819> okay<00:03:07.030> when<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.799> one<00:03:08.799> other<00:03:08.890> thing

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
huh okay okay when you one other thing

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.259 
huh okay okay when you one other thing
to<00:03:09.190> keep<00:03:09.280> in<00:03:09.400> mind<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.730> because<00:03:10.000> it

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
to keep in mind is that because it

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.940 
to keep in mind is that because it
oxidizes<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:10.930> quickly<00:03:11.319> it's<00:03:11.500> also<00:03:11.650> very

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
oxidizes so quickly it's also very

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.619 
oxidizes so quickly it's also very
important<00:03:12.519> to<00:03:12.640> keep<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:12.910> olive<00:03:13.180> oil<00:03:13.329> to<00:03:13.510> buy

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
important to keep the olive oil to buy

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.750 
important to keep the olive oil to buy
olive<00:03:13.959> oil<00:03:14.140> that's<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.739> dark<00:03:15.010> bottle<00:03:15.430> versus

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
olive oil that's in a dark bottle versus

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.280 
olive oil that's in a dark bottle versus
a<00:03:15.790> lighter<00:03:16.030> bottles<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.900> prevent<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.230> from

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
a lighter bottles to prevent it from

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.800 
a lighter bottles to prevent it from
getting<00:03:17.440> oxidized<00:03:17.950> when<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.819> use<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.239> oil<00:03:19.510> in

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
getting oxidized when you use the oil in

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.020 
getting oxidized when you use the oil in
between<00:03:20.140> cooking<00:03:20.590> or<00:03:20.739> using<00:03:21.069> it<00:03:21.190> for<00:03:21.519> for<00:03:21.940> the

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
between cooking or using it for for the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.309 
between cooking or using it for for the
cosmetic<00:03:22.420> application<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:22.989> want<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.200> make

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
cosmetic application you want to make

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.380 
cosmetic application you want to make
sure<00:03:23.349> that<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.769> open<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.519> replace<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.209> top

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
sure that you open and replace the top

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.720 
sure that you open and replace the top
quickly<00:03:25.959> okay<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:26.920> you're<00:03:27.099> saying<00:03:27.310> keep<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.640> in

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
quickly okay so you're saying keep it in

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.759 
quickly okay so you're saying keep it in
a<00:03:27.819> dark<00:03:28.030> bottle<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.540> also<00:03:28.870> say<00:03:29.109> don't<00:03:29.410> get<00:03:29.620> the

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
a dark bottle you also say don't get the

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.770 
a dark bottle you also say don't get the
big<00:03:29.920> jumbo<00:03:30.430> olive<00:03:30.819> oil<00:03:31.000> yes<00:03:31.329> that's<00:03:31.660> correct

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
big jumbo olive oil yes that's correct

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.539 
big jumbo olive oil yes that's correct
because<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.709> oil<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.160> sits<00:03:33.340> there<00:03:33.400> and

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
because it the oil just sits there and

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.759 
because it the oil just sits there and
it<00:03:33.940> becomes<00:03:34.150> oxidized<00:03:34.630> over<00:03:34.900> time<00:03:35.139> olive<00:03:35.709> oil

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
it becomes oxidized over time olive oil

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.160 
it becomes oxidized over time olive oil
spoils<00:03:36.310> very<00:03:36.459> easily<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:37.840> not<00:03:37.989> maybe

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
spoils very easily and it's not maybe

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.020 
spoils very easily and it's not maybe
something<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.889> can<00:03:39.010> physically<00:03:39.400> see<00:03:39.430> it

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
something that you can physically see it

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.550 
something that you can physically see it
just<00:03:40.120> gets<00:03:40.359> oxidized<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:40.959> it's<00:03:41.109> hard<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.380> tell

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
just gets oxidized and it's hard to tell

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.410 
just gets oxidized and it's hard to tell
when<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.829> happens<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.970> that's<00:03:43.150> when<00:03:43.329> you

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
when that happens and that's when you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.539 
when that happens and that's when you
really<00:03:43.630> get<00:03:43.720> all<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> negative<00:03:44.430> effects<00:03:45.430> from

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
really get all the negative effects from

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.180 
really get all the negative effects from
it<00:03:45.639> as<00:03:45.940> cited<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.690> study<00:03:46.900> last<00:03:47.349> year<00:03:47.530> okay<00:03:48.130> so

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
it as cited in a study last year okay so

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.729 
it as cited in a study last year okay so
buy<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.609> fresh<00:03:48.940> by<00:03:49.299> in<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.690> small<00:03:50.170> container<00:03:50.380> and

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
buy it fresh by in a small container and

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.379 
buy it fresh by in a small container and
buy<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.829> in<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.069> dark<00:03:51.310> container<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.030> where<00:03:52.299> do

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
buy it in a dark container and where do

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.569 
buy it in a dark container and where do
we<00:03:52.510> store<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.230> like<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.829> store<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.190> in<00:03:54.310> like

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
we store this I like to store it in like

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.009 
we store this I like to store it in like
a<00:03:54.609> cool<00:03:54.849> dry<00:03:55.000> place<00:03:55.030> you<00:03:55.480> can<00:03:55.599> even<00:03:55.720> put<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:55.930> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
a cool dry place you can even put in the

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.259 
a cool dry place you can even put in the
refrigerator<00:03:56.519> pantry<00:03:57.519> somewhere<00:03:58.150> there

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
refrigerator pantry somewhere there

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.759 
refrigerator pantry somewhere there
sucking<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.540> get<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.660> lot<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:58.810> light<00:03:58.989> okay<00:03:59.530> and

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
sucking to get a lot of light okay and

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.830 
sucking to get a lot of light okay and
you<00:04:00.040> say<00:04:00.220> you've<00:04:00.669> actually<00:04:00.880> got<00:04:01.180> over<00:04:01.690> here

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
you say you've actually got over here

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.990 
you say you've actually got over here
this<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.169> kind<00:04:02.319> of<00:04:02.349> like<00:04:02.470> an<00:04:02.620> oxidized<00:04:03.310> olive

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
this is kind of like an oxidized olive

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.170 
this is kind of like an oxidized olive
oil<00:04:04.269> originated<00:04:04.810> ozonated<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:06.000> don't<00:04:07.000> want<00:04:07.120> the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
oil originated ozonated I don't want the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.780 
oil originated ozonated I don't want the
oxidized<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:08.799> native<00:04:09.130> which<00:04:09.250> actually<00:04:09.400> puts

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
oxidized the native which actually puts

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.210 
oxidized the native which actually puts
oxygen<00:04:10.450> into<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.900> correct<00:04:11.260> yeah<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:11.799> basically

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
oxygen into it correct yeah so basically

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.000 
oxygen into it correct yeah so basically
we<00:04:13.150> own<00:04:13.269> a<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.540> olive<00:04:13.810> oil<00:04:13.989> in<00:04:14.260> our<00:04:14.410> office<00:04:14.829> and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
we own a to olive oil in our office and

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.710 
we own a to olive oil in our office and
it's<00:04:15.639> actually<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:16.209> should<00:04:16.419> say<00:04:16.450> it's

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
it's actually I should say it's

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.050 
it's actually I should say it's
partially<00:04:17.260> ozonated<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.489> full<00:04:18.669> ozonation

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
partially ozonated the full ozonation

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.699 
partially ozonated the full ozonation
process<00:04:19.510> actually<00:04:19.690> takes<00:04:19.900> about<00:04:20.229> three<00:04:20.500> weeks

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
process actually takes about three weeks

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.560 
process actually takes about three weeks
to<00:04:20.889> run<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.130> ozone<00:04:21.459> into<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:21.880> olive<00:04:21.940> oil<00:04:22.270> okay

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
to run the ozone into the olive oil okay

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.740 
to run the ozone into the olive oil okay
not<00:04:23.169> oxygen<00:04:23.620> it's<00:04:23.800> ozone<00:04:24.190> correct<00:04:24.700> yes<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.660> so

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
not oxygen it's ozone correct yes and so

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.240 
not oxygen it's ozone correct yes and so
the<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.320> principle<00:04:26.710> behind<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:27.099> is

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
the the principle behind that is

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.950 
the the principle behind that is
basically<00:04:27.639> you're<00:04:27.820> delivering<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.570> ozone

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
basically you're delivering this ozone

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.270 
basically you're delivering this ozone
into<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.349> cells<00:04:29.620> into<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.979> tissue<00:04:30.160> to

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
into the cells into the tissue to

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.580 
into the cells into the tissue to
accelerate<00:04:30.880> tissue<00:04:31.120> healing<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:32.110> helps<00:04:32.410> with

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
accelerate tissue healing it helps with

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.230 
accelerate tissue healing it helps with
tissue<00:04:32.860> repair<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.520> skill<00:04:33.760> skin

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
tissue repair and skill skin

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.820 
tissue repair and skill skin
regeneration<00:04:34.690> yeah<00:04:34.960> well<00:04:35.320> your<00:04:35.440> skin<00:04:35.650> looks

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
regeneration yeah well your skin looks

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.170 
regeneration yeah well your skin looks
pretty<00:04:36.039> good<00:04:36.159> so<00:04:36.219> much<00:04:36.400> more

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
pretty good so much more
