outboard that was winterized last fall
the<00:00:40.980> battery<00:00:41.309> should<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.640> removed<00:00:42.030> each

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the battery should be removed each

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.080 
the battery should be removed each
winter<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.899> reinstalled<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> spring<00:00:44.090> the

winter and reinstalled in the spring the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
winter and reinstalled in the spring the
first<00:00:45.360> step<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> inspect<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.500> batteries

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
first step is to inspect your batteries

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.700 
first step is to inspect your batteries
as<00:00:47.219> per<00:00:48.149> Coast<00:00:48.420> Guard<00:00:48.660> regulation<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
as per Coast Guard regulation the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.029 
as per Coast Guard regulation the
positive<00:00:50.190> terminals<00:00:50.640> must<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.090> covered

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
positive terminals must be covered

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.020 
positive terminals must be covered
double<00:00:53.039> check<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> tightness<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
double check the tightness of the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.939 
double check the tightness of the
terminal<00:00:54.420> nuts<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.379> battery<00:00:55.739> has

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
terminal nuts and if your battery has

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
terminal nuts and if your battery has
wing<00:00:56.160> nuts<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.090> good<00:00:57.270> idea<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.870> replace

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
wing nuts it's a good idea to replace

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.740 
wing nuts it's a good idea to replace
them<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.559> hex<00:00:58.800> nuts<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.309> lock<00:00:59.609> washers
