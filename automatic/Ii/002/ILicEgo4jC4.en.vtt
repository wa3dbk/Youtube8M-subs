first thing what we do when we show

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.060 
first thing what we do when we show
throw<00:01:22.940> is<00:01:23.180> it's<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.659> lower<00:01:23.870> hip<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.560> lead<00:01:24.770> us<00:01:24.890> out

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
throw is it's a lower hip to lead us out

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.039 
throw is it's a lower hip to lead us out
so<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.150> got<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.390> make<00:01:26.479> sure<00:01:26.659> you're<00:01:26.840> doing

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
so you got to make sure you're doing

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.410 
so you got to make sure you're doing
this<00:01:27.200> component<00:01:27.740> if<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.460> do<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.729> with<00:01:28.850> relaxes

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
this component if you do it with relaxes

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.890 
this component if you do it with relaxes
relaxation<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.500> leg<00:01:30.680> this<00:01:31.340> hip<00:01:31.700> will<00:01:32.690> just

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
relaxation to the leg this hip will just

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.340 
relaxation to the leg this hip will just
fly<00:01:33.110> up<00:01:33.880> okay<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.420> we<00:01:35.510> try<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:35.690> go<00:01:35.869> for<00:01:36.110> when

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
fly up okay so we try to go for when

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.230 
fly up okay so we try to go for when
you're<00:01:36.500> doing<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.799> drill<00:01:37.130> have<00:01:37.580> your<00:01:37.790> posture

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.270 
you're doing the drill have your posture
tip<00:01:38.479> is<00:01:39.320> that's<00:01:39.560> going<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.860> force<00:01:40.130> yourself

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
tip is that's going to force yourself

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.440 
tip is that's going to force yourself
not<00:01:40.900> be<00:01:41.900> able<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.140> get<00:01:42.320> all<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.680> way<00:01:42.770> open<00:01:43.070> up

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
not be able to get all the way open up

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.270 
not be able to get all the way open up
okay<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.960> in<00:01:45.380> terms<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.680> thoracic<00:01:46.159> extension

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
okay so in terms of thoracic extension

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.340 
okay so in terms of thoracic extension
what<00:01:46.790> I<00:01:46.820> want<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.119> focus<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.659> is<00:01:48.170> that
