00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:44.329 
and I would do this but I can say that I
did<00:06:42.809> not<00:06:42.959> get<00:06:43.139> the<00:06:43.259> cash<00:06:43.439> in<00:06:43.619> the<00:06:43.709> envelope<00:06:44.099> and

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:44.339 
did not get the cash in the envelope and

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.609 
did not get the cash in the envelope and
then<00:06:44.429> you're<00:06:44.580> out<00:06:44.659> $24.99<00:06:45.659> that's<00:06:46.319> just<00:06:46.529> a

00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:46.619 
then you're out $24.99 that's just a

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:48.499 
then you're out $24.99 that's just a
thing<00:06:46.830> I<00:06:47.099> think<00:06:47.610> it's<00:06:47.699> illegal<00:06:47.909> to<00:06:48.119> ship<00:06:48.300> money

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
thing I think it's illegal to ship money

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.389 
thing I think it's illegal to ship money
in<00:06:48.659> an<00:06:48.719> envelope<00:06:48.779> anyway<00:06:49.319> I'm<00:06:49.860> not<00:06:49.919> quite<00:06:50.369> sure

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:50.399 
in an envelope anyway I'm not quite sure

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:53.779 
in an envelope anyway I'm not quite sure
but<00:06:51.149> we<00:06:51.300> only<00:06:51.419> take<00:06:51.599> money<00:06:51.839> orders<00:06:52.259> or<00:06:52.759> PayPal

but we only take money orders or PayPal

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.749 
but we only take money orders or PayPal
we<00:06:53.939> prefer<00:06:54.239> PayPal<00:06:54.659> if<00:06:54.989> I<00:06:55.139> was<00:06:55.259> so<00:06:55.409> much<00:06:55.499> easier

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 
we prefer PayPal if I was so much easier

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.989 
we prefer PayPal if I was so much easier
and<00:06:56.929> yep<00:06:57.929> that's<00:06:58.649> just<00:06:59.219> about<00:06:59.489> it<00:06:59.550> this
