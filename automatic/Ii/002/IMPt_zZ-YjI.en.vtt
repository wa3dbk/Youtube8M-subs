did you get a look at what was some sort

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.450 
did you get a look at what was some sort
of<00:00:40.260> hot<00:00:40.379> dog<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> was

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
of hot dog but do you know what it was

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.650 
of hot dog but do you know what it was
you<00:00:41.910> look<00:00:42.030> yellow<00:00:42.530> that's<00:00:43.530> quick<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:45.539> know

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you look yellow that's quick you know

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.360 
you look yellow that's quick you know
after<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.649> happened<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.039> kind<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> thinking

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
after it happened I was kind of thinking

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
after it happened I was kind of thinking
it<00:00:47.610> must<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.879> been<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:49.289> first

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it must have been from that the first

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
it must have been from that the first
bowl<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.100> kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.309> came<00:00:50.460> hard<00:00:50.850> across

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bowl because it kind of came hard across

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.080 
bowl because it kind of came hard across
not<00:00:51.480> down<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:52.980> could<00:00:53.129> do<00:00:53.340> i

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
not down but I think they could do i

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
not down but I think they could do i
think<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.719> probably<00:00:54.750> affected<00:00:55.320> me<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.680> than

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
think it probably affected me more than

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
think it probably affected me more than
the<00:00:56.489> goal<00:00:56.699> yellow<00:00:57.030> cheddar<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.539> see<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.780> i

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the goal yellow cheddar and see if i

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.040 
the goal yellow cheddar and see if i
understand<00:00:58.289> how<00:00:58.410> attracted<00:00:58.890> him<00:00:59.010> more<00:00:59.250> but

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
understand how attracted him more but

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.569 
understand how attracted him more but
someone<00:01:01.050> looked<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> rules<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.949> guess

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
someone looked up the rules and I guess

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.850 
someone looked up the rules and I guess
how<00:01:04.449> help<00:01:04.720> much<00:01:05.080> Tyler<00:01:05.560> do<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.680> have<00:01:05.799> to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
how help much Tyler do you have to

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.859 
how help much Tyler do you have to
regroup<00:01:06.159> mentally<00:01:07.119> in<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.270> situation<00:01:07.509> like

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869

two<00:02:06.590> years<00:02:06.770> but<00:02:06.890> when<00:02:07.039> we<00:02:07.130> dig<00:02:07.280> all<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.549> way

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
two years but when we dig all the way

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.630 
two years but when we dig all the way
we're<00:02:07.909> going<00:02:08.119> back<00:02:08.800> what<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.890> situation<00:02:10.220> was

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
we're going back what the situation was

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.490 
we're going back what the situation was
I<00:02:11.060> think<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.390> shows<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.630> character<00:02:11.930> this

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.920 
I think it just shows the character this
locker<00:02:12.739> room<00:02:13.180> obviously<00:02:14.180> still<00:02:14.660> be<00:02:14.780> done
