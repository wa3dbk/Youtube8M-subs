see<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.620> take<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.010> part<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.550> covers<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
see I take this part it covers the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.810 
see I take this part it covers the
manifold<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.450> was<00:02:17.290> looking<00:02:17.560> at<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.740> book<00:02:18.610> and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
manifold I was looking at the book and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.100 
manifold I was looking at the book and
it<00:02:18.940> says<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.180> have<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.420> take<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.660> manifold

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
it says you have to take the manifold

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.690 
it says you have to take the manifold
but<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.380> think<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:20.860> get<00:02:20.980> away<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.190> taking

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
but I think I can get away just taking

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.450 
but I think I can get away just taking
this<00:02:21.790> piece<00:02:22.030> off<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:22.920> taking<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.040> cover<00:02:24.340> off

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
this piece off and taking this cover off

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.370 
this piece off and taking this cover off
which<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.850> all<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> cover<00:02:25.240> here<00:02:25.480> again<00:02:26.350> I

wanted<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.030> make<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.840> video<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.140> little<00:02:29.230> faster

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
wanted to make the video a little faster

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.000 
wanted to make the video a little faster
so<00:02:30.000> put<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.270> side<00:02:33.480> now<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.540> go<00:02:35.010> for
