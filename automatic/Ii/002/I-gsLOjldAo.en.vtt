real<00:00:05.220> short<00:00:05.460> little<00:00:05.819> jazz<00:00:06.259> progression<00:00:08.269> and<00:00:09.269> I

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
real short little jazz progression and I

real short little jazz progression and I
guess<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.370> jazz<00:00:12.830> uses<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> minor<00:00:14.130> sevens<00:00:14.639> and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
