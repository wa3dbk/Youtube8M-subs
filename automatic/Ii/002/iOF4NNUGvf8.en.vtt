00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
to split push it was really being a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.420 
to split push it was really being a
menace<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:33.390> am<00:00:33.590> yeah<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.130> bit<00:00:35.280> weird

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
menace for my am yeah it's a bit weird

to<00:00:35.550> see<00:00:35.790> split<00:00:36.059> pushing<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:37.020> don't

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
to see split pushing right now we don't

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
to see split pushing right now we don't
see<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.160> lot<00:00:38.340> mostly<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
see that a lot mostly because like the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.420 
see that a lot mostly because like the
tier<00:00:39.809> two<00:00:39.989> turrets<00:00:40.230> now<00:00:40.649> give<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.890> shield<00:00:41.190> so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
tier two turrets now give the shield so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
tier two turrets now give the shield so
it's<00:00:41.610> extremely<00:00:42.390> hard<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:43.020> dive<00:00:43.200> someone

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it's extremely hard to just dive someone

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
it's extremely hard to just dive someone
under<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> drakes<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.300> ash<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.629> such

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
under it and drakes and ash have such

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.010 
under it and drakes and ash have such
great<00:00:46.079> importance<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.539> also<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> fact<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
great importance and also the fact that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.410 
great importance and also the fact that
it<00:00:49.320> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> backfired<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.430> his<00:00:51.210> team

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it kind of backfired because his team

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.000 
it kind of backfired because his team
was<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.809> getting<00:00:52.020> caught<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.379> over<00:00:52.829> the
