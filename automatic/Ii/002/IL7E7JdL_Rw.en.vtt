00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100
 I wrote 5 tyler of wonder woman and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.100
 Friday the 13th welcome to jl vision 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.600
 what is your favorite scary movie 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.740
 they write 4 it was not the success that was being 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.420
 hoping it was in fact got 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.740
 raise what you had invested and earn 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.930
 a little more but it was not what it was 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.910
 I was waiting therefore I did not think of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.120
 do a sequel even though they were going to do 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.830
 an entire trilogy but still now 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.650
 they rethink the possibility of 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.720
 make a screen 5 and close the saga with 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.890
 that part anyway also 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.050
 I was doing a series for 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.199
 television although they say that it has dyes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.199
 supernatural 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.980
 rumors suggest that it could appear in 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.020
 man of steel 2 wonder woman though 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.820
 surely it would be just a cameo case 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.820
 is that they have already released a trailer fan vale 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.820
 of a possible movie of wonderwall 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.030
 to me the trailer leaves me a bit cold 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.320
 like it more in the pilot chapter of 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.729
 wonder woman 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.729
 tyler I thought 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.780
 ah 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.380
 good saga Friday 13 it seems that 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.230
 it never ends and they continue to take off aftermath 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.970
 and sequels and faces 28 thousand more things and 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.890
 now they are going to release another movie 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.920
 Friday the 13th but that will be the style of 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.500
 paranormal activity a thing like that if that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.930
 already in the halloween movie that operates 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.580
 halloween 11 in which they did the same 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.920
 a kind of reality show I've started 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.590
 to appear in the halloween simple to 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 charge everyone I hope it is not so 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.460
 bad as that movie is but I think it 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.100
 to do better than what to do to 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.620
 the paranormal activity I do not see how a 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.710
 serial killer a balance can fit 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.750
 well there but good with network works well 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.300
 that we have faith 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.040
