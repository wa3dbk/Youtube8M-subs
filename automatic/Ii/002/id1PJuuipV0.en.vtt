with<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> chainmail<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.670> very<00:00:26.910> hard<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.330> cut

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
with the chainmail it's very hard to cut

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
with the chainmail it's very hard to cut
someone<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.470> hope<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.130> did<00:00:29.279> enough

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
someone so you hope that you did enough

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.450 
someone so you hope that you did enough
damage<00:00:29.550> by<00:00:30.539> beating<00:00:31.050> upon<00:00:31.320> their<00:00:31.619> armor<00:00:32.070> that

damage by beating upon their armor that
it<00:00:32.579> would<00:00:32.700> actually<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.630> armor<00:00:34.020> would<00:00:34.170> do

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
it would actually the armor would do

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.920 
it would actually the armor would do
more<00:00:34.440> damage<00:00:34.500> than<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> weapon<00:00:35.809> with<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
more damage than the weapon with the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.209 
more damage than the weapon with the
broadsword<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.530> could<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> number<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
broadsword you could do a number of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.500 
broadsword you could do a number of
things<00:00:38.370> many<00:00:38.820> times<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.239> didn't<00:00:39.420> even

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
things many times they didn't even

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.000 
things many times they didn't even
sharpen<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> edge<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.680> would<00:00:40.800> dull

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
sharpen the edge because it would dull

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
sharpen the edge because it would dull
so<00:00:41.250> quickly<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.570> could<00:00:42.750> still<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so quickly but they could still use it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.790 
so quickly but they could still use it
for<00:00:43.469> thrusting<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.579> even<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:45.510> an

for thrusting and even with an

arteries there was just a very

arteries there was just a very
devastating<00:00:58.289> weapon<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> use<00:00:59.210> the<00:01:00.210> other

devastating weapon to use the other
primary<00:01:00.629> weapon<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.289> probably<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
primary weapon was probably the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
primary weapon was probably the
longsword<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> personal<00:01:03.120> weapon<00:01:03.359> and

longsword for the personal weapon and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.729 
longsword for the personal weapon and
both<00:01:03.719> were<00:01:03.899> used<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.260> conjunction<00:01:04.439> with

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
both were used in conjunction with

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.820 
both were used in conjunction with
shields<00:01:05.840> at<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> same<00:01:07.170> time<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> Middle

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
shields at the same time in the Middle

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.859 
shields at the same time in the Middle
Ages<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:08.640> were<00:01:08.700> using<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.360> broadsword

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
Ages that they were using the broadsword

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.250 
Ages that they were using the broadsword
the<00:01:10.680> Japanese<00:01:11.159> developed<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.030> katana<00:01:12.420> now

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the Japanese developed the katana now

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750 
the Japanese developed the katana now
the<00:01:13.320> katana<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:14.040> probably<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> most

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the katana was probably one of the most

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
the katana was probably one of the most
efficient<00:01:15.330> weapons<00:01:15.600> ever<00:01:15.840> designed<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
efficient weapons ever designed and it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 
efficient weapons ever designed and it
was<00:01:17.340> designed<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> curved<00:01:18.780> blade<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
was designed with a curved blade now the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.410 
was designed with a curved blade now the
difference<00:01:20.100> between<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.430> blades<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
difference between the blades is a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.700 
difference between the blades is a
curved<00:01:21.930> blade<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.439> used<00:01:22.650> more<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:22.920> cutting<00:01:23.549> so

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
curved blade is used more for cutting so

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.899 
curved blade is used more for cutting so
with<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.189> weapons<00:01:26.610> which<00:01:26.790> were

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
with these kind of weapons which were

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
with these kind of weapons which were
generally<00:01:27.270> held<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:27.900> different<00:01:28.290> than

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
generally held a little different than

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
generally held a little different than
the<00:01:28.590> broad<00:01:28.979> swords<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.549> middle<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the broad swords of the middle of the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
the broad swords of the middle of the
European<00:01:30.900> Middle<00:01:31.049> Ages<00:01:31.259> these<00:01:32.040> were<00:01:32.250> used

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
European Middle Ages these were used

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
European Middle Ages these were used
like<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> we're<00:01:33.180> brought<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
like this and we're brought and then you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.530 
like this and we're brought and then you
would<00:01:34.290> slice<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.700> put<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> very<00:01:36.329> good

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
would slice so it would put a very good

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.210 
would slice so it would put a very good
cut<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.049> could<00:01:37.170> also<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.439> used<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.799> thrust

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
cut now it could also be used for thrust

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.910 
cut now it could also be used for thrust
but<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.240> tip<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:39.630> designed<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.530> much<00:01:40.710> for

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
but the tip is not designed so much for

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.120 
but the tip is not designed so much for
that<00:01:41.070> more<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> slicing<00:01:42.360> effect<00:01:42.979> most<00:01:43.979> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that more for a slicing effect most of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120 
that more for a slicing effect most of
your<00:01:44.250> curved<00:01:44.729> weapons<00:01:45.180> throughout<00:01:45.930> India<00:01:46.829> and

your curved weapons throughout India and

your curved weapons throughout India and
also<00:01:47.790> through<00:01:48.149> them<00:01:48.270> through<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.740> Middle

through much of the chainmail and even a
plate<00:02:48.640> mail<00:02:48.850> armor<00:02:49.270> would<00:02:49.630> have<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> hard<00:02:50.140> time

against<00:02:50.770> an<00:02:50.890> axe<00:02:52.140> especially<00:02:53.140> considering

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
that they used which were probably about

the next weapon that they would use and
