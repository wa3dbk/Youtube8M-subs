00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
up slow CD so I have to put it back crap

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.539 
up slow CD so I have to put it back crap
and<00:01:46.970> yeah<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.689> into<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> real<00:01:49.500> part<00:01:49.799> getting

and yeah now into the real part getting

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.560 
and yeah now into the real part getting
some<00:01:50.880> wooden<00:01:51.180> axe<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:52.020> wand<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.950> I

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
some wooden axe is what your wand is I

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
some wooden axe is what your wand is I
like<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> used<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> stick<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.189> yeah

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
like when I used to be a stick but yeah

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.249 
like when I used to be a stick but yeah
people<00:01:57.000> probably<00:01:57.479> everybody<00:01:57.930> knows<00:01:58.110> that

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
people probably everybody knows that

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.510 
people probably everybody knows that
they<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.509> to<00:02:01.070> make<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.280> doum<00:02:02.490> doum

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
they just here to make the doum doum

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.840 
they just here to make the doum doum
doum<00:02:02.939> doum<00:02:03.180> doum<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.219> need<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.640> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
doum doum doum so what you need to do is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.710 
doum doum doum so what you need to do is
type<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.360> slash<00:02:06.810> /<00:02:07.369> h<00:02:08.420> HS<00:02:09.420> f<00:02:10.760> ER<00:02:11.760> e

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
type in slash / h HS f ER e

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.860 
type in slash / h HS f ER e
so<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:13.870> hollow<00:02:14.770> sphere<00:02:15.280> each<00:02:15.610> sphere<00:02:15.970> and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
so it's hollow sphere each sphere and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.850 
so it's hollow sphere each sphere and
then<00:02:17.080> space<00:02:18.030> glass<00:02:19.030> or<00:02:19.690> whatever<00:02:20.260> thing<00:02:20.740> you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
then space glass or whatever thing you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.490 
then space glass or whatever thing you
want<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.340> then<00:02:22.300> I'm<00:02:22.600> just<00:02:22.630> going<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:22.959> put<00:02:23.110> 50

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
want and then I'm just going to put 50

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.680 
want and then I'm just going to put 50
for<00:02:23.709> example<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.490> don't<00:02:24.550> 50<00:02:25.240> will<00:02:25.360> make<00:02:25.510> one

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
for example I don't 50 will make one

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.380 
for example I don't 50 will make one
