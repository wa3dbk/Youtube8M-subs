00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.420 
doesn't matter so now you want to place
four<00:02:13.990> repeaters<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.620> row<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.220> want<00:02:15.370> to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
which I believe if you hit it 3 times a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.690 
which I believe if you hit it 3 times a
bit<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.740> biggest<00:02:21.070> delay<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.370> want<00:02:21.640> to

bit of that biggest delay you want to

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.330 
bit of that biggest delay you want to
put<00:02:21.790> all<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.000> them<00:02:22.210> on<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.390> biggest<00:02:22.720> delay<00:02:23.340> to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
put all of them on that biggest delay to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.280 
put all of them on that biggest delay to
