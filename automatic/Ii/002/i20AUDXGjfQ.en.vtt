00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.480
 my project is very close to my heart 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.810
 because I have been at it for the last 25 years 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.930
 have worked and it my dream my 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.930
 vision is to give a swiss line 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.480
 the secret that is pure swiss and there 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:02.469
 Of course I have the Swiss nature 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:06.350
 and biotechnology combined and 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.259
 researchers from switzerland have the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.380
 Extraction of plant stem cells 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.680
 discovered how that was for me 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.460
 actually that's the basis for mine 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.460
 become a line 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.009
 as I have three different ones 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.640
 stem cells that is the stem cell of 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.210
 Appeal of the faith and of the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.210
 alpenrose 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.970
 yes these three stem cells have a lot 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.890
 important properties that complement each other 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.560
 caught each other by the time 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.580
 apple from the rottweiler late believe 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.310
 his very special apple and the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.000
 the effect of that is the vitality because 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.030
 this apple for months after the exam 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.740
 still nice and round and was plump and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.990
 then they have investigated currency 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.360
 is that even possible because the apples 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.340
 if not specially stored 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.890
 shrink the relatively find then have 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.880
 she then just made this discovery 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.340
 That was the first stem cell in this one 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.260
 hut cell technology how to do that 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.350
 The grape was able to win the gift 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.470
 the effect that they are the stem cells of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.670
 under stress thematic stress 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.340
 protected 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.670
 and of course I have a strong one 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.530
 Connection primarily to the belief 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.420
 Because I was in a wine against 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.910
 I grew up and I was very happy 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.130
 As a child we are fascinated 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.230
 then in autumn in october is always the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.870
 harvest and then we always have that 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.090
 then grapes have taken and have 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.660
 these are hung up in it and we 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.630
 then still in january february 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.120
 beautiful full do not believe that 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.769
 had dried up and that was for me 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.670
 very fascinating how is that at all 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.490
 possible and the third on the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.750
 roseby yes at 3000 meters 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.560
 in the spring is still green and the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.260
 whole circumference stress and cold 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.170
 again it stands and above all it dries 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.730
 not synonymous and this was then just 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.840
 specially won and the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.370
 resilience and he 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.220
 skin and of course your own 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.170
 retain moisture and the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.960
 into which we now in our products 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.960
 These are also old roses from the Valais 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.520
 switzerland means a lot to me because 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.090
 of course, where I grew up 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.630
 anyway center with the high mountains and 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.810
 the places and the material and you 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.930
 have had vineyards my father 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:13.080
 was already a wine producer and we have to 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.790
 home cska fresh vegetables daily and 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.760
 I'm like my grandmother 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.609
 Gather herbal gone and the youth 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.410
 has given me very strong roots and 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.380
 the tradition we had 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.450
 and of course that also influenced me 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.300
 and of course I think that's great 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.310
 I share in this nature in the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.310
 could bring in products 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.020
 the plus in this line is that me 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.120
 alone with the additional active ingredients 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.330
 could make a line 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.150
 it has additional active ingredients the bio 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.350
 edelweiss or organic honey but also 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.190
 allantoin simply important active ingredients 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.080
 this line complements the stem cells 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.430
 help but that one also one 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.430
 has long-term effect 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.569
 that was very important to me because of me 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.729
 found that just that 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.740
 that happens a lot of customers wild 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.349
 messed up the products use 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.120
 and if you choose individual products from one 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.759
 you never choose the same line 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.159
 result of every product gives one 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.550
 synergy that is coordinated 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:34.129
 and if used correctly every day 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.909
 then you also have a consistent company 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.909
 success 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.930
 I have three collections 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.660
 put together that for example 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.820
 a weekend can drive away and stop 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.390
 Do not take the big bottles with you 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.730
 must or on the trip for example 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:01.470
 a different size and a holder luxury 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.470
 in the original version 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.290
 yes the lab is already a bit 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:16.440
 secret what I can think of that 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.919
 is a very renowned laboratory in the 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.240
 mountains in switzerland she has one 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.630
 own source 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:28.289
 and that was certainly a lot for me 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:31.169
 important argument also there the water 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:35.490
 the most important elixir of life at all 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:37.770
 is and is a clean good water 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.520
 of course also important for a basis 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.520
 from a line 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.030
 Actually, not really me 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.169
 here my apple plans cell plus 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.539
 collection 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:59.590
 I have these products of course 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:01.000
 I only tested and applied 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.449
 alone I have no drugs 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.110
 and if you say so afterwards 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:10.150
 Can he be addressed that one says 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.810
 you something is different what do you have 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.460
 made 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.979
 of course I have already secretly 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.229
 smiled with then has nothing 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.259
 betrayed but I was happy 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.259
 me
