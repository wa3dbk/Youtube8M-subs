00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.540
 from the first moment it was shown 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.040
 fall out 4 there was a lot of controversy there was 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.960
 joys from many users 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.240
 They were looking forward to it but also 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.330
 there were criticisms especially regarding the 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.400
 graphic section this is a reality and 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.980
 is that the e3 did not help the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.930
 let's say they took one more than 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.970
 good impression of far out 4 there are many 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.949
 that continue to criticize them well 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.260
 attentive because this time who has 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.869
 came to the fore trying to defend 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.110
 the title on the part of detests has been 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.969
 the very pete james attentive because 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.559
 he wanted to respond to each and every one 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.930
 of criticism and has done it from a 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.180
 quite mature form only says in the 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.489
 entertainment world you can never 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.010
 tell and please everyone 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.750
 He also explained that both 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.850
 the graphics like the gameplay of 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.890
 fallout 4 looking for a resemblance with 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 previous installments of the saga everything is 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.640
 full of familiar and different things 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.090
 but when you play for a long time you 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.030
 you realize how almost everything has changed 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.780
 According to him, in his opinion, he hates 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.940
 the right way 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.119
 and well they are trying to do everything 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.850
 what they can to make Fallout 4 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.549
 be a new generation title though 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.490
 many are not what has appeared on 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.470
 everything there is to see then all the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.210
 space that covers this title not everything 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.920
 that mapping that will include something that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.750
 like many people are not having in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.610
 account when making criticisms and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.680
 comments regarding the gameplay 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.530
 the title but the truth is that what 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.290
 It has been shown in the past 3 not 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.270
 he came to surprise enough as he 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.429
 I would have to wait to have the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.229
 title in the hands of course the 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.960
 Detested guys are pretty 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.259
 pissed off with some of the opinions 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.539
 discharged by users and 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.159
 you what do you think you see file out 4 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.659
 as a title of the previous generation 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.659
 in terms of graphics
