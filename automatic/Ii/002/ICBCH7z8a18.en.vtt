00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello friends this week the channel 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.890
 come experiments we are going to make a 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.689
 garden in a light bulb and we need 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.850
 to do it then very simple a couple of 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.670
 little plants a light bulb and a stopper 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.280
 these of water bottle or similar I have 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.250
 used the ficus um and the as plant and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.019
 planted number 2 the land art was good 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.869
 as for there and we are going to put everything 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.300
 this inside the light bulb first step 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 we put a glove to protect not go 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.869
 to be cut if we have to 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.210
 mine what is the filament and everything 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 that goes in not with a plier and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.770
 very careful not to cut us 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.220
 we eliminate the interior once 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.850
 we already have what is the clean bulb 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.120
 let's put what is the basis that will be 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.610
 the heel cited water bottle carafe 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.250
 ok let's put a little bit of earth 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.930
 inside the bulb we remove what is 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.580
 the portfolio below has quite 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.890
 earth so that's what we'll use to 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.740
 put the substrate of our plants 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.630
 our garden and good once 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.930
 we already have the inland we start 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.820
 with the cicus aa plantar 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.800
 take a piece but this one is very big 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.130
 to put it in so I cut it and 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.530
 left a kind of twigs because 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 is implanted and now we're going for the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.720
 third and good this is like very very 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.090
 compact so let's go doing 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.010
 pieces and we are going to go planting so that 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.900
 it is therefore more or less beautiful distributed 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.119
 and always by the roots in the part 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.430
 lower so they grab the earth 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.590
 that we have previously and good 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.900
 Well, more or less is already done so 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.790
 subtract the watering so that it is well 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.250
 hydrated is how much fish we have 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.119
 that like any plant to water so that 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.550
 grow healthy and strong and good then there 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.070
 we have our garden inside a 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.920
 bulb and if you like the whole subject this 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.479
