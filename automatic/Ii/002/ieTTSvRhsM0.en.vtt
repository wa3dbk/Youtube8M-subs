we're<00:00:04.890> going<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> be<00:00:05.130> doing<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.580> tf2<00:00:06.000> item<00:00:06.600> dupe

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
we're going to be doing a tf2 item dupe

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.970 
we're going to be doing a tf2 item dupe
check<00:00:07.230> tutorial<00:00:08.840> so<00:00:09.840> let's<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.500> your<00:00:10.679> own

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
check tutorial so let's see your own

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.999 
check tutorial so let's see your own
let's<00:00:11.730> just<00:00:11.849> get<00:00:11.910> out<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.179> basics<00:00:12.540> um<00:00:13.009> when

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
let's just get out of the basics um when

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.310 
let's just get out of the basics um when
you<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.219> duped<00:00:14.429> item<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.969> when<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.109> one

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
you have duped item is when you have one

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
you have duped item is when you have one
item<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.800> has<00:00:17.160> been<00:00:17.520> duplicated<00:00:18.260> in<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:20.010> tf2

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
item that has been duplicated in the tf2

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.750 
item that has been duplicated in the tf2
item<00:00:20.670> space<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.949> so<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.100> copies<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
item space and so that copies of the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.390 
item space and so that copies of the
same<00:00:23.939> item<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.510> exist<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.010> same<00:00:26.189> time

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
same item that exist at the same time

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.099 
same item that exist at the same time
basically<00:00:26.939> um<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> we're<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.730> be

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
basically um so we're going to be

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.590 
basically um so we're going to be
looking<00:00:31.109> at<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.279> basis<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> checking<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.300> tf2

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
looking at the basis of checking for tf2

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
looking at the basis of checking for tf2
duped<00:00:33.899> items<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.710> thence<00:00:35.070> by<00:00:35.160> looking<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
duped items and thence by looking at the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.470 
duped items and thence by looking at the
IDs<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:37.070> let's<00:00:38.070> look<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.550> tf2<00:00:39.030> outpost

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
IDs so let's look at this tf2 outpost

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080 
IDs so let's look at this tf2 outpost
com<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> IDS<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.460> hat<00:00:41.730> here

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
com or like at the IDS of this hat here

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.540 
com or like at the IDS of this hat here
which<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.690> duped<00:00:42.989> pretty<00:00:43.590> sure<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:46.550> we

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
which is not duped pretty sure and we

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.220 
which is not duped pretty sure and we
see<00:00:47.789> two<00:00:48.059> numbers<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.629> always<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> lot

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
see two numbers here always see the lot

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.799 
see two numbers here always see the lot
of<00:00:49.289> numbers<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:51.210> main<00:00:51.449> numbers

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
of numbers but we see two main numbers

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.660 
of numbers but we see two main numbers
here<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.230> current<00:00:52.620> ID<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
here we see the current ID and the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.630 
here we see the current ID and the
original<00:00:53.940> ID<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:55.620> original<00:00:55.949> ID<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
original ID the original ID is with the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.130 
original ID the original ID is with the
given<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> item<00:00:57.449> when<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.930> first

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
given to the item when it is first

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
given to the item when it is first
created<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.530> space<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.399> case<00:00:59.609> unboxed

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
created in space so in this case unboxed

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.230 
created in space so in this case unboxed
um<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> current<00:01:03.930> ID<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.040> ID

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
um and then the current ID is the ID

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.500 
um and then the current ID is the ID
that<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.619> when<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.130> user<00:01:08.369> owns<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.240> it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that is when the user owns it like it's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.240 
that is when the user owns it like it's
traded<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.710> know<00:01:10.860> um<00:01:12.290> name<00:01:13.290> description<00:01:14.070> tag

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
traded you know um name description tag

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
traded you know um name description tag
gifted<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> changed<00:01:15.659> his<00:01:15.750> ID<00:01:15.930> every<00:01:16.439> time<00:01:16.680> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
gifted it changed his ID every time that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.940 
gifted it changed his ID every time that
it<00:01:17.130> does<00:01:17.250> something<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.759> um<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it does something like that um so as you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.530 
it does something like that um so as you
can<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.220> there's<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.520> long<00:01:20.820> list<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.240> will

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
can see there's this long list of will

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.480 
can see there's this long list of will
not<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.930> long<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.070> list<00:01:23.310> of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
not really that long but this list of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.569 
not really that long but this list of
ID's<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:25.650> trade<00:01:25.890> history<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.619> yeah<00:01:29.040> so

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
ID's as the trade history and so yeah so

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.130 
ID's as the trade history and so yeah so
these<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> original<00:01:30.030> ideas<00:01:30.540> current<00:01:30.900> IDs

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
these are the original ideas current IDs

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560 
these are the original ideas current IDs
and<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> dupe<00:01:32.670> chat<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.180> when

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and when you have a dupe chat it's when

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
and when you have a dupe chat it's when
two<00:01:33.720> items<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> same<00:01:34.560> original<00:01:34.920> ID<00:01:35.280> not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
two items have the same original ID not

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.480 
two items have the same original ID not
current<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.210> riginal<00:01:36.509> um<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> way

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
current but riginal um so that's the way

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
current but riginal um so that's the way
to<00:01:38.549> check<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:38.970> dupes<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
to check for dupes and I know that this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.440 
to check for dupes and I know that this
hat<00:01:40.590> has<00:01:40.619> been<00:01:40.890> duped<00:01:41.869> many<00:01:42.869> times<00:01:43.110> um<00:01:44.000> it<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
hat has been duped many times um it is a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
hat has been duped many times um it is a
steaming<00:01:46.259> pyro<00:01:46.560> message<00:01:46.920> mask<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.490> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
steaming pyro message mask this is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.569 
steaming pyro message mask this is
probably<00:01:47.909> most<00:01:48.270> famous<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.720> being<00:01:48.960> duped

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
probably most famous for being duped

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.100
