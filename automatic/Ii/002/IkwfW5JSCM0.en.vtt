00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.800
 Point 8 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.599
 the multiple money creation 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.999
 it will be money 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.019
 because the book money which actually only be eligible for cash 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.689
 represents as practical and fast is the actual cash will come 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.689
 compels 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.969
 because happened anyway not picked up, you can claim 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:30.359
 but forgive it several times 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.910
 No 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.170
 if someone wants to withdraw cash you just know a small one 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.940
 Reserve reserve ready for restraint accepted would have been enough 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.880
 No 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.720
 No 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.830
 No it follows at 10% reserve requirements 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.890
 the duo from every bill you get makes ten times as much book money 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.890
 can sda 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.030
 Buck new 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.190
 the modern banking system 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.230
 someone will be credited with a sum of money on his account because he 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.880
 park time 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.930
 This cash is taken as a basis and loans are given only there 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.240
 a minimum reserve of cash is needed 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.469
 The punch saying can be signed on this request 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.120
 N / A 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.650
 4 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.650
 by awarding the loans arises here 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.820
 for which the bank holds 10 sat 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.079
 These interest rates create the need for additional money 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.420
 which in turn is caused by a criticism paid on the plane interest 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.070
 appreciate 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.070
 The system is self-employed here 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.769
 because a container makes one 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.819
 Increases faster and faster 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.889
 You take money which animal does not belong 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.259
 with money flowing does not exist 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.259
 now sitting 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.579
 see promptly 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.259
 Inflation and deflation 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.659
 stable prices 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.879
 inflation 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.950
 because the money supply relative to base and it services too big 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.639
 the money loses its value 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.199
 As a result, the prices of the products increase and money is lost 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:06.169
 Stalkers will lower the overall trust in which is even more 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.599
 Value loses 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.599
 the consequence is an escape into the 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.569
 the fraction 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.379
 Money will be maintained in proportion and services too 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.699
 The value of money rises little and prices fall 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.729
 nobody spends more money than absolutely necessary because the products are always cheaper 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:31.849
 become 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.849
 therefore prices must be lowered even more 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.139
 the consequence is the flight into the money there will always be strong the 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.870
 Demand for goods you noticed from her and thus the production 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.789
 the economy collapses 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.450
 have you followed the guidelines should you have reached a goal now? 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:03.279
 By the way, the world is ruled by money The whole planet is not owned by anybody 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.839
 it has noticed 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:07.359
 the planet has evolved 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.829
 There are now many usable KÃ¼the and it continues to happen 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:18.970
 every day the test increases on new money and you get credit for the in the 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.569
 tent 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.669
 the rich are happy 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.969
 and the poor too busy and it's not questionable anyway 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:34.479
 every day increases the financial pressure on the residents 1 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.479
 Fri. 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.219
 only here is the money 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.939
