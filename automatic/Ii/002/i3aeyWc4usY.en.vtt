want<00:01:52.679> them<00:01:52.799> eating<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.340> completely<00:01:53.789> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
want them eating that completely and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.480 
want them eating that completely and
upsetting<00:01:54.630> their<00:01:54.840> GI<00:01:55.020> tract<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.159> only<00:01:56.310> left

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
upsetting their GI tract so we only left

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.580 
upsetting their GI tract so we only left
them<00:01:56.639> out<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.450> about<00:01:57.509> an<00:01:57.810> hour<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.170> first<00:01:58.319> day

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
them out for about an hour the first day

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.050 
them out for about an hour the first day
the<00:01:58.799> second<00:01:59.159> day<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.279> little<00:01:59.490> bit<00:01:59.639> more<00:01:59.819> than<00:01:59.969> an

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the second day a little bit more than an

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.330 
the second day a little bit more than an
hour<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.990> time<00:02:01.229> goes<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.499> we're<00:02:02.100> basically

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
hour and as time goes by we're basically

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.469 
hour and as time goes by we're basically
giving<00:02:02.549> them<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.909> whole<00:02:03.060> run<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.389> whole

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
giving them the whole run of the whole

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.779 
giving them the whole run of the whole
yard<00:02:03.749> and<00:02:04.109> so<00:02:04.619> they<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.889> be<00:02:05.039> out<00:02:05.189> all<00:02:05.459> the<00:02:05.609> time

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
yard and so they can be out all the time

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.180 
yard and so they can be out all the time
one<00:02:06.389> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.599> things<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.049> bison<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.829> they

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
one of the things that bison do is they

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.520 
one of the things that bison do is they
have<00:02:08.459> wallows<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.450> either<00:02:09.630> have<00:02:09.959> dust<00:02:10.259> baths

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
have wallows they either have dust baths

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.440 
have wallows they either have dust baths
as<00:02:10.800> wallows<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.670> mud<00:02:11.970> baths<00:02:12.209> as

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
as wallows or they have mud baths as

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.780 
as wallows or they have mud baths as
wallows<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:13.380> just<00:02:13.650> what<00:02:14.190> they'll<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.550> is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
wallows they just what they'll do is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.680 
wallows they just what they'll do is
they<00:02:15.000> often<00:02:15.390> will<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.110> into<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.410> wallow

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
they often will get into a wallow

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.570 
they often will get into a wallow
and<00:02:17.810> roll<00:02:18.110> around<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.680> get<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> coating<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.340> mud

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
and roll around and get a coating of mud

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.670 
and roll around and get a coating of mud
or<00:02:19.850> dust<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.450> helps<00:02:20.720> with<00:02:20.840> parasites<00:02:21.380> as

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
or dust and that helps with parasites as

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.800 
or dust and that helps with parasites as
well<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:21.950> help<00:02:22.100> keep<00:02:22.280> them<00:02:22.430> cool<00:02:22.460> we<00:02:23.390> did<00:02:23.630> not

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
well as help keep them cool we did not

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.520 
well as help keep them cool we did not
design<00:02:24.350> one<00:02:24.650> into<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.280> exhibit<00:02:26.140> because<00:02:27.140> we

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
design one into this exhibit because we

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.040 
design one into this exhibit because we
wanted<00:02:27.860> them<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.100> pick<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.610> location<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.750> once

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
wanted them to pick the location so once

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.050 
wanted them to pick the location so once
that<00:02:30.170> happens<00:02:30.770> once<00:02:30.920> they<00:02:31.160> pick<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.430> spot<00:02:31.760> and

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
that happens once they pick a spot and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.490 
that happens once they pick a spot and
they'll<00:02:32.180> they'll<00:02:32.480> be<00:02:32.660> very<00:02:32.810> distinct<00:02:33.410> about

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
they'll they'll be very distinct about

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.830 
they'll they'll be very distinct about
that<00:02:33.800> they'll<00:02:34.010> be<00:02:34.130> very<00:02:34.280> focused<00:02:34.820> on<00:02:35.240> one<00:02:35.540> spot

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
that they'll be very focused on one spot

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.320 
that they'll be very focused on one spot
and<00:02:36.170> they'll<00:02:36.860> start<00:02:37.100> looking<00:02:37.880> at<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.090> spot

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
and they'll start looking at that spot

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.110 
and they'll start looking at that spot
and<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.870> rolling<00:02:39.620> around<00:02:39.710> in<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.430> then<00:02:40.970> we

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
and and rolling around in it and then we

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.090 
and and rolling around in it and then we
can<00:02:41.330> come<00:02:41.510> back<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.080> add<00:02:42.200> some<00:02:42.470> some<00:02:42.860> water

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
can come back in and add some some water

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.640 
can come back in and add some some water
and<00:02:43.430> some<00:02:43.670> dirt<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.210> make<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.960> true<00:02:45.290> mud

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
and some dirt and make that a true mud

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.830 
and some dirt and make that a true mud
wallow<00:02:45.890> for<00:02:46.250> them<00:02:46.430> part<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:47.300> our<00:02:47.330> keepers

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
wallow for them part of what our keepers

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.010 
wallow for them part of what our keepers
do<00:02:48.080> here<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.820> we<00:02:49.820> train<00:02:50.120> our<00:02:50.270> animals<00:02:50.750> if

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
do here is we train our animals if

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.410 
do here is we train our animals if
they're<00:02:51.320> shifting<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.890> new<00:02:52.130> pen<00:02:52.430> coming

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
they're shifting to a new pen coming

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.540 
they're shifting to a new pen coming
over<00:02:53.720> for<00:02:53.990> maybe<00:02:54.680> even<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.040> blood<00:02:55.280> draw

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
over for maybe even a blood draw

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.320 
over for maybe even a blood draw
actually<00:02:56.540> medical<00:02:56.930> procedures<00:02:58.210> getting<00:02:59.210> them

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
actually medical procedures getting them

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.300 
actually medical procedures getting them
to<00:02:59.480> turn<00:02:59.660> around<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.380> we<00:03:00.410> can<00:03:00.590> see<00:03:00.650> both<00:03:00.950> sides

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
to turn around so we can see both sides

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.140 
to turn around so we can see both sides
of<00:03:01.610> them<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.810> short<00:03:03.110> time<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:04.610> getting<00:03:04.820> we

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
of them in a short time just getting we

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.940 
of them in a short time just getting we
build<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.870> relationship<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.650> that's<00:03:06.800> what

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
build that relationship and that's what

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.740 
build that relationship and that's what
training<00:03:07.340> does<00:03:07.520> so<00:03:07.910> obviously<00:03:08.270> food<00:03:08.480> is<00:03:08.600> gonna

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
training does so obviously food is gonna

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.020 
training does so obviously food is gonna
be<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.900> really<00:03:09.200> good<00:03:09.470> positive<00:03:10.040> reinforcer<00:03:10.880> and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
be a really good positive reinforcer and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.420 
be a really good positive reinforcer and
then<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.240> course<00:03:11.300> verbal<00:03:12.310> reinforcements<00:03:13.310> are

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
then of course verbal reinforcements are

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.160 
then of course verbal reinforcements are
also<00:03:13.580> very<00:03:13.970> well<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:14.600> getting<00:03:14.900> used<00:03:15.080> to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
also very well and this getting used to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.870 
also very well and this getting used to
us<00:03:15.260> every<00:03:15.530> day<00:03:15.650> being<00:03:15.890> around<00:03:16.190> us<00:03:16.430> hearing<00:03:16.700> of

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
us every day being around us hearing of

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.720 
us every day being around us hearing of
voices<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:18.470> having<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.400> bond

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
voices and and having that that bond

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.520 
voices and and having that that bond
with<00:03:19.970> them<00:03:20.090> every<00:03:20.330> day<00:03:20.360> really<00:03:21.050> does<00:03:21.230> help

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
with them every day really does help

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.490 
with them every day really does help
with<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.070> whole<00:03:22.280> training<00:03:22.550> process<00:03:23.500> they

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
with the whole training process they

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.500 
with the whole training process they
were<00:03:24.560> literally<00:03:24.950> almost<00:03:25.400> hunted<00:03:26.030> out<00:03:26.300> of

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
were literally almost hunted out of

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.530 
were literally almost hunted out of
existence<00:03:27.020> for<00:03:27.530> many<00:03:27.920> many<00:03:28.280> reasons<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:29.000> they

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
existence for many many reasons so they

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.690 
existence for many many reasons so they
are<00:03:29.720> really<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.230> good<00:03:30.470> example<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:31.130> what<00:03:31.430> we<00:03:31.459> can

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
are really a good example of what we can

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.880 
are really a good example of what we can
do<00:03:31.880> when<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.120> lot<00:03:32.330> when<00:03:32.560> individuals<00:03:33.560> or<00:03:33.830> a

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
do when a lot when individuals or a

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
isn't a great great thing seeing bison

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.420 
isn't a great great thing seeing bison
