the ball you'll have to adjust the
racket<00:00:27.160> angle<00:00:27.489> so<00:00:27.669> you<00:00:27.700> drive<00:00:28.059> the<00:00:28.210> ball

the ball falls back try to catch it on

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.700 
the ball falls back try to catch it on
the<00:00:34.000> racket<00:00:34.360> surface<00:00:34.780> so<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:35.380> goes<00:00:35.559> straight

the racket surface so it goes straight
up<00:00:38.910> exercise<00:00:39.910> 2<00:00:40.210> starts<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.690> same<00:00:40.900> way<00:00:41.170> but

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
up exercise 2 starts the same way but

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.100 
up exercise 2 starts the same way but
instead<00:00:42.430> of<00:00:42.490> catching<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:42.970> ball<00:00:43.150> reverse<00:00:43.930> the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
instead of catching the ball reverse the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.840 
instead of catching the ball reverse the
racket<00:00:44.440> angle<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:44.950> let<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.190> ball<00:00:45.310> bounce<00:00:45.610> on

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
racket angle and let the ball bounce on

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.150 
racket angle and let the ball bounce on
the<00:00:45.940> other<00:00:46.090> side<00:00:46.330> of<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.510> racket

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the other side of the racket

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.500 
the other side of the racket
since<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.280> spin<00:00:48.520> reversed<00:00:48.880> after<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.300> first

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
since the spin reversed after the first

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.420 
since the spin reversed after the first
bounce<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:50.230> opposite<00:00:50.740> slope<00:00:50.860> will<00:00:51.130> now<00:00:51.250> make

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
bounce the opposite slope will now make

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.520 
bounce the opposite slope will now make
it<00:00:51.460> bounce<00:00:51.730> up<00:00:51.940> again<00:00:52.210> give<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.320> bit<00:00:53.500> of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
it bounce up again give it a bit of

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.500 
it bounce up again give it a bit of
extra<00:00:53.829> force<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.790> spin<00:00:55.030> will<00:00:55.180> reverse

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
extra force and the spin will reverse

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.140 
extra force and the spin will reverse
again<00:00:56.220> see<00:00:57.220> how<00:00:57.340> many<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:57.670> can<00:00:57.820> make<00:00:57.970> without

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
again see how many you can make without

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.510 
again see how many you can make without
losing<00:00:58.630> control

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
losing control

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.950 
losing control
obviously<00:01:00.520> this<00:01:00.910> exercise<00:01:01.420> is<00:01:01.600> much<00:01:01.750> more

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
obviously this exercise is much more

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.189 
obviously this exercise is much more
difficult<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.910> next<00:01:04.210> exercises<00:01:04.839> help<00:01:05.049> you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
difficult the next exercises help you

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.790 
difficult the next exercises help you
develop<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.680> racket<00:01:05.979> hand<00:01:06.189> control<00:01:07.620> toss<00:01:08.620> the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
develop a racket hand control toss the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.920 
develop a racket hand control toss the
ball<00:01:08.920> up<00:01:09.130> without<00:01:09.610> spin<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.300> catch<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.780> with

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
ball up without spin and catch it with

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.450 
ball up without spin and catch it with
the<00:01:10.960> racket<00:01:11.350> allowing<00:01:11.770> it<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:11.920> balance<00:01:12.310> as

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
the racket allowing it to balance as

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.149 
the racket allowing it to balance as
little<00:01:12.729> as<00:01:12.790> possible<00:01:13.620> raise<00:01:14.620> your<00:01:14.770> hand<00:01:14.979> and

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
little as possible raise your hand and

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.670 
little as possible raise your hand and
meet<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> ball<00:01:15.610> as<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.940> drops<00:01:16.470> learn<00:01:17.470> how<00:01:17.650> to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
meet the ball as it drops learn how to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.200 
meet the ball as it drops learn how to
control<00:01:17.950> your<00:01:18.130> racket<00:01:18.610> hand<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:22.000> same

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
control your racket hand the same

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.450 
control your racket hand the same
exercises<00:01:22.840> before<00:01:22.990> but<00:01:23.830> this<00:01:23.979> time<00:01:24.190> have<00:01:24.430> a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
exercises before but this time have a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.070 
exercises before but this time have a
friend<00:01:24.760> throw<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.090> ball<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.570> from<00:01:25.810> about

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
friend throw the ball to you from about

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.490 
friend throw the ball to you from about
10<00:01:26.320> feet<00:01:26.470> away<00:01:26.940> again<00:01:28.049> catch<00:01:29.049> it<00:01:29.200> with<00:01:29.350> as

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
10 feet away again catch it with as

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.789 
10 feet away again catch it with as
little<00:01:29.710> bounce<00:01:29.979> as<00:01:30.159> possible<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:32.229> exercise

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
little bounce as possible this exercise

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.380 
little bounce as possible this exercise
is<00:01:33.010> designed<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.460> teach<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.940> feeling<00:01:34.240> for

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
is designed to teach you the feeling for

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.810 
is designed to teach you the feeling for
under<00:01:34.570> spin<00:01:35.010> swing<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.130> racket<00:01:36.250> under<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
under spin swing the racket under the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.850 
under spin swing the racket under the
ball<00:01:37.030> making<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.720> go<00:01:37.840> straight<00:01:38.080> up<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.470> then

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
ball making it go straight up and then

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.500 
ball making it go straight up and then
bounce<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.400> table<00:01:39.729> directly<00:01:40.150> in<00:01:40.210> front<00:01:40.420> of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
bounce on the table directly in front of

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.830 
bounce on the table directly in front of
you

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
you

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.080 
you
make<00:01:41.710> sure<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.040> first<00:01:42.310> adjust<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.760> racket

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
make sure you first adjust the racket

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.609 
make sure you first adjust the racket
angles<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.600> ball<00:01:43.780> bounces<00:01:44.229> straight<00:01:44.320> up

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
angles so the ball bounces straight up

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.690 
angles so the ball bounces straight up
not<00:01:45.040> sideways<00:01:45.840> once<00:01:46.840> you've<00:01:47.020> mastered<00:01:47.170> that

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
not sideways once you've mastered that

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.800 
not sideways once you've mastered that
gradually<00:01:48.700> make<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.030> bounce<00:01:49.180> on<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.479> table

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
gradually make it bounce on the table

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.870 
gradually make it bounce on the table
closer<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.439> closer<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.040> net<00:01:51.220> until<00:01:51.760> you

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
closer and closer to the net until you
