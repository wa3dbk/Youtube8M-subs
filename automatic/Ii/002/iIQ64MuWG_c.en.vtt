00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the description alright so let's start

the description alright so let's start
it<00:00:45.420> off<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:45.539> mapping<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.170> most<00:00:46.379> common

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it off by mapping out the most common

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.860 
it off by mapping out the most common
spawn<00:00:47.100> points<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.610> each<00:00:47.789> flag<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.629> map

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
spawn points for each flag on this map

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410 
spawn points for each flag on this map
for<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.340> quite<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> few<00:00:50.760> spawns<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
for a we have quite a few spawns and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.060 
for a we have quite a few spawns and
they're<00:00:51.750> pretty<00:00:51.899> straightforward<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
they're pretty straightforward but the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.189 
they're pretty straightforward but the
most<00:00:53.219> common<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> back<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.719> spawn<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
most common one is the back a spawn the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.200 
most common one is the back a spawn the
back<00:00:55.350> Center<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> spawn<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:57.030> there's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
back Center a spawn and then there's

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.880 
back Center a spawn and then there's
also<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:57.690> right<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> docks<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
also one that's right by the docks and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
also one that's right by the docks and
that<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> second<00:00:59.789> most<00:00:59.879> common<00:01:00.030> spawn<00:01:00.570> for

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that is the second most common spawn for

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.440 
that is the second most common spawn for
the<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> flag

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.360 

moving<00:01:04.020> on<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:04.830> actually<00:01:05.190> only

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
moving on to be there are actually only

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.280 
moving on to be there are actually only
two<00:01:05.760> spawns<00:01:06.150> attached<00:01:06.480> to<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.870> and<00:01:07.050> they're

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
two spawns attached to it and they're

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
two spawns attached to it and they're
actually<00:01:07.380> quite<00:01:07.740> far<00:01:08.070> away<00:01:08.220> from<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> flag

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
actually quite far away from the flag

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
actually quite far away from the flag
the<00:01:09.720> spawn<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.170> helicopter<00:01:10.860> behind<00:01:11.190> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the spawn by the helicopter behind the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
the spawn by the helicopter behind the
big<00:01:11.430> sinking<00:01:11.850> ship<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> probably<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> most

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
big sinking ship is probably the most

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.110 
big sinking ship is probably the most
common<00:01:13.500> cause<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:13.920> spawn<00:01:14.460> complaints<00:01:15.030> on

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
common cause for spawn complaints on

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.480 
common cause for spawn complaints on
this<00:01:15.480> map<00:01:15.690> it<00:01:16.530> seems<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> should<00:01:17.460> be

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this map it seems like it should be

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.190 
this map it seems like it should be
attached<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.120> the<00:01:18.240> sea<00:01:18.420> flag<00:01:18.690> but<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
attached to the sea flag but that is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
attached to the sea flag but that is
definitely<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:20.100> case<00:01:20.210> from<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
definitely not the case from the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.210 
definitely not the case from the
extensive<00:01:21.870> research<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> did<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.190> only

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
extensive research that I did the only

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.219 
extensive research that I did the only
way<00:01:23.760> you'll<00:01:23.910> spawn<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> hold

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
way you'll spawn there is if you hold

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
way you'll spawn there is if you hold
the<00:01:25.350> beef<00:01:25.530> leg<00:01:25.800> so<00:01:26.670> sometimes<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.240> situation

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the beef leg so sometimes a situation

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
the beef leg so sometimes a situation
arises<00:01:27.870> where<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.590> enemy<00:01:28.860> team<00:01:29.040> holds<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.580> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
arises where the enemy team holds a and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
arises where the enemy team holds a and
B<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> I'll<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.080> pushing<00:01:31.260> towards<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.860> beef<00:01:32.040> leg

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
only to be shot in the back by an enemy

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
only to be shot in the back by an enemy
that's<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.140> spawned<00:01:37.500> by<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.860> helicopter

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that's just spawned by that helicopter

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
that's just spawned by that helicopter
it's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.270> very<00:01:39.600> strange<00:01:39.990> spawned<00:01:40.410> but<00:01:40.770> just

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it's a very strange spawned but just

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.920 
it's a very strange spawned but just
keep<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.460> mind<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.940> keep<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.630> mind<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
keep it in mind and keep in mind that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.570 
keep it in mind and keep in mind that
the<00:01:43.020> enemy<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.740> potential<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> spawn

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
the enemy has the potential to spawn

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.390 
the enemy has the potential to spawn
there<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:44.940> they<00:01:45.270> hold<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> beef<00:01:45.750> leg<00:01:46.190> it's<00:01:47.190> not

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
there if they hold the beef leg it's not

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.980 
there if they hold the beef leg it's not
likely<00:01:47.700> they'll<00:01:48.000> spawn<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.780> hold

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
likely they'll spawn there if they hold

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.370 
likely they'll spawn there if they hold
a<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.770> C<00:01:50.160> as<00:01:50.400> well<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> still<00:01:52.050> can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
a or C as well as be but it still can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.370 
a or C as well as be but it still can
happen<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.640> finally<00:01:53.910> for<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
happen so finally for see just like a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
happen so finally for see just like a
there<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:55.770> quite<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> few<00:01:56.160> spawns<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> they're

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
there are quite a few spawns and they're

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.420 
there are quite a few spawns and they're
all<00:01:57.270> pretty<00:01:57.540> straightforward<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:59.009> one<00:01:59.250> big

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
all pretty straightforward the one big

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
all pretty straightforward the one big
lesson<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.970> learn<00:02:00.149> from<00:02:00.390> these<00:02:00.540> sea<00:02:00.780> spawns<00:02:01.080> is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
lesson to learn from these sea spawns is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.450 
lesson to learn from these sea spawns is
that<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.710> basically<00:02:02.009> separated

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
that they are basically separated

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.960 
that they are basically separated
between<00:02:02.970> back<00:02:03.479> spawns<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.110> front<00:02:04.530> spawns<00:02:04.970> so

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
between back spawns and front spawns so

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.520 
between back spawns and front spawns so
if<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.210> hold<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.229> players

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
if you hold see and you have players

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
if you hold see and you have players
that<00:02:07.619> are<00:02:07.830> hanging<00:02:08.009> back<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.970> spawns<00:02:09.240> are

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that are hanging back the spawns are

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
that are hanging back the spawns are
likely<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.869> anchor<00:02:10.319> towards<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> back<00:02:11.009> three

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
likely to anchor towards the back three

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.250 
likely to anchor towards the back three
spawns<00:02:11.640> which<00:02:12.000> isn't<00:02:12.480> ideal<00:02:12.600> because<00:02:13.050> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
spawns which isn't ideal because you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.890 
spawns which isn't ideal because you
lose<00:02:13.470> math<00:02:13.740> control<00:02:14.240> so<00:02:15.240> if<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.600> avoid<00:02:15.690> it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
lose math control so if you can avoid it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.720 
lose math control so if you can avoid it
try<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.440> your<00:02:16.590> entire<00:02:16.920> team<00:02:17.190> pushed<00:02:17.520> up

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
try to have your entire team pushed up

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
try to have your entire team pushed up
on<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.030> map<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.750> secure<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.319> front

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
on the map so you can secure the front

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.610 
on the map so you can secure the front
see<00:02:19.980> spawns<00:02:20.370> rather<00:02:20.700> than<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.000> back<00:02:21.180> ones

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
see spawns rather than the back ones

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.050 
see spawns rather than the back ones
these<00:02:22.620> fronts<00:02:23.040> ponds<00:02:23.220> make<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> sea

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
these fronts ponds make it so the sea

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.970 
these fronts ponds make it so the sea
flag<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.630> most<00:02:24.780> advantageous<00:02:25.170> flag<00:02:25.770> to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
flag is the most advantageous flag to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.670 
flag is the most advantageous flag to
hold<00:02:26.190> alongside<00:02:26.640> be<00:02:27.120> as<00:02:27.330> long<00:02:28.110> as<00:02:28.170> your<00:02:28.440> entire

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
hold alongside be as long as your entire

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.590 
hold alongside be as long as your entire
team<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:28.980> pushed<00:02:29.370> up<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.300> makes<00:02:30.480> it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
team is pushed up and that makes it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.330 
team is pushed up and that makes it
really<00:02:30.840> easy<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.319> spawn<00:02:31.560> trap<00:02:31.830> people<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
really easy to spawn trap people at the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.980 
really easy to spawn trap people at the
eighth<00:02:32.550> leg<00:02:32.850> because<00:02:33.240> even<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.750> die

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
eighth leg because even if you die

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.900 
eighth leg because even if you die
you'll<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.530> keep<00:02:34.680> spawning<00:02:34.950> mid<00:02:35.370> map<00:02:35.610> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
you'll just keep spawning mid map and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.140 
you'll just keep spawning mid map and
you'll<00:02:36.300> be<00:02:36.420> back<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> action<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.350> no<00:02:37.620> time

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
you'll be back in the action in no time

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.400 
you'll be back in the action in no time
okay<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.209> those<00:02:39.420> are<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.630> most<00:02:39.750> common<00:02:40.200> spawn

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
okay so those are the most common spawn

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.260 
okay so those are the most common spawn
points<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.160> map<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.790> before<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.180> get

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
into the spawn tests I'm going to walk

into the spawn tests I'm going to walk
you<00:02:43.980> guys<00:02:44.190> through<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.520> few<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.060> game

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you guys through a few in game

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.880 
you guys through a few in game
situations<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:46.110> illustrate<00:02:46.620> how<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
situations that illustrate how the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.000 
situations that illustrate how the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.910 
spawns behave on this map for this first
situation<00:02:50.790> right<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:51.540> my<00:02:51.900> team<00:02:52.110> holds<00:02:52.470> C<00:02:52.680> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
situation right now my team holds C and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.890 
situation right now my team holds C and
a<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.520> we're<00:02:53.790> pushing<00:02:53.910> for<00:02:54.209> be<00:02:54.330> right<00:02:54.540> now<00:02:54.690> but

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
a and we're pushing for be right now but

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.320 
a and we're pushing for be right now but
the<00:02:54.990> enemy<00:02:55.290> team<00:02:55.470> holds<00:02:55.920> be<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:57.000> where<00:02:57.240> are

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the enemy team holds be so where are

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.480 
the enemy team holds be so where are
they<00:02:57.420> going<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.660> spawn<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.220> where<00:02:59.340> that

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
they going to spawn this is where that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.130 
they going to spawn this is where that
really<00:02:59.849> weird<00:03:00.090> spawn<00:03:00.390> comes<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.840> right<00:03:00.959> now

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
really weird spawn comes in right now

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.630 
really weird spawn comes in right now
because<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.470> know<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.709> beef<00:03:01.890> leg<00:03:02.099> has<00:03:02.340> two

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
because you know the beef leg has two

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.520 
because you know the beef leg has two
spawns<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.569> they<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.810> potentially<00:03:04.050> spawn

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
spawns that they can potentially spawn

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.260

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
nothing to do with the spawns I'm just

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.180 
nothing to do with the spawns I'm just
getting<00:03:36.780> some<00:03:36.960> kills<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.440> trying<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.010> gain

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190

that map control and get them into an a
spawn<00:03:40.710> trap<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.730> at<00:03:41.850> this<00:03:41.970> point<00:03:42.120> we're<00:03:42.300> going

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
spawn trap so at this point we're going

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.850 
spawn trap so at this point we're going
to<00:03:42.480> pause<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.020> as<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.410> can<00:03:43.530> see<00:03:43.560> on<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
to pause it and as you can see on the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.410 
to pause it and as you can see on the
mini-map<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:44.520> a<00:03:44.550> teammate<00:03:44.940> that's<00:03:45.000> pushed

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
mini-map I have a teammate that's pushed

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.750 
mini-map I have a teammate that's pushed
towards<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> dark<00:03:46.140> side<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.590> map<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.070> I'm

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
towards the dark side of the map and I'm

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.610 
towards the dark side of the map and I'm
assuming<00:03:48.270> he's<00:03:48.480> effectively<00:03:48.960> blocking<00:03:49.320> off

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
assuming he's effectively blocking off

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.990 
assuming he's effectively blocking off
the<00:03:49.650> docks<00:03:50.040> ponds<00:03:50.370> which<00:03:50.610> are<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.820> more

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
the docks ponds which are the more

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.720 
the docks ponds which are the more
common<00:03:51.420> spawns<00:03:51.690> for<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:53.040> where<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.460> enemy

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
common spawns for a so where the enemy

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.400 
common spawns for a so where the enemy
is<00:03:53.760> going<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.970> spawn<00:03:54.210> I'm<00:03:54.420> guessing<00:03:55.290> they're

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
is going to spawn I'm guessing they're

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.590 
is going to spawn I'm guessing they're
going<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.620> spawn<00:03:55.830> rate<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.370> my<00:03:56.520> right<00:03:56.820> behind

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
going to have a quick look to see if

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.190 
going to have a quick look to see if
anybody's<00:04:14.400> coming<00:04:14.550> off<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:14.850> spawn<00:04:15.270> from<00:04:15.630> the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
anybody's coming off of spawn from the

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.320 
anybody's coming off of spawn from the
back<00:04:16.560> center<00:04:16.920> a<00:04:17.040> spawn<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.790> i<00:04:18.000> see<00:04:18.150> that

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
back center a spawn and i see that

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.300 
back center a spawn and i see that
nobody<00:04:18.630> has<00:04:18.750> done<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.859> means<00:04:20.100> they

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
nobody has done that so that means they

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.949 
nobody has done that so that means they
must<00:04:20.549> be<00:04:20.790> spawning<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:21.359> dock<00:04:21.540> side<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
must be spawning on the dock side of the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.630 
must be spawning on the dock side of the
mat<00:04:22.140> because<00:04:22.350> as<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.770> can<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:22.950> my<00:04:23.280> teammate

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
mat because as you can see my teammate

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.150 
mat because as you can see my teammate
is<00:04:23.790> no<00:04:24.000> longer<00:04:24.270> over<00:04:24.660> there<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.440> rotate<00:04:25.919> back

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
is no longer over there so I rotate back

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.890 
is no longer over there so I rotate back
and<00:04:26.430> there<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.760> go<00:04:26.790> once<00:04:27.180> again<00:04:27.419> i<00:04:27.450> get<00:04:27.660> to

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and there you go once again i get to

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.750

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
a green guy spawn right now i'll give

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.460 
a green guy spawn right now i'll give
you<00:04:51.450> guys<00:04:51.540> a<00:04:51.600> few<00:04:51.840> seconds<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.320> make<00:04:52.410> a

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
you guys a few seconds to make a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:00.050 
you guys a few seconds to make a
decision<00:04:57.590> ok<00:04:58.590> times<00:04:58.890> up<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.310> if<00:04:59.850> you<00:04:59.940> guys

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
decision ok times up and if you guys

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.790 
decision ok times up and if you guys
chose<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.510> bond<00:05:00.780> right<00:05:00.960> here<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.650> are

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
chose this bond right here you are

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.890 
chose this bond right here you are
likely<00:05:02.070> correct<00:05:02.400> but<00:05:03.210> i<00:05:03.240> wouldn't<00:05:03.630> completely

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
likely correct but i wouldn't completely

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.600 
likely correct but i wouldn't completely
rule<00:05:04.260> out<00:05:04.410> this<00:05:04.620> spawned<00:05:04.919> by<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.130> cabin

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
rule out this spawned by the cabin

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.210 
rule out this spawned by the cabin
either<00:05:05.960> so<00:05:06.960> let's<00:05:06.990> go<00:05:07.290> over<00:05:07.320> why<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:08.010> is

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
either so let's go over why that is

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.790 
either so let's go over why that is
we're<00:05:09.180> going<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.360> first<00:05:09.600> rule<00:05:09.870> out<00:05:10.110> any<00:05:10.350> spawn

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
we're going to first rule out any spawn

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.700 
we're going to first rule out any spawn
that<00:05:11.010> is<00:05:11.100> not<00:05:11.310> anchored<00:05:11.820> by<00:05:12.090> a<00:05:12.120> teammate

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
that is not anchored by a teammate

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.290 
that is not anchored by a teammate
that<00:05:14.100> leaves<00:05:14.250> us<00:05:14.430> with<00:05:14.610> three<00:05:14.640> potential

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
that leaves us with three potential

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.180 
that leaves us with three potential
spawn<00:05:15.570> points<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.230> now<00:05:16.380> we<00:05:16.440> have<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.830> rule<00:05:16.980> out

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
spawn points but now we have to rule out

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.010 
spawn points but now we have to rule out
any<00:05:17.220> spawn<00:05:17.760> that<00:05:18.030> is<00:05:18.120> blocked<00:05:18.390> by<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.630> direct

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
any spawn that is blocked by a direct

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.840 
any spawn that is blocked by a direct
line<00:05:19.200> of<00:05:19.230> sight<00:05:19.380> from<00:05:19.710> an<00:05:19.860> enemy<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:20.370> as<00:05:20.700> you

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
line of sight from an enemy and as you

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.250 
line of sight from an enemy and as you
can<00:05:20.970> see<00:05:21.000> that<00:05:21.150> spawn<00:05:21.600> right<00:05:21.840> there<00:05:22.080> is

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
can see that spawn right there is

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.430 
can see that spawn right there is
blocked<00:05:23.070> by<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.280> guy<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.730> ship<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:25.260> that

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
blocked by the guy in the ship so that

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.200 
blocked by the guy in the ship so that
leaves<00:05:25.590> us<00:05:25.770> with<00:05:25.950> two<00:05:26.130> potential<00:05:26.610> options<00:05:27.030> and

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
leaves us with two potential options and

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.910 
leaves us with two potential options and
one<00:05:27.810> of<00:05:27.900> them<00:05:28.020> is<00:05:28.080> right<00:05:28.260> by<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.440> cabin<00:05:28.860> and

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
one of them is right by the cabin and

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.890 
one of them is right by the cabin and
that's<00:05:29.070> technically<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:29.610> be<00:05:29.850> spawned<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.390> the

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
that's technically a be spawned and the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.080 
that's technically a be spawned and the
other<00:05:31.050> one<00:05:31.230> is<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.500> front<00:05:32.070> middle<00:05:32.310> C<00:05:32.640> spawn

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
other one is the front middle C spawn

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.879 
other one is the front middle C spawn
okay<00:05:34.510> so<00:05:34.570> let's<00:05:34.810> move<00:05:34.930> on<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.199> the<00:05:35.290> second<00:05:35.650> test

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
okay so let's move on to the second test

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.040 
okay so let's move on to the second test
and<00:05:36.130> in<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.520> case<00:05:36.730> the<00:05:37.000> green<00:05:37.210> team<00:05:37.419> holds<00:05:37.870> B

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
and in this case the green team holds B

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.100 
and in this case the green team holds B
and<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:39.100> red<00:05:39.280> team<00:05:39.460> holds<00:05:39.910> see<00:05:40.150> based

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
and a and the red team holds see based

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.540 
and a and the red team holds see based
on<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.380> positioning<00:05:41.830> of<00:05:41.919> all<00:05:42.130> of<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.340> players

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
on the positioning of all of the players

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.430 
on the positioning of all of the players
on<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.970> map<00:05:43.150> where<00:05:43.389> would<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:43.930> red<00:05:44.199> player

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
on the map where would a red player

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.560 
on the map where would a red player
spawn<00:05:44.800> right<00:05:45.160> now<00:05:45.430> I'll<00:05:46.060> give<00:05:46.300> you<00:05:46.389> guys<00:05:46.540> a

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
spawn right now I'll give you guys a

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.820 
spawn right now I'll give you guys a
little<00:05:46.750> bit<00:05:46.960> of<00:05:46.990> time<00:05:47.169> just<00:05:47.229> like<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.710> last

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
little bit of time just like the last

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.659 
little bit of time just like the last
one<00:05:52.199> if<00:05:53.199> you<00:05:53.380> chose<00:05:53.590> one<00:05:53.800> of<00:05:53.889> these<00:05:54.010> two<00:05:54.190> baxi

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
one if you chose one of these two baxi

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.240 
one if you chose one of these two baxi
spawns<00:05:55.000> here<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.660> are<00:05:55.810> correct<00:05:56.110> let's<00:05:57.100> go

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
spawns here you are correct let's go

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.100 
spawns here you are correct let's go
over<00:05:57.520> why<00:05:57.699> this<00:05:58.300> time<00:05:58.540> we're<00:05:58.720> first<00:05:58.900> going<00:05:58.960> to

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
over why this time we're first going to

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.990 
over why this time we're first going to
block<00:05:59.290> off<00:05:59.500> any<00:05:59.770> spawn<00:06:00.130> wear<00:06:00.460> a<00:06:00.490> green<00:06:00.760> player

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
block off any spawn wear a green player

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000 
block off any spawn wear a green player
has<00:06:01.210> a<00:06:01.240> direct<00:06:01.570> line<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.840> sight<00:06:01.960> on<00:06:02.320> and<00:06:02.560> they

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
has a direct line of sight on and they

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.060 
has a direct line of sight on and they
are<00:06:03.070> essentially<00:06:03.430> blocking<00:06:03.940> those<00:06:04.060> pawns

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
are essentially blocking those pawns

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.650 
are essentially blocking those pawns
as<00:06:06.130> you<00:06:06.310> can<00:06:06.400> see<00:06:06.580> that<00:06:06.820> still<00:06:07.090> leaves<00:06:07.270> us<00:06:07.450> with

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
as you can see that still leaves us with

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.870 
as you can see that still leaves us with
for<00:06:07.930> potential<00:06:08.470> see<00:06:08.680> spawns<00:06:09.040> but<00:06:09.490> if<00:06:09.730> you

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
for potential see spawns but if you

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.970 
for potential see spawns but if you
notice<00:06:10.060> most<00:06:10.780> of<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.080> players<00:06:11.290> are<00:06:11.560> pushed<00:06:11.830> a

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
notice most of the players are pushed a

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.680 
notice most of the players are pushed a
little<00:06:12.130> bit<00:06:12.370> more<00:06:12.550> towards<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.060> ship<00:06:13.300> side<00:06:13.540> of

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
little bit more towards the ship side of

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.510 
little bit more towards the ship side of
the<00:06:13.750> map<00:06:13.960> so<00:06:14.680> they're<00:06:14.830> not<00:06:14.980> likely<00:06:15.190> to<00:06:15.340> be

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
the map so they're not likely to be

that<00:06:19.810> are<00:06:19.900> left<00:06:20.050> over<00:06:20.260> are<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.710> back<00:06:20.890> to<00:06:21.220> see

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
that are left over are the back to see
