00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hi, I'm the chef Jordi Perry from 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.180
 culinary institute of america and I'm going to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.610
 give them this basic cooking lesson 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.599
 how to cook pasta 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.599
 and 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 First turn on the water to have water 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.740
 boiling 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.599
 I'm going to add some salt to the water 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.239
 when pasta is cooked the measurements are 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.050
 a gallon of water a pound of pasta and 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.050
 an ounce of salt 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.530
 so the pasta should be a lot 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.600
 taste we need to wait for the water 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.550
 boil completely before adding the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.040
 paste so that it does not stick when it 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.110
 cook there's a lot of talk about putting oil in 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.629
 the water but it's not really necessary 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.150
 first of all the pasta sinks 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.890
 while the oil floats and second 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.170
 when the water is boiling completely 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.239
 as it is now if the water jumps out of 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.760
 the oea would be a fire hazard for 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.040
 your house the best thing is to leave the oil in 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 your container and use enough water 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 boiling with salt for pasta 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.060
 now as you see is boiling completely 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.200
 now we can add the pasta 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200
 directly to the water 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.080
 always remember whether you make pasta 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.510
 fresh or dry is extremely 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.100
 important to stir often so that 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.890
 pasta does not stick to the bottom of the pot 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.140
 today I chose to make fusilli pasta and this 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 pasta should be delayed approximately 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.970
 10 to 12 minutes to cook as 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.659
 with any of the other noodles or 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.659
 long pasta 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.870
 a cooking time of 10 to 12 minutes 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.930
 it's normal unless you cook pn or 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.910
 citi and even rigatoni 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.830
 that for being a little bigger and 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.830
 thick ones take a little longer 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.799
 but you should always remember that for 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.090
 determine if the pasta is made is 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.090
 important to try them 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:17.070
 which is still quite crispy 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.620
 and another way to determine if the pasta 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.690
 is ready is to cut it in the middle and 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.190
 look in the center of the noodle to see if 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.800
 it is white 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.350
 if it is, it probably still lacks 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.920
 besides water and salt they need a little 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.920
 of patience 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.840
 well finished the cooking time can 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.180
 see that the taut paste is soft and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.640
 now the cabbage we will make is ready to 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.430
 accompany it with the sauce they want and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.819
 so the pasta is cooked until the next 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.819
 Thank you
