00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
kind of wanted to talk about it and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.089 
kind of wanted to talk about it and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
it now I don't get into too much detail

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.200 
it now I don't get into too much detail
about<00:00:16.410> how<00:00:16.590> chargebacks<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.460> done<00:00:17.699> but

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
about how chargebacks are done but

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.849 
about how chargebacks are done but
basically<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> chargeback<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.410> when<00:00:19.560> someone

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
basically a chargeback is when someone

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.710 
basically a chargeback is when someone
says<00:00:20.039> they're<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.369> pay<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.000> minecraft

server for a status rank status or a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.500 
server for a status rank status or a
donator<00:00:25.830> status<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:27.029> they'll<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.359> is

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
donator status and what they'll do is

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.599 
donator status and what they'll do is
before<00:00:27.869> they<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.109> charged<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.039> they'll

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
before they get charged for it they'll

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.550 
before they get charged for it they'll
cancel<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.240> even<00:00:30.779> though<00:00:30.929> they've<00:00:31.170> enjoyed

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
cancel it even though they've enjoyed

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.670 
cancel it even though they've enjoyed
the<00:00:31.740> benefits<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> having<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.149> status<00:00:33.680> now

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the benefits of having that status now

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080 
the benefits of having that status now
this<00:00:34.860> could<00:00:35.040> lead<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.460> lot<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.760> servers

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
this could lead to a lot of servers

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.760 
this could lead to a lot of servers
closing<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:36.690> unfortunately<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.559> only

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
closing down unfortunately and only

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.229 
closing down unfortunately and only
leaving<00:00:37.950> these<00:00:38.190> big<00:00:38.430> servers<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:38.969> which<00:00:39.120> would

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
leaving these big servers up which would

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
leaving these big servers up which would
kind<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.660> monopolies<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.860> cost

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
kind of be monopolies and it would cost

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.799 
kind of be monopolies and it would cost
a<00:00:41.250> lot<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> money<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.030> certain<00:00:42.329> ranks<00:00:42.660> on

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
a lot of money to get certain ranks on

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.560 
a lot of money to get certain ranks on
them<00:00:42.989> or<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:44.100> would<00:00:44.280> only<00:00:44.399> leave<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.149> small

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
them or it would only leave really small

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.000 
them or it would only leave really small
servers<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.410> enough<00:00:46.680> money<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
servers you don't have enough money to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
servers you don't have enough money to
support<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.789> which<00:00:48.450> means<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> they

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
support them which means that they

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.060 
support them which means that they
wouldn't<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> fun<00:00:49.829> things

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
wouldn't have a lot of the fun things

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
wouldn't have a lot of the fun things
that<00:00:50.190> minecraft<00:00:50.489> servers<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.180> today<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:52.440> in

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that minecraft servers have today now in

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.740 
that minecraft servers have today now in
order<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.070> explain<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> best<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.090> I'm

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
server and a private park and hopefully

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.110 
server and a private park and hopefully

in my park I make $200 130 of those

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.560 
in my park I make $200 130 of those
dollars<00:03:07.290> has<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.130> go<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.520> employees<00:03:09.060> to

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
dollars has to go to the employees to

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.630 
dollars has to go to the employees to
maintain<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.140> park<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.770> supervise<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.400> park

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
maintain the park to supervise the park

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000 
maintain the park to supervise the park
and<00:03:11.850> whatever<00:03:12.240> so<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.690> leaves<00:03:12.930> me<00:03:13.110> with<00:03:13.140> $70

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
and whatever so that leaves me with $70

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.250 
and whatever so that leaves me with $70
now<00:03:14.610> let's<00:03:14.820> say<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.030> give<00:03:15.330> 10<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.810> dollars

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
now let's say I give 10 to that dollars

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.640 
now let's say I give 10 to that dollars
in<00:03:16.470> tax<00:03:17.130> for<00:03:18.090> property<00:03:18.600> tax<00:03:18.780> let's<00:03:19.050> say<00:03:19.260> which

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
in tax for property tax let's say which

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.080 
in tax for property tax let's say which
is<00:03:19.800> similar<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.130> keeping<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.700> cost<00:03:20.880> of

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
is similar to keeping the cost of

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.800 
is similar to keeping the cost of
servers<00:03:21.390> up<00:03:21.600> or<00:03:21.810> relative<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:23.940> have<00:03:24.060> $60<00:03:24.690> off

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
servers up or relative so I have $60 off

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.780 
servers up or relative so I have $60 off
now<00:03:24.930> now<00:03:25.170> with<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.440> $60<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.280> keep<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.640> or<00:03:26.760> I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
now now with that $60 I can keep it or I

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.660 
now now with that $60 I can keep it or I
can<00:03:26.970> put<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.420> back<00:03:27.720> into<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.200> server<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.830> make

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
can put it back into the server and make

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.460 
can put it back into the server and make
it<00:03:29.850> better<00:03:30.030> by<00:03:30.450> adding<00:03:30.780> something<00:03:30.959> else<00:03:31.260> like

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
it better by adding something else like

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.870 
it better by adding something else like
let's<00:03:31.650> say<00:03:31.800> it's<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.190> game<00:03:32.370> or<00:03:32.519> whatever<00:03:32.580> so

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
let's say it's a game or whatever so

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.910 
let's say it's a game or whatever so
let's<00:03:32.910> say<00:03:33.090> at<00:03:33.209> my<00:03:33.360> park<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.019> decide<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> want<00:03:34.890> to

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
let's say at my park I decide I want to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.170 
let's say at my park I decide I want to
add<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.070> soccer<00:03:35.400> field<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.000> going<00:03:36.120> to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
add a soccer field and this is going to

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.870 
add a soccer field and this is going to
cost<00:03:36.330> me<00:03:36.540> $60<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.980> by<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.190> time<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.370> spend<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
cost me $60 so by the time I spend the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.680 
cost me $60 so by the time I spend the
$60<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.810> get<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.590> park<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.519> soccer<00:03:41.760> field<00:03:42.570> I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
$60 and get the park the soccer field I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.590 
$60 and get the park the soccer field I
mean<00:03:42.720> then<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.220> zero<00:03:44.610> dollars<00:03:44.880> left<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.480> my

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
mean then I have zero dollars left in my

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.180 
mean then I have zero dollars left in my
account<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.440> means<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:46.800> have<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:46.980> wait

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
account that means that I have to wait

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.470 
account that means that I have to wait
till<00:03:47.370> next<00:03:47.400> month<00:03:47.880> at<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.090> end<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.330> month

now<00:03:52.320> let's<00:03:52.560> say<00:03:52.860> someone<00:03:53.820> during<00:03:54.300> that<00:03:54.510> period

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
now let's say someone during that period

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.040 
now let's say someone during that period
where<00:03:55.290> after<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.680> buy<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.010> soccer<00:03:56.519> field<00:03:57.050> they

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
where after I buy the soccer field they

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.290 
where after I buy the soccer field they
decide<00:03:58.410> they're<00:03:58.650> going<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:58.860> take<00:03:59.070> back<00:03:59.300> $60

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
decide they're going to take back $60

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.350 
decide they're going to take back $60
now<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.110> happens<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.620> am<00:04:01.890> $60<00:04:02.580> in<00:04:02.730> debt<00:04:03.030> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
now what happens I am $60 in debt the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.850 
now what happens I am $60 in debt the
only<00:04:03.540> reason<00:04:03.750> why<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.930> bought<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:04.590> in<00:04:04.650> the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
only reason why I bought that in the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.990 
only reason why I bought that in the
first<00:04:05.040> place<00:04:05.250> was<00:04:05.430> because<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.730> thought

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
first place was because I thought

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.940 
first place was because I thought
someone<00:04:06.660> was<00:04:06.930> going<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.080> cover<00:04:07.350> their<00:04:07.620> money

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
someone was going to cover their money

someone was going to cover their money
and<00:04:08.160> pay<00:04:08.760> me<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.450> was<00:04:09.600> going<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.780> receive<00:04:09.989> it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
and pay me and I was going to receive it

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.350 
and pay me and I was going to receive it
so<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.680> afford<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.160> but<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:11.700> turns<00:04:11.910> out<00:04:12.120> I

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
so I can afford this but it turns out I

so I can afford this but it turns out I
got<00:04:12.660> screwed<00:04:13.140> over<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:14.400> now<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.580> problem<00:04:14.910> that

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
got screwed over so now the problem that

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.780 
got screwed over so now the problem that
I'm<00:04:15.269> facing<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:16.019> I'm<00:04:16.290> in<00:04:16.650> debt<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.580> thing

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
improvements to the park aka the server

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.810 
improvements to the park aka the server
until<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:23.100> make<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.400> money<00:04:23.550> back<00:04:23.760> and

gonna be a month of non improvements
well<00:04:31.590> that's<00:04:32.550> not<00:04:32.760> really<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.000> case<00:04:33.270> what

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
well that's not really the case what

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.720 
well that's not really the case what
happens<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.530> market<00:04:34.830> fluctuates<00:04:35.370> as<00:04:35.550> time

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
happens is the market fluctuates as time

you<00:06:03.000> one<00:06:03.720> person<00:06:04.020> will<00:06:04.950> do<00:06:05.160> a<00:06:05.190> chargeback<00:06:05.610> and

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
you one person will do a chargeback and

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.330 
you one person will do a chargeback and
it<00:06:06.600> won't<00:06:06.810> affect<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.260> server<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.830> will<00:06:07.890> if

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
it won't affect the server it will if

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.650 
it won't affect the server it will if
you<00:06:08.640> think<00:06:08.850> about<00:06:08.970> it<00:06:09.210> there's<00:06:09.390> going<00:06:09.480> to<00:06:09.540> be<00:06:09.600> a

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
you think about it there's going to be a

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.510 
you think about it there's going to be a
lot<00:06:09.930> more<00:06:10.140> people<00:06:10.500> that<00:06:10.590> are<00:06:10.650> thinking<00:06:10.860> just

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
lot more people that are thinking just

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.030 
lot more people that are thinking just
like<00:06:11.910> you<00:06:12.210> so<00:06:12.990> that<00:06:13.170> means<00:06:13.380> that<00:06:13.800> you're<00:06:14.010> not

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
like you so that means that you're not

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.040 
like you so that means that you're not
only<00:06:14.580> you<00:06:15.000> you're<00:06:15.180> going<00:06:15.270> to<00:06:15.360> do<00:06:15.480> it<00:06:15.660> but<00:06:15.990> a

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
only you you're going to do it but a

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.450 
only you you're going to do it but a
bunch<00:06:16.290> of<00:06:16.380> other<00:06:16.590> people<00:06:16.800> are<00:06:17.010> going<00:06:17.100> to<00:06:17.160> do<00:06:17.310> it

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
bunch of other people are going to do it

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.040 
bunch of other people are going to do it
and<00:06:17.700> when<00:06:17.910> a<00:06:17.940> bunch<00:06:18.180> of<00:06:18.300> people<00:06:18.570> do<00:06:18.750> it<00:06:18.870> it

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
and when a bunch of people do it it

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.290 
and when a bunch of people do it it
actually<00:06:19.260> leads<00:06:19.680> to<00:06:19.830> a<00:06:19.950> lot<00:06:20.250> of<00:06:20.280> money<00:06:20.700> so<00:06:21.270> you

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
actually leads to a lot of money so you

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.720 
actually leads to a lot of money so you
could<00:06:21.780> actually<00:06:22.080> be<00:06:22.800> affecting<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:23.490> server

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
could actually be affecting the server

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.670 
could actually be affecting the server
even<00:06:23.970> no<00:06:24.450> matter<00:06:24.630> how<00:06:24.750> big<00:06:25.050> you<00:06:25.200> think<00:06:25.440> it<00:06:25.560> is

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
even no matter how big you think it is

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.170 
even no matter how big you think it is
and<00:06:25.860> regardless<00:06:26.520> of<00:06:26.670> whether<00:06:26.820> you<00:06:26.970> think

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
and regardless of whether you think

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.580 
and regardless of whether you think
someone's<00:06:27.480> rich<00:06:27.720> and<00:06:27.960> they<00:06:28.020> can<00:06:28.170> cover<00:06:28.410> the

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
someone's rich and they can cover the

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.470 
someone's rich and they can cover the
cost<00:06:28.830> you<00:06:29.400> can't<00:06:29.760> do<00:06:30.060> that

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
cost you can't do that

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.450 
cost you can't do that
that's<00:06:30.750> not<00:06:31.050> right<00:06:31.590> and<00:06:31.710> you<00:06:31.830> can't<00:06:32.070> steal

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
that's not right and you can't steal

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.100 
that's not right and you can't steal
things<00:06:32.760> from<00:06:33.000> people<00:06:33.390> just<00:06:33.660> because<00:06:33.930> you

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
things from people just because you

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.560 
things from people just because you
think<00:06:34.380> they<00:06:34.470> can<00:06:34.620> afford<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:36.000> loss<00:06:36.240> on<00:06:36.510> it

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
think they can afford the loss on it

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.020 
think they can afford the loss on it
that's<00:06:36.930> not<00:06:37.140> right<00:06:37.520> so<00:06:38.520> to<00:06:38.580> basically

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
that's not right so to basically

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.180 
that's not right so to basically
conclude<00:06:39.540> don't<00:06:40.380> do<00:06:40.590> charge

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
conclude don't do charge

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.070 
conclude don't do charge
X<00:06:41.340> and<00:06:41.580> if<00:06:41.670> you<00:06:41.760> do<00:06:41.940> do<00:06:42.090> chargebacks<00:06:42.630> and<00:06:42.930> you

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
X and if you do do chargebacks and you

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.070 
X and if you do do chargebacks and you
get<00:06:43.320> caught<00:06:44.120> don't<00:06:45.120> say<00:06:45.420> I<00:06:45.450> didn't<00:06:45.750> tell<00:06:45.900> you

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
get caught don't say I didn't tell you

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.280 
get caught don't say I didn't tell you
so<00:06:46.320> it<00:06:46.950> is<00:06:47.370> stealing<00:06:47.730> and<00:06:48.060> it<00:06:48.210> is<00:06:48.450> fraud<00:06:48.810> so

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
so it is stealing and it is fraud so

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.230 
so it is stealing and it is fraud so
don't<00:06:49.620> do<00:06:49.980> it<00:06:50.010> if<00:06:50.310> you<00:06:50.520> don't<00:06:50.760> want<00:06:50.940> to<00:06:51.030> get<00:06:51.150> in
