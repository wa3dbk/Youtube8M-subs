you
just<00:00:15.420> one's<00:00:15.630> regular<00:00:17.599> so<00:00:18.599> basically<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.290> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
just one's regular so basically this is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.050 
just one's regular so basically this is
what<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.099> the<00:00:20.220> outside<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.880> your

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
what you see on the outside of your

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
what you see on the outside of your
jeans<00:00:22.580> likewise<00:00:27.590> this<00:00:28.590> would<00:00:28.860> be<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.009> triple

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
jeans likewise this would be a triple

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.850 
jeans likewise this would be a triple
stitch<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.700> actually<00:00:30.060> put<00:00:30.239> it<00:00:36.020> right<00:00:37.020> right

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
stitch we actually put it right right

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
stitch we actually put it right right
that's<00:00:38.070> good<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.769> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that's good and then this one so this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.319 
that's good and then this one so this
one<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> clean<00:00:41.429> finished<00:00:41.789> too<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
one is clean finished too with the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.689 
one is clean finished too with the
zigzag<00:00:42.539> sit<00:00:43.019> so<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.859> one's<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.250> credit

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
zigzag sit so this one's actually credit

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.110 
zigzag sit so this one's actually credit
as<00:00:44.789> well<00:00:45.829> it's<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:46.980> called<00:00:47.309> overlap<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
as well it's actually called overlap the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.259 
as well it's actually called overlap the
zig-zag<00:00:48.539> stitch<00:00:48.769> this<00:00:49.769> is<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.210> I'm<00:00:51.210> just

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
zig-zag stitch this is also I'm just

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.060 
zig-zag stitch this is also I'm just
showing<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:51.809> different<00:00:51.839> variations<00:00:52.379> so

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
showing you two different variations so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.180 
showing you two different variations so
right<00:00:53.339> now<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.300> few<00:00:55.079> variations<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.070> we

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
right now we have a few variations so we

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.110 
right now we have a few variations so we
have<00:00:56.339> super<00:00:56.760> skinny<00:00:57.679> then<00:00:58.679> you<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.760> fat

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
have super skinny then you have this fat

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.280 
have super skinny then you have this fat
one<00:01:00.559> which<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.739> would<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.890> similar<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.399> what

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
one which it would be similar to what

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
one which it would be similar to what
what's<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> brand<00:01:04.739> True<00:01:04.949> Religion<00:01:05.370> does<00:01:05.550> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
what's that brand True Religion does and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.870 
what's that brand True Religion does and

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.660 

and<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:13.079> of<00:01:13.200> regular<00:01:13.670> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and then this one is kind of regular so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.160 
and then this one is kind of regular so
it's<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.720> do

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
away from it as well and then when

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.420 
away from it as well and then when
you're<00:03:06.780> done<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.140> can<00:03:07.290> always<00:03:07.530> come<00:03:07.950> back<00:03:07.980> and

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
one so the process uses this kind of

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.960 
one so the process uses this kind of
triple<00:03:34.530> stitch<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.860> lot<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.250> actually<00:03:35.760> probably
