00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
the ends once he got to the end when he

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.200

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
spawns right here and just left it so

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.760 
spawns right here and just left it so
but<00:06:55.389> let<00:06:55.480> me<00:06:55.570> turn<00:06:55.750> it<00:06:55.810> so<00:06:55.960> you<00:06:56.050> can<00:06:56.230> see<00:06:56.530> what

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
product in my hand and just kind of

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.300 
product in my hand and just kind of

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.620 
smear it through my hands just to add
some<00:07:09.490> more<00:07:09.639> product<00:07:10.030> because<00:07:10.180> the<00:07:10.240> product

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
some more product because the product

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.620 
some more product because the product
isn't<00:07:10.900> thick<00:07:11.440> I<00:07:11.680> like<00:07:11.950> thick<00:07:12.630> consistency

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.630 
isn't thick I like thick consistency

tight<00:07:13.870> products<00:07:14.380> and<00:07:14.530> that<00:07:14.620> one<00:07:14.800> was<00:07:14.919> a<00:07:15.010> little

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
tight products and that one was a little

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.790 
tight products and that one was a little
bit<00:07:15.250> watery<00:07:15.700> so<00:07:16.600> it's<00:07:16.960> gonna<00:07:17.110> be<00:07:17.230> interesting

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
bit watery so it's gonna be interesting

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.380
