00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.440
 Uu 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.470
 Uw u u u 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.470
 2 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.910
 Hmm 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.260
 Hmm 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.830
 It is a clutch and flop 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:31.949
 But this is I'm exactly the same as the previous work on Well that conformal 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.300
 Is the material of the beads buoyant or energy 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.300
 Because I used 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:45.020
 Response Response is the movement of the ball of the action has become this fast 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.130
 Action basic actions such as say Pikupiku' just downright stop-and-go 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.240
 Say 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.200
 That Titch Ouchon Chun Chun Che-Otaru 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.730
 I would like to eat 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:02.780
 If you pull slowly and stop and pull slowly and stop, the floating attitude will be like this 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.719
 The ball looks like it's down like this 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.210
 A little while ago 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:11.369
 Listen and in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 This ripple because the response has become faster this response back and stop entering the back returns 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.409
 Come out 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.320
 What kind of insect system to twitch? 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.440
 Easy to do 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.530
 Macon 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.530
 Higher that than say Toka want to fishing 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.070
 Lou, such as wanting fishing in such a do 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.070
 Action is a picture 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.560
 none 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.670
 Hmm 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.670
 I'm waiting
