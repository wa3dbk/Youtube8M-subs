preparation<00:00:13.900> and<00:00:14.079> that<00:00:14.169> is<00:00:14.650> rust<00:00:14.950> removal<00:00:15.400> for

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
preparation and that is rust removal for

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.210 
preparation and that is rust removal for
a<00:00:16.209> successful<00:00:17.080> application<00:00:17.680> of<00:00:17.770> our<00:00:17.980> paint

and for it to last a long time on your

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.410 
and for it to last a long time on your
stove<00:00:20.440> or<00:00:20.560> on<00:00:20.680> your<00:00:20.800> stove<00:00:21.010> pipe<00:00:21.310> you<00:00:21.790> do<00:00:22.120> need

stove or on your stove pipe you do need
to<00:00:22.600> remove<00:00:22.900> all<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.290> rust<00:00:23.530> before<00:00:24.340> we<00:00:24.460> begin

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
to remove all the rust before we begin

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.070 
to remove all the rust before we begin
I'd<00:00:24.940> like<00:00:24.970> to<00:00:25.120> start<00:00:25.480> with<00:00:25.570> a<00:00:25.690> couple<00:00:25.900> of

mask this will protect you from the
flying<00:00:37.610> debris<00:00:37.790> that<00:00:38.120> comes<00:00:38.270> off<00:00:38.510> when<00:00:38.719> you're

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
flying debris that comes off when you're

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.389 
flying debris that comes off when you're
actually<00:00:39.199> doing<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.469> abrasion<00:00:39.949> on<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.129> pipe

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
actually doing the abrasion on the pipe

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.229 
actually doing the abrasion on the pipe
for<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.640> snow

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
for the snow

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
as well when you do the project a couple

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.780 
as well when you do the project a couple
of<00:01:14.659> things<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:14.990> don't<00:01:15.350> want<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:15.920> do<00:01:16.189> is<00:01:16.670> you

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
of things you don't want to do is you

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.910 
of things you don't want to do is you
don't<00:01:17.030> want<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.420> use<00:01:17.630> chemical<00:01:18.170> rust<00:01:18.380> removers

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
don't want to use chemical rust removers

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.710 
don't want to use chemical rust removers
chemical<00:01:19.610> rust<00:01:19.820> removers<00:01:20.299> will<00:01:20.509> leave<00:01:20.689> a

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
chemical rust removers will leave a

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.480 
chemical rust removers will leave a
residue<00:01:20.990> on<00:01:21.409> your<00:01:21.439> Piper<00:01:21.799> on<00:01:22.070> your<00:01:22.220> stove

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
residue on your Piper on your stove

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.640 
residue on your Piper on your stove
because<00:01:23.060> stove<00:01:23.509> right<00:01:23.780> paint<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.229> very

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
because stove right paint is very

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.950 
because stove right paint is very
sensitive<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.310> contaminants<00:01:25.970> we<00:01:26.390> don't<00:01:26.659> want

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
sensitive to contaminants we don't want

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.630 
sensitive to contaminants we don't want
that<00:01:27.170> type<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.439> contaminant<00:01:28.189> left<00:01:28.369> on<00:01:28.549> the

that type of contaminant left on the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.550 
that type of contaminant left on the
stove<00:01:28.909> in<00:01:29.090> preparation<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:30.200> do<00:01:30.350> not

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
stove in preparation so we do not

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.039 
stove in preparation so we do not
recommend<00:01:30.950> using<00:01:31.640> any<00:01:31.939> of<00:01:32.030> those<00:01:32.240> dissolving

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
recommend using any of those dissolving

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.899 
recommend using any of those dissolving
rust<00:01:33.259> dissolving<00:01:33.770> chemicals<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.729> and

rust dissolving chemicals on this and

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.520 
rust dissolving chemicals on this and
then<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:35.450> other<00:01:35.600> thing<00:01:35.869> is<00:01:35.899> that<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.319> seats

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
then the other thing is that the seats

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.620 
then the other thing is that the seats
are<00:01:36.679> going<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:36.979> be<00:01:37.100> very<00:01:37.340> hot<00:01:37.640> services<00:01:38.450> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
survive that heat go through the effort

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.739 
survive that heat go through the effort
to<00:01:42.770> physically<00:01:43.399> remove<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:43.880> rust<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.359> you'll

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749
