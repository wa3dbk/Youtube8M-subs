building what I'm going to be doing is
I'm<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> take<00:01:23.160> some<00:01:23.369> clay<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.000> cub<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
I'm going to take some clay and cub and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.490 
I'm going to take some clay and cub and
form<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> bench<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.540> goes<00:01:27.780> completely<00:01:28.110> around

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
form a bench that goes completely around

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.270 
form a bench that goes completely around
this<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.130> give<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> some<00:01:29.520> more<00:01:29.550> external<00:01:30.210> mass

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
this to give it some more external mass

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.520 
this to give it some more external mass
and<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.550> heat<00:01:32.760> goes<00:01:33.030> through<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.660> it'll

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and as the heat goes through that it'll

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.060 
and as the heat goes through that it'll
heat<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.630> cub<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.710> slowly

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
heat that a cub up and then slowly

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.270 
heat that a cub up and then slowly
release<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.820> heat<00:01:39.060> throughout<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> day<00:01:40.280> as

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
release that heat throughout the day as

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.800 
release that heat throughout the day as
you<00:01:41.550> can<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:41.970> doesn't<00:01:42.300> require<00:01:42.509> too

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you can see this doesn't require too

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.710 
you can see this doesn't require too
much<00:01:42.960> wood<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.710> only<00:01:44.039> use<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.429> about

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
much wood and only use is about

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.180 
much wood and only use is about
one-fifth<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.229> amount<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> regular<00:01:46.979> wood

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
one-fifth the amount of a regular wood

really see it i'm at kind of make that
one<00:02:41.730> out<00:02:41.850> down<00:02:42.090> there<00:02:43.489> most<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.790> gets

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
one out down there most of it gets

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.690 
one out down there most of it gets
covered<00:02:45.300> up<00:02:45.390> once<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.690> plastic<00:02:46.140> gets<00:02:46.290> put<00:02:46.530> on

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
covered up once the plastic gets put on

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.070 
covered up once the plastic gets put on
I'm<00:02:47.700> go<00:02:47.820> ahead<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.060> step<00:02:48.239> outside<00:02:48.450> here<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
I'm go ahead and step outside here and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.650 
I'm go ahead and step outside here and
see<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:49.320> we<00:02:49.410> can't<00:02:49.760> see<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> smoke<00:02:51.180> coming<00:02:51.209> out

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
see if we can't see the smoke coming out

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.760 
see if we can't see the smoke coming out
of<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.870> chimney<00:02:52.489> there

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.210 

sure<00:02:58.400> most<00:02:58.580> my<00:02:58.790> neighbors<00:02:59.120> think<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.570> is

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
sure most my neighbors think this is

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.670 
sure most my neighbors think this is
like<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.280> giant<00:03:01.670> UFO<00:03:02.170> getting<00:03:03.170> ready<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.500> take

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
like a giant UFO getting ready to take

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.350 
like a giant UFO getting ready to take
off<00:03:03.860> in<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.190> backyard<00:03:04.640> here<00:03:05.200> but<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:07.180> as<00:03:08.180> you

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
off in the backyard here but I as you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.930 
off in the backyard here but I as you
can<00:03:08.450> see<00:03:08.630> we've<00:03:08.780> got<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.430> good<00:03:10.430> amount<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.790> smoke

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
can see we've got a good amount of smoke

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.530 
can see we've got a good amount of smoke
coming<00:03:11.270> out<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:12.130> bottom<00:03:13.130> chimney<00:03:13.580> both<00:03:14.300> up

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
coming out that bottom chimney both up

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.680 
coming out that bottom chimney both up
most<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.620> wood<00:03:15.860> as<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:17.120> burns<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:17.570> this

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
most of the wood as it burns in this

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.750 
most of the wood as it burns in this
thing<00:03:17.960> it's<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.380> fairly<00:03:18.800> clean<00:03:19.160> burning<00:03:19.400> stove

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760

once<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.270> heats<00:03:20.420> up<00:03:20.830> you'll<00:03:21.830> see<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.130> smoke

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
once it heats up you'll see that smoke

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.990 
once it heats up you'll see that smoke
