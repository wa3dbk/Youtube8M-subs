00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello to all Russians are cooked 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.710
 fast i 'll show you their seven 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.629
 will have to list very easy to test by 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.330
 the one of no promises will take us 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.790
 butter chocolate pecan nuts 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.250
 the flour of almond powder from 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.870
 sugar a little bit of salt and eggs 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.820
 so we will need three whites and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.439
 three young people so I start with 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.660
 put the butter and chocolate so to 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.920
 melt in the microwave 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.990
 I will start with sequences of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.220
 30 seconds 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.030
 so you have to be careful about 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.450
 burnt the chocolate so here I am going to break 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 but them and I will put so the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.970
 whites on one side and the yellows of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.170
 the other 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.170
 [Music] 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 benjamin corporate stoller so the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.079
 bloggers in my device it's going 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.879
 bring me lightness 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.340
 so here I took out my chocolate and my 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.399
 Butter Microwave oven 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.680
 so I mix right and I 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.860
 incorporate it do I pour it 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.990
 directly in my young people here and there 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 now i'm going to add my 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.630
 pinch of salt in the whites and I'm going 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.630
 go up in the snow 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.979
 george hdr to find my sugar and I 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.810
 will continue to beat for the 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.530
 completely dissolve now I go 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.830
 would say that so could my flour 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.830
 in my chocolate 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.200
 I mix comico for the poor the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 all healer 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.170
 that's it but the whole thing is up there 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.289
 I pour my around a world and with 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.750
 maryse I will try to incorporate so 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.759
 my powder 1 but white butter so 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.509
 gently without making the 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.799
 mass so there we do returns as if 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.799
 we made a foam actually a 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.940
 now I gather so my two 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.120
 preparations yet a very recipe 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:30.200
 easy cooking and quick to see her 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:33.470
 with a great result of the finals well 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.630
 sure you will be able to perfume so this 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.269
 wholesale nor with cinnamon from the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.459
 vanilla or to use so hazelnuts 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.090
 if you want or other nuts from your 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.280
 choice so I used nuts 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.400
 pecan I think it's going very well 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.829
 with my recipe so the device a I 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.859
 will try to divert as if I 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:59.510
 did not foam so to incorporate 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:02.319
 but there are two devices here we want one 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.319
 different mix 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.989
 so my oven is in the process of 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.450
 warm up to 160 degrees or even 170 and 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.239
 so cooking it will be about 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.459
 18 to 20 minutes or watch this 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.910
 what it takes is to actually look at the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.950
 top in our cake if the top 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.300
 and well taken is that the cake is 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.830
 cooked then there I poured but no 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.630
 less than once can the grids 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.849
 and so before if you want but 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.310
 I do not do it and I get to have 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.700
 a very good result 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.819
 here is another device is ready so we 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.709
 will be able to put it in our mold 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.080
 so it's a mold that I have 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.000
 should at first I put 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.510
 so a sheet of parchment paper 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.310
 disappointed share I spotted tunes flour and that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.709
 it's really to be sure not to 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.080
 to have surprise at demoulding 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.239
 so now I'm already mixing 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.900
 as it takes to have no more 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.459
 trace of egg white and I'm going to pour 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.459
 ink all my device in 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.520
 So here we go for the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.520
 baking 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:30.620
 so that's it's there football is and 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:33.289
 then here is the top and taken our 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.560
 cake is slightly flickering it is 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.090
 Perfect I aÃ¯ the cuy 18 minutes at 160 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.210
 degrees so here I 'll leave it 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.129
 cool down and so I'll go to 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.680
 mold release to brownies and therefore to 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:52.090
 well chilled down enough mussels 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.090
 easily thanks to the baking paper 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.560
 it's important to cut it off when it 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.879
 was two points 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:07.069
 so here I am going to cut off so a 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:13.159
 small part placed a big part at stake 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:15.529
 the wheel cut in half and here I am 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.180
 so shows the inside he's really 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.560
 perfectly cooked so you have to 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.529
 respect the cooking time 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.039
 so I put 18 minutes but he 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.039
 must not go beyond 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.880
 we will go to dressage so here I 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.010
 take a brownie here and I'm going 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.520
 serve if he wants an ice ball 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.650
 vanilla then the ideal it would be when 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.510
 even to warm it up 10 seconds to 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.120
 microwave 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.060
 it would be pretty bad there I drop my ball 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.430
 vanilla ice cream and so I'm going there 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.390
 deposit over a chip of 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.790
 chocolate then it's chips of 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.520
 chocolate that you've already seen in my 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.580
 previous videos 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.790
 and there a little bit of this veil to 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.750
 chocolate to decorate here is my recipe 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.750
 is over 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.189
 I will go to tasting 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:24.360
 this brownie a real killer 3 or their 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.630
 hope you enjoyed my video if it's 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.509
 the case 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.750
 think about sharing it and I tell you 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.639
 so 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.050
 see you soon on fast cooking for 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.050
 even easier recipes
