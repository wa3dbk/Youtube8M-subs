00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
tunneling claws yeah tunneling claws

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.420 
tunneling claws yeah tunneling claws
against<00:00:55.760> seven<00:00:56.760> battle<00:00:57.000> cruisers<00:00:57.300> yeah

quicker<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.129> let's<00:01:02.370> simulate<00:01:02.969> reality<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
quicker so let's simulate reality and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.350 
quicker so let's simulate reality and
show<00:01:05.100> how<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.519> gonna<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.970> fact<00:01:06.180> let<00:01:06.330> me

29 29 minds it's a bit of stress to say
that's<00:01:26.100> reality<00:01:26.340> though<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.000> mean<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.540> our

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that's reality though I mean in our

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
that's reality though I mean in our
games<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.829> 29<00:01:29.159> minds<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:29.820> most

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
games we get like 29 minds but most

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.399 
games we get like 29 minds but most
people<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.600> probably<00:01:30.720> gonna<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
people are probably gonna have like a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.039 
people are probably gonna have like a
handful<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.420> yeah<00:01:33.420> realistically<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
handful right yeah realistically a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.600 
handful right yeah realistically a
handful<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.310> show<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
handful but this is just to show the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.789 
handful but this is just to show the
potency<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> Mines<00:01:36.720> versus<00:01:37.170> battle<00:01:37.380> cruisers

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
potency of Mines versus battle cruisers

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.910 
potency of Mines versus battle cruisers
and<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.640> against<00:01:39.390> battle<00:01:40.350> cruiser<00:01:40.530> tank

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and you know against battle cruiser tank

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.039 
and you know against battle cruiser tank
it's<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.250> quite<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.700> viable<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.299> against

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it's not quite as viable but against

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.530 
it's not quite as viable but against
pure<00:01:43.229> battle<00:01:43.560> cruiser<00:01:44.299> actually<00:01:45.299> pretty

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
pure battle cruiser actually pretty

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.020 
pure battle cruiser actually pretty
strong<00:01:45.899> okay<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.280> other<00:01:47.430> thing<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> note

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
strong okay and one other thing to note

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240 
strong okay and one other thing to note
these<00:01:48.329> battle<00:01:48.720> cruisers<00:01:49.140> there<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:49.680> 33

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
these battle cruisers there are 33

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.990 
these battle cruisers there are 33
upgrades<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.590> line<00:01:52.590> holy<00:01:52.979> okay<00:01:53.340> yeah

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
upgrades right line holy okay yeah

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.249 
upgrades right line holy okay yeah
they're<00:01:54.180> fully<00:01:54.360> upgraded<00:01:54.750> mines<00:01:54.930> don't<00:01:55.140> get

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
they're fully upgraded mines don't get

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.380 
they're fully upgraded mines don't get
upgrades<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.100> can't<00:01:56.369> upgrade<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
upgrades like you can't upgrade the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.700 
upgrades like you can't upgrade the
damage<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.049> them<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.590> armor<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.759> nope<00:02:00.710> so

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
damage on them just the armor so nope so

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
damage on them just the armor so nope so
it<00:02:01.770> does<00:02:01.950> depend<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.579> when<00:02:02.850> they<00:02:02.969> push<00:02:03.210> out

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it does depend to when they push out

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.789 
it does depend to when they push out
with<00:02:03.540> these<00:02:03.630> battle<00:02:03.960> cruisers<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> how<00:02:04.649> much

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
with these battle cruisers and how much

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.819 
with these battle cruisers and how much
armor<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.700> stuff<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.030> um

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
armor they have and stuff like that um

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.809 
armor they have and stuff like that um
so<00:02:07.829> your<00:02:07.979> minds<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.640> less

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
so your minds actually get less

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.580 
so your minds actually get less
effective<00:02:09.300> later<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> game<00:02:09.929> technically

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
effective later in the game technically

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
before I even started hey guess how many

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.070 
before I even started hey guess how many
minds<00:04:56.199> I<00:04:56.319> lost<00:04:56.560> 0<00:04:57.870> 0<00:04:59.039> that's<00:05:00.039> good<00:05:00.250> answer<00:05:01.080> I'm

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
minds I lost 0 0 that's good answer I'm

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.270 
minds I lost 0 0 that's good answer I'm
gonna<00:05:02.259> say<00:05:02.470> it's<00:05:02.620> somewhere<00:05:02.889> between<00:05:02.949> zero

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
gonna say it's somewhere between zero

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.350 
gonna say it's somewhere between zero
and<00:05:03.729> negative<00:05:04.180> one<00:05:05.159> maybe<00:05:06.159> your<00:05:06.400> motive<00:05:07.180> one

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
and negative one maybe your motive one

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.320 
and negative one maybe your motive one
almost<00:05:07.870> almost<00:05:08.490> but<00:05:09.490> that's<00:05:09.669> how<00:05:09.909> to<00:05:09.970> deal

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
almost almost but that's how to deal

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.969 
almost almost but that's how to deal
with<00:05:10.599> straight<00:05:11.110> up<00:05:11.229> battle<00:05:11.470> cruisers<00:05:11.800> now

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
with straight up battle cruisers now

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.600 
with straight up battle cruisers now
again<00:05:12.250> if<00:05:12.430> there's<00:05:12.639> tanks<00:05:13.060> it's<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.300> lot<00:05:13.479> harder

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
again if there's tanks it's a lot harder

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.219 
again if there's tanks it's a lot harder
and<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.669> can<00:05:15.909> just<00:05:15.940> run<00:05:16.300> your<00:05:16.449> minds<00:05:16.780> up<00:05:16.900> but

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
and I can just run your minds up but

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.390 
and I can just run your minds up but
even<00:05:17.650> still<00:05:18.090> this<00:05:19.090> is<00:05:19.360> ridiculously<00:05:20.050> strong

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.740 

something<00:05:24.400> to<00:05:24.490> do<00:05:24.639> even<00:05:24.940> if<00:05:25.060> he<00:05:25.150> attacks<00:05:25.389> into

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
something to do even if he attacks into

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.159 
something to do even if he attacks into

the<00:06:22.569> mine<00:06:22.780> if<00:06:23.020> it's<00:06:23.229> scanned<00:06:23.940> see<00:06:24.940> yes<00:06:25.150> and<00:06:25.360> no

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
the mine if it's scanned see yes and no

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.779 
the mine if it's scanned see yes and no
it<00:06:25.659> takes<00:06:25.870> really<00:06:26.500> good<00:06:26.650> micro<00:06:27.250> but<00:06:27.460> you<00:06:27.610> saw

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
it takes really good micro but you saw

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.700 
it takes really good micro but you saw
even<00:06:28.090> running<00:06:28.300> away<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.930> mines<00:06:29.139> are<00:06:29.259> so<00:06:29.440> fast

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
even running away the mines are so fast

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.439 
even running away the mines are so fast
that<00:06:29.830> they'll<00:06:30.039> just<00:06:30.190> catch<00:06:30.400> up<00:06:30.430> now<00:06:31.000> if<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.330> go

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
that they'll just catch up now if you go

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.180 
that they'll just catch up now if you go
over<00:06:31.479> a<00:06:31.719> cliff<00:06:31.960> you<00:06:32.319> can<00:06:32.500> get<00:06:32.650> away<00:06:32.830> from<00:06:32.889> them

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
over a cliff you can get away from them

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.469 
over a cliff you can get away from them
but<00:06:33.400> then<00:06:33.819> you're<00:06:34.000> just<00:06:34.030> delaying<00:06:34.419> the
