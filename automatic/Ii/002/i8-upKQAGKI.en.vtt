yourself he'll spawn inside of you and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.930 
yourself he'll spawn inside of you and
that's<00:01:23.100> pretty<00:01:23.310> cool<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> guess

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
that's pretty cool I guess

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.440 
that's pretty cool I guess
BAM<00:01:25.070> look<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.190> that<00:01:26.280> he<00:01:26.400> spawned<00:01:26.760> inside<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> me

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
BAM look at that he spawned inside of me

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.399 
BAM look at that he spawned inside of me
that<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.930> cool

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that was so cool

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.000 
that was so cool
but<00:01:29.240> basically<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.170> interactive<00:01:31.800> him<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
but basically you can interactive him I

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.999 
but basically you can interactive him I
guess<00:01:32.190> so<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.550> if<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.820> hit<00:01:32.970> him<00:01:33.470> he<00:01:34.470> says

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
guess so like if you hit him he says

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
guess so like if you hit him he says
stuff<00:01:35.219> like<00:01:35.460> he<00:01:35.790> says<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.149> a<00:01:36.299> variety<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
stuff like he says like a variety of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.609 
stuff like he says like a variety of
different<00:01:37.170> things

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
different things

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.550 
different things
BAM<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.600> basically<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.110> textured

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
BAM so it's basically like a textured

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.270 
BAM so it's basically like a textured
cow<00:01:40.969> because<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.990> went<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.530> normal<00:01:44.100> minecraft
