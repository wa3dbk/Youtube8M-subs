 fleas that you can not do of course

 before the day plus the conventional tablet 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.930
 on a tablet that did not have the spee in the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.060
 apex crime then the consumer but 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.509
 consumer that basically used 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.119
 to see your mail your web page to see 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.310
 your social networks and not your 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.009
 movies are his games then he came out in 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.229
 the night category with which we 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.149
 we have him with the nation spain 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.780
 then the consumer could already write 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.759
 your meeting agendas and this is a 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.520
 topic of work or do your drawings and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.619
 now we are presenting a new 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.580
 product not a new category that is 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.110
 the pro category then this in the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.800
 product but what will you do 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.200
 that the consumer can already use it 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.060
 for your professional life 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.980
 many times one has for example 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.200
 you're traveling and you have to be taking 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.820
 your computer with your notebook and generate 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.410
 your tablet and an email where is your 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.970
 jobs and that and three hits at the moment 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.119
 we studied your computer and 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.770
 to a tablet and not carrying his cell 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.360
 then on the last trip 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.480
 I did not get to computers anymore because 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.300
 because since you 're not going to be able to have 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.760
 from the office version for 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.459
 to be able to work not with an attitude is for 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.190
 example the spreadsheet the you're going to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.010
 can see that the look and feel is such 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.450
 which as a like the programs let's say 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.150
 of standards in what is sheet of 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.860
 calculation does not equal happens for what it is 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.459
 text processing and also for what 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.350
 which is the pp not then another of the 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.239
 functions is the subject of doing your 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.860
 conferences and ni red one can 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.110
 share documents up to 20 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.239
 people then this one can be 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.430
 working all and looking at it 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.650
 time and at the same time not as we saw 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.690
 in the presentation or the theme of the floor and 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.460
 remote 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.770
 It happened to me just that day that I was 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.860
 trip what 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.330
 I had to make an approval in sab 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.640
 but the computer had to 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.870
 offices then I went to the remote and if 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.780
 I entered the window of my computer 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.120
 Computer windows opened the SAP 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.070
 from here he made my approval why 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.040
 side because you take control of the screen 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.570
 of the computer then this Tuesday 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.450
 file from your computer from your 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.150
 tablet we went to send you or place the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.540
 files on your computer or vice versa 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 do not 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.930
 or not 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.960
 good to highlight the maximum of 12 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.120
 points is the resolution of the screen 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.880
 closes effectively first we are 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.950
 talking about a 12.2 screen is almost 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.120
 a 4 then if you want to see a 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.810
 magazine you will not be able to see it with the 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.810
 real look and feel 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.590
 RESULTING these metals in the 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.210
 shared screens that can 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.100
 divide them into four to wish one 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.229
 divide one can live up to four 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.229
 parts then for example you are 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.229
 seeing your mail no and next 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:43.880
 maybe you want to see your photograph not 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.880
 then here the game in two 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.060
 and then I do not know how to see your music 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.710
 you want to have it here then and the 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.980
 You have three parts and this one I do not know 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.620
 your contacts or you or your voice 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.850
 here then you have up to four 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.040
 screens that you can work 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.010
 you can size the screen according to 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.990
 size you want to use if you need 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.340
 in each of them with the function 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.010
 also screening that we have seen 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.080
 because this one can also pass your 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.270
 information is with samsung TVs 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.720
 from the series of 6 onwards 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.640
 you can also see the cube in 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.940
 your television without any without any type 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.460
 of cable then this nothing I think that 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.740
 It is an excellent product that will be able to 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.630
 that the consumer does not have has 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.770
 an ultra portability but also 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.770
 a lot of performance and productivity 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.250
 ah 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.780
 but that there must in the 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.730
 desktop of any user 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.280
 indeed not one too 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.410
 you will be able to see we have a keyword 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.480
 bluetooth keyboard that can be placed 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.520
 additional or a mouse also a 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.700
 bluetooth then already for the consumer 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:29.020
 that accommodates us to maybe write with 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.230
 the keyboard that comes here that is 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.790
 worthy is a keyboard that is to size 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.900
 normal but you can also have your 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.020
 additional keyboard thank you very much 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.020
 we see
