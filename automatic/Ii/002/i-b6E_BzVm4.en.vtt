couldn't get comfortable with taking

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.520 
couldn't get comfortable with taking
this<00:00:49.579> technology<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:50.480> just<00:00:50.690> transporting<00:00:51.379> it

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
this technology and just transporting it

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.250 
this technology and just transporting it
off<00:00:52.160> shores<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:53.329> we<00:00:53.510> came<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.899> this<00:00:54.019> room

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
off shores and so we came to this room

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.350 
off shores and so we came to this room
and<00:00:54.410> we're<00:00:54.530> like<00:00:54.649> we<00:00:55.010> just<00:00:55.190> can't<00:00:55.339> do<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:55.579> just

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
and we're like we just can't do it just

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.750 
and we're like we just can't do it just
we<00:00:56.809> gotta<00:00:57.079> stay<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.769> United<00:00:58.100> States<00:00:58.339> then

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
we gotta stay in the United States then

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.229 
we gotta stay in the United States then
I<00:00:59.030> think<00:00:59.449> it<00:00:59.510> was<00:00:59.600> our<00:00:59.719> best<00:00:59.899> best<00:01:00.379> decision

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
I think it was our best best decision

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.049 
I think it was our best best decision
the<00:01:02.239> carbon<00:01:02.629> wheels<00:01:02.809> that<00:01:03.229> we<00:01:03.320> make<00:01:03.530> here

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
the carbon wheels that we make here

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:13.210 
the carbon wheels that we make here
incredible<00:01:05.059> they're<00:01:05.239> their<00:01:05.659> life<00:01:05.869> change<00:01:12.220> you

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
incredible they're their life change you

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
how it builds you're not just having a

robot pump out wheels all day the wheel
is<00:01:58.890> mounted<00:01:59.100> into<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:00.990> they're

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
is mounted into this so what they're

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.540 
is mounted into this so what they're
looking<00:02:01.410> for<00:02:01.440> on<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.800> test<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.460> you

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
looking for on the test is that you

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.920 
looking for on the test is that you
don't<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.880> any<00:02:03.210> exposed<00:02:03.600> sharp<00:02:03.930> edges

broken but it passes blowing stuff up is

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.480 
broken but it passes blowing stuff up is
very<00:02:09.690> fun<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.619> get<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.770> lot<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:10.979> data<00:02:11.250> from
