00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 hey I 'm Biemann again and me 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.240
 have a very small but good tip 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.900
 who should never help with learning 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.900
 this is where the world goes down 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.260
 we know it all enjoy very often 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.090
 learn things by heart be it for the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.430
 be it for work or for school 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.140
 certain tests the driver's license that 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 memorize is always meet us 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.439
 I live again in want you here 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.439
 betrayed a little trick like that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.079
 Things are really good and effective in the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.940
 Pear wars simply take a din a3 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.070
 Sheet writer takes a punch of space 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.530
 a short description and a little 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.500
 picture and glue to the wall cryptic whole 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.570
 lots of notes to the wall reading garden 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.860
 do you have to handwriting I paint because 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 memorize better 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.870
 what does it say you have to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.420
 learn the pq formula then you write 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.699
 you big on sheet against high then 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.859
 Do you perhaps make a sign of how? 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.390
 the plus - and the root sign and 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.760
 That's what you hang on the wall 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 you are only looking at this picture and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.100
 visualizes you the right pq 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.729
 formula the picture or this sign the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 root 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.210
 She should have a little hint 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.890
 give as the formula reads note 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.270
 should you after a time too 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.270
 cover or paint over 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.470
 in the end , only really should stand there 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.360
 pq formula and nothing else than you 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.800
 will come to another example you 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.560
 want to know how long the 30-year-old 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.170
 criticism fun on the side, everyone knows that 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.360
 He know a 30 years due to a 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.520
 but until when the 30 year war 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.680
 was then you just take one again 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.180
 note writes on it thirty-year-old 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.080
 war and then you could for example 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:53.400
 a football with 610 and a foot 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.400
 at 18 and then the 6 18 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.470
 So 16 18 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.650
 there began the thirty-year war and 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.830
 lasted you know exactly 30 years 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.450
 until 16.48 third only the drums and 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.430
 this foot and feet better said 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.290
 and knows exactly what's going on 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.870
 another example you learn the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.330
 capitals of the world and bite at the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.760
 arrived in Turkey and so you want one 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.450
 Note have studied istanbul well 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.060
 can remember nothing comes back I have 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.900
 I 've got you all we know 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.120
 ankara that the capital of Turkey in 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.520
 cookclubs a note writes turkey 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:41.110
 big on as a catchword on the list 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:44.110
 and malt an anchor you see this image 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.300
 and visualizes ankara someday 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.280
 you think the anchor and you know okay 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.140
 there was an anchor and you come completely 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.900
 fast on the banker as a capital 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.680
 turkey a super trick star race 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.960
 through the room 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.200
 look at the notes and I'm mine 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.190
 One hundred percent sure you are doing 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.320
 to memorize everything 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.980
 It's also fun because everyone will 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.980
 brain half excited 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.210
 creative vein his analytical but me 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.070
 Wanted success with everyone for what they learned 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.860
 tell me how it went, says 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.860
 benefited me if patrick has benefited
