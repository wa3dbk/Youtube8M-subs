00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.200
 almost utrecht has shown that there 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.980
 something can be achieved as a sub-topper 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.750
 the arena 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.800

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.010
 which was thought to be necessary in advance 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.410
 fighting relegation 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.410

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.510
 then vvv az 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.450
 I'm going for a surprise 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.299
 if you want to win something like this 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.680
 then you also go for some surprises 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.790
 everyone has a can of starting 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.590
 nature can be completely beside 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.140
 sit down then it's the fun of it all 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.180
 game you want is right yes 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.680
 it is often called feyenoord twente tent 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.120
 burden I heard in the tub 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.799
 this week from a good friend of mine 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.659
 who is a true feyenoord supporter and how 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.630
 me on a Saturday night game yes 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.820
 Saturday from 9 and then go 40,000 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.409
 behind it and then the pacer feyenoord sled 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.990
 feyenoord is going to win through it okay 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.060
 then the then have lost groningen 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.070
 heerenveen 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.090
 It can be anything 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.090
 heerenveen yes 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.570
 to groningen so often this season 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.830
 lucky and with competitions where they 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.110
 not have total points 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.369
 and it deserves one at a time 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.020
 Sunday 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.790
 then groningen goes a tad once 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.890
 to get 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.970
 roda vitesse 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.090
 about competitions where anything is possible 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.090
 to happen 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.130
 roda i think i'm for robo anyway 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.750
 I have had a strong team in recent years 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.550
 don't understand that she cleans so low 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.200
 In recent years 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.720
 now you see that as those guys even longer 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.060
 stay together that it will be now 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.530
 bearing fruit and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.570
 can never be an easy one with psv 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.670
 against those guests heart and that's why I think 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.260
 it also not strange that they are whole this year 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.810
 do well then two psv guyana are you 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.070
 look and that turns and when I do something 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.610
 otherwise we would put no explanation 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.200
 ok so clearly heracles nec 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.470
 maybe a tricky one for you 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.820
 not a long way yes but the time goes by 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.269
 another child on the artificial grass again 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.340
 and that i guess is the round hole and 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.470
 how many danny koevermans finally there 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.470
 well we know that Sunday evening around 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.090
 the clock from a quarter past six this is in 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.090
 at least they are predictions
