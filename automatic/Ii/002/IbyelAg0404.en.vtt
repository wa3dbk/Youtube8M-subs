00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.569 
my favorite places to travel and that's
so<00:00:37.370> hard<00:00:37.609> because<00:00:37.789> you<00:00:38.480> can<00:00:38.539> think<00:00:38.870> about

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
so hard because you can think about

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.709 
so hard because you can think about
scenically<00:00:40.579> you<00:00:40.850> can<00:00:41.000> think<00:00:41.149> about<00:00:41.329> cultural

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
scenically you can think about cultural

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.439 
scenically you can think about cultural
you<00:00:41.899> can<00:00:42.140> think<00:00:42.289> about<00:00:42.440> food<00:00:42.940> but<00:00:43.940> there<00:00:44.269> is

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
you can think about food but there is

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.880 
you can think about food but there is
one<00:00:44.780> place<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.050> I've<00:00:45.289> traveled<00:00:45.530> that<00:00:45.859> I

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
one place that I've traveled that I

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.080 
one place that I've traveled that I
think<00:00:46.160> that<00:00:46.280> I<00:00:46.339> have<00:00:46.609> to<00:00:46.670> return<00:00:46.879> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
think that I have to return to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.810 
think that I have to return to
and<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:48.510> probably<00:00:48.690> India

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
and that's probably India

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.310 
and that's probably India
in<00:00:50.059> five<00:00:50.420> months<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.929> bicycling<00:00:51.320> on<00:00:51.559> India

traveled it's the most a mystic streams
of<00:01:38.000> everything<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:39.590> hated<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.520> I

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
loved it and I think that a lot of times

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.389 
loved it and I think that a lot of times
journeys<00:01:43.520> are<00:01:44.060> like<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.590> because<00:01:45.590> if<00:01:46.250> you

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
journeys are like that because if you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.580 
journeys are like that because if you
just<00:01:46.759> love<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.090> place<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.810> probably<00:01:48.229> means<00:01:48.350> you

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
just love a place it probably means you

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.889 
just love a place it probably means you
haven't<00:01:48.970> firth<00:01:49.970> enough<00:01:50.240> or<00:01:50.539> you<00:01:50.660> probably

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
haven't firth enough or you probably

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.529 
haven't firth enough or you probably
haven't<00:01:51.229> had<00:01:51.470> quite<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.190> adventure<00:01:52.539> because

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
haven't had quite the adventure because

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.680 
haven't had quite the adventure because
there<00:01:53.899> always<00:01:54.080> been<00:01:54.350> ups<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.710> downs<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:56.030> so

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
there always been ups and downs and so

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.850 
there always been ups and downs and so
it's<00:01:56.930> probably<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.259> place<00:01:57.410> I'll<00:01:57.590> have<00:01:57.740> to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
it's probably a place I'll have to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.020 
it's probably a place I'll have to
return<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.869> go<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.009> lot<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:01.460> exotic

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
return so you go to a lot of exotic

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.320 
return so you go to a lot of exotic
places<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.920> lot<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.520> us<00:02:04.640> can't<00:02:04.910> do<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:07.030> if<00:02:08.030> you

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
places a lot of us can't do that if you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.050 
places a lot of us can't do that if you
had<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.570> week<00:02:08.950> from<00:02:09.950> where<00:02:10.310> we<00:02:10.429> are<00:02:10.459> at<00:02:10.850> this
