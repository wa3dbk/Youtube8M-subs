00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.959
 moin moin welcome main 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.910
 operator technology and lifestyle channel 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.170
 You will often be asked how 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.210
 we turn our videos which 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.529
 technology we use and we have 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.980
 yes already some contributions to it 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.320
 brought 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.150
 today so that they give us theme light 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.919
 in the past I have this topic 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.810
 always a bit downcast 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.730
 I have to admit we have to admit some 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.829
 videos were not perfectly lit. 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.500
 that has changed now since then 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.600
 We are setting the cinema permanently 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.560
 system of gioia camera on 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.199
 If we have the camera now 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.420
 Perspective changes scores is the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.960
 Camera then you see what I am now 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.269
 see both of us easily 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.030
 Tripods with the light bulb and the 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.010
 reflector look on it and the whole 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.570
 I'll put that closer to you now 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.280
 in front 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.500
 he comes back to the set up which 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.030
 we insert here you have just seen 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.559
 we have two of these noise ourselves 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.179
 that has the advantage that we have two 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.489
 can illuminate pages that gives 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.650
 less shadow for example in the face 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.900
 There are also fewer reflections because 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.630
 you do not radiate directly from the front 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.340
 must and the one or the one who 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.380
 filmed or photographed 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.909
 we will blind you too 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.829
 Do not stop that from the side 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.689
 here comes the whole time now in detail 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.880
 that can be permanent light system 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.290
 modular 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.390
 this is here for example 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.399
 the lamp tripod that should always be 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.189
 It also has a lamp socket 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.560
 These with screen bracket to the screen 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.570
 and of course the bulb 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.899
 I said the whole thing is modular 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.649
 that means you can do it 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.299
 yours, the light situation of a study 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.430
 Always adjust the situation 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.159
 you could, for example, the umbrellas 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.719
 exchange this screen against each other 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.369
 is a through light 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.800
 you can start from reflection stems like 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.450
 this one, for example 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.940
 his first silver story something 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.190
 harder light for portrait photography 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.080
 there is also one of the gold 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.410
 That's what makes a something coated 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.119
 warmer increases what the products 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.800
 portrait photography much more pleasant 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.270
 now can different tune 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.250
 easily be replaced by 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.650
 here the screw triggers the terror 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.410
 undresses and then the other again 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.570
 it starts quickly and it works 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.350
 easy you can also the angle here 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.520
 to adjust 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.560
 the whole swing is located as well 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.530
 the lamp version is also the one 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.300
 switch for the lamp many systems 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.010
 that come from other manufacturers 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.530
 do not offer that will simply be the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.230
 Lamp 0 is switched on by the plug 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.240
 we have an on and off switch 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.980
 so come tell me a light bulb you 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.720
 probably had it like me 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.540
 at the beginning also something much smaller 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.520
 but expected the size of this lamp 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.820
 makes sense and has a purpose 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.190
 she is very bright she has 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.480
 Here are 4600 flowers in comparison 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.420
 what would you probably have more 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.209
 expected this lamp has similar to the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.150
 has had 60 this has 50w this 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.290
 brings as I said 4600 logan this 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.300
 hold only 2600 lumens and that makes 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.030
 film and take pictures already 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.670
 amount 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.380
 Daylight lamps with 5000 kelvin there 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.590
 You should also pay attention when you 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:28.120
 you lamps will buy that about this 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.810
 came up 5000 5400 should it be then 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.760
 you have had a relatively neutral light 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.069
 the other day the land tripod it can be up 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.319
 adjusted to two meters 5 in height 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.269
 simply by doing so 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.670
 the clip opens then it is solved 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.489
 and you can push it up and down 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.390
 and then the whole thing again 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.799
 shut up and it locks me up 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.560
 I hope I could meet you here with one 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.470
 small insight in it next to us 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.090
 Illuminate our set here and 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.860
 Maybe some ideas were given 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.930
 you can do that at home 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.200
 this system what I presented to you 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.579
 I'm relatively cheap and yet 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.450
 makes it a very professional one 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.030
 impression 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.970
 and the nice thing about it is modular 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.370
 you can build up the different ones 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.169
 exchange parts with each other 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.930
 did you already see it there? 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.990
 different companies you exchange 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.120
 can use and that's what it does 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.020
 whole as practical and also for the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.510
 home users relatively cheap if we 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.039
 The foot needs to look in 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.979
 the video description there are all 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.800
 on the left and also in our blog 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.900
 there are many more information 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.870
 and there also demonstrate again our 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.810
 complete set up i hope i have 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.130
 Do not promise too much and you 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.690
 Turn on again next time 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.950
 i would like to thank you in any case 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.950
 once to watch and say
