00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.610
 hello to all youtube friends be a 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.830
 more welcome to my section of 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.080
 tutorials where we install mods and 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.349
 sometimes very interesting skins to our 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.480
 gta san andreas and this time I want 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.239
 share a very good way but 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.430
 before answer me you have sighted you have given 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.919
 account that in the gta san andreas without 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.770
 mods or anything have different flame of 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.079
 shot but it does not look very real installs 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.300
 new effects but it is lost by 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.550
 complete that shot flame effect 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.610
 different and all the weapons fire the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.440
 same call then if so, this is your 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.420
 video and mod indicated 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.030
 first download the mod that will be 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.790
 uploaded to mediafire but before it will come out 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.940
 a link waits 5 seconds and then 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.430
 jump advertising well once what 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.590
 stay offloaded them a file 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.970
 Rar like this what we have to do 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.950
 is to give you right click extract here 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.440
 [Music] 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.440
 and leave us a folder like this 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.829
 inside that folder will have some 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.910
 images of how the mod looks and 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.700
 mod files 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.119
 [Music] 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.119

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.040
