00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:18.100
 bbi Yes really I can tell you and eat ease impact from the motorway is fit degree today 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.030
 Fuel efficiency is now catalog 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.020
 36 It is 100,000 kilometers 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.350
 me 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.550
 It is this car Ne real fuel consumption actually god 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.100
 Good Points I'm such about the movement by ne leaves and to be 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:38.260
 30 kg 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:41.260
 I will try to see if 30 km fuel economy will occur with the fitted hybrid 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 cap 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:53.210
 It's because I ran 28 km on the highway now 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:59.800
 An average hides it is Tsukai sleep the Toka I auto-cruise will be 27 period so in the ward crisp 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.800
 Well a little while in the middle of a conference about 80 km gold speed 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:13.600
 I think now I will try a little Kyun sword at high speed inter 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:18.830
 Just when I ran my sister 10 km 50 km now the average fuel consumption is 26 k 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:22.400
 I was running at a much Hey econ mode, but I thought the way congestion Toka' 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.030
 Fuel consumption is falling and rising a little 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.990
 Will it actually go 30 kilometers 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.100
 Good good 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.220
 me 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.220
 yeah yeah 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:40.790
 I'm entering now, so the mileage is 155 km and the average fuel consumption is up to 24 km with Ghana 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:46.670
 It went down, after all 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:51.060
 Fast fly in about that decent sound 150 kilometers finally your 10 kilometers whether warp Gardens function 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.720
 I full well chapati like a little pure deteriorate and Gane Ow 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.720
 me 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:05.220
 Yes I think I will try to drive down the road from now on 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:09.780
 It was around 27km even if we went east on that expressway, but 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:14.640
 I think that going down more and more towards the fuel consumption and still get off from now on non-toll road 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.910
 Well 30km was still impossible But how far do you really extend 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.180
 let's go 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.180
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:35.269
 It's comfortable I have ran towards had embryonic stem that still cats country road in 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:39.799
 It is that daytime road with no signal and no end , but still a little jealousy and mean bark 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.480
 A little voice Well I There is a 23.5 k 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:48.980
 I think that falling 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.980
 From here a I think that the average fuel consumption is good for the skin up to about 25 km 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.510
 I 've been running things that I can't get by just entering 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.110
 200 groups and ran 207 km 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:07.320
 It is 24 k to the average fuel efficiency mother 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:11.260
 I'm getting 23.9 kg Yeah I think that there is really good fuel economy of you in the catalog 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.730
 But it is not run armor as good Hey talk Moma I'd 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:20.110
 Well, but this Honda hybrid is pretty good winding, isn't it? 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:25.870
 I 'm thinking about the fuel efficiency after all that hybrid is chasing recently and it does not run easily 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:31.280
 Its own way but this is Kedomo I had a little run in the middle sister that econ mode is 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:35.180
 There was no patties alone, but I didn't go for 30 kg of liters 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.600
 m Fit hybrid actual fuel consumption was 24 k 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.280
 So I measured the actual fuel efficiency of the fitted hybrid 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.280
 Could be Johnny phone 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.900
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:10.709
 pou dou dou 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.090
 voodoo 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.090
 dee
