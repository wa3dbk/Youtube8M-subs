00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.840
 3 - 5 is minus 23 is the positive sign and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.050
 5 is the negative sign 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.730
 as they are of different signs is subtracted 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.730
 and you notice the sign of the greatest 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.019
 that is the rule that is used in the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.600
 subtraction of whole numbers if the signs 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.239
 they are opposites that is to say a positive one and one 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.839
 negative is subtracted that's what has been 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.410
 done here 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.920
 3 - 5 2 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.770
 and the sign of the greater is repeated as the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.840
 greater is 5 and its negative sign in the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 result is also notice negative sign 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.670
 8 of the positive sign 8 - 4 is plus 4 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:28.530
 - 26 is more 4 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.040
 - 54 is minus 1 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.720
 note how this is being applied 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.720
 rule in all these exercises 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.800
 in all of them has been subtracted that is the 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.890
 rule is subtracted when they are signs 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:50.040
 opposites subtract 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:53.720
 is 48 minus 446 minus 24 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.720
 and 524 some 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.680
 but what interests us is that it 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.680
 repeat the sign of the greater 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.709
 so when subtracting you must identify 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.500
 which is greater between 3 and 5 the greater is 5 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.860
 its negative signs and that's why it repeats 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.670
 the negative sign the sign of the greatest 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.770
 between 4 and 8 the biggest is 8 his sign is 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.390
 positive and that's why in the result 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.910
 notes the highest positive between 6 and less 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.170
 26 his sign is positive and that's why 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.530
 score positive in the result 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.930
 between minus 5 and 4 the largest is 5 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.680
 its negative sign and that 's why it's not so 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.439
 negative in the result 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.439
 always notice in the result the sign 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:55.150
 of the oldest when the 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.150
 subtraction of two whole numbers 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.980
 now practice perform the following 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.980
 subtraction 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.580
 here are the results
