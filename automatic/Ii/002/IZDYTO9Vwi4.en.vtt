some<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.710> features<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.369> unit<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
some of the features of this unit the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.960 
some of the features of this unit the
most<00:01:27.049> notable<00:01:27.470> difference<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.790> you'll

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
most notable difference is that you'll

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.800 
most notable difference is that you'll
feed<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.329> stock<00:01:29.630> from<00:01:30.530> left<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.890> right<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
feed the stock from left to right the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.170 
feed the stock from left to right the
reason<00:01:32.960> for<00:01:33.229> that<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:34.430> bits<00:01:34.640> below<00:01:35.000> the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
reason for that is the bits below the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.870 
reason for that is the bits below the
work<00:01:35.390> surface<00:01:36.100> now<00:01:37.100> that's<00:01:37.280> an<00:01:37.399> added<00:01:37.670> safety

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.270 
barely see the profile emerge but in
between<00:02:49.180> passes<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.900> shut<00:02:50.739> down<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.040> router

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
between passes I shut down the router

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.830 
between passes I shut down the router
and<00:02:51.700> raise<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.599> fit<00:02:52.810> height<00:02:53.049> slightly<00:02:57.840> block

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
and raise the fit height slightly block

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:09.070

the<00:02:59.049> router<00:02:59.260> into<00:02:59.560> place<00:02:59.769> make<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.609> second

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.980 

since<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.340> bearing<00:03:10.760> guided<00:03:11.120> bit<00:03:11.330> for

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
since this is a bearing guided bit for

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.140 
since this is a bearing guided bit for
the<00:03:12.110> third<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:12.500> final<00:03:12.680> pass<00:03:13.070> I'll<00:03:13.670> level<00:03:13.940> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
the third and final pass I'll level the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.960 
the third and final pass I'll level the
bearing<00:03:14.480> even<00:03:14.990> with<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.230> tabletop<00:03:15.770> this<00:03:16.760> will

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
bearing even with the tabletop this will

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:28.210 
bearing even with the tabletop this will
cut<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.240> full<00:03:17.480> profile<00:03:18.050> of<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.350> bit

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.030 

I<00:03:31.780> was<00:03:32.780> really<00:03:33.080> impressed<00:03:33.320> with<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.710> finish

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
I was really impressed with the finish

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.810 
I was really impressed with the finish
that<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.460> bit<00:03:34.730> left<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.450> wood<00:03:36.520> it<00:03:37.520> barely

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
that this bit left on the wood it barely

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.970 
that this bit left on the wood it barely
needs<00:03:38.030> any<00:03:38.180> sanding<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:39.200> looks<00:03:39.410> great<00:03:39.740> right

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
needs any sanding it looks great right

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:50.089 
needs any sanding it looks great right

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
the next operation we're going to do is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.839 
the next operation we're going to do is
to<00:03:52.629> make<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:52.930> crown<00:03:53.260> molding<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:54.459> similar

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
to make this crown molding it's similar

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.660 
to make this crown molding it's similar
to<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.629> molding<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.109> we<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.409> made<00:03:56.650> yet<00:03:57.549> we

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
to the molding that we just made yet we

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.220 
to the molding that we just made yet we
don't<00:03:57.849> have<00:03:57.969> a<00:03:58.000> bearing<00:03:58.420> guided<00:03:58.719> bit<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.109> the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
don't have a bearing guided bit and the

is<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.239> little<00:04:01.480> shallower<00:04:02.069> we'll<00:04:03.069> make<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.280> in

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
is a little shallower we'll make it in

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.080 
is a little shallower we'll make it in
two<00:04:03.670> passes<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.510> when<00:04:05.409> the<00:04:05.530> face<00:04:05.769> is<00:04:05.799> cut<00:04:06.219> then

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
two passes and when the face is cut then

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.750 
two passes and when the face is cut then
we'll<00:04:07.209> put<00:04:07.420> two<00:04:07.569> 45-degree<00:04:08.170> angles<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.189> the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
we'll put two 45-degree angles on the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.080 
we'll put two 45-degree angles on the
back<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.659> that<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.959> crown<00:04:11.200> fits<00:04:11.560> against<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.159> 90

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
back so that the crown fits against a 90

bit<00:04:20.079> into<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.680> router<00:04:21.509> put<00:04:22.509> the<00:04:22.599> router<00:04:22.780> back

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
bit into the router put the router back

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.279 
bit into the router put the router back
into<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.440> horizontal<00:04:23.710> router<00:04:24.190> table<00:04:28.229> for<00:04:29.229> the

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.850 
into the horizontal router table for the
first<00:04:29.500> pass<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:30.160> raise<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.330> bit<00:04:31.539> so<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.620> just

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
first pass I raise the bit so it just

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.480 
first pass I raise the bit so it just
protrudes<00:04:33.250> above<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.639> table<00:04:38.099> again<00:04:39.099> using

protrudes above the table again using

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.339 
protrudes above the table again using
downward<00:04:39.820> pressure<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.900> make<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.169> first

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
downward pressure and make the first

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.350 
downward pressure and make the first
pass

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.899 

turn<00:04:45.259> off<00:04:45.409> the<00:04:45.590> router<00:04:45.800> between<00:04:46.220> passes<00:04:46.699> and

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
turn off the router between passes and

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.649 
turn off the router between passes and
raise<00:04:47.449> the<00:04:47.629> bit<00:04:47.810> height<00:04:49.389> this<00:04:50.389> crown<00:04:50.629> molding

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
raise the bit height this crown molding

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.230 
raise the bit height this crown molding
has<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.139> pretty<00:04:51.439> shell<00:04:51.680> profile<00:04:52.280> so<00:04:53.030> this

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
has a pretty shell profile so this

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.280 
has a pretty shell profile so this
second<00:04:53.719> pass<00:04:54.050> will<00:04:54.379> be<00:04:54.409> the<00:04:54.590> final<00:04:54.949> tax

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.850

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.320 
the back install a 45 degree chamfer bit
into<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.340> router<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:12.640> I'll<00:05:13.640> chamfer<00:05:14.090> both

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
into the router and I'll chamfer both

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.820 
into the router and I'll chamfer both
edges<00:05:14.810> of<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:14.990> backside<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.620> crown
