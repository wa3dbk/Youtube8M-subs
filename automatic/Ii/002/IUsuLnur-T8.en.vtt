like to get the most mileage out of a

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.360 
like to get the most mileage out of a
scale<00:00:33.699> as<00:00:33.850> possible<00:00:34.330> by<00:00:34.690> playing<00:00:35.050> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
scale as possible by playing it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.740 
scale as possible by playing it
essentially<00:00:36.370> in<00:00:36.550> three<00:00:36.790> octaves<00:00:37.239> instead<00:00:37.720> of

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
essentially in three octaves instead of

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.140 
essentially in three octaves instead of
just<00:00:37.989> one<00:00:38.170> position<00:00:38.710> first<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.129> all<00:00:39.220> want<00:00:40.089> to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
just one position first of all want to

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.430 
just one position first of all want to
let<00:00:40.239> you<00:00:40.329> know<00:00:40.449> that<00:00:40.480> i<00:00:40.629> am<00:00:40.659> tuned<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.289> have

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
let you know that i am tuned to have

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.830 
let you know that i am tuned to have
step<00:00:41.710> flap<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:45.190> Annie

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
step flap is Annie

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.230 
step flap is Annie
so<00:00:47.230> if<00:00:47.320> you<00:00:47.380> want<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.590> tune<00:00:47.740> to<00:00:47.770> me<00:00:48.240> you

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
so if you want to tune to me you

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.090 
so if you want to tune to me you
probably<00:00:49.450> may<00:00:50.320> be<00:00:50.380> a<00:00:50.470> little<00:00:50.620> out<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.830> tune<00:00:50.980> I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
probably may be a little out of tune I

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.920 
probably may be a little out of tune I
just<00:00:51.280> took<00:00:51.370> this<00:00:51.490> out<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:51.790> case<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.240> I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
just took this out of the case and I

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.830 
just took this out of the case and I
need<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.230> change<00:00:53.410> strings<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:55.480> one<00:00:55.660> of<00:00:55.750> my

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
need to change strings is one of my

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.330 
need to change strings is one of my
gigging<00:00:56.230> geeking<00:00:57.040> guitars<00:00:59.010> and<00:01:00.010> my<00:01:00.130> band

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
usually tunes a half step flap it's

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.780 
usually tunes a half step flap it's
actually<00:01:03.730> fairly<00:01:04.059> common<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.760> do<00:01:06.940> that<00:01:07.650> okay

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
actually fairly common to do that okay

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790 
actually fairly common to do that okay
hope<00:01:09.790> you're<00:01:09.970> in<00:01:10.030> tune<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.450> e<00:01:10.869> minor<00:01:11.440> blues

scale<00:01:12.190> first<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:12.790> all<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:13.060> based<00:01:13.300> on<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.540> E

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
scale first of all is based on the E

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.270 
scale first of all is based on the E
minor<00:01:13.930> pentatonic<00:01:14.410> scale<00:01:14.890> which<00:01:15.070> are<00:01:15.190> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
minor pentatonic scale which are the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.510 
minor pentatonic scale which are the
notes<00:01:15.400> e<00:01:15.670> G<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.660> B<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.070> D<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:18.760> then<00:01:18.970> they<00:01:19.119> repeat

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
notes e G a B and D and then they repeat

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.310 
notes e G a B and D and then they repeat
EEG<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:22.479> that's<00:01:22.660> just<00:01:22.720> one<00:01:22.840> position<00:01:24.660> if<00:01:25.660> you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
EEG so that's just one position if you

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.430 
EEG so that's just one position if you
add<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.590> b-flat<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:28.210> there<00:01:28.540> that's<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.840> flat

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
add a b-flat in there that's the flat

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.639 
add a b-flat in there that's the flat
five<00:01:29.680> in<00:01:30.610> there<00:01:31.479> then<00:01:31.690> that's<00:01:32.170> commonly

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
five in there then that's commonly

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:39.810 
five in there then that's commonly
called<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.009> blues<00:01:33.250> scale<00:01:37.560> ok<00:01:38.560> that's<00:01:39.399> a<00:01:39.550> blues

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
called the blues scale ok that's a blues

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.870 
called the blues scale ok that's a blues

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
now I did put a g-sharp in there we'll

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.200 
now I did put a g-sharp in there we'll
talk<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.549> little<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:47.819> that's<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
lot of looks like that that essentially

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
lot of looks like that that essentially
works<00:01:55.020> over<00:01:55.259> eight<00:01:55.439> dominant<00:01:55.469> 7<00:01:56.159> which<00:01:56.249> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
works over eight dominant 7 which the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.630 
works over eight dominant 7 which the
corner<00:01:56.640> playing<00:01:56.819> here<00:01:57.380> okay<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.530> wouldn't<00:01:58.890> play

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
corner playing here okay I wouldn't play

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.139 
corner playing here okay I wouldn't play
the<00:01:59.789> G<00:02:00.000> sharp<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.079> was<00:02:01.200> playing<00:02:01.349> over<00:02:01.560> us<00:02:01.799> a

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
the G sharp if I was playing over us a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.570

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
okay three octaves I also recommend that

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.980 
okay three octaves I also recommend that
you<00:03:52.460> try<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.670> use<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.030> same<00:03:53.270> technique

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
you try to use the same technique

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.110 
you try to use the same technique
ascending<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.040> I'm<00:03:55.190> doing<00:03:55.490> it<00:03:55.700> seems<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:56.030> be

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
ascending that I'm doing it seems to be

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.850 
ascending that I'm doing it seems to be
the<00:03:56.210> most<00:03:56.360> efficient<00:03:56.840> if<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.380> work<00:03:57.530> out<00:03:57.740> your

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
the most efficient if you work out your

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.070 
the most efficient if you work out your
own<00:03:57.920> that's<00:03:58.160> fine<00:03:58.370> too<00:03:58.610> 1<00:03:59.240> i'll<00:03:59.660> show<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.870> two

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
a little flavor to that if we're playing

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.670 
a little flavor to that if we're playing
over<00:04:44.999> a<00:04:45.360> major<00:04:45.629> chord<00:04:45.960> or<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.080> dominant<00:04:46.499> chord

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
over a major chord or a dominant chord

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.969 
over a major chord or a dominant chord
like<00:04:46.830> in<00:04:46.949> blues<00:04:48.319> you<00:04:49.319> still<00:04:49.560> want<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.740> use<00:04:49.860> that

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
like in blues you still want to use that

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.019 
like in blues you still want to use that
minor<00:04:50.219> scale<00:04:50.550> perhaps<00:04:52.610> now<00:04:53.610> I've<00:04:53.729> done<00:04:53.849> some
