00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.550
 very good what if you actor and good 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.860
 in this video I bring you pvm that made a 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.799
 little bit that did not go up and well we're 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.900
 against the worker to see that it is a 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.419
 dungeon than the sole people do not usually 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.180
 go but there is one thing that is very expensive not 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.820
 I know if it's a good nail I think so 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.600
 It is one of the worker and is seen quer 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.000
 on my server is now at about 60,000 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.830
 and good because it's pretty good it is 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.390
 easy European but not only the drop but 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.339
 achievements achievements can give you 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 up to 10 or each achievement gives you 10 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.760
 then I had already passed is more 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.649
 morra and had already won here more but 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.649
 I thought maybe I could be 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.980
 try some achievement with with my pgr and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.960
 I'm doing the bridge sheet 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.170
 I know how to pronounce it but it's the one 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.609
 you have to kill in a 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.379
 and the truth is that quite difficult 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.469
 because walker goes down a lot and as not 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.629
 get hooked then kill us and have 9 pm 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.909
 so it will be hard for me to hold it while 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.739
 loaded bombs but good with a with a 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.289
 good start go scary here 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.089
 As you can see, we are putting up with the bad 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.979
 is that the first shift almost the bundle or 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.840
 because I wanted to cheat him repulsively 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.820
 the worker to be to stay away 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.850
 try to approach but the trap 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.970
 repulsive low life then yes yes the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.380
 get to activate would pay the challenge or 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.970
 I would finish the achievement that I am trying 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 do it because if it does not it does not help me 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.700
 much more morra 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.200
 so good as you see the bombs 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.640
 they start to be a little bit more charged 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.250
 and good with a leg of magnetization 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.850
 it's simply to keep them more 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.100
 easy to scare him and well then we're going 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.959
 moving away is the cyborg 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.209
 it also goes down a lot and it's getting closer and 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:41.539
 good for the other two I do not care 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:43.970
 too much but but good thing is that 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.709
 you have to do in four combos well 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.049
 facts because if we are not going to shit it and 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.789
 here with the vessel because I'm approaching the 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.280
 worker because we're going to kill him already 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.930
 vulnerabilities left him a little bad 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.020
 placed then with a strategy 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.210
 evolved 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.399
 and with a tide we already see that we are 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.140
 they plow dow into that faucet that 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.600
 over there has a deadly trap there 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.369
 inside and as you can see, very simple with 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.289
 a kick of coal because if not the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.509
 I consider going to die approached me to 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.790
 give you more voice with the pumps and so 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.940
 get to lower more and then it is already 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.349
 we have a war that the dead has not been 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.330
 it has not been enough it has not been weighed 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.670
 it's going to be harder, come on and now 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.489
 I would touch the cyborg we would have to go back 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.140
 to load the pumps then we're going to 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.410
 it and we have to put up without giving it 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.450
 with nothing without giving him repulsive yes yes without 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.220
 do nothing but good as you see then no 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.950
 I get a lot of life because the cyborg only 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.840
 hits in a straight line and moves 3 pm well 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.120
 that I'm not, I'm not worrying 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.620
 I was going to do double but I already had 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.989
 done before he had only zampado the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.269
 worker at a good time I'm going 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.500
 giving vulnerabilities and the thing is that 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.480
 the civilian goes to the side that does not 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.579
 I wanted him to go down to the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.459
 right and the uncle then put on by 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.900
 behind the wall thing that prevents me 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.549
 kill him on this turn so 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.260
 I just stand one more doing 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.750
 here a trap immobilization and with the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.400
 panda was even going to give him there 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.930
 sober drunk to drive him away but 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.180
 as I was also going down I can not so 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.590
 I have to take it and throw it again and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.590
 as you see low very much has hitched 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.650
 to rami and you have downloaded seven hundred and two 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.390
 times so much eye with that but 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.760
 well this is already here we put it in 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.870
 undefined glyph to have to have 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.480
 the bombs ready for the next 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.730
 objective and we already kill it simple 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.320
 bad is that because they have lowered me in a 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.290
 I'm confused in a mini dismissal 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.600
 lowered to the were a lot but but good 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.430
 as I have the guardian at 3 I already believe and 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.010
 with the estimate I simply approach the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.239
 guardian then stop to look for 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.880
 cure me a little bit that I think I 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.550
 they had gone down 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.640
 and here we call directly for the 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.320
 why elementary than with a convict with 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.010
 play trick and swindle I can I can put it 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.300
 also moved away the fire pump to 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.250
 what 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.020
 can happen and give two attacks 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.390
 deadly and so make sure that what 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.000
 we killed and until now only the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.640
 mouth is not and it's mouth or breast work more 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.240
 is not mom work the thing is that I was 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.650
 Bicha gives me a lot of problems because 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.810
 As you can see, it stays and cornered in the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.220
 corner I do not want to approach because 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.040
 knows that we are trying to do the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.440
 and how do you know that, he says no no no 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.870
 I 'm going to make it difficult for you besides 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.340
 that I have resistance, then, over 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.830
 I'm going to stay here in the corner as 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.150
 you see you try to kill the small bomb and 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.710
 it stays in the little corner as saying 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.690
 no no, he does not love me, you're not going to me 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.400
 make a combo the thing is that if you 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.130
 make a combo of these with the bombs 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.930
 great from that corner as it has 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.090
 as it has resistance because it does not 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.550
 I would get down but because it seems that 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.650
 it comes out and I'm going to put it in here and it 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.120
 forget that the vessel was out there 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.830
 touching the eggs and not see until the 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.170
 vessel would have been easier 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.970
 we would have just there but it has 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.380
 complicated enough here last 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.360
 breath preparing for the next 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.070
 shift but nothing because the mother does not 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.729
 they would approach the bombs and I would 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.499
 complicates a lot until here good 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.529
 as a little bit strange he approached the panda 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:02.150
 so I can pick it up and throw it where 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.430
 there are the bombs and so when it comes 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.949
 the scammer and we take this is left 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.050
 ready maybe I could have captured but 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.020
 I thought it would be more 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.180
 difficult the issue of I do not know to push away the 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.430
 worker and that maybe I would have to 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.569
 lower more life but as you see a con man 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.930
 of specialty is to kill one and one 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:27.289
 challenge that I have proposed to see this is 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.750
 try to pass thousands to that is super 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.400
 hard 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.350
 and more with a continuator scammer and 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.700
 you know I'm very used to saying 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.800
 what serves us no dungeon 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.780
 geeks 3 well I think in unharmed can 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.330
 get to serve but you have to curry it 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.860
 a lot then I'll try to do it 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.120
 for the next video and I hope that 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.950
 you liked life favorites 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.780
 subscribe like all my videos 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.830
 comments appeared remember that 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.690
 I have a facebook that hair when 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.170
 they see all the videos and nothing that we 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.170
 we see in the next
