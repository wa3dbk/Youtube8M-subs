of money that is just ready to be spent

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.789 
of money that is just ready to be spent
so<00:01:33.570> other<00:01:33.689> than<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
so other than that really that's the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.649 
so other than that really that's the
main<00:01:35.009> four<00:01:35.430> options<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:35.970> think<00:01:36.329> would<00:01:36.509> be

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
main four options that I think would be

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
main four options that I think would be
the<00:01:36.689> reason<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.170> by<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> s4<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.460> reason

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the reason to go by the s4 the reason

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.999 
the reason to go by the s4 the reason
being<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.360> similar<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> s3<00:01:40.259> design

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
being it's very similar to the s3 design

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.889 
being it's very similar to the s3 design
wise<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.119> you'd<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.479> holding<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
wise it's not like you'd be holding it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.179 
wise it's not like you'd be holding it
out<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.170> someone's<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.590> oh<00:01:43.770> you've<00:01:44.040> got

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
out with someone's like oh you've got

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429 
out with someone's like oh you've got
the<00:01:44.310> s4<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.090> more<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.360> oh<00:01:45.659> okay<00:01:46.049> he's<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the s4 it's more like oh okay he's got a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.399 
the s4 it's more like oh okay he's got a
galaxy<00:01:47.009> samsung<00:01:47.310> galaxy<00:01:47.850> s3<00:01:48.200> possibly<00:01:49.200> if

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
galaxy samsung galaxy s3 possibly if

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
galaxy samsung galaxy s3 possibly if
you're<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.799> into<00:01:50.100> tech<00:01:50.329> they'll<00:01:51.329> realize

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you're really into tech they'll realize

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
you're really into tech they'll realize
that's<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> s4<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.950> terms<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> software

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that's the s4 in terms of the software

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.190 
that's the s4 in terms of the software
is<00:01:53.790> pretty<00:01:53.970> much<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> same<00:01:54.420> got<00:01:54.869> those<00:01:55.020> small

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
is pretty much the same got those small

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.130 
is pretty much the same got those small
things<00:01:55.350> such<00:01:55.799> as<00:01:55.829> air<00:01:56.189> view<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:57.360> may<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.869> for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
things such as air view which may be for

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.569 
things such as air view which may be for
some<00:01:58.290> would<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.890> beneficial<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
some would be really beneficial but I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.280 
some would be really beneficial but I
think<00:01:59.759> from<00:01:59.909> most<00:02:00.180> especially<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.110> way<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
think from most especially the way that

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
think from most especially the way that
we<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:01.710> our<00:02:01.829> technology<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.579> how<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.060> utilize

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
we use our technology and how we utilize

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.969 
we use our technology and how we utilize
technology<00:02:03.719> probably<00:02:04.350> won't<00:02:04.500> even<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.680> much

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
technology probably won't even be much

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
technology probably won't even be much
of<00:02:05.009> use<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.210> maybe<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.659> know<00:02:06.780> something<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
of use and maybe you know something to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.930 
of use and maybe you know something to
get<00:02:07.290> used<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.740> over<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> next<00:02:08.190> cup<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
get used to over the next cup of you and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.750 
get used to over the next cup of you and
top<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.479> years<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.679> i<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.280> samsung

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
top of years but i think that samsung

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
top of years but i think that samsung
galaxys4<00:02:12.120> isn't<00:02:12.599> something<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.200> would

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
galaxys4 isn't something that you would

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.700 
galaxys4 isn't something that you would
just

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
just

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.670 
just
go<00:02:14.100> buy<00:02:14.820> out<00:02:15.000> straight<00:02:15.720> away<00:02:15.750> from<00:02:16.080> an<00:02:16.230> s3<00:02:16.590> I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
go buy out straight away from an s3 I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.380 
go buy out straight away from an s3 I
think<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.340> an<00:02:17.430> s3<00:02:17.700> maybe<00:02:17.940> wait<00:02:18.180> for

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
think if you have an s3 maybe wait for

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.960 
think if you have an s3 maybe wait for
the<00:02:18.480> next<00:02:18.840> update<00:02:19.070> or<00:02:20.070> if<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.940> know

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
the next update or if you you know

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.460 
the next update or if you you know
happen<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.570> change<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> different<00:02:22.050> platform

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
happen to change to a different platform

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.010 
happen to change to a different platform
or<00:02:22.920> different<00:02:23.570> manufacturer<00:02:24.570> something<00:02:24.900> but

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
or different manufacturer something but

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.750 
or different manufacturer something but
for<00:02:25.230> now<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> think<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.130> samsung<00:02:26.460> galaxy

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
for now I think that the samsung galaxy

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.820 
for now I think that the samsung galaxy
s4<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.150> really<00:02:27.330> based<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.900> aimed<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.560> new

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
s4 is really based and aimed for new

working space may be coming from an old

working space may be coming from an old
Android<00:02:33.720> system<00:02:34.050> maybe<00:02:34.380> something<00:02:34.740> like<00:02:34.920> the
