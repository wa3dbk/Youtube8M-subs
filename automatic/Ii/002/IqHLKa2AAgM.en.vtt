end<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> right<00:00:44.670> hand<00:00:44.910> side<00:00:45.210> switch

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
end over the right hand side switch

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.520 
end over the right hand side switch
hands<00:00:46.440> pinch<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> left<00:00:47.399> side<00:00:48.530> I'm

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
hands pinch it with the left side I'm

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.490 
hands pinch it with the left side I'm
gonna<00:00:49.800> take<00:00:50.010> another<00:00:50.340> bite<00:00:51.110> I'm<00:00:52.110> gonna<00:00:52.289> feed

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
gonna take another bite I'm gonna feed

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.590 
gonna take another bite I'm gonna feed
this<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.680> down<00:00:53.190> through<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.390> hand

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this one down through that right hand

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
this one down through that right hand
loop<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> whole<00:01:01.829> knot<00:01:02.100> should<00:01:02.550> look

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
loop so now the whole knot should look

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.969 
loop so now the whole knot should look
like<00:01:04.250> that

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.710 

now<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:09.670> want<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:09.909> take<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.210> work<00:01:10.360> in<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.600> end

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
now I want to take the work in the end

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.030 
now I want to take the work in the end
and<00:01:10.990> weave<00:01:11.290> through<00:01:11.950> those<00:01:12.460> bottom<00:01:12.880> loops

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.969 

gonna<00:01:18.040> come<00:01:18.250> down<00:01:18.490> through<00:01:18.759> that<00:01:19.979> right-hand

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
gonna come down through that right-hand

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:29.550 
gonna come down through that right-hand
side<00:01:21.430> loop<00:01:27.240> try<00:01:28.240> not<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.539> get<00:01:28.630> my<00:01:28.840> power<00:01:29.320> cord

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
side loop try not to get my power cord

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.630 
side loop try not to get my power cord
to<00:01:29.649> twist<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.159> up<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:32.110> come<00:01:32.350> up<00:01:32.560> over<00:01:35.640> that

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
to twist it up gonna come up over that

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.710 
to twist it up gonna come up over that
standing<00:01:37.210> part<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.930> then<00:01:38.380> down<00:01:38.799> through<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
standing part and then down through this

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.919 
standing part and then down through this
left-hand<00:01:41.289> loop<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:45.130> we<00:01:45.280> are<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.869> that's

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
left-hand loop there we are so that's

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.590 
left-hand loop there we are so that's
the<00:01:50.170> first<00:01:50.470> part<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.860> we've<00:01:51.009> done<00:01:51.569> now<00:01:52.569> I

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
the first part of the we've done now I

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.830 
the first part of the we've done now I
just<00:01:52.690> want<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.110> come<00:01:53.289> back<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.360> up<00:01:55.539> through

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
just want to come back and up through

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.969 
just want to come back and up through
that<00:01:56.080> right-hand<00:01:56.590> loop<00:01:58.679> and<00:01:59.679> they're<00:01:59.830> not

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
that right-hand loop and they're not

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.870 
that right-hand loop and they're not
almost<00:02:00.459> finished<00:02:02.520> that's<00:02:03.520> what<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.789> should

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
almost finished that's what it should

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.859 
almost finished that's what it should
look<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:04.209> now<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:07.090> just<00:02:07.390> want<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.720> get

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
look like now and I just want to get

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.590 
look like now and I just want to get
this<00:02:08.200> working<00:02:08.860> end<00:02:09.190> up<00:02:09.640> through<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.239> center

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
this working end up through the center

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.140 
this working end up through the center
of<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.899> whole<00:02:10.959> knot<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:12.610> gonna<00:02:12.760> go<00:02:12.940> over

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
of this whole knot it's gonna go over

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.550 
of this whole knot it's gonna go over
the<00:02:13.329> first<00:02:13.480> part<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:14.380> under<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.980> next<00:02:15.400> two

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the first part then under the next two

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.530 
the first part then under the next two
over<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.829> then<00:02:18.430> under<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
over and then under and that is the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.370 
over and then under and that is the
finish<00:02:22.900> not<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.530> its<00:02:23.799> loose<00:02:24.220> form<00:02:24.989> now<00:02:25.989> we<00:02:26.019> just

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
finish not in its loose form now we just

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.620 
finish not in its loose form now we just
need<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.769> tighten<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.190> whole<00:02:27.370> thing<00:02:27.640> up<00:02:27.820> which

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
need to tighten the whole thing up which

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.229 
need to tighten the whole thing up which
is<00:02:28.840> quite<00:02:29.370> difficult<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.820> don't<00:02:31.000> want<00:02:31.150> to

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
is quite difficult you don't want to

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.840 
is quite difficult you don't want to
lose<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.630> shaper<00:02:31.870> than<00:02:32.170> not<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.579> start

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
lose the shaper than not I like to start

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.180 
lose the shaper than not I like to start
at<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> very<00:02:34.420> start<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.049> then<00:02:35.560> work<00:02:35.799> it<00:02:35.950> all

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
at the very start and then work it all

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.630 
at the very start and then work it all
the<00:02:36.220> way<00:02:36.459> through<00:02:36.820> so<00:02:37.630> I'll<00:02:37.750> start<00:02:38.079> here<00:02:38.640> pinch

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
the way through so I'll start here pinch

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.740 
the way through so I'll start here pinch
it<00:02:39.820> off<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.620> then<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:41.890> work<00:02:42.400> out<00:02:42.670> slack<00:02:43.150> and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
it off and then just work out slack and

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.990 
it off and then just work out slack and
just<00:02:44.079> work<00:02:44.260> out<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.530> little<00:02:44.859> bit<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.370> time<00:02:45.640> don't

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
just work out a little bit of time don't

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.520 
just work out a little bit of time don't
find<00:02:46.209> tighten<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.750> whole<00:02:46.840> thing<00:02:47.049> up<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.320> one

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
find tighten the whole thing up in one

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.449 
find tighten the whole thing up in one
go<00:02:47.739> or<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.310> probably<00:02:48.640> won't<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:49.000> able<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:49.359> it

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
go or you probably won't be able do it

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.309 
go or you probably won't be able do it
so<00:02:51.459> I'll<00:02:51.609> do<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:53.579> just<00:02:54.959> pull<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:55.989> loop

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
so I'll do that and just pull the loop

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:09.450 
so I'll do that and just pull the loop
through

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.880 

so<00:03:10.460> that's<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.910> first<00:03:11.650> tightening<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.770> the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
so that's the first tightening of the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.760 
so that's the first tightening of the
knot<00:03:13.690> it's<00:03:14.690> just<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.080> get<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.320> rough<00:03:15.500> shape

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
knot it's just to get the rough shape

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.130 
knot it's just to get the rough shape
and<00:03:15.980> now<00:03:16.460> I'll<00:03:16.640> do<00:03:16.820> one<00:03:17.060> final<00:03:17.300> tightening<00:03:17.810> and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
and now I'll do one final tightening and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.990 
and now I'll do one final tightening and
we<00:03:18.260> should<00:03:18.500> have<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:19.340> not<00:03:19.550> finished

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.910 

and<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:25.690> there's<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.680> finish<00:03:26.950> not

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and so there's the finish not

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.370 
and so there's the finish not
good-looking<00:03:29.920> not
