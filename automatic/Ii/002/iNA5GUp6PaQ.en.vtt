00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.270
 welcome to markus maier with yours 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.700
 listen and your robson 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.240
 yes we want you again today 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.620
 new house from us show this time as well 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.890
 just completely different and again 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.590
 a bit crazy abstract 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 abstract we could do 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 I just like that better 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.529
 cell and as always we fly 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.289
 around and then show you from the inside 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.240
 and do not be surprised so the house still has 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.790
 no garden is not deaf yet 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.180
 designed and we want from it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.430
 make a separate video and one 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 new sequence block for block to finished 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.989
 garden but we want you the house is 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.190
 nevertheless show ever and I have 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.600
 say I'm a bit proud of it 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.160
 it just falls a little bit different 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.539
 and somehow I like that very well 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.800
 yes that's the other way around 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.840
 fly that is really easy to read 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.300
 and what have made me here once 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.129
 we have such window blinds over 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.530
 the windows are built so that little ones 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 window canopies so in principle quite 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.310
 simply kept really only be 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.380
 white square rectangle and then but 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.780
 tried by these gray stones and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
 gray wool and meat is the stone 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.750
 everything so different 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.159
 grays different materials 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.080
 just mixed together and not 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.960
 always just a garage but easy 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 sometimes a carport but we show that 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 you same 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.170
 So here you walk in or drive times 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.430
 purely depending on how he gets here 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.830
 any case, probably in any way 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.390
 Go garden like a garden 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.770
 go back out how big the whole 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.210
 is considered moody and therefore not 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.759
 just such a long boring one 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.649
 oil of the driveway we thought 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.149
 we'll just make a tree 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.619
 artwork in mother nature on the way 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.210
 should you be somehow lit. 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.830
 And I like that in the garden quite well 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.649
 if you integrate that in the floor lights 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.720
 yes and here is now in principle the 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.700
 Pitch the carport and at the same time 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:18.620
 also the entrance to the markus maier hopes 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.300
 he is not so synonymous times me 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.640
 just have inner again with so 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.830
 support an additional extra 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.030
 element built around the whole as I said 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.260
 so far, yes, this would be easy 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.410
 just boring to take a bit 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.459
 make it look more interesting 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.610
 just as we strip this gray 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.350
 I simply just about to 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.239
 optics and it does a lot yes 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.630
 definitely 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.320
 then we enter and stand as usual 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.320
 in the hallway 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.410
 so down to is these additional accurate and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.180
 gray wool what you already in the house 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.500
 again does not always find one 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.709
 a bit with the krad stone walk with 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.170
 worked these half quartz blocks 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.000
 the wardrobe shown with the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:15.980
 coat hook and here again 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.269
 simply sun what is it again 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.629
 Sometimes there is a little something in it 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.310
 The floor lamp life times but definitely 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.959
 but let's go in here 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.180
 So there are also different ones 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.319
 We have quartz stones and they have 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.670
 we just tried here 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.110
 I'll fly in this way 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.930
 a bit high that you can see it that way 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.610
 in the end, here is only for now 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.790
 the toilet just separated too 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.079
 still bad and what ever 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.090
 really very cool i at this 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.680
 quartz stone just what i like as soil 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.250
 have the looks simply from Vienna 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.900
 original bathroom flows really cool 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.650
 that's almost into the flu you can 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.209
 Really cool, he gives the give 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.120
 it will keep many new ones 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.160
 possibilities here then the access to 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.609
 bathroom also flies right back 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.810
 so high in the corner so here was one 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:07.880
 walk-in shower towel rack was 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.819
 carpet was on the other side 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.760
 here just yet as a wall shelf and 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.769
 still bathroom furniture bathroom element 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.389
 Here I have to say clothes too 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.039
 Currently, texture pack is this one 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.900
 make a version of the place ex fan deserve 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.820
 now has both images and use 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.889
 by chance, here's one 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.229
 little serenade with the shoeplatter 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:32.090
 and doors are it is a picture just that 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:34.789
 is picture it was hung there yes 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.940
 and from here comes my bedroom 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.940
 as well as I show you here from the hallway 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.400
 again with the quartz stone so the 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.700
 we just have it everywhere 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.050
 repeated in the house so that we like 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.770
 that always so glad when such a 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.970
 line through the whole house 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.130
 and here you have to say the morning 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.060
 meyer lives alone no woman no 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.030
 children and is the hard sugar 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.920
 absolute right - there are mega 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.480
 informatics bad coal in the business and 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.140
 a black brother killer the whole 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.410
 time only pcs a bit thicker mill 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.610
 small curly hair little girl oh 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.040
 I already have the picture in my head 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.190
 first cuddly the markus maier is 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.840
 tricky a cuddly morning here 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.360
 then another bed that has me too 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.200
 never that we quartz stone went this it 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.700
 around the bed and here 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.590
 I think that's cool as well 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.590
 small optics just after when 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.930
 you put the wall a bit inside 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.270
 skewed channel or that out depending on 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.180
 just a little break in 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.180
 niche with deco nico niche 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.310
 yes, here it goes on in the hallway so that 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.720
 is just synonymous only optics because we 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.610
 found that fits very well with this 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.740
 that's just fine 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.300
 Just show the quartz itself 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.860
 right here liebau I have to 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.490
 Also, our texture pack is right 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.470
 well done 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:16.569
 Laufer on it in the hallway hangs there 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:18.550
 namely such a cool picture that optically 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.259
 divided into three but is in 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.120
 It is somehow a reality 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:26.500
 your wide is a lot of space wide picture 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:32.409
 and looks like 33 is finally a lot 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:35.560
 place and slowly it really cool 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.789
 I like the picture very much and there 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.810
 of course, here is also nice 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:42.789
 Living and dining area the color red 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.680
 taken and of course nice too 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.900
 tried in this whole area too 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.330
 integrate because you look twice 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.590
 set up at home so of course there are 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.240
 it is also the complete bund 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.979
 set up without a stalk and nothing but 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.740
 one looks at one's own general appearance 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:00.490
 that it must be in continuous 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.620
 pattern has at least the robbed that the 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.909
 Space in itself just all uniform 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.529
 is designed a bit with the 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:11.949
 clear exactly what we still great 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:14.440
 So just say that here 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:17.080
 kitchenette here is a small one 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.120
 kochinsel abo this time everything is small 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.719
 The mother alone kept the house 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.210
 yes not much ground so if 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:28.360
 they are already through and is 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.490
 Absolutely just classy nerdbrille 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.400
