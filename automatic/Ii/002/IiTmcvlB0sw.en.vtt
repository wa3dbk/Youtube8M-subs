00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
okay today we're going to talk about

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.170 
okay today we're going to talk about
major<00:00:03.149> scales<00:00:03.750> we<00:00:04.680> are<00:00:04.859> actually<00:00:05.460> between

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
major scales we are actually between

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.919 
major scales we are actually between
cage<00:00:07.049> system<00:00:07.529> lessons<00:00:08.160> here<00:00:08.570> and<00:00:09.570> what<00:00:09.780> we're

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
cage system lessons here and what we're

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.030 
cage system lessons here and what we're
doing<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.260> we're<00:00:10.410> actually<00:00:10.530> going<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.920> give

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
doing is we're actually going to give

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.200 
doing is we're actually going to give
you<00:00:11.130> some<00:00:11.160> information<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.820> will<00:00:12.000> be<00:00:12.120> able

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
you some information that will be able

you some information that will be able
to<00:00:12.330> put<00:00:12.570> together<00:00:12.690> with<00:00:13.340> cage<00:00:14.340> system<00:00:14.849> lesson

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
to put together with cage system lesson

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.220 
to put together with cage system lesson
number<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.740> in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> next<00:00:17.220> lesson<00:00:18.109> what<00:00:19.109> we're

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
number one in the next lesson what we're

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.029 
number one in the next lesson what we're
going<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.529> we're<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.949> to

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
going to do is we're actually going to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.710 
going to do is we're actually going to
talk<00:00:20.220> about<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> major<00:00:21.359> scale<00:00:21.660> is

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
talk about how a major scale is

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.650 
talk about how a major scale is
constructed<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:23.210> for<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> way<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.570> we're

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
constructed and for the way that we're

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.970 
constructed and for the way that we're
going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> go<00:00:24.930> about<00:00:25.080> doing<00:00:25.260> these<00:00:25.500> lessons

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
going to go about doing these lessons

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.929 
going to go about doing these lessons
we're<00:00:26.160> actually<00:00:26.250> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.550> use<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> major

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
we're actually going to use the major

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.519 
we're actually going to use the major
scale<00:00:27.150> kind<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> reference<00:00:28.080> point<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
scale kind of as a reference point or a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.109 
scale kind of as a reference point or a
touchstone<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.340> lot<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> theory

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
touchstone for a lot of the theory

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.610 
touchstone for a lot of the theory
whether<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.099> constructing<00:00:32.099> cords<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:34.500> know

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
whether it's constructing cords you know

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.319 
whether it's constructing cords you know
or<00:00:34.910> improvising<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.000> any<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.239> other

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
or improvising or any of that other

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.020 
or improvising or any of that other
stuff<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> first<00:00:37.980> thing<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.700> know

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
stuff the first thing is you know

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.160 
stuff the first thing is you know
typically<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> major<00:00:39.690> scale<00:00:44.809> yeah<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.989> got<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
typically a major scale yeah it's got a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
typically a major scale yeah it's got a
specific<00:00:47.100> sound<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> scale<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
specific sound what a scale is is it's a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
specific sound what a scale is is it's a
collection<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.379> notes<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.039> set

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
collection of notes that are set

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.850 
collection of notes that are set
distances<00:00:50.940> from<00:00:51.059> each<00:00:51.239> other<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:52.199> give<00:00:52.469> us<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
distances from each other that give us a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
distances from each other that give us a
sound<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:55.140> play<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> major<00:00:55.590> scale<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.899> can

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
sound I can play a major scale I can

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.910 
sound I can play a major scale I can
play<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> minor<00:00:58.289> scale<00:00:58.559> I<00:01:00.530> can<00:01:01.530> alter<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
play a minor scale I can alter that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.959 
play a minor scale I can alter that
minor<00:01:02.160> scale<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> little<00:01:02.670> bit

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:06.969 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:14.410 

mega<00:01:07.969> play<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.270> as<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:08.479> Dorian<00:01:12.880> all<00:01:13.880> right<00:01:14.000> it's

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
mega play it as a Dorian all right it's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.029 
mega play it as a Dorian all right it's
the<00:01:14.630> distances<00:01:15.140> between<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.500> notes<00:01:15.770> that

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
the distances between the notes that

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.950 
the distances between the notes that
give<00:01:16.189> us<00:01:16.340> these<00:01:16.460> different<00:01:16.819> sounds<00:01:17.210> or<00:01:17.329> colors

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
give us these different sounds or colors

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.419 
give us these different sounds or colors
or<00:01:18.170> flavors<00:01:18.439> or<00:01:18.890> however<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:19.189> want<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.369> look

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
or flavors or however you want to look

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.459 
or flavors or however you want to look
at<00:01:19.670> them<00:01:19.719> the<00:01:20.719> first<00:01:20.960> one<00:01:21.170> we're<00:01:21.319> going<00:01:21.409> to

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
at them the first one we're going to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.529 
at them the first one we're going to
deal<00:01:21.649> with<00:01:21.679> is<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.100> major<00:01:22.250> scale<00:01:22.549> yeah<00:01:23.119> that's

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
deal with is the major scale yeah that's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.209 
deal with is the major scale yeah that's
probably<00:01:23.899> what<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.439> majority<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.979> your

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
probably what the majority of your

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.100 
probably what the majority of your
melodies<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:25.909> western<00:01:26.270> music<00:01:26.299> come<00:01:26.780> out<00:01:26.929> of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
melodies and western music come out of

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.289 
melodies and western music come out of
one<00:01:27.979> way<00:01:28.130> or<00:01:28.280> another<00:01:28.310> whether<00:01:28.759> it's<00:01:29.000> just

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
one way or another whether it's just

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.929 
one way or another whether it's just
being<00:01:29.659> in<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.899> major<00:01:30.049> key<00:01:30.409> or<00:01:30.619> if<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.130> mode

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
being in a major key or if it's a mode

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.510 
being in a major key or if it's a mode
or<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.209> section<00:01:32.719> of<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.990> scale<00:01:33.289> like<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.219> minor

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
or a section of the scale like a minor

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.569 
or a section of the scale like a minor
scale<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.799> first<00:01:37.039> thing<00:01:37.159> we<00:01:37.250> have<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.369> talk

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
scale the first thing we have to talk

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.609 
scale the first thing we have to talk
about<00:01:37.640> though<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.659> idea<00:01:38.899> of<00:01:38.989> half<00:01:39.140> steps<00:01:39.500> and

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
about though the idea of half steps and

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.179 
about though the idea of half steps and
whole<00:01:39.709> steps<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:41.179> half<00:01:41.659> step<00:01:41.959> is<00:01:42.229> basically

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
whole steps a half step is basically

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.100 
whole steps a half step is basically
where<00:01:43.310> we're<00:01:43.489> on<00:01:43.579> one<00:01:43.789> fret<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.689> we<00:01:44.810> go<00:01:44.959> up<00:01:45.020> to

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
where we're on one fret and we go up to

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.959 
where we're on one fret and we go up to
the<00:01:45.200> next<00:01:45.380> friend<00:01:45.709> it's<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.579> distance

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
the next friend it's the distance

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.029 
the next friend it's the distance
between<00:01:47.119> those<00:01:47.479> two<00:01:47.750> notes<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:48.259> whole<00:01:48.770> step

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
between those two notes a whole step

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.740 
between those two notes a whole step
would<00:01:49.280> be<00:01:50.020> from<00:01:51.020> one<00:01:51.229> note<00:01:51.969> up<00:01:52.969> to<00:01:53.270> fret<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:53.659> is

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
would be from one note up to fret so is

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.080 
would be from one note up to fret so is
actually<00:01:54.020> going<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.229> be<00:01:54.379> a<00:01:54.590> note<00:01:55.579> kind<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.000> in

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
actually going to be a note kind of in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.410 
actually going to be a note kind of in
the<00:01:56.119> middle<00:01:56.270> that's<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:57.049> whole<00:01:57.229> step<00:01:58.179> if<00:01:59.179> we're

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
the middle that's a whole step if we're

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
what these notes are the other thing we

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.409 
what these notes are the other thing we
need<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.220> talk<00:02:49.370> about<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.910> idea<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.150> scale

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:50.419 
need to talk about is the idea of scale

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.000 
need to talk about is the idea of scale

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
degrees and the scale degree basically

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.370 
degrees and the scale degree basically
just<00:02:52.130> tells<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.459> what<00:02:53.239> each<00:02:53.840> note<00:02:54.230> is

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
just tells you what each note is

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.930 
just tells you what each note is
relative<00:02:54.919> to<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.190> root<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.579> starting

the major sixth be the major seventh and
then<00:03:25.610> we're<00:03:25.730> back<00:03:25.849> to<00:03:25.910> see<00:03:26.269> which<00:03:26.480> is<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
then we're back to see which is the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.140 
then we're back to see which is the
octave<00:03:27.110> we've<00:03:27.230> gone<00:03:27.410> through<00:03:27.650> all<00:03:27.769> seven

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.420 
octave we've gone through all seven
diatonic<00:03:29.150> notes<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.080> we've<00:03:30.739> ended<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:31.130> on<00:03:31.310> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
diatonic notes and we've ended up on the

diatonic notes and we've ended up on the
octave<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:33.800> were<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:33.950> start<00:03:34.069> on<00:03:34.430> a

we're<00:03:39.410> going<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.560> get<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.739> different

is<00:03:41.750> going<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:41.989> give<00:03:42.110> us<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.319> different<00:03:42.470> key<00:03:42.819> half

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
is going to give us a different key half

a half step should we be flat now this

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.190 
a half step should we be flat now this
could<00:03:58.640> also<00:03:58.970> be<00:03:59.120> considered<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.810> sharp

we're<00:04:08.480> going<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.630> learn<00:04:08.780> later<00:04:09.049> versus<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
we're going to learn later versus the

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.390 
we're going to learn later versus the
root<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.630> if<00:04:11.630> we<00:04:11.810> had<00:04:11.959> an<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.319> in<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.620> sharp<00:04:13.130> in

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
root and if we had an a in a sharp in

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.340 
root and if we had an a in a sharp in
the<00:04:13.910> same<00:04:14.120> scale<00:04:14.450> things<00:04:14.720> would<00:04:14.870> get<00:04:14.989> kind<00:04:15.260> of

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
the same scale things would get kind of

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.900 
the same scale things would get kind of
confusing<00:04:15.470> with<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.280> especially<00:04:16.729> with<00:04:16.820> this

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
confusing with this especially with this

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.520 
confusing with this especially with this
beginning<00:04:17.209> diatomic<00:04:17.780> type<00:04:18.019> theory<00:04:20.229> so<00:04:21.229> we're

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
beginning diatomic type theory so we're

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.379 
beginning diatomic type theory so we're
going<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.739> make<00:04:21.829> sure<00:04:22.039> that<00:04:22.250> there's<00:04:22.490> no<00:04:22.669> no

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
going to make sure that there's no no

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.110 
going to make sure that there's no no
name<00:04:23.570> that's<00:04:23.780> used<00:04:23.870> twice<00:04:24.289> so<00:04:24.740> here<00:04:25.220> we're<00:04:25.970> on

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
name that's used twice so here we're on

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.240 
name that's used twice so here we're on
the<00:04:26.210> fourth<00:04:26.479> note<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.169> is<00:04:27.350> B<00:04:27.650> flat<00:04:27.950> and

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the fourth note and that is B flat and

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.960 
the fourth note and that is B flat and
then<00:04:29.060> we<00:04:29.180> go<00:04:29.330> up<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.600> next<00:04:29.810> possible<00:04:30.320> note

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
then we go up to the next possible note

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.360 
then we go up to the next possible note
which<00:04:31.970> would<00:04:32.210> be<00:04:32.419> C<00:04:34.990> D<00:04:35.990> up<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.320> whole<00:04:36.470> step<00:04:36.500> yep

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
which would be C D up a whole step yep

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.670 
which would be C D up a whole step yep
the<00:04:37.520> whole<00:04:37.550> step<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.210> then<00:04:38.810> back<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.200> F<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:39.590> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
the whole step and then back to F so the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.860 
the whole step and then back to F so the
key<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:39.979> F<00:04:40.220> isn't<00:04:40.760> all<00:04:40.880> natural<00:04:41.389> notes<00:04:41.600> like

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
key of F isn't all natural notes like

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.150 
key of F isn't all natural notes like
the<00:04:42.080> sea<00:04:42.289> is<00:04:42.970> natural<00:04:43.970> notes<00:04:44.120> meaning<00:04:44.690> just

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
the sea is natural notes meaning just

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.070 
the sea is natural notes meaning just
see<00:04:46.160> as<00:04:46.310> opposed<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.729> c<00:04:46.940> sharp<00:04:47.210> or<00:04:47.510> D<00:04:47.690> flat<00:04:47.930> or

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
see as opposed to c sharp or D flat or

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.350 
see as opposed to c sharp or D flat or
any<00:04:48.229> of<00:04:48.289> that<00:04:48.350> stuff<00:04:48.590> from<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.639> key<00:04:49.789> of<00:04:49.910> F<00:04:50.090> we

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
any of that stuff from the key of F we

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.290 
any of that stuff from the key of F we
have<00:04:50.479> one<00:04:50.720> flat<00:04:51.080> we<00:04:51.560> have<00:04:51.680> B<00:04:51.919> flat<00:04:52.190> so<00:04:53.060> if<00:04:53.150> I'm

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
have one flat we have B flat so if I'm

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.110 
have one flat we have B flat so if I'm
playing<00:04:53.599> in<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.960> key<00:04:54.139> of<00:04:54.169> F<00:04:54.500> then<00:04:54.910> all<00:04:55.910> the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
playing in the key of F then all the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.610 
playing in the key of F then all the
bees<00:04:56.270> will<00:04:56.300> be<00:04:56.630> flattered<00:04:57.020> if<00:04:59.020> I<00:05:00.020> was<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.320> start

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
bees will be flattered if I was to start

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.080 
bees will be flattered if I was to start
on<00:05:00.830> G<00:05:02.020> let's<00:05:03.020> see<00:05:03.139> what<00:05:03.260> that<00:05:03.380> gives<00:05:03.560> us<00:05:03.770> G<00:05:04.190> is

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
on G let's see what that gives us G is

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.879 
on G let's see what that gives us G is
the<00:05:05.150> root<00:05:05.539> whole<00:05:06.470> step<00:05:06.770> up<00:05:06.979> would<00:05:07.250> be<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:08.889> whole

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
the root whole step up would be a whole

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.339 
the root whole step up would be a whole

be e whole step up to the 7th note is
this<00:05:21.470> which<00:05:21.650> is<00:05:21.800> f<00:05:22.039> sharp<00:05:22.069> and<00:05:22.789> then<00:05:23.360> G<00:05:23.830> now<00:05:24.830> if

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
this which is f sharp and then G now if

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.969 
this which is f sharp and then G now if
you<00:05:26.539> don't<00:05:26.810> know<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.259> natural<00:05:27.650> order<00:05:27.800> of

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
you don't know the natural order of

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.180 
you don't know the natural order of
notes<00:05:28.370> as<00:05:29.300> they<00:05:29.509> occur<00:05:29.870> in<00:05:30.560> like<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.889> Western

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
notes as they occur in like the Western

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.950 
notes as they occur in like the Western
twelve-tone<00:05:31.879> systems<00:05:32.360> this<00:05:32.569> might<00:05:32.780> be<00:05:32.930> a

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
twelve-tone systems this might be a

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.719 
twelve-tone systems this might be a
little<00:05:33.110> bit<00:05:33.289> confusing<00:05:33.830> so<00:05:34.430> let<00:05:34.520> me<00:05:34.580> do<00:05:34.699> a

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
little bit confusing so let me do a

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.939 
little bit confusing so let me do a
little<00:05:34.789> bit<00:05:35.030> of<00:05:35.060> review<00:05:35.389> for<00:05:35.659> you<00:05:35.949> basically

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
little bit of review for you basically

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.029 
little bit of review for you basically
every<00:05:37.729> note<00:05:37.940> has<00:05:38.870> a<00:05:38.900> whole<00:05:39.169> step<00:05:39.379> between<00:05:39.530> it

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
every note has a whole step between it

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.230 
every note has a whole step between it
and<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.340> next<00:05:40.490> note<00:05:41.319> except<00:05:42.319> for<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:43.069> and<00:05:43.789> F<00:05:43.940> and

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
and the next note except for a and F and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.899 
and the next note except for a and F and
B<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:45.020> C<00:05:45.319> so<00:05:46.159> if<00:05:46.280> we're<00:05:46.430> starting<00:05:46.729> on<00:05:46.819> the

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
B and C so if we're starting on the

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.240 
B and C so if we're starting on the
sixth<00:05:47.240> string<00:05:47.270> which<00:05:47.690> is<00:05:47.719> an<00:05:47.930> e<00:05:48.110> when<00:05:48.949> we<00:05:49.039> play

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
sixth string which is an e when we play

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.430 
sixth string which is an e when we play
it<00:05:49.340> open<00:05:49.639> the<00:05:50.330> first<00:05:50.509> fret<00:05:50.870> is<00:05:51.020> going<00:05:51.169> to<00:05:51.229> be<00:05:51.349> an

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
it open the first fret is going to be an

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.339 
it open the first fret is going to be an
F<00:05:51.819> but<00:05:52.819> then<00:05:52.940> the<00:05:53.060> next<00:05:53.210> fret<00:05:53.629> is<00:05:53.870> actually

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
F but then the next fret is actually

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.080 
F but then the next fret is actually
like<00:05:54.500> a<00:05:54.530> black<00:05:54.889> key<00:05:55.159> on<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.400> piano<00:05:55.610> if<00:05:55.909> you<00:05:55.969> can

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
like a black key on the piano if you can

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.420 
like a black key on the piano if you can
visualize<00:05:56.210> and<00:05:56.840> on<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:57.680> blog<00:05:57.889> entry<00:05:58.219> there's

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
visualize and on the blog entry there's

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.100 
visualize and on the blog entry there's
actually<00:05:58.729> going<00:05:58.819> to<00:05:58.909> be<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.090> worksheet<00:05:59.930> with

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
actually going to be a worksheet with

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.469 
actually going to be a worksheet with
some<00:06:00.289> of<00:06:00.379> the<00:06:00.440> stuff<00:06:00.680> on<00:06:00.889> it<00:06:01.270> you<00:06:02.270> have<00:06:02.389> the

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
some of the stuff on it you have the

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.089 
some of the stuff on it you have the
white<00:06:02.659> keys<00:06:02.930> on<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.199> piano<00:06:03.289> and<00:06:03.680> then<00:06:03.800> of<00:06:04.009> the

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
white keys on the piano and then of the

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.219 
white keys on the piano and then of the
black<00:06:04.280> keys<00:06:04.580> this<00:06:05.180> would<00:06:05.389> be<00:06:05.479> a<00:06:05.509> black<00:06:05.840> key<00:06:06.110> and

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
black keys this would be a black key and

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.540 
black keys this would be a black key and
that's<00:06:06.349> what<00:06:06.590> we<00:06:06.680> call<00:06:06.830> a<00:06:06.860> sharp<00:06:07.250> or<00:06:07.460> a<00:06:07.490> flat

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
that's what we call a sharp or a flat

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.369 
that's what we call a sharp or a flat
the<00:06:08.389> other<00:06:08.539> name<00:06:08.750> for<00:06:08.780> that<00:06:08.990> would<00:06:09.199> be<00:06:09.289> an

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:09.379 
the other name for that would be an

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.659 
the other name for that would be an
accidental<00:06:10.629> then<00:06:11.629> we<00:06:11.750> have<00:06:11.900> G<00:06:12.259> and<00:06:12.919> then<00:06:13.490> it's

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
accidental then we have G and then it's

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.719 
accidental then we have G and then it's
a<00:06:13.729> whole<00:06:13.759> step<00:06:14.270> up<00:06:14.509> to<00:06:14.960> a<00:06:14.990> so<00:06:15.620> we've<00:06:15.770> got<00:06:15.949> g<00:06:16.340> g

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
a whole step up to a so we've got g g

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.969 
a whole step up to a so we've got g g
Chardonnay<00:06:17.270> a<00:06:18.310> sharp<00:06:19.690> B<00:06:20.690> and<00:06:21.080> then<00:06:21.620> between

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
Chardonnay a sharp B and then between

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.610 
Chardonnay a sharp B and then between
B&amp;C<00:06:22.190> there's<00:06:22.940> no<00:06:23.180> black<00:06:23.449> key<00:06:23.719> or<00:06:23.930> no<00:06:23.960> half<00:06:24.259> step

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
B&amp;C there's no black key or no half step

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.890 
B&amp;C there's no black key or no half step
alright<00:06:25.430> so<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:25.849> next<00:06:25.880> node<00:06:26.210> up<00:06:26.330> from<00:06:26.509> V<00:06:26.659> would

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
alright so the next node up from V would

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.769 
alright so the next node up from V would
actually<00:06:27.229> be<00:06:27.380> see<00:06:27.800> just<00:06:28.520> one<00:06:28.699> half<00:06:28.909> step<00:06:29.090> then

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
actually be see just one half step then

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.339 
actually be see just one half step then
we<00:06:29.870> have<00:06:29.960> a<00:06:30.020> whole<00:06:30.289> step<00:06:30.680> 2<00:06:31.190> D<00:06:32.050> I'll<00:06:33.050> step<00:06:33.319> back

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
we have a whole step 2 D I'll step back

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.159 
we have a whole step 2 D I'll step back
up<00:06:33.710> to<00:06:33.889> e<00:06:34.120> it<00:06:35.120> just<00:06:35.389> kind<00:06:35.539> of<00:06:35.599> continues<00:06:36.020> the

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
up to e it just kind of continues the

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.709 
up to e it just kind of continues the
cycles<00:06:36.620> like<00:06:36.770> that<00:06:37.039> that<00:06:37.969> has<00:06:38.120> nothing<00:06:38.360> really

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
cycles like that that has nothing really

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.260 
cycles like that that has nothing really
to<00:06:38.870> do<00:06:39.139> with<00:06:39.349> us<00:06:39.740> constructing<00:06:40.580> major<00:06:40.789> scales

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
to do with us constructing major scales

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.999 
to do with us constructing major scales
but<00:06:41.599> I<00:06:41.659> just<00:06:41.900> want<00:06:42.050> to<00:06:42.110> make<00:06:42.199> sure<00:06:42.259> that<00:06:42.680> if

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
but I just want to make sure that if

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.149 
but I just want to make sure that if
you're<00:06:43.340> not<00:06:43.659> aware<00:06:44.659> of<00:06:44.930> the<00:06:45.469> the<00:06:45.740> order<00:06:46.039> of

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159 
you're not aware of the the order of

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.800 
you're not aware of the the order of
those<00:06:46.340> notes<00:06:46.550> that<00:06:46.909> you<00:06:47.029> go<00:06:47.330> back<00:06:47.539> and<00:06:47.569> you

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
those notes that you go back and you

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.999 
those notes that you go back and you
learn<00:06:47.990> that<00:06:48.169> because<00:06:48.409> otherwise<00:06:48.469> this<00:06:48.830> will

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009 
learn that because otherwise this will

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:50.439 
learn that because otherwise this will
get<00:06:49.159> really<00:06:49.460> really<00:06:49.610> confusing<00:06:50.240> really

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
get really really confusing really

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.080 
get really really confusing really
quickly<00:06:51.430> ok<00:06:52.430> I'm<00:06:52.550> going<00:06:52.669> to<00:06:52.729> do<00:06:52.849> one<00:06:53.060> more

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
quickly ok I'm going to do one more

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.409 
quickly ok I'm going to do one more
scale<00:06:53.599> for<00:06:53.870> you<00:06:53.990> we're<00:06:54.830> going<00:06:54.949> to<00:06:55.009> start<00:06:55.250> on<00:06:55.430> D

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
scale for you we're going to start on D

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.450 
scale for you we're going to start on D
which<00:06:57.379> I'm<00:06:57.529> going<00:06:57.650> to<00:06:57.710> start<00:06:57.919> on<00:06:58.009> the<00:06:58.190> fourth

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
which I'm going to start on the fourth

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.719 
which I'm going to start on the fourth
string<00:06:58.550> open<00:06:59.469> just<00:07:00.469> to<00:07:00.500> give<00:07:00.710> you<00:07:00.860> one<00:07:01.580> more

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
string open just to give you one more

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.769 
string open just to give you one more
chance<00:07:01.789> to<00:07:02.210> see<00:07:02.360> us<00:07:02.479> using<00:07:02.680> some<00:07:03.680> sharps<00:07:04.069> here

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
chance to see us using some sharps here

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:09.820 
chance to see us using some sharps here
d<00:07:05.779> is<00:07:06.349> open<00:07:06.830> a<00:07:07.039> whole<00:07:07.879> step<00:07:08.409> between<00:07:09.409> the<00:07:09.620> first

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
d is open a whole step between the first

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.140 
d is open a whole step between the first
and<00:07:09.949> second<00:07:10.340> notes<00:07:10.490> would<00:07:10.610> bring<00:07:10.849> us<00:07:10.940> two<00:07:11.120> E

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
and second notes would bring us two E

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.110 
and second notes would bring us two E
and<00:07:11.590> then<00:07:12.590> a<00:07:12.650> whole<00:07:12.919> step<00:07:13.190> up<00:07:13.400> from<00:07:13.610> that<00:07:13.789> note

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
and then a whole step up from that note

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.879 
and then a whole step up from that note
would<00:07:14.389> be<00:07:14.539> F<00:07:14.750> sharp<00:07:15.110> because<00:07:15.500> you<00:07:15.620> remember

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:15.889 
would be F sharp because you remember

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:17.950 
would be F sharp because you remember
between<00:07:16.129> enf<00:07:16.520> that's<00:07:17.330> a<00:07:17.509> naturally<00:07:17.930> occurring

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
between enf that's a naturally occurring

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.860 
between enf that's a naturally occurring
half<00:07:18.800> step<00:07:19.190> there's<00:07:19.879> no<00:07:20.060> black<00:07:20.449> key<00:07:20.629> between

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
half step there's no black key between

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.329 
half step there's no black key between
there<00:07:21.110> so<00:07:21.259> we<00:07:21.650> got<00:07:21.830> d<00:07:22.099> e<00:07:22.370> f<00:07:23.500> sharp<00:07:24.500> then<00:07:25.159> we<00:07:25.250> have

00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:25.339 
there so we got d e f sharp then we have

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:26.590 
there so we got d e f sharp then we have
a<00:07:25.370> half-step<00:07:25.849> to<00:07:25.909> the<00:07:26.089> fourth<00:07:26.389> and

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
a half-step to the fourth and

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.600 
a half-step to the fourth and
which<00:07:26.810> would<00:07:26.990> be<00:07:27.170> G<00:07:28.480> whole<00:07:29.480> step<00:07:29.920> up<00:07:30.920> to<00:07:31.340> a

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
which would be G whole step up to a

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.220 
which would be G whole step up to a
whole<00:07:32.570> step<00:07:32.810> up<00:07:33.020> to<00:07:33.200> be<00:07:33.410> now<00:07:34.400> here<00:07:34.970> we<00:07:35.660> have<00:07:35.690> B

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.230 
whole step up to be now here we have B

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.110 
whole step up to be now here we have B
and<00:07:36.530> then<00:07:36.980> c<00:07:37.190> is<00:07:37.220> a<00:07:37.310> naturally<00:07:37.670> occurring<00:07:37.700> half

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 
and then c is a naturally occurring half

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.150 
and then c is a naturally occurring half
step<00:07:38.360> so<00:07:38.390> we<00:07:38.570> have<00:07:38.660> to<00:07:38.780> actually<00:07:38.900> push<00:07:39.290> up<00:07:39.590> to

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 
step so we have to actually push up to

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.890 
step so we have to actually push up to
the<00:07:40.280> c-sharp<00:07:40.670> to<00:07:40.910> give<00:07:41.030> us<00:07:41.240> the<00:07:41.420> whole<00:07:41.450> step

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:41.900 
the c-sharp to give us the whole step

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.920 
the c-sharp to give us the whole step
and<00:07:42.640> then<00:07:43.640> we<00:07:43.760> have<00:07:43.850> a<00:07:43.880> half<00:07:44.120> step<00:07:44.390> back<00:07:44.600> to<00:07:44.810> the

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:44.930 
and then we have a half step back to the

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.800 
and then we have a half step back to the
d<00:07:45.430> keep<00:07:46.430> in<00:07:46.580> mind<00:07:46.610> once<00:07:47.240> again<00:07:47.390> if<00:07:47.570> you're<00:07:47.690> not

d keep in mind once again if you're not

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.150

real familiar with your notes on the

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.340 
real familiar with your notes on the
fretboard<00:07:49.430> the<00:07:50.060> double<00:07:50.420> dot<00:07:50.660> that<00:07:50.900> you<00:07:51.050> see<00:07:51.230> on

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.350 
fretboard the double dot that you see on

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.410 
fretboard the double dot that you see on
most<00:07:51.530> guitars<00:07:51.880> that<00:07:52.880> is<00:07:53.030> actually<00:07:53.300> your

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:53.420 
most guitars that is actually your

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.670 
most guitars that is actually your
octave<00:07:53.720> marker<00:07:54.080> that<00:07:54.230> means<00:07:54.440> that<00:07:54.560> you've

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:54.680 
octave marker that means that you've
