00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
they're not gonna stop just because you

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
servers you should probably look around

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.060 
servers you should probably look around
for<00:00:54.789> those<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:55.180> use<00:00:55.390> plugins<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.829> keep

affect<00:00:58.780> your<00:00:58.899> base<00:00:59.309> that<00:01:00.309> being<00:01:00.579> said<00:01:00.789> if

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
affect your base that being said if

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.389 
affect your base that being said if
you're<00:01:01.059> gonna<00:01:01.120> play<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.920> vanilla

completely vanilla server you should

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.170 
completely vanilla server you should
probably<00:01:05.560> play<00:01:05.950> with<00:01:05.979> people<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.549> know<00:01:06.729> if

probably play with people you know if

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.870 
probably play with people you know if
you<00:01:07.869> absolutely<00:01:08.770> are<00:01:08.979> going<00:01:09.369> to<00:01:09.520> play<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.850> a

the<00:01:12.009> best<00:01:12.220> thing<00:01:12.430> I<00:01:12.610> could<00:01:12.790> come<00:01:12.939> up<00:01:12.970> with<00:01:13.210> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the best thing I could come up with is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.630 
the best thing I could come up with is
hide<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.909> thus<00:01:16.079> the<00:01:17.079> jungle<00:01:17.470> tree<00:01:17.770> secret

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
hide and thus the jungle tree secret

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.999 
hide and thus the jungle tree secret
base<00:01:18.820> it's<00:01:19.540> not<00:01:19.780> very<00:01:19.960> elaborate<00:01:20.530> there<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.829> no

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
base it's not very elaborate there is no

pack<00:01:23.110> just<00:01:23.560> because<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:23.950> wanted<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.579> show<00:01:24.939> that

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
pack just because I wanted to show that

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.410 
pack just because I wanted to show that
it<00:01:26.170> is<00:01:26.229> in<00:01:26.799> fact<00:01:27.100> invisible<00:01:27.790> from<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.119> ground

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
it is in fact invisible from the ground

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.109 
it is in fact invisible from the ground
and<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.649> here's<00:01:29.979> your<00:01:30.040> base<00:01:30.280> you

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
and this is it here's your base you

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.880 
and this is it here's your base you
could<00:01:31.299> do<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:31.840> in<00:01:32.020> multiple<00:01:32.170> trees<00:01:32.649> if<00:01:32.799> you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
could do this in multiple trees if you

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.319 
could do this in multiple trees if you
wanted<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.280> but<00:01:34.500> yeah<00:01:35.500> it's<00:01:35.710> there<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:37.090> can't

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
wanted to but yeah it's there you can't

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.639 
wanted to but yeah it's there you can't
really<00:01:37.509> see<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.780> though<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.259> long<00:01:38.439> as<00:01:38.530> you've

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
really see it though as long as you've

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.410 
really see it though as long as you've
got<00:01:38.680> enough<00:01:39.040> leaf<00:01:39.280> blocks<00:01:39.610> between<00:01:39.850> them<00:01:40.270> and

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
got enough leaf blocks between them and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.319 
got enough leaf blocks between them and
your<00:01:40.899> stuff<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.220> invisible<00:01:42.610> now<00:01:42.969> how<00:01:43.149> do

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
your stuff it is invisible now how do

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.569 
your stuff it is invisible now how do
you<00:01:43.509> get<00:01:43.719> up<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:43.990> down<00:01:44.229> well<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.130> just<00:01:45.369> have<00:01:45.549> a

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
you get up and down well you just have a

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.219 
you get up and down well you just have a
nearby<00:01:45.850> tree<00:01:46.270> with<00:01:46.450> vines<00:01:46.659> on<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.200> can

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
nearby tree with vines on it so you can

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.580 
nearby tree with vines on it so you can
grow<00:01:47.740> or<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.939> you<00:01:49.000> can<00:01:49.210> climb<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:49.990> then<00:01:50.170> jump

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
grow or so you can climb and then jump

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.280 
grow or so you can climb and then jump
across<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:51.219> that's<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.119> pretty<00:01:52.780> simple<00:01:53.170> idea

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
across and that's it pretty simple idea

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.859 
across and that's it pretty simple idea
I<00:01:53.829> do<00:01:54.159> not<00:01:54.549> think<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:54.969> this<00:01:55.210> is<00:01:55.390> what<00:01:55.570> purple

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
I do not think that this is what purple

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.279 
I do not think that this is what purple
black<00:01:56.079> Kiwi<00:01:56.439> had<00:01:56.619> in<00:01:56.770> mind<00:01:57.039> sorry<00:01:57.939> about<00:01:58.210> that

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
black Kiwi had in mind sorry about that

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.399 
black Kiwi had in mind sorry about that
but<00:01:59.289> this<00:01:59.829> is<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.039> way<00:02:00.250> my<00:02:00.399> mind<00:02:00.610> works<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.750> I

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
but this is the way my mind works so I

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.490 
but this is the way my mind works so I
