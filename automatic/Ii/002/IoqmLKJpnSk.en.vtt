future<00:03:10.569> if<00:03:10.840> i<00:03:10.959> need<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.260> do<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.799> i<00:03:11.980> am

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
future if i need to do that so i am

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.600 
future if i need to do that so i am
perfectly<00:03:12.880> happy<00:03:12.970> right<00:03:13.420> now<00:03:13.450> with<00:03:13.930> my<00:03:14.650> specs

one<00:03:16.209> thing<00:03:16.569> though<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.080> I<00:03:17.290> would<00:03:17.620> change<00:03:17.920> and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
one thing though that I would change and

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.860 
one thing though that I would change and
I<00:03:18.340> would<00:03:18.459> recommend<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.940> do<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.239> as<00:03:19.390> well<00:03:19.420> if

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
I would recommend you do this as well if

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.640 
I would recommend you do this as well if
you<00:03:20.350> build<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.709> custom<00:03:21.220> pc<00:03:21.609> is<00:03:21.880> get<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.900> modular

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
you build a custom pc is get a modular

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.780 
you build a custom pc is get a modular
power<00:03:23.859> supply<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.730> got<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.440> 550<00:03:26.440> watt<00:03:26.790> non

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
modular power supply meaning there's

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.220 
modular power supply meaning there's
cords<00:03:29.799> going<00:03:30.130> everywhere<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:31.000> my<00:03:31.510> pc<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:31.959> well

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
cords going everywhere in my pc and well

my<00:03:32.739> computer<00:03:33.220> does<00:03:33.489> have<00:03:33.819> really<00:03:34.209> good<00:03:34.359> cable

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
my computer does have really good cable

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.319 
my computer does have really good cable
management<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.680> could<00:03:36.069> have<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> lot<00:03:36.760> better<00:03:37.060> if

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
management it could have a lot better if

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.030 
management it could have a lot better if
i<00:03:37.450> didn't<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.989> like<00:03:38.260> shove<00:03:38.590> all<00:03:38.829> those

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
i didn't have to like shove all those

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.430 
i didn't have to like shove all those
cords<00:03:39.489> in<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.700> back<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.600> that<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.410> i

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
cords in the back and all that so i

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.720 
cords in the back and all that so i
would<00:03:41.650> recommend<00:03:41.950> getting<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.190> modular<00:03:42.579> power

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
would recommend getting a modular power

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.520 
would recommend getting a modular power
supply<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.150> way<00:03:43.389> you<00:03:43.450> only<00:03:43.600> have<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.350> use

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
supply that way you only have to use

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.039 
supply that way you only have to use
cables<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.250> plug<00:03:45.430> in<00:03:45.639> things<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.780> need

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
cables and plug in things that you need

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.599 
cables and plug in things that you need
if<00:03:47.319> you're<00:03:47.410> not<00:03:47.590> sitting<00:03:47.859> there<00:03:47.980> for<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.250> ton

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
if you're not sitting there for the ton

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.460 
if you're not sitting there for the ton
of<00:03:48.790> extra<00:03:49.209> cables<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:49.989> you're<00:03:50.200> not<00:03:50.319> even

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
of extra cables that you're not even

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.610 
using running all over your pc so that
is<00:03:53.980> one<00:03:54.220> thing<00:03:54.430> i<00:03:54.549> would<00:03:54.609> change<00:03:54.790> and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
is one thing i would change and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.259 
is one thing i would change and
hindsight's<00:03:56.620> 2020<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.370> if<00:03:57.730> i<00:03:57.850> do<00:03:57.910> ever

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
hindsight's 2020 and if i do ever

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.240 
hindsight's 2020 and if i do ever
upgrade<00:03:58.480> my<00:03:58.840> power<00:03:59.019> supply<00:03:59.260> because<00:03:59.620> i'm

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
upgrade my power supply because i'm

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.490 
upgrade my power supply because i'm
running<00:04:00.670> very<00:04:00.940> close<00:04:01.269> to<00:04:01.510> my<00:04:01.630> how<00:04:02.079> much<00:04:02.319> i'm

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
running very close to my how much i'm

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.309 
running very close to my how much i'm
running<00:04:02.829> at<00:04:02.920> about<00:04:03.000> 475<00:04:04.000> watts<00:04:04.359> so<00:04:05.139> if<00:04:05.230> i

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
running at about 475 watts so if i

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.690 
running at about 475 watts so if i
upgrade<00:04:05.500> my<00:04:05.680> graphics<00:04:06.160> card<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.459> something

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
upgrade my graphics card is something

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.740 
upgrade my graphics card is something
like<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:06.970> i'm<00:04:07.060> gonna<00:04:07.180> have<00:04:07.359> to<00:04:07.389> upgrade<00:04:07.600> my

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
like that i'm gonna have to upgrade my

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.250 
like that i'm gonna have to upgrade my
power<00:04:08.049> supply<00:04:08.319> which<00:04:09.329> probably<00:04:10.329> will<00:04:10.780> be<00:04:11.019> it

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
power supply which probably will be it

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.650 
power supply which probably will be it
will<00:04:11.620> be<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.889> modular<00:04:12.400> power<00:04:12.549> supply<00:04:12.700> if<00:04:13.239> i<00:04:13.600> do

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
will be a modular power supply if i do

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.240 
will be a modular power supply if i do
decide<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.319> upgrade<00:04:14.440> my<00:04:14.620> power<00:04:14.889> supply<00:04:15.069> and

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
decide to upgrade my power supply and

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.069 
decide to upgrade my power supply and
graphics<00:04:15.489> card<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.090> all<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.359> so<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:16.989> would

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
graphics card and all that so that would

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.319 
graphics card and all that so that would
all<00:04:17.169> happen<00:04:17.350> at<00:04:17.560> one<00:04:17.739> time<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:19.090> nevertheless

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
all happen at one time but nevertheless

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.469 
all happen at one time but nevertheless
that<00:04:20.109> is<00:04:20.139> pretty<00:04:20.829> much<00:04:20.979> it<00:04:21.039> I<00:04:21.310> mean<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.579> love

from a really old pc and it's actually

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.030 
from a really old pc and it's actually
really<00:04:55.000> good<00:04:55.210> quality<00:04:55.630> it's<00:04:55.750> 1440p<00:04:56.470> quality

which isn't amazing but it's still great

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.260 
which isn't amazing but it's still great
