 a bizarre case involving dance occurred 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.230
 in 1518 in Strasbourg France A 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.030

 today 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.440
 another curious case is the city of the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.540
 county in the United States where 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.550
 dance was banned for about a hundred years 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.590
