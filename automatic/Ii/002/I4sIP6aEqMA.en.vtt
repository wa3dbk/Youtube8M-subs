00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.400
 I started basketball in Brussels 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.610
 when I was 5 years old with my level there 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.639
 I stenz here since May five years 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.960
 hat in basketball I passed a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.539
 few all over the country to play at 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.580
 distance to Brussels then I left 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.980
 at the training center at legs then I 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.890
 left in division 2 at mons hainaut 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.689
 and now i'm in miami actually i 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.070
 wanted to leave you I wanted to play 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.040
 here to train for me is where you 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.440
 went bigger talents in the world 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.829
 and so I wanted to come here and play 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.170
 I had the opportunity of a net in a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.180
 very good team here my american with 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.329
 an Auvergne coach who is one of the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.149
 best leaders in belgium 18 years and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.000
 so here they offered me a scholarship 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.460
 and play here in this team 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.589
 in a last conference of the country where 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:08.130
 axa 1.9 since I moved well I 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.210
 does less than 16 - 18 less than 20 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.869
 I did some workouts too 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.600
 last year with the team 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.640
 national men since I was 16 years old 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.990
 I have a very good cause as a co 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.890
 bouffioulx that I see myself all 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.420
 do not know how to put my first 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.670
 individual rewards it was 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.670
 really in less than 26 years I was 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.190
 selected in the best five I 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.380
 think I do them 3 3 times I had to 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.690
 select two taking the best 5 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.220
 it's with audevant bulk and this year 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.360
 in my 20 very good tournament 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.360
 No one has done that I think we ended 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.149
 fourth and that the third category Philosophy 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.039
 and it took third to ride but 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.110
 we did a really good trick 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.720
 there were not enough really good players 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.170
 we left a lot we did a good 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.360
 championship 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.000
 then the year after we lost some 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.170
 final all the bosnia and we did 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 also really a very good 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 which allowed us this year we will be 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.770
 saying how do you see the future I 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.599
 would say in the short term and in the medium term 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.130
 actually already in what I came here 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.560
 because and my parents and I was 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.709
 really to demonize as far as here 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.450
 we offer you the possibility of numbers 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.560
 as you saw well here we are very 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.319
 professional workouts every 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.200
 days we work really hard and 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.810
 next to that we studied we studied 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.940
 so how at the end of four years he 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.290
 we five years it depends on the studies that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.400
 you do you can have a degree and so 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.650
 I think it's very variable 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.440
 and what kind of study do you play 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.450
 chosen I started in economics then 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.040
 I changed 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.350
 it's called Morocco stayed in the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.880
 store really I know what I want 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.600
 to do and it's good in sports it's 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.080
 very important indeed 2 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.360
 to maintain the basketball level here but 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.250
 also at the level of studies nor according to this 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.080
 I heard you have to really well 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.290
 combine the two and how is 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.030
 a day then for you bats have already 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.460

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.060

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.980

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.080

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.000
 morning until noon one hour after the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.650
 drop is directly drive at 3am 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.810
 world must already be in the focus to 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.510
 the entrance we work back two 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.010
 minimum hours so here we go 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.210
 CuillÃ© will drive today 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.530
 the training was not very long 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.820
 because we have a game tomorrow we have to 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.880
 last two hours what to say anything and 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.110
 beautiful girl but in general during 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.560
 summer these four hours of training 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.380
 so we have another one evoking each 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.670
 of us can we muscled the morning 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.590
 there we did not see what ever did 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.240
 muscu the day before and the newspaper the young 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.610
 yes because you play tomorrow the village 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.370
 in Geneva did not miss muscu so there 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.630
 we must not wake up and so after 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.350
 after the training I say what you 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.740
 do the spell that will sleep 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.430
 Monday we have after the training we have 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.200
 a minimum of one hour 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.629
 we have a study room for 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.659
 athletes and we have to go there minimum 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.329
 an hour so the strict like a month 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:17.449
 they are mostly very riding side themselves 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:20.090
 picks up yes but on the island and it is very 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.340
 demanding he and he is very close to 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.130
 players but we can also neil to the 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.539
 grip the discipline in front of this success the 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.220
 pressure that will give 10 then 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.949
 we are talking about the coach that is 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.050
 who taught you in two years for example 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.880
 what he brought in fact 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.810
 it's a price that means I did 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.870
 many things but what is 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.919
 brought you imagine here is very 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.669
 different in beziers so enormously 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.550
 ease my progress 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.480
 my transition to the beautiful American basketball 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.360
 and explain the difference 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.210
 what it was seeing seeing my 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.639
 macs a loan the day after really 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.700
 studied my game there 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.420
 after being born to my students 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.000
 and learn from our mistakes and nose 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.680
 the level is really different be 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.470
 more so much more athletic so he 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.010
 did not really learn how 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.320
 switch 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.689
 not really changed my game really to 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.919
 you condition to the European game of 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:25.289
 the americans and so that's easy 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.189
 still has to authenticate hi 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.999
 everyone or a special case 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:33.149
 already in fact we have many 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:35.129

 -16 -18 less than 20 grams this is 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.460
 really an honor for me 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.090
 really that I still enjoy being 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.259

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.830
 really i'm really happy such 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.130
 is the question 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:16.009
 the nba of an ambition yeah of course 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.039
 that was one of the goals and it's for 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.630
 that I'm working hard of course for 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.490

 always for my personal goals 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:29.320
 it has always been in my head and you 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.480
 see step by step first on the 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.700
 the European gratin and then the nba or 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.340
 well 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.050
 or the edges of the belicchi bread then 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.050
 to the cunt in pay and then the nbc 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.000
 nam migration of players here who 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.740
 are loaned regular alone it's 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.860
 really vary I do not really know 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.600
 to say it's complicated to say anything can 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.950
 to pass that everything goes very quickly in a year 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.950
 in two years so knew
