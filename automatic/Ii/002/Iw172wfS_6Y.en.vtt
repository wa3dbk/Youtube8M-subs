00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
we'll take a look at some of the stats

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.330 
we'll take a look at some of the stats
of<00:00:42.460> Jax<00:00:43.210> Briggs<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:44.079> also<00:00:44.920> you<00:00:45.010> see<00:00:45.160> I<00:00:45.190> have<00:00:45.309> a

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
of Jax Briggs and also you see I have a

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.420 
of Jax Briggs and also you see I have a
lot<00:00:45.640> of<00:00:45.670> souls<00:00:46.090> and<00:00:46.239> coins<00:00:46.570> at<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.719> top<00:00:46.960> I<00:00:47.430> did

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
lot of souls and coins at the top I did

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.500 
lot of souls and coins at the top I did
that<00:00:48.579> just<00:00:48.730> for<00:00:48.820> demonstration<00:00:49.480> purposes

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
that just for demonstration purposes

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.020 
that just for demonstration purposes
there's<00:00:50.079> no<00:00:50.170> new<00:00:50.379> glitch<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:51.039> don't<00:00:51.640> ask<00:00:51.760> about

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
there's no new glitch so don't ask about

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.139 
there's no new glitch so don't ask about
that<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.559> here<00:00:53.800> he<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.219> another<00:00:54.610> realm<00:00:54.850> brute

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
that so here he is another realm brute

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.540 
that so here he is another realm brute
ability<00:00:55.629> where<00:00:56.110> he<00:00:56.200> gives<00:00:56.320> extra<00:00:56.980> health<00:00:57.250> to

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
ability where he gives extra health to

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.410 
ability where he gives extra health to
nether<00:00:58.000> realm<00:00:58.649> teammates<00:00:59.649> and<00:01:00.390> Sub<00:01:01.390> Zero

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
nether realm teammates and Sub Zero

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.330 
nether realm teammates and Sub Zero
gives<00:01:01.899> extra<00:01:02.230> attack<00:01:02.590> to<00:01:02.800> never<00:01:02.980> another

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
gives extra attack to never another

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.499 
gives extra attack to never another
realm<00:01:03.520> teammate<00:01:03.879> so<00:01:04.030> if<00:01:04.119> you<00:01:04.210> pair<00:01:04.360> them

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
realm teammate so if you pair them

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.020 
realm teammate so if you pair them
together<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.920> get<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.100> lot<00:01:06.220> of<00:01:06.280> they<00:01:06.880> get<00:01:07.000> a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
together they get a lot of they get a

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.649 
together they get a lot of they get a
pretty<00:01:07.330> big<00:01:07.509> boost<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:09.220> I'll<00:01:10.180> show<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.420> some

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
of his special moves in the x-ray attack

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.899 
of his special moves in the x-ray attack
which<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.640> pretty<00:01:12.939> cool<00:01:13.119> as<00:01:13.299> well<00:01:14.700> he's<00:01:15.700> got<00:01:15.880> a

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
some regular attacks actually you can

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.170 
some regular attacks actually you can
see<00:01:35.350> as<00:01:35.500> there's<00:01:35.680> large<00:01:35.950> robotic<00:01:36.759> arms<00:01:37.060> with

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
see as there's large robotic arms with

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.969 
see as there's large robotic arms with
the<00:01:37.270> spikes<00:01:37.570> on<00:01:37.780> them<00:01:37.960> your<00:01:38.409> special<00:01:38.770> attack

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
the spikes on them your special attack

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.499 
the spikes on them your special attack
one<00:01:39.189> pretty<00:01:39.939> cool<00:01:40.180> there's<00:01:40.360> all<00:01:40.420> these

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
one pretty cool there's all these

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.580 
one pretty cool there's all these
different<00:01:40.570> dots<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.200> screen<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.500> have

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
different dots and the screen you have

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.370 
different dots and the screen you have
to<00:01:41.710> touch<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.210> new<00:01:43.360> type<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.810> special

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
to touch it's a new type of special

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.249 
to touch it's a new type of special
attack<00:01:44.650> so<00:01:45.460> that's<00:01:45.700> very<00:01:46.240> unique<00:01:46.420> with<00:01:47.079> this

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
attack so that's very unique with this

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.760 
attack so that's very unique with this
character<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.840> we'll<00:01:49.960> go<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.229> special<00:01:50.560> attack

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
character and we'll go to special attack

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.399 
character and we'll go to special attack
number<00:01:51.040> two<00:01:51.280> which<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.420> called<00:01:52.659> multi<00:01:53.049> slam

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
number two which is called multi slam

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.109 
number two which is called multi slam
and<00:01:53.680> basically<00:01:54.250> he<00:01:54.430> just<00:01:54.460> slams<00:01:54.820> them<00:01:55.000> back

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
and basically he just slams them back

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.219
