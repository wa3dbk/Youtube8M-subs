00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.389
 Steve Jobs once said that a smartphone 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.389
 which cannot be fully managed 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.429
 one handed is complete bullshit and if you 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.379
 full of this advice without hesitation put 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.539
 big 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.180
 iphone 6 plus the sony 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.130
 their own financial reports decided again 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.769
 show compact device therefore 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.240
 the last fa we saw sony z3 compact 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.529
 flagship device as per 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.529
 characteristics and price 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.610
 Externally, the smartphone is not much different from 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.320
 addition for three which is sold without 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.160
 prefixes compact well except in 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.160
 smaller dimensions 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.870
 cedar is approved almost all facial 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 part takes protected by special 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.160
 glass 4 6 inch ips screen with 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 hd-resolution, but the top is already crowded 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.640
 light and proximity sensors logo 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.430
 sony 2 megapixel front camera 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 and by the way the genome and the dynamics and here 2 2 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.520
 located under the screen where we usually 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.320
 used to seeing the touch keys 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.760
 so if you turn the phone in 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 landscape orientation then get 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.780
 the stereo sound on the ends is real 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 an abundance of all kinds of connectors and buttons 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.320
 the middle right is the key 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 power management from just below 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 volume rocker and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.810
 it would be a little worth doing a little bit 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.509
 more too this little button 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.920
 and there are often false clicks more than that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.479
 if you like to measure with friends 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.610
 the size of the volume keys 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.320
 then this smartphone is clearly not for you on 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.090
 first look on the left side i'm so much 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.590
 dock connector well 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.810
 no need to be an analyst with a capital letter 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.550
 and to guess that the smartphone is protected 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.200
 from water and dust so everyone else 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.509
 items hidden under the plugs 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.459
 they are here by the way 2 under the top do not hide 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.959
 microusb and card slot 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.819
 and under the lower tray for the sim card format 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.039
 I personally have nothing against 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.660
 Accommodation 2 pin connectors on the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.700
 among the left side but in our particular 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.590
 The case on the appearance of the device is 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.300
 not very positive effect but 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.250
 bottom all feng shui holes for 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.330
 mount strap and microphone on top of the same 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.369
 no frills 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.200
 audio output and another microphone back 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.759
 the panel as well as the front is covered with a protective 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.709
 glass but that doesn't mean that 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.390
 a smartphone can easily survive all your 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.160
 sudden crash tests by the way if you have 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.900
 black model back side 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.550
 can easily be covered with prints 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.410
 sometimes these prints are even stronger 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.069
 striking than sony and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.720
 xperia 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.730
 but a regular napkin easily fixes this. 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.080
 The problem of the camera and the flash is also on its own 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.970
 habitual location 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.160
 device I really liked 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.930
 certainly plays an important role here 27 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.730
 megapixel main module but in my 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.500
 sony's personal imagination is always 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.660
 I was famous for installing on my own 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.819
 good smartphones are far from the best 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.380
 photo software but recently all 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.819
 changed the standard application can 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.620
 find almost everything that only the soul 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.970
 wish starting from automatic 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.349
 mode where you are required only 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.910
 push the button and finish 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.680
 virtual reality which will add 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.480
 on your usual video downtown 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.520
 true dinosaurs by default all 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.980
 pictures are taken by 8 megapixels let's 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.209
 will be 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.590
 from the moment is enough for 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.629
 most tasks but if you want 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.250
 squeeze the maximum out of the camera then a choice of 20 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.599
 megapixel resolution in manual 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.700
 the mode will not take you more than five 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.440
 seconds snapdragon processor 801 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.940
 it works at a clock frequency of 2 and 5 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.730
 gigahertz given not a large resolution 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.920
 screen graphics accelerator adreno 330 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.799
 2 gigabytes of RAM 45000 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.330
 parrots in antutu and 19000 in 3d mark 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.980
 talk about any problems with 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.989
 lutess performance is not necessary 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.700
 here asphalt 8 by default use 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.329
 maximum graphics settings lunch 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.950
 trigger 2 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.840
 despite average parameters such 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.280
 feeling that gives out 60 fps even 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.860
 dynamic scenes plov version 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.720
 the operating system here is 444 and atop 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.430
 it has a proprietary sony shell installed 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.590
 here seriously from a small device with 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.720
 only 8 6 millimeters thick as something not 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.400
 expect good battery life i'm to 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.230
 example did not expect him more than a day but 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.840
 sony managed to push in a small 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.650
 2600 smartphone battery 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.230
 milliampere hours 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.030
 the same words are set in still sevan m8 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.709
 but there is a bigger screen and resolution 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.329
 taller with my usage mode i 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.250
 charged the smartphone about once a 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.930
 two days and this is a very good indicator in 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.730
 settings, you can enable stamina mode 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.079
 which will extend the running time for another 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.730
 a few hours and if you believe 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.530
 approximately calculated time 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.090
 altogether make him immortal at 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.040
 full charge the program promise some 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.569
 too emotional way for days 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.519
 to figure out the positioning 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.739
 smartphone you just need to look at it 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.329
 name prefix compact there explain 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.370
 all happy that it is not trimmed 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.630
 version of the flagship z3 is practically 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.819
 deck spear which is only 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.530
 lost 1 gigabyte of ram and 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.880
 a little bit in battery capacity though 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.070
 autonomy is not reflected 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.229
 last price difference for z3 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.300
 asking about 600 10 dollars then 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.940
 for z3 compact will be asked for 120 dollars 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.080
 less about 490 how much is it in 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.410
 hryvnia you better not know 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.410
 seriously 13 blind pieces
