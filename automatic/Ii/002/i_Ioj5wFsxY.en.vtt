00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello friends today we are here to 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.760
 show you the ufo cam with its latest 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.190
 firmware version as you will check is 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.830
 spectacular new automatisms that 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.460
 have been incorporated that allow us 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.640
 have automatic takeoff and landing 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.439
 from a lever we will expose 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.100
 hold position and we're going to give the 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.100
 automatic takeoff 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.710
 the device takes off and stays 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 maintaining the position at a point a 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.370
 about 23 meters high as you can see 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.800
 and I could now modify his position 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.930
 from the stick but what we would give is 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.550
 an order of displacement since 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.220
 he is managing the flight in a way 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.860
 automatic we would have what I can 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.559
 move to the left I can 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.670
 move to the right and the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.640
 would manage the flight to do the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.890
 trajectory that I am sending you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.710
 we can see that the control system of 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.980
 height is now much more accurate let's 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.920
 to lower the height a little 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.010
 let's go and nail the height as you see 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.040
 can go back up 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.320
 let's go and nail the height the precision 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 in the height control is much higher 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.110
 which gives us much more peace of mind 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.950
 the time to fly 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.180
 I want you to see that the manual control 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.640
 it's not overly complicated and although 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.670
 always the automatisms obviously 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.290
 they are what would make me handle it 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.900
 anyone 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.490
 the manual auto flight I will pass it to 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.500
 manual so you can see it even though there 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.720
 a certain wind with which good will happen 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.980
 the wind takes a little bit I 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.020
 correct I bring it here 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.760
 and I have no more to do 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.060
 corrections to keep it at a point 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.530
 As you can see, the behavior is very noble 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.630
 it does not make sudden movements nor 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.210
 has aggressive behaviors is 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.330
 all very smoothed so that the video is 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.480
 the best possible we will go back to spend 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.850
 to the autopilot and would go back to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.040
 stay in position I bring it 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.940
 a little here so you can see how 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.180
 does the one 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.370
 the fully automatic landing 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.710
 This is one of the last functions that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.690
 have been incorporated and they make this 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.600
 team can handle it as you see 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.900
 any since it is practically 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.900
 everything automated we stop the engines 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.450
 now so we can see the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.459
 Exceptional automatic capabilities of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.069
 this team we are going to make a flight in the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.890
 which I 'm not going to look at the device in 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.540
 no time will you see what we can do 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.610
 the takeoff completely 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.190
 automatic without the need of even 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.410
 see the device he stays 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.710
 position and height which is what we read 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.440
 and put on the station and we could 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.030
 control perfectly both 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.040
 displacements as height that 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.680
 would manage the flight automatically 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.020
 we see how well he ascends and stays 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.060
 maintaining if it has height nailed 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.970
 at the point we have asked 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.590
 descend and let go of the stick and brake 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.730
 perfectly we are going to do this same 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.380
 movement with a little more agility 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.300
 so you can see 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.300
 as management in more abrupt movements 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.000
 and how it stops perfectly as you see it is 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.130
 impressive flight management is 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.110
 has achieved with this last 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.600
 update especially in the control 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.400
 of height that is very improved we will see 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.080
 that we can also make the landing 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.320
 completely automatically 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.320
 Even today there is a certain good 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.630
 another very interesting feature that 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.310
 we have implemented in the ufo cam is the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.290
 possibility of using stations of 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.030
 camera operator that would allow us 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.760
 control both the inclination of the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.819
 camera as the apparatus rotation like 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.319
 the zoom or the photo shot this is 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.050
 possible thanks to a system of 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.180
 automatic orientation that allows us 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.100
 make straight paths with 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.140
 independence of the apparatus rotation 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.359
 that is, we can be doing 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.799
 rotations to keep the frame with 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.560
 the camera operator's station 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.500
 while the pilot makes a trajectory 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.560
 and that rotation of the camera operator does not 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.770
 would affect the flight of that device 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.560
 we can make frames that would be 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.919
 very complicated to do with a single 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.510
 pilot is characteristic we think 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.930
 very interesting and we have developed 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.539
 this type of screen for 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.490
 to the camera operator station that 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.110
 would allow us to see the video in time 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.080
 real while doing these 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.990
 controls all the details we saw 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.440
 that were necessary from the practice 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.620
 we have incorporated them and features 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.039
 as the simplicity of repair the use 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.009
 of low cost rotors and the 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.470
 stability of the image have been 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.449
 our main in our 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.060
 main objectives when it comes to 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.770
 develop this team with which 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.229
 We believe that we have solved many of the 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.840
 problems that exist in other equipment 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.550
 From the market 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.680
 another novelty that has incorporated 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.020
 recently the micro- copd technology 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.460
 air is the possibility of using tablets 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.830
 android to schedule routes to 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.330
 teams this is achieved through 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.160
 this device that is the range 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.129
 extend that serves as a link between the 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.219
 tablet and the infoca 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:47.059
 this new application available for 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:50.330
 Android allows us new systems 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:52.580
 generation of routes has 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.949
 spoken telemetry and a lot of 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.309
 new features that we can see 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:00.939
 in a video soon we will do 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:00.939
 expressly of this system 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.380
 finally let's see how the ufo cam 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.550
 is able to make a flight completely 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.980
 automatic without the need of any type 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.990
 control from the station from the 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.180
 takeoff until landing we have 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.190
 programmed a route through the computer 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.510
 a quite simple way and 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.970
 he just had to start the 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.680
 engines and with this keyboard here I'm going to 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.290
 execute the route and he is going to commission 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.520
 of doing the complete included takeoff and 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.520
 Landing let's see 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:42.410
 You can see how the takeoff 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.100
 and going to the different points there 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:49.610
 go to the first point and it will go 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.530
 doing the whole route while 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.520
 the device makes the route I want 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.020
 tell you some of the 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.370
 main characteristics of this 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.340
 team this team is thought 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.530
 mainly for aerial filming 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.750
 in such a way that it is very smoothed 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.520
 all your movements so that the video 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.669
 go out as best as possible 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.300
 Logically, it stabilizes 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:14.180
 camera on two axes in such a way that the 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.250
 video comes out the best we can 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.440
 obtained very interesting results in 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.920
 this sense also comment that is 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.640
 designed to 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.040
 that is very easy to repair that no 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.580
 have vibrations is a team thought 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.800
 by and for the air filming I hope 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.080
 that you liked the capabilities 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.430
 completely automatic that the 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.430
 luxury cam in its latest version
