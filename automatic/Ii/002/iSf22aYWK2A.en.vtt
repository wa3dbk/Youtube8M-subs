00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.610
 According to Stephen King, there are three types of 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.670
 things make people afraid 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.280
 horror terror and the disgusting thing like him 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.500
 it calls or grass from these English 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.239
 is an example of what most people do 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.160
 my audience already over 14 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.230
 years as are likely to know would be to 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.510
 By the way , I have the genre , by the way 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.489
 also with twelve given well mistakes or 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.800
 not so it is definitely said 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.200
 it's about blood and blood again 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.490
 blood and accurately then joins also 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.110
 our today's anime 1 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.820
 By the way, translated means cops party 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.620
 corpse party in german 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.510
 and that's all about that 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.700
 anime from cops game is a very 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.350
 short anime with only four could follow 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.699
 actually an anime movie has to be 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.420
 but as a short series 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.740
 enforced 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.450
 The story is actually more one 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.680
 excuse has its reason in the big and 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.210
 it's all about a bunch of students 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.770
 and a teacher together in the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.000
 School horror stories tell 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.440
 through a mismatched streetwear 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.149
 then all get into a kind 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.710
 parallel world and have to be there in one 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.149
 old school an unsolved 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.960
 Enlighten murder case again 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.850
 return 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.950
 and then one goes after the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.229
 on top of it and that's exactly what it is 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.240
 also so a pity that the emir so 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.039
 is short and has so many characters 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.080
 will be about every character 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.550
 busy for five minutes and afterwards 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.310
 you only see any guts 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.539
 or any in parts but come 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.399
 First of all, let us ask you the most important question 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.200
 why I 'm a horror at all 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.630
 Anime is because the whole 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.280
 at all creepy na not like 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.360
 right and then on the other side 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.000
 but a little bit 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.649
 well to enlighten you all the time 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.660
 is not that scary because it is 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.450
 a bit bright everything and there is 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.560
 also no real shocking moments 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.940
 on the other hand, it is also one 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.800
 a bit scary because it is quite 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.810
 many brutal scenes and disgusting 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.390
 are seen and some people the creeps 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.039
 also what the horror scenes themselves 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.660
 you can hardly imagine bloody 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.160
 and sometimes you have the feeling that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.030
 like the guts out of the screen 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.280
 jump out 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.930
 to come from time to time the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.240
 Characters sometimes really nice 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.550
 can be crazy and crazy 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.530
 was not there such an anime at 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.569
 the characters were so crazy 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.120
 and he was so bloody and off 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.760
 a bit of hysteria share what was 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.520
 because that's really figuration monaco 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.410
 kuranyi 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.540
 and then the question comes up 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.580
 is that all as good as me 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.800
 courage in monaco kuranyi or just 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.630
 comparable because of those who 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.450
 To know a little the courage is one 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.310
 unbelievably good anime, unfortunately 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.230
 not really because though cops partie 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.170
 almost as good if I even 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.840
 has better crazy and bloody scenes 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.060
 the whole thing is no comparison to that 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.930
 great mystery share at 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.450
 decoration 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.430
 well then cops party is not 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.310
 quite similar to igor acino 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.710
 But lakonie is a cops game 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.660
 a good anime at all 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.950
 actually already though cops party 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.980
 a bit like a horror movie 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.450
 who has a little too low budget 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.340
 he did a pretty good job and 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.100
 I have a great following over four 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.270
 long just analyzes the psychoses 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.120
 we liked 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.540
 and also the little humor tries 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.160
 humor in such an anime yes that 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.940
 is there 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.190
 Let's just do an example 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.140
 what happens if you have your smaller one 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.790
 sister with a spirit you just 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.010
 first met and he completely 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.660
 friendly smiles and leaves alone 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.580
 next to it, a forest and you say 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.680
 just see you later I have to 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.200
 go short on the toilet is the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.840
 First, there will be a nice party 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.670
 is the secondly lena meyer is landrut 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.120
 to the Chancellor of Germany 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.370
 chosen 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.970
 or is it all third if 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.970
 killed 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.170
 1 2 or 3 last chance before 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.530
 yes you did that well on 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.770
 end quickly once again a short 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.540
 Conclusion cops party is a good anime of 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.580
 just convinced that he just 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.060
 short is that he is easy to look at 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.770
 and that he has very good psychoses that 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.780
 but then can not just on the whole 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.240
 same level as igora 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.220
 china kokoro never even when the guts 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.770
 never looked so nice 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.960
 at corps party and that's exactly what it is 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.270
 also the point to those the intestines 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.890
 the innards do not mind and the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.780
 Big horror fans are the ones who can 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.220
 the anime look at another one 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.440
 is advised against it 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.120
 I thank you for watching and we 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.590
 see us at the next review for 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.280
 the vote for it there is a new one 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.960
 system 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.270
 I will take this video 2 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.800
 post comments each with the country 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.730
 it is on him and you can then thumb 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.500
 high or high 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.390
 thumb down then for your favorite 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.390
