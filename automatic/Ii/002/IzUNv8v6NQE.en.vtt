00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
this outline and it looks very similar

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.610 
this outline and it looks very similar
to<00:00:42.250> me<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.760> pod<00:00:42.970> by<00:00:43.290> Channel<00:00:44.290> Islands<00:00:44.559> and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620

al Merrick and I had a pod and that
board<00:00:46.540> was<00:00:46.570> great<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.170> they<00:00:47.530> do<00:00:47.589> actually

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
board was great and they do actually

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.930 
board was great and they do actually
feel<00:00:48.460> very<00:00:48.729> similar<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.210> two<00:00:49.360> boards<00:00:49.720> however

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
feel very similar the two boards however

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.030 
feel very similar the two boards however
some<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.269> waves<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:52.900> are<00:00:53.049> listed<00:00:53.589> on<00:00:53.830> the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
some of the waves that are listed on the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.280 
some of the waves that are listed on the
site<00:00:54.250> as<00:00:54.970> being<00:00:55.330> you<00:00:55.600> know<00:00:55.629> weights<00:00:56.019> that<00:00:56.170> you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
site as being you know weights that you

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.810 
site as being you know weights that you
could<00:00:56.409> surf<00:00:56.589> this<00:00:56.799> board<00:00:57.040> with<00:00:57.220> like<00:00:57.430> glances

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
could surf this board with like glances

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.880 
could surf this board with like glances
right<00:00:58.030> for<00:00:58.210> example<00:00:58.269> momento<00:00:58.930> ease<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.320> would

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
right for example momento ease I would

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.740 
right for example momento ease I would
definitely<00:01:00.460> not<00:01:00.670> surf<00:01:00.970> this<00:01:01.150> board<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:01.600> waves

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
definitely not surf this board and waves

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.149 
definitely not surf this board and waves
like<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.019> I<00:01:02.170> think<00:01:02.320> it's<00:01:02.559> fine<00:01:02.769> for<00:01:02.799> team

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
like that I think it's fine for team

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.710 
like that I think it's fine for team
riders<00:01:03.489> dan<00:01:03.699> malloy<00:01:03.970> would<00:01:04.239> do<00:01:04.360> just<00:01:04.659> fine

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
riders dan malloy would do just fine

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.450 
riders dan malloy would do just fine
surfing<00:01:05.320> Lance<00:01:05.830> is<00:01:05.979> right

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
surfing Lance is right

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.359 
surfing Lance is right
probably<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.150> any<00:01:07.420> type<00:01:07.690> of<00:01:07.720> board<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:09.280> the

probably in the you know waist high to
just<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:25.780> know<00:01:25.870> couple<00:01:26.080> feet<00:01:26.290> overhead

just a you know couple feet overhead

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.130 
just a you know couple feet overhead
range<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.700> great<00:01:28.060> little<00:01:28.270> option<00:01:28.660> this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
range this is a great little option this

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.010 
range this is a great little option this
thing's<00:01:29.290> fast<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.890> paddles<00:01:30.250> well<00:01:30.430> it's<00:01:31.330> EPS<00:01:31.780> so

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020

outline<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.730> it's<00:01:43.240> got<00:01:43.480> width<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.650> again<00:01:44.860> it's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
outline so it's got width and again it's

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
got paddle power as a result but the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.980 
got paddle power as a result but the
nose<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.370> you<00:01:48.790> know<00:01:48.909> it's<00:01:49.120> kind<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.510> its

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
thinned out and it's not too bulky I

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.960 
thinned out and it's not too bulky I
never<00:01:52.450> felt<00:01:52.720> like<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.740> nose<00:01:53.950> was<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.880> know

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
never felt like the nose was you know

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.730 
never felt like the nose was you know

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
getting in the way when I tried to turn

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.760 
getting in the way when I tried to turn
the<00:01:56.770> board<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.970> tail<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:58.510> very<00:01:58.540> is<00:01:59.440> very

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
the board and the tail is very is very

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.530 
the board and the tail is very is very
quite<00:02:00.040> straightforward<00:02:00.700> pulled<00:02:00.970> into<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.360> nice

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
quite straightforward pulled into a nice

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.630 
quite straightforward pulled into a nice
little<00:02:01.690> swallow<00:02:01.990> at<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.320> back<00:02:02.470> here<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.920> that

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
little swallow at the back here and that

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.420 
little swallow at the back here and that
channels<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.840> single<00:02:05.500> concave<00:02:05.710> down<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.159> a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
channels a single concave down to a

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.609 
channels a single concave down to a
double<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.120> V<00:02:07.240> out<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.479> back<00:02:07.630> channels<00:02:08.110> water

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
double and V out the back channels water

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.800 
double and V out the back channels water
out<00:02:08.799> back<00:02:09.099> nicely<00:02:09.369> through<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.759> board<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.569> a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
out back nicely through the board so a

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.899 
out back nicely through the board so a
good<00:02:11.110> kind<00:02:11.409> of<00:02:11.470> all-rounder<00:02:12.069> for<00:02:12.340> lots<00:02:12.790> of

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
good kind of all-rounder for lots of

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.479 
good kind of all-rounder for lots of
different<00:02:12.970> types<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.569> waves<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.280> again<00:02:15.280> I

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
different types of waves and again I

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.920 
different types of waves and again I
wouldn't<00:02:15.909> serve<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.180> at<00:02:16.330> Lance's<00:02:16.629> Rider<00:02:16.840> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
wouldn't serve this at Lance's Rider a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.809 
wouldn't serve this at Lance's Rider a
big<00:02:17.110> powerful<00:02:17.379> reef<00:02:17.650> break<00:02:17.860> like<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.490> I

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
big powerful reef break like that and I

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.340 
big powerful reef break like that and I
wouldn't<00:02:19.180> serve<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.450> as<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.660> groveler<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:20.319> I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
wouldn't serve this as a groveler but I

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.890 
wouldn't serve this as a groveler but I
think<00:02:20.620> for<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.400> average<00:02:21.610> waves<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.330> most

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
think for the average waves that most

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.199 
think for the average waves that most
you<00:02:23.260> know<00:02:23.349> 80%<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> time<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.760> farc<00:02:25.060> by

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
you know 80% of the time the farc by

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.460 
you know 80% of the time the farc by
Flecha<00:02:25.450> Shannara<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.140> good<00:02:26.290> option

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
Flecha Shannara is a really good option

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.220 
Flecha Shannara is a really good option

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
if you've had a go on the farc please as
