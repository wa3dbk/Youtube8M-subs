there we go if I was unhappy with
anything<00:01:03.230> else<00:01:03.559> in<00:01:04.040> this<00:01:04.220> area<00:01:04.489> let's<00:01:05.330> say

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
anything else in this area let's say

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.570 
anything else in this area let's say
that<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:06.020> needed<00:01:06.409> to<00:01:06.619> brighten<00:01:07.009> her<00:01:07.130> under<00:01:07.460> eyes

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
that I needed to brighten her under eyes

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.789 
that I needed to brighten her under eyes
I<00:01:07.850> could<00:01:08.030> go<00:01:08.149> ahead<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.450> use<00:01:08.659> this<00:01:09.110> action<00:01:09.409> the

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
I could go ahead and use this action the

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.550 
I could go ahead and use this action the
under<00:01:10.040> eye<00:01:10.070> brightened<00:01:10.700> eye<00:01:10.909> if<00:01:11.750> she<00:01:12.409> was<00:01:12.530> a

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
under eye brightened eye if she was a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.080 
under eye brightened eye if she was a
little<00:01:12.770> closer<00:01:13.009> perhaps<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:13.610> want<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.850> use<00:01:13.939> the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
little closer perhaps I want to use the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.789 
little closer perhaps I want to use the
mascara<00:01:14.479> action<00:01:14.960> but<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:15.140> think<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.560> this

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
mascara action but I think that this

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.560 
mascara action but I think that this
looks<00:01:16.039> fine<00:01:16.310> right<00:01:16.610> now<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.210> I'm<00:01:17.299> going<00:01:17.479> to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
looks fine right now so I'm going to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.170 
looks fine right now so I'm going to
move<00:01:17.780> on<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.289> the<00:01:18.680> depth<00:01:18.979> contrast<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.940> glow

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
move on to the depth contrast and glow

move on to the depth contrast and glow
and<00:01:21.640> I'm<00:01:22.640> going<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.909> go<00:01:23.090> ahead<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.750> add<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:25.189> deep

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.840 
I'm gonna crank it up a little higher
than<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.230> normally<00:02:16.290> would<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.890> would<00:02:17.130> probably<00:02:17.670> I

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
than I normally would I would probably I

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.700 
than I normally would I would probably I
was<00:02:18.330> doing<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:19.020> real<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.200> would<00:02:19.350> probably

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
was doing this for real I would probably

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.860 
was doing this for real I would probably
started<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.100> lower<00:02:20.310> opacity<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:21.150> build<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
started a lower opacity and build it a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.850 
started a lower opacity and build it a
little<00:02:22.050> more<00:02:22.230> subtly

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.869 

there<00:02:30.670> we<00:02:30.850> go

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
there we go

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.080 
there we go
my<00:02:33.689> red<00:02:33.870> cast

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
my red cast

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.420 
my red cast
if<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.780> want<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> little<00:02:37.590> bit<00:02:37.800> more<00:02:37.830> I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
if I want to do a little bit more I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.699 
if I want to do a little bit more I
would<00:02:38.849> just<00:02:39.030> go<00:02:39.209> here<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.690> overall<00:02:40.080> paint

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
would just go here to the overall paint

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.550 
would just go here to the overall paint
out<00:02:40.860> color<00:02:41.160> casts<00:02:41.459> action

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
out color casts action

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.530 
out color casts action
and<00:02:43.650> hit<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.550> again<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.970> was<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> pretty

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
and hit it again that was a pretty

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
and hit it again that was a pretty
strong<00:02:45.930> red<00:02:46.680> color<00:02:46.950> cast<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.580> needed

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
strong red color cast so it needed

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.880 
strong red color cast so it needed
little<00:02:48.540> extra<00:02:48.810> attention<00:02:49.520> all<00:02:50.520> right<00:02:51.120> I'm
