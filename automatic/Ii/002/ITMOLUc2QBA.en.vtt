00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.779
 are the people with the afternoons then 

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.160
 takes a life inside her and yes that 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.379
 we have the phone at hand we are going to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.809
 make an update of what is the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.059
 galaxy s3 for that obviously we require 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.730
 the phone and the system here is if not 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 we can not do anything 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 in this samsung that is samsung kies the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.320
 current system is a 4.0 point 4 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.020
 what is an ice cream sandwich 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.810
 and it must be updated to what is a 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.099
 living i'm not exactly sure that 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.320
 version but that is going to update 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.970
 is going to update ok once 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.040
 we enter the mediate tells us that there is 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.890
 update let's update from 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.840
 righ now 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 here it tells us that you're going to a copy of 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.780
 security that the charged battery has 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.720
 that does not need any phone that does not 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.699
 disconnect the cable what all the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.199
 updates always say though 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.700
 they allowed passion of 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.350
 information or to continue without saving 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.150
 I have read a previous information and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.070
 we were updated we started the 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.129
 upgrade 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.659
 we expect something that is work and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.250
 I hope it does not take long because 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.970
 I require this video to be five 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.970
 minutes or less 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.190
 cargo charge cargo cargo load cargo 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.940
 cord 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.940
 load 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.970
 and that is that I already downloaded 100% of the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.500
 firewall components that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.620
 I honestly do not believe in the installation 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 requires weighing almost one giga cyan egg 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.690
 and here begins what is the preparation 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.030
 component update 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.610
 firmware or the rom like many already the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.280
 you know it's worth now if the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.710
 update as god sends 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.640
 in this case we will have to wait for 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.960
 it ends once it ends 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.940
 will begin to install the system 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.310
 device or start doing the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.920
 device update as 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.970
 will account the device 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.700
 automatically enters mode 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.040
 download to be able to load the data of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.220
 this update the process of 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.520
 download in a more or less stable network 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.100
 Up to 10 megabytes lasts about 8 minutes 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.910
 in the installation or in the update 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.069
 of the system will last as well as 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.989
 see about 5 more minutes 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.890
 let's wait for this to end 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.560
 we carry 87 percent 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.200
 I remind you that this update or the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.350
 update in mode that's just is 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.260
 possible if the phone has the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.000
 original course since otherwise to 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.920
 sometimes does not even allow them the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.770
 connection to what is the software that is 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.150
 that's very very very important not what 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.010
 go to put the water and because neither 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.660
 will even give them access to what 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.420
 is the device we have 97 percent 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.920
 98 percent and the phone is also 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.600
 loading your bar is completely 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.720
 full and we reach one hundred percent 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.130
 wait for the device to restart 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.020
 here we are going to accept 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.920
 is a system leaving the principal for 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.190
 need updates 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.710
 after that the only thing that remains is 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.180
 and I hope 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.180
 from his vein 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.769
 what 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.250
 and it turned on samsung now it happens of 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.250
 load 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.970
 entering the operating system 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.560
 update the operating system of 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.319
 android optimizing the application 14 of 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.689
 89 in this only because we have left 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.760
 wait for it to finish what is the 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:45.370
 optimization of all applications and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.730
 adjustments to be able to start using it 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.150
 As I told you before, I had a 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.319
 system 4 points 0.4 that corresponds 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.450
 to ice cream sandwich and according to this according to 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.790
 who was going to update it to what it was 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.170
 the living I'm not sure what version 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.739
 but I hope it is at least 4.1.2 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.739
 let's see the result 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.420
 to unlock unlock and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:21.090
 we review what our system is 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.680
 setup get down about the 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:29.870
 perfect device is a version 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.870
 4.1.2 of the living 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.990
 no problem is not update 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.510
 ok perfect and that was all for what 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.810
 is the galaxy s3 update with 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.610
 original system from the shell is very 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.340
 I also recommend that you do not 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.770
 update bi exhaust what is the way vota 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.420
 to the via bogotÃ¡ is wireless when it is 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.790
 say in messages or devices that 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.460
 it's going to be updated since it can get 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.260
 to mark many mistakes and even the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.240
 phone can enter a bridge mode 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.750
 that they will not be able to remove it so 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.420
 easily so it is much much much 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.660
 pretty to repeat a recommended chingo 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.230
 to be updated within what is that 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.780
 is and not via note 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.320
 well, this was all I hope that you 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.170
 has helped 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.170
 be careful be happy of life bye
