00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.090
 This is a collection of precisely gir will get 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.550
 number one winner will be next 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.150
 idiot will go more precisely 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.250
 trayan 2 because he's 3d sleep and let's say 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.930
 so but it is like dvd but more than 3 dash is not 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.140
 Look at the trailer 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.920
 and will continue to go and Jeff space and risk 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.930
 of rain 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.850
 here but there is such an interesting moment two 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.220
 recent winners despite the fact that 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.280
 they will get the least graphic 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.250
 a toy although it is a game in itself 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.830
 pretty cool and interesting laptop 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.739
 last winners will have a chance they 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.810
 will be able to choose what they want hedgehogs space 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.450
 or risk of rain, that is, here it is 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.830
 they will be different this will be their bonus 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.230
 let's say so compared to two 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.280
 previous well at least a tomb raider 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.730
 of course 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.540
 naturally naturally remains far away 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.820
 ahead of everyone else is behind him 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.180
