00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.900
 the innovative concept of the clutch of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.590
 grange group is one of the main ones 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 innovations of the 7g dct the two changes are 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 constantly firm but only one is of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.450
 in turn connected to the engine 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.760
 through the relative clutch la 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.530
 external clutch sends the pair of the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.650
 engine to gear gears 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.600
 odd through the solid tree and from 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.629
 there to the differential through the tree 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.629
 exit to finally get to the wheels 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.120
 the second internal clutch controls the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.120
 even gears through the hollow shaft 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.629
 as for the reverse they are 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 new paths have been taken 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.560
 the necessary reversal of the sense of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.369
 gear shifting is achieved without 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.570
 use an additional shaft 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.159
 the reverse gear is engaged 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.649
 simply by a command 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.700
 intelligent gearwheels 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.420
 gears 2 r 3 and 1 and using all e 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.299
 four existing trees 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.890
 this causes the 7g dct exchange to have 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.140
 an extremely short structure e 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.789
 compact 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.200
 the dual use of gears 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:39.690
 conductors of gears 4 and 6 as well as 57 e 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.580
 a further technical feature a 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:51.149
 driving gear operates two 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:53.190
 gears driven change 7g dct 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.890
 defines new benchmarks 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.630
 in terms of efficiency and was in fact 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.490
 developed a unique concept of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.890
 formed oil supply 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.719
 substantially of the vane pump e 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.149
 additional pump and oil 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.770
 integrated thanks to the latter the oil 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.670
 it is fed according to the actual 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.259
 need 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.269
 the mechanical pump can be more 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.549
 small and it is possible to integrate the 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.760
 new start stop system to save money 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.920
 fuel at a standstill engine maintains one 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.780
 base oil pressure to be able to 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.269
 be ready again in a few 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.650
 fractions of a second 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.780
 in this way we still get one 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.420
 time a net reduction in consumption of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.489
 fuel also coating of the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.980
 differential a new system for 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.299
 limiting their losses contribute to them 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.299
 aimed at improving performance
