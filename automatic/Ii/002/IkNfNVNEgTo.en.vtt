00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
I had to race tomorrow I think I would

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.820 
I had to race tomorrow I think I would
qualify<00:01:25.390> no<00:01:26.050> probably<00:01:26.470> not

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
qualify no probably not

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.440 
qualify no probably not
it's<00:01:27.190> gonna<00:01:27.310> be<00:01:27.430> tough<00:01:27.580> qualifying<00:01:28.030> even<00:01:28.270> if<00:01:28.360> I

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
it's gonna be tough qualifying even if I

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's gonna be tough qualifying even if I
put<00:01:29.230> my<00:01:29.380> head<00:01:29.560> down<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.860> just<00:01:29.920> actually

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
put my head down and just actually

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.800 
put my head down and just actually
trained<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:30.910> went<00:01:31.030> at<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.180> hard<00:01:31.480> it'll<00:01:31.720> be

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
trained and went at it hard it'll be

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.330 
trained and went at it hard it'll be
tough<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.080> qualify<00:01:32.410> those<00:01:32.530> guys<00:01:32.710> those<00:01:33.280> guys

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
tough to qualify those guys those guys

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.120 
tough to qualify those guys those guys
are<00:01:33.580> fast<00:01:33.760> like<00:01:34.090> I<00:01:34.300> know<00:01:34.780> in<00:01:35.080> my<00:01:35.230> heart<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.680> I

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
are fast like I know in my heart that I

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.920 
are fast like I know in my heart that I
probably<00:01:36.880> don't<00:01:37.150> even<00:01:37.240> belong<00:01:37.540> there<00:01:37.780> like

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
probably don't even belong there like

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.190 
probably don't even belong there like
those<00:01:38.050> guys<00:01:38.260> would<00:01:38.770> whoop<00:01:38.979> my<00:01:39.100> butt<00:01:39.340> I<00:01:40.200> just

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
those guys would whoop my butt I just

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.870 
those guys would whoop my butt I just
want<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.410> go<00:01:41.470> out<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.620> do<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:42.040> mean<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.520> don't

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
want to go out and do it I mean I don't

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.430 
want to go out and do it I mean I don't
see<00:01:43.120> any<00:01:43.270> reason<00:01:43.540> why<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.690> shouldn't<00:01:43.960> try

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
see any reason why I shouldn't try

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.260 
see any reason why I shouldn't try
I<00:01:44.470> mean<00:01:44.920> maybe<00:01:45.190> for<00:01:45.430> one<00:01:45.580> lap<00:01:45.760> I<00:01:45.910> might<00:01:46.060> be<00:01:46.210> able

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
I mean maybe for one lap I might be able

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.360 
I mean maybe for one lap I might be able
to<00:01:46.420> throw<00:01:46.870> down<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.080> lap<00:01:47.380> that's<00:01:47.650> that's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
to throw down a lap that's that's

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.640 
to throw down a lap that's that's
somewhere<00:01:48.760> near<00:01:48.970> qualifying<00:01:49.540> but<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:50.560> would

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
somewhere near qualifying but it would

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.550 
somewhere near qualifying but it would
have<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.860> be<00:01:50.920> one<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.310> my<00:01:51.430> best<00:01:51.670> laps<00:01:51.940> probably

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
have to be one of my best laps probably

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.350 
have to be one of my best laps probably
if<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.740> got<00:01:53.920> into<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.190> Moto's<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.700> wouldn't<00:01:55.119> I

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
if I got into the Moto's I wouldn't I

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.900 
if I got into the Moto's I wouldn't I
definitely<00:01:56.229> wouldn't<00:01:56.470> have<00:01:56.530> anything

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
definitely wouldn't have anything

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.760 
definitely wouldn't have anything
anything<00:01:57.910> for<00:01:58.180> him<00:01:58.300> but<00:01:58.509> it<00:01:59.170> would<00:01:59.259> be<00:01:59.380> it'd<00:01:59.710> be

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
anything for him but it would be it'd be

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.309 
anything for him but it would be it'd be
cool<00:02:00.009> to<00:02:00.040> do

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.600 

I've<00:02:09.319> honestly<00:02:09.470> never<00:02:09.739> trained<00:02:10.160> once<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.520> my

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
I've honestly never trained once in my

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.589 
I've honestly never trained once in my
life<00:02:11.739> it's<00:02:12.739> I<00:02:13.190> don't<00:02:13.819> know<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.120> just<00:02:14.360> never

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
life it's I don't know I just never

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.120 
life it's I don't know I just never
really<00:02:14.930> thought<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.200> was<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.470> fun<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.950> just

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
really thought it was that fun so I just

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.210 
really thought it was that fun so I just
didn't<00:02:16.430> do<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:17.450> guess<00:02:18.019> if<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.950> count

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
didn't do it and I guess if you count

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.850 
didn't do it and I guess if you count
