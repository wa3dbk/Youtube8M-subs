outputs are also available as digital or
analog<00:03:11.400> audio<00:03:11.639> outputs<00:03:12.269> or<00:03:12.510> again<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.139> audio

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
analog audio outputs or again the audio

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.159 
analog audio outputs or again the audio
can<00:03:13.739> be<00:03:13.769> output<00:03:14.340> as<00:03:14.519> embedded<00:03:14.879> SDI<00:03:15.419> audio<00:03:15.959> as

can be output as embedded SDI audio as

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.699 
can be output as embedded SDI audio as
well<00:03:16.970> now<00:03:17.970> there<00:03:18.150> are<00:03:18.269> two<00:03:18.569> audio<00:03:19.199> output

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
well now there are two audio output

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.979 
well now there are two audio output
sections<00:03:20.220> one<00:03:20.639> is<00:03:20.669> your<00:03:20.940> main<00:03:21.150> program<00:03:21.720> audio

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
sections one is your main program audio

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.979 
sections one is your main program audio
output<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.250> second<00:03:23.699> is<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.989> configurable

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
output and the second is a configurable

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.439 
output and the second is a configurable
audio<00:03:25.379> output<00:03:25.889> this<00:03:26.400> allows<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.909> to<00:03:27.000> do<00:03:27.150> two

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
audio output this allows you to do two

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.420 
audio output this allows you to do two
separate<00:03:27.989> audio<00:03:28.440> mixes<00:03:28.889> from<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.220> same

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
separate audio mixes from the same

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.640 
separate audio mixes from the same
TriCaster<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:30.870> only<00:03:31.169> can<00:03:31.349> you<00:03:31.439> produce

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
TriCaster so not only can you produce

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.219 
TriCaster so not only can you produce
two<00:03:32.280> separate<00:03:32.699> resolutions<00:03:33.359> or<00:03:33.569> two<00:03:33.840> separate

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
two separate resolutions or two separate

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.289 
two separate resolutions or two separate
formats<00:03:34.709> coming<00:03:35.069> out<00:03:35.189> at<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> same<00:03:35.609> time<00:03:35.849> but

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
formats coming out at the same time but

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.849 
formats coming out at the same time but
you<00:03:36.359> can<00:03:36.569> also<00:03:36.720> have<00:03:36.900> two<00:03:36.959> separate<00:03:37.530> audio

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
you can also have two separate audio

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.610 
you can also have two separate audio
mixes<00:03:38.540> simultaneously<00:03:39.540> from<00:03:39.720> one<00:03:39.930> TriCaster

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
mixes simultaneously from one TriCaster

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.559 
mixes simultaneously from one TriCaster
and<00:03:40.829> again<00:03:41.099> we'll<00:03:41.549> look<00:03:41.669> at<00:03:41.849> configuring<00:03:42.120> that

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
and again we'll look at configuring that

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.710 
and again we'll look at configuring that
once<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:43.019> get<00:03:43.139> into<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.470> interface<00:03:44.629> you<00:03:45.629> have

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
once we get into the interface you have

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.999 
once we get into the interface you have
the<00:03:45.810> ability<00:03:46.199> to<00:03:46.229> connect<00:03:46.620> your<00:03:46.709> main

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:47.009 
the ability to connect your main

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.129 
the ability to connect your main
interface<00:03:47.400> monitor<00:03:48.150> here<00:03:48.509> you<00:03:48.780> want<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:48.989> make

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
interface monitor here you want to make

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.809 
interface monitor here you want to make
sure<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.439> you're<00:03:49.590> using<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:50.129> minimum

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
look at our network inputs you'll also

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.810 
look at our network inputs you'll also
