some<00:00:00.630> of<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.780> things<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:01.050> enjoy<00:00:01.079> most<00:00:01.260> about

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
some of the things I enjoy most about

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.560 
some of the things I enjoy most about
design<00:00:02.100> and<00:00:02.250> e-learning<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.939> just<00:00:03.270> how<00:00:03.389> many

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
design and e-learning is just how many

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.390 
design and e-learning is just how many
different<00:00:03.659> ways<00:00:03.929> we<00:00:04.200> have<00:00:04.440> for<00:00:04.859> creating<00:00:05.279> our

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
different ways we have for creating our

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.940 
different ways we have for creating our
courses<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.230> scenarios<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.410> example<00:00:07.470> are<00:00:07.919> a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
courses and scenarios for example are a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.890 
courses and scenarios for example are a
great<00:00:08.280> way<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.519> introduce<00:00:08.900> multiple

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
great way to introduce multiple

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.680 
great way to introduce multiple
characters<00:00:10.380> who<00:00:10.920> can<00:00:11.219> provide<00:00:11.690> viewpoints

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
characters who can provide viewpoints

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.530 
characters who can provide viewpoints
context<00:00:13.380> perspectives<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.549> really<00:00:15.059> support

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
context perspectives that really support

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.540 
context perspectives that really support
or<00:00:15.750> even<00:00:15.780> challenge<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> main<00:00:16.859> content<00:00:17.460> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
or even challenge the main content and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.189 
or even challenge the main content and
in<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.060> example<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> create<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
in this example we're going to create a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.679 
in this example we're going to create a
really<00:00:19.410> simple<00:00:19.830> scenario<00:00:20.340> using<00:00:21.029> hyperlinks

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
really simple scenario using hyperlinks

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.650 
really simple scenario using hyperlinks
animation<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.859> hidden<00:00:23.189> slides<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.570> this

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
animation and hidden slides so in this

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.120 
animation and hidden slides so in this
example<00:00:24.840> right<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.410> will<00:00:25.590> click<00:00:25.800> any<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> these

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
example right we will click any of these

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.250 
example right we will click any of these
characters<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.939> then<00:00:27.750> they'll<00:00:27.869> quickly

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
characters and then they'll quickly

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.929 
characters and then they'll quickly
slide<00:00:28.619> into<00:00:28.890> place<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> great<00:00:29.580> way<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.730> add<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
slide into place so a great way to add a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
slide into place so a great way to add a
little<00:00:30.150> bit<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.449> animation<00:00:30.840> while<00:00:31.260> still

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
little bit of animation while still

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
little bit of animation while still
allowing<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.369> content<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.660> drive<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
allowing the content to really drive the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.370 
allowing the content to really drive the
slide<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.180> starting<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.600> here<00:00:36.660> with<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> simple

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
slide so starting out here with a simple

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
slide so starting out here with a simple
slide<00:00:37.739> single<00:00:38.219> slide<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> background

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
that's been placed inside the slide

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.940 
that's been placed inside the slide

characters so control D five times gives

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.170 
characters so control D five times gives
me<00:01:18.659> six<00:01:19.020> slides<00:01:19.259> total<00:01:19.860> come<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:20.820> over<00:01:21.060> here

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
those guys back in place and now I can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
those guys back in place and now I can
go<00:01:26.939> back<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.119> my<00:01:27.330> outline<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> I'm<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
go back to my outline and I'm going to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.910 
go back to my outline and I'm going to
rename<00:01:28.500> each<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.490> these<00:01:29.579> slides<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.439> each

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
rename each of these slides one for each

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.499 
rename each of these slides one for each
of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> characters<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.450> Allen<00:01:36.229> Carl<00:01:38.509> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
of the characters so Allen Carl and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
of the characters so Allen Carl and
again<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.110> don't<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.579> just

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
again I don't have to do this this just

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.850 
again I don't have to do this this just
makes<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.299> lot<00:01:42.450> easier<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.990> when<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> start

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
makes it a lot easier to when I start

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.499 
makes it a lot easier to when I start
applying<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:44.280> hyperlinks<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> actually<00:01:45.390> have

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
applying my hyperlinks to actually have

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.300 
applying my hyperlinks to actually have

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
now I can go ahead and just paste across

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.960 
now I can go ahead and just paste across
all<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.780> slides<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.950> benefit<00:02:27.370> for<00:02:27.730> me<00:02:27.850> to

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
all the slides and the benefit for me to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.670 
all the slides and the benefit for me to
doing<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:29.470> aren't<00:02:29.620> that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
doing this is that aren't that

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.710 
doing this is that aren't that
hyperlinks<00:02:30.340> multiple<00:02:30.700> times<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.570> also

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
hyperlinks multiple times and it also

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.660 
hyperlinks multiple times and it also
reduces<00:02:32.230> my<00:02:32.380> chance<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.040> know<00:02:33.130> making<00:02:33.550> a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
reduces my chance of you know making a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.920 
reduces my chance of you know making a
mistake<00:02:33.790> with<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.330> hyperlinks<00:02:34.840> and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
mistake with one of the hyperlinks and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.840 
mistake with one of the hyperlinks and
going<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.290> wrong<00:02:35.410> slide<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.610> at<00:02:36.700> this

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
going to the wrong slide so at this

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.320 
going to the wrong slide so at this
point<00:02:37.090> right<00:02:37.360> we've<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.880> slide<00:02:39.880> title

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
point right we've we have a slide title

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.690 
point right we've we have a slide title
that's<00:02:40.480> unique<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:41.560> also<00:02:41.739> have<00:02:42.100> hyperlinked

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
that's unique we also have hyperlinked

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.120 
that's unique we also have hyperlinked
characters<00:02:43.180> across<00:02:43.510> all<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.020> slides<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:44.650> now

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
characters across all the slides so now

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.640 
characters across all the slides so now
I<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.340> go<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.489> each<00:02:45.670> individual<00:02:46.390> slide<00:02:46.780> click

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
I can go to each individual slide click

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
going to add an animation for one slide

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.600 
going to add an animation for one slide
and<00:03:11.080> that's<00:03:11.140> for<00:03:11.410> whatever<00:03:11.680> characters<00:03:12.310> slide

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610

and that's for whatever characters slide
I'm<00:03:13.480> actually<00:03:13.720> linking<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.410> don't<00:03:14.500> want<00:03:14.650> to

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
I'm actually linking to I don't want to

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.009 
I'm actually linking to I don't want to
do<00:03:14.980> multiple<00:03:15.880> animations<00:03:16.209> on<00:03:16.510> one<00:03:16.690> slide

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
do multiple animations on one slide

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.449 
do multiple animations on one slide
otherwise<00:03:17.350> all<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> characters<00:03:18.130> would<00:03:18.280> go

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
otherwise all the characters would go

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.310 
otherwise all the characters would go
over<00:03:18.670> there<00:03:18.850> that's<00:03:19.390> not<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.690> effect<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.079> want

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
over there that's not the effect we want

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.930 
over there that's not the effect we want
so<00:03:20.530> when<00:03:20.709> we<00:03:20.829> did<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.100> for<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.310> hyperlinks

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
so when we did that for the hyperlinks

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.509 
so when we did that for the hyperlinks
that<00:03:22.000> was<00:03:22.299> okay<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.350> for<00:03:23.650> animation<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.370> want

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
that was okay but for animation I want

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.400 
that was okay but for animation I want
to<00:03:24.640> make<00:03:24.760> sure<00:03:24.790> I'm<00:03:25.030> only<00:03:25.180> animating<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.320> know

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
to make sure I'm only animating you know

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.380 
to make sure I'm only animating you know
Elly<00:03:26.650> for<00:03:26.950> Elly<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.280> go<00:03:27.670> Steve<00:03:27.880> for<00:03:28.150> Steve<00:03:28.360> and

Elly for Elly and go Steve for Steve and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.690 
Elly for Elly and go Steve for Steve and
just<00:03:29.079> really<00:03:29.320> one<00:03:29.500> slide<00:03:29.799> of<00:03:29.829> animation<00:03:30.489> per

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
just really one slide of animation per

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.789 
just really one slide of animation per
character<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.310> ignite<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:35.320> I'm<00:03:35.440> just<00:03:35.620> sort

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
character and I ignite and I'm just sort

so if I click Alan now the only thing to

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.960 
so if I click Alan now the only thing to
notice<00:04:23.620> right<00:04:23.650> here<00:04:23.800> right<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.700> clicked

notice right here right is I clicked

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.159 
notice right here right is I clicked
Alan<00:04:25.270> but<00:04:25.419> he<00:04:25.479> hasn't<00:04:25.630> mu

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
Alan but he hasn't mu

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.450 
Alan but he hasn't mu
and<00:04:26.289> that's<00:04:26.499> because<00:04:26.770> we<00:04:26.889> just<00:04:27.039> need<00:04:27.219> to<00:04:27.310> go

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
and that's because we just need to go

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.820 
and that's because we just need to go
into<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.909> sink<00:04:28.150> animations<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.110> adjust<00:04:29.499> when

into the sink animations and adjust when

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.350 
into the sink animations and adjust when
this<00:04:30.069> timing<00:04:30.520> comes<00:04:30.759> in<00:04:30.969> so<00:04:31.090> let's<00:04:31.210> go<00:04:31.330> back

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
this timing comes in so let's go back

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.689 
this timing comes in so let's go back
and<00:04:31.719> do<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.930> real<00:04:32.139> quick<00:04:32.349> so<00:04:33.280> we'll<00:04:33.520> click

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
and do that real quick so we'll click

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.149 
and do that real quick so we'll click
sync<00:04:34.150> animations<00:04:34.689> and<00:04:35.110> I'll<00:04:35.710> click<00:04:35.889> start

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159

characters so a really great way to

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.279 
characters so a really great way to
create<00:04:48.639> some<00:04:48.939> simple<00:04:49.240> scenarios<00:04:49.779> using<00:04:50.139> some

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
create some simple scenarios using some

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.409 
create some simple scenarios using some
of<00:04:50.319> the<00:04:50.439> basic<00:04:50.800> features<00:04:51.099> in<00:04:51.370> both<00:04:51.849> PowerPoint
