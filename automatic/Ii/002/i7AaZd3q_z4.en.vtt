00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.049 
upcoming release of Avengers age of
Ultron<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.540> me<00:00:36.750> thinking<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.980> recreating<00:00:38.670> an

Ultron got me thinking or recreating an

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.690 
Ultron got me thinking or recreating an
Ultron<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:40.379> answer<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.920> question<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.579> will

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
Ultron to answer that question we will

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.250 
Ultron to answer that question we will
first<00:00:41.910> need<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> define<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.660> artificial

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
first need to define what artificial

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
first need to define what artificial
intelligence<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> according<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.059> many

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
intelligence is according to many

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.810 
intelligence is according to many
textbooks<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> system<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> perceives

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
textbooks it is a system that perceives

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.090 
textbooks it is a system that perceives
its<00:00:48.059> environment<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.840> takes<00:00:49.350> actions<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
its environment and takes actions that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
its environment and takes actions that
maximize<00:00:50.670> its<00:00:50.879> chances<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.510> success<00:00:51.960> based<00:00:52.440> on

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
maximize its chances of success based on

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
maximize its chances of success based on
that<00:00:52.890> definition<00:00:53.520> humans<00:00:54.059> would<00:00:54.360> fall<00:00:54.660> under

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that definition humans would fall under

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
that definition humans would fall under
the<00:00:55.050> category<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.680> artificial<00:00:56.219> intelligence

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the category of artificial intelligence

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.110 
the category of artificial intelligence
well<00:00:57.320> most<00:00:58.320> humans<00:00:58.710> artificial<00:00:59.609> intelligence

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
well most humans artificial intelligence

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
well most humans artificial intelligence
is<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> theory<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.199> development<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is also the theory and development of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310 
is also the theory and development of
computer<00:01:02.460> systems<00:01:02.850> able<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> perform<00:01:03.690> tasks

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
computer systems able to perform tasks

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
computer systems able to perform tasks
that<00:01:04.530> normally<00:01:05.010> require<00:01:05.460> human<00:01:05.790> intelligence

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that normally require human intelligence

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.359 
that normally require human intelligence
this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.200> visual<00:01:07.740> perception

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
this is things like visual perception

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.880 
this is things like visual perception
speech<00:01:08.729> recognition<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.710> decision-making

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
speech recognition and decision-making

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
speech recognition and decision-making
so<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.490> summary<00:01:11.880> artificial<00:01:12.630> intelligence<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so in summary artificial intelligence is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.399 
so in summary artificial intelligence is
when<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> human<00:01:13.890> creates<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.700> robot<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.990> acts

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
when a human creates a robot that acts

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.730 
when a human creates a robot that acts
like<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.189> human<00:01:17.610> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.600> unfortunately<00:01:19.470> for

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
like a human kind of unfortunately for

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
like a human kind of unfortunately for
the<00:01:19.830> Avengers<00:01:20.070> Tony<00:01:20.549> created<00:01:21.000> an<00:01:21.119> artificial

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the Avengers Tony created an artificial

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.780 
the Avengers Tony created an artificial
intelligence<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.619> too<00:01:23.009> human-like

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
intelligence that was too human-like

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
intelligence that was too human-like
because<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> developed<00:01:25.080> some<00:01:25.409> human

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
because it developed some human

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.980 
because it developed some human
personality<00:01:26.640> traits<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> trait<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
personality traits like the trait to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.319 
personality traits like the trait to
completely<00:01:28.560> overreact<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> situation<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
completely overreact to a situation and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.240 
completely overreact to a situation and
her<00:01:30.420> bail<00:01:30.570> against<00:01:30.900> its<00:01:31.079> creators<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.890> Ultron

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
her bail against its creators so Ultron

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
her bail against its creators so Ultron
is<00:01:32.340> pretty<00:01:32.490> much<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> teenage<00:01:33.030> robot<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.960> our

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
is pretty much a teenage robot so is our

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
is pretty much a teenage robot so is our
civilization<00:01:34.979> close<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.520> creating<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
civilization close to creating and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.840 
civilization close to creating and
artificial<00:01:36.659> intelligence<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.439> Ultron<00:01:37.950> well

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
artificial intelligence like Ultron well

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
artificial intelligence like Ultron well
we<00:01:39.750> might<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.200> little<00:01:40.290> bit<00:01:40.740> closer<00:01:41.100> than<00:01:41.280> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
we might be a little bit closer than you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.080 
we might be a little bit closer than you
think

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
think

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.330 
think
let's<00:01:42.659> take<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> project<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> google

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
so if you were to take out your house

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.700 
so if you were to take out your house
key<00:02:25.240> right<00:02:25.420> now<00:02:25.600> take<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:25.990> picture<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.680> and

key right now take a picture of it and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.100 
key right now take a picture of it and
send<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.160> into<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.550> soin<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.360> would<00:02:28.900> be<00:02:29.050> able

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
to recognize it as a house key I know

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.510 
to recognize it as a house key I know
that<00:02:31.780> may<00:02:31.930> not<00:02:32.080> sound<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.800> impressive<00:02:32.950> right

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
that may not sound that impressive right

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.160 
that may not sound that impressive right
now<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:33.910> think<00:02:34.150> about<00:02:34.240> what<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.630> could<00:02:34.690> lead

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
now but think about what that could lead

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.380 
now but think about what that could lead
to<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.770> maybe<00:02:36.160> one<00:02:36.580> day<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.760> machine<00:02:37.180> could

upgrade and improve themselves so

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.370 
upgrade and improve themselves so
quickly<00:05:00.940> that<00:05:01.510> our<00:05:01.540> human<00:05:02.080> biological

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
quickly that our human biological

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.370 
quickly that our human biological
evolution<00:05:03.250> wouldn't<00:05:03.970> be<00:05:04.150> able<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.630> compete

evolution wouldn't be able to compete

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.380 
evolution wouldn't be able to compete
so<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:06.130> summary<00:05:06.550> we'd<00:05:06.850> be<00:05:07.000> pretty<00:05:07.180> much

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
so in summary we'd be pretty much

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.590 
so in summary we'd be pretty much
screwed<00:05:07.900> unless<00:05:08.680> we<00:05:09.160> had<00:05:09.340> something<00:05:09.670> like<00:05:09.850> the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
screwed unless we had something like the

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.240 
screwed unless we had something like the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
vision and for those of you that don't

vision and for those of you that don't
know<00:05:12.370> vision<00:05:12.760> is<00:05:12.970> pretty<00:05:13.270> much<00:05:13.510> a

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
know vision is pretty much a

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.810 
know vision is pretty much a

development<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.990> could<00:05:38.290> play<00:05:38.500> dumb<00:05:38.830> until<00:05:39.130> it

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
development it could play dumb until it

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.220 
development it could play dumb until it
comprehensive<00:05:39.640> environments<00:05:40.630> well<00:05:40.930> enough

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
comprehensive environments well enough

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.610 
comprehensive environments well enough
to<00:05:41.710> escape<00:05:42.220> it<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:42.670> outsmart<00:05:43.510> its<00:05:43.960> creators

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
to escape it and outsmart its creators

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.740 
to escape it and outsmart its creators
so<00:05:45.100> it<00:05:45.250> is<00:05:45.460> quite<00:05:45.850> possible<00:05:46.390> that<00:05:46.450> we've

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
so it is quite possible that we've

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.990 
so it is quite possible that we've
already<00:05:47.020> created<00:05:47.440> AI<00:05:47.860> that<00:05:48.220> is<00:05:48.250> smarter<00:05:48.850> than

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
already created AI that is smarter than

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.480 
already created AI that is smarter than
humans<00:05:49.270> but<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.140> might<00:05:50.350> just<00:05:50.380> be<00:05:50.710> playing<00:05:51.130> dumb

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
humans but it might just be playing dumb

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.150 
humans but it might just be playing dumb
until<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:51.940> gets<00:05:52.150> strong<00:05:52.600> enough<00:05:52.630> to<00:05:53.160> destroy

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
until it gets strong enough to destroy

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.730 
until it gets strong enough to destroy
