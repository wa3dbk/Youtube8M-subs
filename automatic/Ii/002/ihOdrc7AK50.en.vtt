speaking<00:05:02.590> there<00:05:02.980> are<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.190> few<00:05:03.490> flaws<00:05:03.880> with<00:05:04.660> the

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
speaking there are a few flaws with the

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.840 
speaking there are a few flaws with the
animation<00:05:05.440> where<00:05:05.830> they<00:05:06.010> take<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.250> few<00:05:06.550> still

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850

animation where they take a few still
images<00:05:07.420> and<00:05:07.480> post<00:05:07.870> them<00:05:08.080> over<00:05:08.350> a<00:05:08.380> few<00:05:08.590> dialogue

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
images and post them over a few dialogue

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.100 
images and post them over a few dialogue
scenes<00:05:09.430> but<00:05:09.700> they're<00:05:10.150> only<00:05:10.270> dialogue<00:05:10.840> scene

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
scenes but they're only dialogue scene

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.020 
scenes but they're only dialogue scene
so<00:05:11.290> it's<00:05:11.440> not<00:05:11.530> really<00:05:11.830> that<00:05:12.010> big<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.790> pet

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
so it's not really that big of a pet

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
some of the action scenes had a still

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.840 
some of the action scenes had a still
image<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:17.350> you've<00:05:17.830> heard<00:05:18.130> some<00:05:18.670> of<00:05:18.700> the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
image and you've heard some of the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.770 
image and you've heard some of the
fighting<00:05:19.120> going<00:05:19.450> on

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
fighting going on

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.530 
fighting going on
that<00:05:20.140> is<00:05:20.380> something<00:05:20.740> that's<00:05:20.920> more

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
that is something that's more

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.610 
that is something that's more
substantial<00:05:22.540> as<00:05:22.660> far<00:05:22.870> as<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.050> complaint<00:05:23.440> goes

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
substantial as far as the complaint goes

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.560 
substantial as far as the complaint goes
so<00:05:23.860> it's<00:05:24.190> not<00:05:24.340> really<00:05:24.640> that<00:05:24.670> big<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.360> deal

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
so it's not really that big of a deal

as<00:05:36.730> everyone<00:05:37.150> else<00:05:37.300> probably<00:05:37.540> is<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.140> opening

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
as everyone else probably is the opening

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.290 
as everyone else probably is the opening
theme<00:05:38.860> as<00:05:39.100> far<00:05:39.310> as<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.520> voice<00:05:39.669> acting<00:05:40.120> goes

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
the only flaws that I found in this

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.180 
the only flaws that I found in this
series<00:06:10.660> were<00:06:10.810> a<00:06:10.840> few<00:06:11.230> episodes<00:06:11.350> scattered

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
series were a few episodes scattered

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.800 
series were a few episodes scattered
throughout<00:06:12.490> that<00:06:12.910> focus<00:06:13.390> on<00:06:13.510> a<00:06:13.570> few

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
throughout that focus on a few

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.870 
throughout that focus on a few
characters<00:06:14.290> that<00:06:14.500> seem<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:14.980> be<00:06:15.100> irrelevant<00:06:15.520> to

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
characters that seem to be irrelevant to

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.150 
characters that seem to be irrelevant to
the<00:06:16.090> overall<00:06:16.480> plot<00:06:16.750> but<00:06:17.110> if<00:06:17.350> you<00:06:17.650> understand

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
the overall plot but if you understand

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.370 
the overall plot but if you understand
the<00:06:18.520> grand<00:06:18.910> scheme<00:06:19.270> of<00:06:19.330> things<00:06:19.480> the<00:06:20.050> major
