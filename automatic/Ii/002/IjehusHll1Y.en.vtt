used to it it is one of the bests part
one<00:00:21.949> of<00:00:22.009> the<00:00:22.099> fastest<00:00:22.429> that<00:00:22.490> I've<00:00:22.609> ever<00:00:22.730> gotten

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
one of the fastest that I've ever gotten

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.210 
one of the fastest that I've ever gotten
unfortunately<00:00:23.960> now<00:00:24.050> that<00:00:24.080> I<00:00:24.259> am<00:00:24.349> crippled<00:00:25.130> I

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
unfortunately now that I am crippled I

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.769 
unfortunately now that I am crippled I
can't<00:00:25.460> play<00:00:25.699> as<00:00:25.820> much<00:00:26.000> as<00:00:26.119> I<00:00:26.210> used<00:00:26.449> to<00:00:26.539> or<00:00:26.599> at

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
can't play as much as I used to or at

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.089 
can't play as much as I used to or at
least<00:00:26.929> as<00:00:27.050> fast<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.679> mouse<00:00:27.830> doesn't

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
least as fast and the mouse doesn't

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.070 
least as fast and the mouse doesn't
really<00:00:28.249> matter<00:00:28.550> but<00:00:28.820> before<00:00:29.240> when<00:00:29.929> I<00:00:29.960> was

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
really matter but before when I was

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.260 
really matter but before when I was
incredibly<00:00:30.380> sharp<00:00:30.650> and<00:00:30.829> quick<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.699> g9x<00:00:32.119> was

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
incredibly sharp and quick the g9x was

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.610 
incredibly sharp and quick the g9x was
actually<00:00:32.599> awesome<00:00:33.050> because<00:00:33.200> it<00:00:33.380> gives<00:00:33.530> you

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
actually awesome because it gives you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.700 
actually awesome because it gives you
that<00:00:33.740> little<00:00:33.950> bit<00:00:34.100> of<00:00:34.370> advantage<00:00:35.090> now<00:00:36.079> this<00:00:36.440> is

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
that little bit of advantage now this is

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.529 
that little bit of advantage now this is
a<00:00:36.770> new<00:00:37.039> sensor<00:00:37.370> goes<00:00:37.520> anywhere<00:00:37.670> from<00:00:37.789> 200<00:00:38.420> dpi

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
a new sensor goes anywhere from 200 dpi

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.979 
a new sensor goes anywhere from 200 dpi
to<00:00:39.010> 5,000<00:00:40.010> dpi<00:00:40.670> which<00:00:41.270> is<00:00:41.600> extremely

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
to 5,000 dpi which is extremely

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.180 
to 5,000 dpi which is extremely
impressive<00:00:42.140> but<00:00:42.559> not<00:00:42.590> a<00:00:42.800> lot<00:00:42.980> of<00:00:43.039> people

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
impressive but not a lot of people

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.790 
impressive but not a lot of people
really<00:00:43.280> going<00:00:43.489> above<00:00:43.609> 3<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.359> 4,000<00:00:44.840> dpi<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:45.289> you

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
really going above 3 to 4,000 dpi so you

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.750 
really going above 3 to 4,000 dpi so you
might<00:00:45.920> not<00:00:46.039> be<00:00:46.100> using<00:00:46.250> as<00:00:46.430> much<00:00:46.550> but

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
might not be using as much but

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.939 
might not be using as much but
everything<00:00:46.969> else<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.329> about<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:47.690> same

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
everything else is about the same

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.080 
everything else is about the same
everything<00:00:48.949> my<00:00:49.340> favorite<00:00:49.609> thing<00:00:49.699> about<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.969> G

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
everything my favorite thing about the G

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.420 
everything my favorite thing about the G
9<00:00:50.239> X<00:00:50.420> or<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.780> G<00:00:50.930> 9<00:00:51.109> is<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.980> is<00:00:52.129> very

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
9 X or the G 9 is that it is very

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.889 
9 X or the G 9 is that it is very
customizable<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.149> can<00:00:53.210> change<00:00:53.510> literally

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
customizable you can change literally

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.599 
customizable you can change literally
every<00:00:54.199> aspect<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.800> it<00:00:54.980> now<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:55.129> guys<00:00:55.309> already

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
every aspect of it now you guys already

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.369 
every aspect of it now you guys already
know<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:56.539> pretty<00:00:56.719> much<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:56.899> can<00:00:57.109> change

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
know that pretty much you can change

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.220 
know that pretty much you can change
your<00:00:57.949> shells<00:00:58.570> so<00:00:59.570> here's<00:00:59.750> what<00:00:59.870> it<00:00:59.899> looks<00:00:59.960> like

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
your shells so here's what it looks like

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.529 
your shells so here's what it looks like
with<00:01:00.920> nothing<00:01:01.100> on<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:01.640> this<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.390> regular

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
with nothing on and this is the regular

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.290 
with nothing on and this is the regular
shell<00:01:02.929> it's<00:01:03.170> called<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.410> precision<00:01:03.589> shell

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
shell it's called the precision shell

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.630 
shell it's called the precision shell
right<00:01:05.300> there<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.780> then<00:01:06.080> if<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.290> want<00:01:06.640> you

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
right there and then if you want you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
right there and then if you want you
have<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.900> wide<00:01:09.110> load<00:01:09.320> shell<00:01:10.090> right<00:01:11.090> there<00:01:11.330> so

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
have the wide load shell right there so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.760 
have the wide load shell right there so
you<00:01:11.720> can<00:01:11.900> see<00:01:12.080> there's<00:01:12.290> definitely<00:01:12.500> a

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
you can see there's definitely a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.800 
you can see there's definitely a
difference<00:01:13.160> between<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.300> two<00:01:14.480> one<00:01:14.660> is

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
difference between the two one is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.080 
difference between the two one is
thinner<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:15.470> one<00:01:15.620> has<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.740> big<00:01:16.250> thumb<00:01:16.820> rest

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
thinner this one has a big thumb rest

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.110 
thinner this one has a big thumb rest
right<00:01:17.960> there<00:01:18.020> where<00:01:18.440> you<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:18.650> pretty<00:01:18.770> much

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
right there where you can pretty much

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.880 
right there where you can pretty much
rest<00:01:20.120> your<00:01:20.300> thumb<00:01:20.360> very<00:01:20.900> nice<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.830> is

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
rest your thumb very nice and this is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.220 
rest your thumb very nice and this is
precision<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:22.580> I<00:01:22.910> actually<00:01:23.360> use<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.780> fat<00:01:23.990> grip

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
precision so I actually use the fat grip

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.050 
precision so I actually use the fat grip
but<00:01:24.680> lately<00:01:25.160> I'll<00:01:25.310> be<00:01:25.460> using<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.730> thin<00:01:25.880> grip

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
but lately I'll be using the thin grip

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.910 
but lately I'll be using the thin grip
because<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.540> my<00:01:26.630> injury<00:01:26.870> so<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:27.230> cool<00:01:27.440> now

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
because of my injury so it's cool now

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.430 
because of my injury so it's cool now
it's<00:01:28.070> very<00:01:28.370> non<00:01:28.850> ambidextrous<00:01:29.630> Mouse<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.230> if

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's very non ambidextrous Mouse so if

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.740 
it's very non ambidextrous Mouse so if
you<00:01:30.590> are<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.800> lefty<00:01:31.550> don't<00:01:32.240> even<00:01:32.450> think<00:01:32.690> about

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
you are a lefty don't even think about

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
you are a lefty don't even think about
it<00:01:33.050> you<00:01:33.530> will<00:01:33.710> not<00:01:34.550> like<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.240> but<00:01:35.960> if<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.530> are<00:01:36.560> a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
it you will not like it but if you are a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.200 
it you will not like it but if you are a
righty<00:01:37.070> everything<00:01:37.670> else<00:01:37.790> is<00:01:37.910> really<00:01:38.030> cool

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
righty everything else is really cool

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.730 
righty everything else is really cool
this<00:01:38.330> is<00:01:38.390> very<00:01:38.600> customizable<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:39.410> let's<00:01:39.590> start

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
this is very customizable so let's start

so that's plenty of weights and add a

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.130 
so that's plenty of weights and add a
lot<00:04:05.570> of<00:04:06.640> heft<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.940> your<00:04:08.300> mouse<00:04:08.480> let's<00:04:08.780> just<00:04:08.990> say

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
lot of heft to your mouse let's just say

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.170 
lot of heft to your mouse let's just say
and<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:09.950> changes<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.340> from<00:04:10.459> really<00:04:10.700> fast

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
and that changes it from really fast

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.340 
and that changes it from really fast
it's<00:04:11.420> lots<00:04:11.570> of<00:04:11.690> precision<00:04:12.080> I'll<00:04:12.170> talk<00:04:12.320> a

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
it's lots of precision I'll talk a

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.960 
it's lots of precision I'll talk a
little<00:04:12.530> bit<00:04:12.680> about<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:13.130> sensor<00:04:13.489> on<00:04:13.640> here<00:04:13.850> it's

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
little bit about the sensor on here it's

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.890 
little bit about the sensor on here it's
