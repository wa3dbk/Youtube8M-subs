00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.680
 it's about connecting a three-phase induction motor to the line 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.430
 Three-phase laboratory panels using direct start using a 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.990
 saves motor that is composed of real thermal and contact so that the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.990
 engine can start that stop from different points 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.619
 the circuit that we are going to perform is divided control circuit and yes pito of 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:24.960
 power 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.630
 The components of the control circuit are 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.140
 thermal reale whose function is to ensure circuit protection 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.670
 against overloads 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.510
 stop buttons united 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.690
 used to stop the engine from two different points 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.920
 It is normally closed 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 united marching pushbuttons 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.520
 used to start the engine from the points normally found 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.960
 open 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.880
 a contact of the magnetic fact the objective of this mechanism is to close the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.270
 normally open circuits since normally closed circuits 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.710
 by an election 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.750
 It is composed of 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.670
 a magnetothermic switch 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.770
 is a device capable of interrupting the electrical current of a circuit 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.990
 when it exceeds certain values 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.659
 Its function is to protect electrical circuits against 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.420
 short circuits and overloads 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 the magnetic effects piter micó of the electric current are based 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.010
 a three-phase contact 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.920
 whose function is the same as in the control circuit set or 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.350
 interrupting the flow of current 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.650
 a thermal relay 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.680
 this mechanism serves as an engine protection element 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.310
 its mission is to disconnect the circuit when the intensity consumed 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.030
 by the engine exceeded for a short time to that allowed by it 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.560
 preventing the cattle from burning 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.770
 if you connect a short thermal to contactors you get a motor guard 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 digital metro polti 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.910
 used to measure the potential difference between circuit points 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.570
 Ammeter is an instrument used to measure the current intensity 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.560
 that is circulating through an electrical circuit 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.420
 we go time after monophasic 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.600
 used to measure the electrical power hello supply rate of 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 electric power circuit 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.380
 the main objective of the contact this year as magnetic they are activated 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.319
 close any of the travel buttons 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.469
 ferrando and another step of current 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.269
 the current may flow through this step until it is decided to stop the beach before 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.079
 the stop switches 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.029
 what you want to achieve with the power circuit is to take measurements 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.090
 of voltage intensity if power passing through the circuit at the time of 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:26.389
 the measurement 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.599
 For this, a voltmeter is placed between two phases, one perimeter in one phase and 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.989
 the bat and meters 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.760
 after all this is provided current through the switch 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.760
 main motor that connect triangle 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.489
 to see to believe both races 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.529
 for tomorrow in mérida 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.279
 home 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.399
 in the morning 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.219
 Canada 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.219
 win and win 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:01.259
