Parrot TV

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.660
Parrot smaller than sparrow

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.900
Amongst parrots there is a great variety.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.140
We have huge Hyacinth macaws over 1-meter-long

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.620
and small parrotslets which fit in our hand.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.060
The parrot I am holding now is called the Pacific parrotlet

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.900
This tiny parrot, native to South America,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.900
is very popular in Polish aviculture.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.900
Numerous captive bred colour mutations of these birds

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900
provide proof of their popularity

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900
and are a sign that they adopted well to Polish conditions.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.900
In their natural habitat

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.900
Pacific parrotlets are green.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.140
The parrotlet I am now holding in my hand is the blue mutation.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.260
Other color mutations in aviculture

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.780
include lutino, white and fallow.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.800
The smallest parrot species in the world

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.900
is the 8-10 cm long pygmy parrot.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Coming back to our topic, the Polish name of the parrotlet

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.100
which seems to relate to a hypocoristic form of a sparrow

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.900
has probably originated from its physical similarity to the common sparrow.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.900
The  common sparrow is 14-15 cm long

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.900
and its shape resembles the shape of the parrotlet.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.900
Parrotlets are 11-15 cm long.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
The Pacific parrotlet I am holding now in my hand

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.900
is usually 13 cm long.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.900
Despite its size,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.900
a parrotlet is usually a feisty bird full of character,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.900
but it does not tolerate strange animals

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.460
or humans in its company.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.300
Parrotlets become emotionally attached to their guardians

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.900
and don't do well with solitude.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.900
Keeping a parrotlet is not suitable for someone

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.900
who spends most of his day out of the house,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.580
leaving the parrotlet unattended.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.900
When we choose a parrotlet as our companion

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
we have to bear in mind that it is best to keep a pair of parrotlets

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
or otherwise spend a lot of time with a single parrotlet

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
When we keep a pair of parrotlets

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
they will socialize mostly with each other,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.900
not bonding strongly with their guardian.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.040
Hand-reared birds,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.840
as this parrot sitting on my hand,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.240
make splendid companions.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.660
Parrotlets learn to speak words

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.900
and even short sentences,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.900
sounding them repeatedly

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.900
They make splendid companions for children

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900
Due to their small size,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.400
parrotlets require

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.900
comparatively small cages

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900
and little space at home.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.900
We must enable them

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.400
to stay outside the cage

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.900
and  have direct contact with their guardians.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.560
They will reward us with affection

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.360
and attachment

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.400
and may contribute a lot

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.900
to making our daily life pleasant.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.180
If you decide to keep at home

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.820
such a small parrot with a great heart,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.900
we invite you to our Parrot Shop in Warsaw.
