00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.040
 only thing they have to do is download 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.040
 the file 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.490
 once downloaded we go to folder where 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.790
 they downloaded it 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.950
 and decompress it, I have it in 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.720
 that says the plugin plugin 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.860

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.790
 extract it where you like me 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.790
 I'm going to do on my desk 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.299
 once done is to observe it in this 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.300
 folder will contain these three 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.350
 records 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.439
 these three files are 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.540
 what will make our wiggins 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.180
 boil and that in this one offers increases 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.610
 its good volume we connect our pcp 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.330
 to our computer 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.000
 and I have it connected 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.580
 let's go to our team 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.980
 as you will see here is and psp I already have 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.290
 my plugin folder if you do not 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.320
 they have this folder of those plugins 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.430
 can create the ones that form exactly 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 as he says he creates it they will see it as run 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.860
 I have many plugins 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.189
 what they have to do is copy this 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.189
 binder 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.190
 do not 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:09.630
 along with this other all the files 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.620
 we are going to hit you prx is the most 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.580
 important copy it in the ips efe and already 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.150
 I'm not going to copy it because I already have it 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.010
 in the folder 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.010
 in this folder we have what is game 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.310
 we open it 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.519
 this cereal is the one that we are going to use 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.519
 let's copy 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.640
 and we paste it into our game folder of 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.290
 our plugins as I say yes no 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 they have the folder copying just as 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.209
 everything is there but if they already have it they are going to 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.319
 game the open paste and save and no longer what 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.319
 I keep it because I have already done it 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.210
 fat woman 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.520
 same in this letter of this h 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.540
 copy 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.939
 and instead of hitting 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.939
 your pegs we hope to save 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:19.580
 that would be all in our 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:23.150
 in this pc or what they are occupying 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.060
 we closed the pst window and now we 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.300
 we give our p esp to activate the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.300
 draft 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.430
 Y 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:52.520
 I inform you so that this plugin 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.610
 functions ups pdl is checked if your 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.980
 psp is not checked can enter my 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.970
 channel there I have a tutorial how 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.980
 hack bs.f. 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.440
 if you already have the you 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.840
 hacked what they have to do is the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.680
 final cl button and this menu will disappear 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.270
 we will not receive less and we will leave 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.220
 to plugins 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.890
 in our plugins 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.470
 but well that we just installed 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:28.200
 esport as real is in bsh 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.050
 bsh and we also have them in game what 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.120
 we have to see is that they are in water if 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.030
 is in development 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.919
 we change it equally here 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.740
 above 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.889
 sh should be the same if it's like this 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:49.800
 we change to this state we hope in 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:53.569
 back and only we give in reset bsh 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.569
 our psp is going to start 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.930
 rock 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:09.689
 and automatically our psp will increase 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.919
 its volume 30% more 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:17.309
 and I hope it worked for them 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.469
