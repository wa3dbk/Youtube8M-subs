fondant you can cut another one out

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.359 
fondant you can cut another one out
afterwards<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.050> I'm<00:02:09.739> just<00:02:09.920> going<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.100> smooth

out<00:02:10.610> all<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.970> my<00:02:11.120> edges<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:11.660> I<00:02:11.690> don't<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:12.170> any

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
out all of my edges so I don't have any

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.960 
out all of my edges so I don't have any
I<00:02:12.709> know<00:02:13.280> rough<00:02:13.850> edges<00:02:14.739> but<00:02:15.739> nice<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.160> smooth<00:02:16.580> I

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
I know rough edges but nice and smooth I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.910 
I know rough edges but nice and smooth I
just<00:02:17.330> added<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.720> little<00:02:17.750> water<00:02:18.019> onto<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.680> back

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
globe while I'm doing this to make sure

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.640 
globe while I'm doing this to make sure
I'm<00:02:26.420> putting<00:02:26.720> all<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.989> continents<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
I'm putting all the continents in the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.970 
I'm putting all the continents in the
right<00:02:27.800> places<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:29.060> don't<00:02:29.269> have<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.780> know

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
right places and I don't have you know

random things where they're not supposed

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.500 
random things where they're not supposed
to<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.459> can<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.760> stick<00:02:34.970> those<00:02:35.120> all<00:02:35.330> on

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
to be so you can just stick those all on

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:45.070 
to be so you can just stick those all on
using<00:02:35.989> water

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.840

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
and once you're done that you can make

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.180 
and once you're done that you can make
your<00:02:47.000> plane<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:48.260> I'm<00:02:48.470> just<00:02:48.620> going<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.800> use<00:02:48.980> some

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
your plane so I'm just going to use some

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.860 
your plane so I'm just going to use some
white<00:02:49.220> fondant<00:02:49.700> for<00:02:50.120> my<00:02:50.210> plane<00:02:50.450> I'm<00:02:50.690> going<00:02:50.780> to

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
white fondant for my plane I'm going to

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.050 
white fondant for my plane I'm going to
roll<00:02:51.020> out<00:02:51.140> this<00:02:51.290> little<00:02:51.650> log<00:02:51.890> pinch<00:02:52.340> both<00:02:52.610> ends

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
roll out this little log pinch both ends

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.210 
roll out this little log pinch both ends
and<00:02:53.180> then<00:02:53.360> push<00:02:53.600> one<00:02:53.990> end<00:02:54.020> down<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.980> that's

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and then push one end down and that's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.600 
and then push one end down and that's
going<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.460> be<00:02:55.580> for<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.820> windshield<00:02:57.370> now<00:02:58.370> for

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
going to be for the windshield now for

the wings I'm actually going to roll out
some<00:03:00.710> fondant<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.850> that's<00:03:02.030> relatively<00:03:02.690> thin

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
some fondant so that's relatively thin

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.730 
some fondant so that's relatively thin
for<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.180> big<00:03:05.390> wing<00:03:05.630> I'm<00:03:05.900> going<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.290> cut<00:03:06.470> out<00:03:06.710> a

the corners and set that aside for the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.030 
the corners and set that aside for the
