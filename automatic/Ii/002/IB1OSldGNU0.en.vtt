00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.730
 so that such friends of pÃ©rez kill or 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.669
 hurt we bring a hangout of what is the 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.759
 motorola x a team really that 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.919
 falls in love as I said by his design by 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.050
 your cameras by the software that have 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.080
 included here in this new vessel 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.490
 motorola and google logo for 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.560
 start you have to talk about the team the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.070
 computer has a dual-core processor 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.680
 has a 4.7 amoled screen is 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.460
 quite as for the hand is thin 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.019
 that we could give it a point against 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.089
 so they are lending us motorola 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.460
 it just seems like it's just going to take the 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.949
 version of 16 gigas that for many 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.170
 do that one point as I always say 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.239
 decline because it's going to make us doubt that 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.460
 we want a little more because you can 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.339
 demand more this equipment as you can see 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.469
 I want to show you how it works 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.850
 the whole camera rotate twice we are going to 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.639
 to be able to enter the camera that is a 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.879
 10 megapixel camera that has a 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:02.739
 a rather big peculiarity is that 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.620
 when taking the photo we are going to have a 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.909
 better contrast with luminosity is 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.189
 pretty fluid 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.530
 what point do I like in this case I 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.869
 I'm not a fan of android but I 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.869
 I like I have a pure team with 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.729
 pure android and the x motorola has it 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:24.039
 has a android 4.2 coming series 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.170
 li ning new custom or comes 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.939
 completely pure is not like 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.670
 earlier that we would have some things 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.469
 of motorola this time no longer the agreement 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.929
 with google or say the purchase with google 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.770
 is affecting there but apart it has 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:42.179
 special qualities for being from google 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.179
 among them is that the help to show 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.759
 ok google now 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.829
 how much is 4x4 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.090
 as you could see it has always the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.130
 bag sensor 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.470
 tim I hope you liked this 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.390
 cannes even from the motorola and that no longer 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.489
 lend to be able to extract the video 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.150
