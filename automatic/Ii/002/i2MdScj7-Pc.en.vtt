00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.540
 half summerload you are here to visit 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 in the zoo basel around the australian 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 to train freshwater crocodiles 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.630
 They've been here for over a week 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.410
 Did you train with them? 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.100
 crocodiles 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 we just trained that 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.880
 crocodiles on the day follow one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.949
 aim for a signal because of that 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.200
 have attached a bar of nothing 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.660
 other like a tape on one 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.780
 bamboo stick a yellow tape around 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 this tape should follow the tape 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.329
 should be this glue when touching 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.219
 caressed 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.430
 that means we paint with this stock 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.980
 over the whole day like the snout and then 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.780
 get a reward 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.199
 the meaning and purpose of the whole story 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.500
 is 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 they should lose the shy but before 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.190
 the day you should know you can 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080
 there she is supposed to get there 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.170
 something 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.060
 they should touch that we want them 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.850
 also touch in the future 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.869
 even at others without them 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.759
 to be afraid of that, that is if 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.070
 Keep this stick in the water or 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.640
 ashore and the crocodiles the same 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.860
 see signal then they wanted that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.220
 she is connected with the call of the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 called in future it will at some point so 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.829
 be that only calls and then 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.229
 without days the crocodile doing what you can 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.840
 they want to get where they are 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.090
 you want to have and how did you do that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 Crocodiles motivated with something too 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.320
 eat food for children 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.810
 hours of fish actually extremely good 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.479
 because he is not so much first 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.649
 rich is obviously eating 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.520
 but also heat and when we are four 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.810
 training sessions a day then do 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.759
 is that a lot of tilt for you 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.659
 there comes together who should get 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.009
 and he should become important to her as it is 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.320
 because the training went with the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.740
 basler crocodiles 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.020
 it was difficult 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.990
 but that was expected, it still has 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.960
 nobody so far a group of fresh water 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.380
 crocodiles specifically trains this at first 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.810
 times 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.120
 so it was a nice task 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.010
 that's all very social living 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.720
 crocodile species in larger numbers 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.090
 sometimes in very very small waters 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.550
 living in australia during the dry season 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.650
 are the summarized and then have to 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.620
 They got away well and got along well with each other 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.690
 get by 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.760
 but that also means crocodiles 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.120
 social life then they opened up a lot 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.330
 the body language their neighbors and us 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.800
 have a dominant man in here 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.740
 and he shows very clearly that he is the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.390
 is boss and if that is the target 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.780
 approaching then dares no other 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.000
 Crocodile also only near the day 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.890
 and that was the problem from the start 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.770
 and besides, he showed us that he 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.910
 that's what we tried out of the 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.100
 to hunt the plant 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.020
 already on the first day you have it with you 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.820
 a beginning okay but managed yes 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.980
 Of course we have that with the 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.220
 Very good with the second person 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.050
 who is much more curious 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.560
 and now needs our of 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.630
 student is and interestingly that 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.210
 but I have that elsewhere too 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.580
 already attained the other group 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.330
 we are now very close to what we do 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.180
 with this a human and you learn 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.600
 that's good obviously because of that 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.760
 gets something complex around 7 now 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.960
 already set first successes that 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.150
 they follow the target 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.430
 What is the withdrawal of what you want 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.220
 you reach the end goal that lasts 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.840
 the end goal is still a long time 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.830
 that me the crocodiles get as far 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.150
 that they go in a box at once 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.130
 in a box either 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.570
 transport from one place to another 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.790
 going or in a box in the 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.410
 Veterinarians can treat them 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.650
 because if a crocodile is an injury 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.109
 or should get an injection or 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.470
 I also have a blood sample 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.989
 should 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.350
 then the goal of the possible is without 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.280
 an anesthetic 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.560
 to perform and above all things without 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.780
 all the stress of having a group 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.190
 connected to the fixing of the crocodile 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.100
 We do not want to do all that 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.600
 but we want to be completely relaxed in 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.920
 let the box march and then 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.550
 Do we want to do what is done? 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.720
 now have to see the moment you still 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.330
 here as a coach 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.680
 But you will be leaving at the end of the week 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.450
 training will continue 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.490
 is it difficult if after that 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.820
 Animal keeper from zoo basel with the animals 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.990
 No no hard at all 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.180
 that does not really matter 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.610
 indicated I am surrounded thereby 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.410
 instructions few tips i have that in 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.690
 the first two days myself and made 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.930
 then it makes 6 material 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.480
 I'm very interested in this very much 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.120
 enthusiastic and I am firmly on that 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.560
 conviction that this is our success 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.740
 In addition, I'm not out 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.740
 of the world
