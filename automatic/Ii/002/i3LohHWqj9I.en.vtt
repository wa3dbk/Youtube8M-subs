00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
these are the spaces in between our

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.550 
these are the spaces in between our
single<00:02:31.790> crochets<00:02:32.239> in<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.510> previous<00:02:32.989> row<00:02:35.560> okay

start<00:02:41.150> our<00:02:41.450> repeat<00:02:41.930> by<00:02:42.200> doing<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.070> single

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
start our repeat by doing a single

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.699 
start our repeat by doing a single
crochet<00:02:43.550> two<00:02:44.000> together<00:02:44.200> we'll<00:02:45.200> insert<00:02:45.650> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
crochet two together we'll insert the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.550 
crochet two together we'll insert the
hook<00:02:46.040> into<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.670> same<00:02:47.920> space<00:02:48.920> as<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.430> previous

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
hook into the same space as the previous

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.320 
hook into the same space as the previous
single<00:02:51.560> crochet<00:02:51.590> two<00:02:51.860> together<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:53.030> last

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
single crochet two together so this last

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.610 
single crochet two together so this last
one<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.690> did<00:02:53.989> we're<00:02:54.140> going<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.320> insert

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
one we just did we're going to insert

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.070 
one we just did we're going to insert
that<00:02:54.680> again<00:02:55.220> yarn<00:02:56.150> over<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.480> draw<00:02:56.630> through

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
that again yarn over and draw through

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.370 
that again yarn over and draw through
then<00:02:57.500> we'll<00:02:57.620> go<00:02:57.709> into<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.040> next<00:02:58.160> chain<00:02:59.150> space

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
then we'll go into the next chain space

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.470 
then we'll go into the next chain space
yarn<00:03:00.380> over<00:03:00.709> draw<00:03:00.739> through<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.550> then<00:03:02.300> we<00:03:02.450> will

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
yarn over draw through and then we will

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.449 
yarn over draw through and then we will
yarn<00:03:02.870> over<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.200> draw<00:03:03.470> through<00:03:03.680> all<00:03:04.070> three

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
yarn over and draw through all three

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.430 
yarn over and draw through all three
loops<00:03:04.640> together<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:05.989> we're<00:03:06.140> kind<00:03:06.320> of

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
loops together so we're kind of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.090 
loops together so we're kind of
overlapping<00:03:07.130> our<00:03:08.090> stitches<00:03:08.570> as<00:03:08.780> we<00:03:09.230> go<00:03:09.410> okay

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
overlapping our stitches as we go okay

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.690 
overlapping our stitches as we go okay
and<00:03:10.340> then<00:03:10.489> we'll<00:03:10.670> chain<00:03:10.940> one<00:03:11.209> again<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.890> we'll

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
and then we'll chain one again and we'll

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.830 
and then we'll chain one again and we'll
repeat<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.620> all<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.100> way<00:03:16.220> across<00:03:16.610> until<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
repeat this all the way across until the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.490 
repeat this all the way across until the
last<00:03:18.290> stitch<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.580> our<00:03:20.150> row<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.989> when<00:03:24.230> we<00:03:24.350> reach
