guide<00:00:08.879> on<00:00:09.210> how<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.420> flash<00:00:09.809> over<00:00:10.260> f1<00:00:11.299> innovation

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
guide on how to flash over f1 innovation

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.180 
guide on how to flash over f1 innovation
v10<00:00:12.780> by<00:00:13.440> far<00:00:13.830> yab<00:00:14.129> over<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.670> XDA<00:00:14.900> so<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.440> flashed

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
v10 by far yab over on XDA so I flashed

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.330 
v10 by far yab over on XDA so I flashed
over<00:00:17.730> stock<00:00:18.060> JV<00:00:18.539> q<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.199> semaphore<00:00:19.890> kernel

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
over stock JV q with semaphore kernel

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.800 
over stock JV q with semaphore kernel
and<00:00:20.690> so<00:00:21.690> I'm<00:00:21.870> on<00:00:22.020> JV<00:00:22.380> q<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:23.330> semaphore<00:00:24.330> jvr

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and so I'm on JV q with semaphore jvr

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.920 
and so I'm on JV q with semaphore jvr
1.6<00:00:25.620> if<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.280> want<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> guide<00:00:26.700> on<00:00:26.850> that<00:00:27.090> it'll

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
check that out so what we're going to do

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
check that out so what we're going to do
now<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.009> put<00:00:33.020> fire<00:00:34.020> ABS<00:00:34.350> rum<00:00:35.090> in<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.660> internal

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
now is put fire ABS rum in the internal

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.710 
now is put fire ABS rum in the internal
SD<00:00:37.710> card<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.220> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.460> see<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.880> enable<00:00:39.420> USB

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
SD card so as you can see you enable USB

it<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.810> computer<00:00:46.670> just<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.790> my<00:00:47.970> keyboard

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.690 

just<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.450> up<00:00:54.630> to<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.200> computer<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.579> can

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
just go up to the computer so you can

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.789 
just go up to the computer so you can
see<00:00:59.880> there's<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.800> f10<00:01:01.800> wipe<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.559> there's<00:01:04.710> my

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
see there's the f10 wipe and there's my

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.530 
see there's the f10 wipe and there's my
JV<00:01:05.100> q<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.399> semaphore<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.149> had<00:01:06.329> right

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
JV q and semaphore that I had right

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.449 
JV q and semaphore that I had right
there<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.469> we're<00:01:07.859> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.039> go<00:01:08.130> into<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:08.459 
there so we're going to go into the

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:14.419 
there so we're going to go into the
internal<00:01:08.729> sd<00:01:09.090> card<00:01:10.549> there<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.819> and<00:01:13.069> copy<00:01:14.069> in

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
internal sd card there we go and copy in

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.449 
internal sd card there we go and copy in
there<00:01:15.079> you<00:01:16.079> can<00:01:16.170> also<00:01:16.289> wiped<00:01:16.679> internal<00:01:17.219> sd

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
there you can also wiped internal sd

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.199 
there you can also wiped internal sd
card<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.329> desired<00:01:19.369> before<00:01:20.369> flashing<00:01:20.939> over

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.209 
card if so desired before flashing over

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:25.399 
card if so desired before flashing over
the<00:01:21.420> wrong<00:01:22.009> this<00:01:23.009> will<00:01:23.189> ensure<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:24.109> clean<00:01:25.109> air

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the wrong this will ensure a clean air

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.370 
the wrong this will ensure a clean air

in<00:01:31.189> recovery<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.429> we're<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.849> to<00:01:32.909> delete

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
in recovery is we're going to delete

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
dalvik cache as well so that we get a

nice<00:01:41.609> clean<00:01:41.789> install<00:01:42.209> and<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> wipe

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:43.529 
nice clean install and we get a wipe

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.769 
nice clean install and we get a wipe
also<00:01:44.369> make<00:01:44.549> sure<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.999> you<00:01:45.179> are<00:01:45.329> coming<00:01:45.749> from

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:45.779 
also make sure if you are coming from

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:47.690 
also make sure if you are coming from
another<00:01:46.139> room<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.859> example<00:01:47.279> I<00:01:47.459> don't<00:01:47.609> know

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
another room for example I don't know

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.339 
another room for example I don't know
during<00:01:48.299> darkies<00:01:48.659> wrong<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:48.990> anything<00:01:49.229> like

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
during darkies wrong way anything like

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:52.069 
during darkies wrong way anything like
that<00:01:49.380> make<00:01:50.369> sure<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.639> disable<00:01:51.119> lagfix<00:01:51.270> before

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that make sure you disable lagfix before

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.789 
that make sure you disable lagfix before
you<00:01:52.380> flash<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.669> you<00:01:53.819> can<00:01:53.969> see<00:01:54.090> i'm<00:01:54.209> on<00:01:54.359> stock

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
you flash as you can see i'm on stock

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.999 
you flash as you can see i'm on stock
rom<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.849> doesn't<00:01:57.179> really<00:01:57.299> matter<00:01:57.889> and<00:01:58.889> i

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
rom so it doesn't really matter and i

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.709 
rom so it doesn't really matter and i
think<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.639> good<00:01:59.909> thing<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.270> ensure<00:02:00.569> is<00:02:00.689> that

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
think a good thing to ensure is that

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.209 
think a good thing to ensure is that
you're<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> hundred<00:02:01.289> percent<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.130> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you're a hundred percent so that you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.949 
you're a hundred percent so that you
don't<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.639> do<00:02:02.729> battery<00:02:03.119> calibration<00:02:03.299> or

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
don't have to do battery calibration or

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.069 
don't have to do battery calibration or
anything<00:02:04.679> like<00:02:04.739> that<00:02:04.889> so<00:02:05.729> right<00:02:06.569> so<00:02:06.779> now<00:02:06.929> we're

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
anything like that so right so now we're

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.870 
anything like that so right so now we're
going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.319> into<00:02:07.799> recovery<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.580> i<00:02:08.640> want<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
going to go into recovery so i want to

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.400 
going to go into recovery so i want to
power<00:02:09.060> off<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> phone<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.899> you've<00:02:10.380> got

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
power off the phone if you've got

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.130 
power off the phone if you've got
extended<00:02:11.270> power<00:02:12.270> menu<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:13.020> go

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
extended power menu then just go

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.330 
extended power menu then just go
straight<00:02:13.470> into<00:02:13.590> recovery<00:02:14.100> that's<00:02:14.280> fine

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
straight into recovery that's fine

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.339 
straight into recovery that's fine
but<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.700> said<00:02:16.120> I'm<00:02:16.269> on<00:02:16.450> stock<00:02:17.190> but<00:02:18.190> I've<00:02:18.430> got<00:02:18.670> a

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
to do is wipe data/factory reset press

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.050 
to do is wipe data/factory reset press
that<00:02:37.870> there<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:38.650> go<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.430> then<00:02:39.819> we're<00:02:39.910> going<00:02:40.000> to

that there we go and then we're going to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.610 
that there we go and then we're going to
wipe<00:02:40.269> cache<00:02:40.569> partition<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:44.080> then<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.379> go<00:02:44.590> to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
wipe cache partition and then we go to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.800 
wipe cache partition and then we go to
