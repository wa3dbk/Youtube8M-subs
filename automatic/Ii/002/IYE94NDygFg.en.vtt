anything where we were doing something a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.700 
anything where we were doing something a
little<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.079> ordinary<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.440> thought

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
his thing and also a painter and then I

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.080 
his thing and also a painter and then I
think<00:05:03.450> we<00:05:03.630> will<00:05:03.780> be<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.169> wrap<00:05:04.500> we<00:05:05.220> wanted<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.640> use

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
think we will be a wrap we wanted to use

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.850 
think we will be a wrap we wanted to use
real<00:05:06.450> people<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.200> show<00:05:08.660> what<00:05:09.660> we<00:05:09.810> do<00:05:10.080> from<00:05:10.560> a

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
real people and show what we do from a

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.090 
real people and show what we do from a
different<00:05:11.700> angle<00:05:11.820> something<00:05:12.479> that<00:05:12.660> maybe

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
different angle something that maybe

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.520 
different angle something that maybe
hasn't<00:05:14.100> been<00:05:14.460> shot<00:05:15.330> before<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:15.900> I<00:05:16.169> guess<00:05:16.350> the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
hasn't been shot before and I guess the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.560 
hasn't been shot before and I guess the
building<00:05:16.919> industry<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.880> that's<00:05:18.030> why<00:05:18.270> we've

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
building industry and that's why we've

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.779 
building industry and that's why we've
been<00:05:18.840> mounting<00:05:19.830> cameras<00:05:20.250> two<00:05:20.460> different

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
been mounting cameras two different

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.670 
been mounting cameras two different
things<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.450> trying<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:21.840> get<00:05:22.020> different

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
things and just trying to get different

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.640 
things and just trying to get different
types<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.669> shots<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:24.210> show<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:24.930> building

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
types of shots to show the building

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.460 
types of shots to show the building
process<00:05:26.190> from<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:27.330> guess<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.810> more<00:05:28.050> intimate

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
process from I guess a more intimate

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.790 
process from I guess a more intimate
angle<00:05:29.039> what<00:05:29.250> we<00:05:29.400> were<00:05:29.580> doing<00:05:30.510> was<00:05:30.750> working<00:05:31.680> on
