00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
and that's really hard but this helps it

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.630 
and that's really hard but this helps it
just<00:01:52.969> from<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.420> itself<00:01:54.159> deciding<00:01:55.159> not<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.369> do

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
just from it itself deciding not to do

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
just from it itself deciding not to do
that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.179
