00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.900
 hi everyone i hope you go 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.580
 well we're here today for a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 new video is today we're going to get 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.050
 find for a prediction of cards 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 of fifa 16 ultimate team so I explain 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.900
 quickly made the principle for those who do not 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.609
 do not know it's very simple I 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.410
 Just give my opinion on 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.140
 the cards that I think the players 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.150
 will have refused 16 so of course nothing 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.250
 official it's really my personal opinion 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 to me so I give according to 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.899
 seasons that players made in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.460
 club and in selection so for this 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.590
 first episode I decided to choose 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.270
 four players which player I like 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.760
 although we have a good season 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 so if it's kind of like fred hotyat not 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.520
 of problem so do not hesitate in the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.350
 comments to offer me ideas of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.820
 players and that's it if I see that at 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.410
 pleyben will you do other episodes ya 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.180
 no problem I had already proposed 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.010
 last year we are waiting in fifa 15 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.989
 we do not believe that I had made four 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.449
 episodes it had a lot of fun so 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.059
 here we will start immediately this 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.979
 episode with the first player so the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.409
 first player is kevin de bruyne 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.650
 the Belgian wolfsburg player who made 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.450
 a very, very good season with his club 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.159
 so I decided to put a little more 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.560
 of 11 general stages so we go mostly 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.450
 to look at the general stage after 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.810
 stats speed shot passes etc 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.009
 it's really saying is secondary 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.509
 this is the story of giving an opinion 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.110
 but it's mostly the general stage 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.299
 we are going to look 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.369
 so see June +2 at Kevin Bruyne 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.290
 for fifa 16 because here he has done 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.920
 a very very good season at the club so 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.700
 I will mention a few how 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.770
 say 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.320
 a few stats that he realized 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 last season so he finished 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.430
 second of the championship with his club in 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.590
 bundesliga the lady of finished second 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.060
 just behind the bayern munich 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.520
 so then he finished better 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.560
 decisive passer of the championship with 20 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 passes he also finished the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.430
 championship with ten goals on the clock 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.259
 so moc point here are twenty passes of 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.360
 ten goals in the league is not bad 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.860
 everything he is in total on the season he has 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.159
 makes 58 matches in all competitions 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.450
 confused 18 goals 29 assists 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.220
 so he's an excellent passer 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.759
 so he won the cup of germany 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.640
 also with his club 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.040
 he scored a goal also in the final after 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.069
 here I am not going I will not tell them 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.110
 technical gestures the stars gesture 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.390
 technical forgiveness and bad foot so I 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.939
 go ubc I know that on fifa this is 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.500
 on fifa 15 he had the villa he has 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.180
 four-star technical gesture and 5 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.010
 bad foot star I think about 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.569
 fifa it will be the same it will be 5 stars 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.489
 dead foot to tetouan two techniques 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.170
 but today it is really I 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.150
 tell you this is the general stage that we are going 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.980
 watch especially so here are two brunettes 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.329
 I put him a + 2s for me it would be 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.170
 deserved because he really did a 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.090
 very beautiful season 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.980
 so the second player even 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.269
 can straws the new player from 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.340
 Manchester United 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.920
 so here is a very very good player very 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.599
 promising and here we hear more 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.700
 besides talk because here it is 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.180
 good performances in clubs and 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.310
 selection 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.659
 so even if it 's not guy larÃ©e 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.930
 I like two more as you can 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.019
 to see him 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.069
 here we go to 80 that would be it 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.079
 would be interesting to have a map 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.920
 like that in bp next year seen 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.480
 he is in manchester 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.069
 here with a little map like that at 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.549
 80 you see that would really be 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.590
 interesting 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.859
 so even if it's not he won 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.569
 the championship with the psv eindhoven 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.510
 so then he finishes top scorer 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.269
 of the championship with 22 goals also took 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.609
 finishes 12th European scorer 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.169
 with 28 goals in 40 matches 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.139
 so here are the scorers 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.840
 Europeans it's this ranking of all 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.400
 European championships 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.220
 all together and the best scorers 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.680
 go of course at the top of these ska 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.090
 mandate ronaldo messi but even worse for 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.190
 straws he finishes at the 12th position 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.079
 so ski and that's the 12th best 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.319
 European scorer what is really not 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.720
 wrong 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.879
 so that's why I put a + 2 and 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.620
 I think it would be deserved and that's it 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.019
 that would really be at least he will have 1 80 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.760
 I think he'll pass the bar of 80 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.709
 so that's for memphis straws on 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.519
 third player is alexander 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.629
 Lacazette 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.790
 this is the French of the Olympic 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.199
 Lyon to whom I put a plus two 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.840
 as could see because here it is 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.190
 did a very, very good season but 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.810
 alexandre lacazette 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.659
 so what did he do this season 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.270
 he made 40 matches 31 goals 7 assists 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.700
 decisive since and 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.570
 very good ratio 1 he finishes 6th best 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.570
 European scorer 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.820
 so here it is right behind a 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.200
 little far behind ronaldo messi lo 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.830
 but he's still in the sixth 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.320
 position 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.840
 what is really what is really 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.880
 not bad at all and finishes 2nd of 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.660
 championship with with the right ol 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.610
 behind the psg 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.740
 then he finished top scorer of the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.930
 league championship 1 with 27 goals 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.520
 here it was far before that tanner 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.440
 gignac there were still some 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.110
 goals of advanced he was elected best 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.330
 league player 1 so that's all he has 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.630
 successful this year so that's why I 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.340
 dis - 1 + 2 in the worst case it will have 1 83 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.230
 I think at least they will rise to a 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.050
 general stage but that would be it 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.880
 really nice to have it card 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.800
 of alexandre lacazette at 84 years stage 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.930
 general it would be really a very 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.480
 nice map so that's it and we will finish 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.970
 this episode with the fourth player who 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.680
 is alexis sanchez here is the Chilean of 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.450
 arsenal that made a very very beautiful 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.100
 season him too one so I put him a 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.340
 plus a general stage here he had 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.720
 still already 85 so 1.86 I think 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.090
 that it would be really deserved because 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.040
 he had a great season 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.950
 Alexis Sanchez and finishes 3rd of 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.930
 bpm england championship with 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.520
 arsenal so a championship that is 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.290
 still pretty much contested where there is 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.420
 very very big teams so then 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.850
 he finished fifth scorer the 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.830
 bpl with 16 goals and ninth best 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.030
 decisive smuggler with him passing decisive 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.650
 so here it is in both 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.700
 rankings and in the top 10 of 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.550
 scorers and smugglers 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.070
 he finishes the season with 52 games 25 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.030
 goals 12 assists so here it is 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.800
 as 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.170
 a good ratio for a side attacker 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.990
 right even though we've seen a lot of 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.250
 scorer also send the cards 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.650
 the booth cards that came out in has 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.140
 some who came out scorers 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.330
 Then he won the fight with 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.130
 arsenal so there is a goal in 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.080
 final he put a goal in the final and 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.600
 then he won of course the copa 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.670
 america with chile sees victory 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.300
 in the final against Argentina at the shots 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.430
 purpose of which here is the panenka he put 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.110
 the goal the goal of victory everything 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.790
 simply during the shooting session at the 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.680
 goal he put a little kawala breakdown 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.910
 for to mark the blow so what she 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.610
 did a very, very good season and I 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.320
 think a case 86 that would be deserved so 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.690
 this is for this first episode 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.430
 this is really my personal opinion you 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.510
 can you give your opinion also we 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.310
 is we may not all agree 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.230
 on the stats but it's really 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.990
 story give an idea about the cards 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.740
 that we can find on fifa 16 so I 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.120
 count on you for 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.770
 but it's in the comments of 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.870
 player ideas and I tell you to 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.950
