way to start an NBA season especially

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.390 
way to start an NBA season especially
when<00:00:27.869> you're<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.080> rookie<00:00:28.260> coming<00:00:28.650> into<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> NBA

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
when you're a rookie coming into the NBA

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.110 
when you're a rookie coming into the NBA
and<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:31.470> last<00:00:31.740> game<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.130> really<00:00:32.369> struggled

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and the last game you really struggled

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
and the last game you really struggled
getting<00:00:33.780> some<00:00:34.110> offens<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.800> our<00:00:34.920> defense

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
getting some offens going our defense

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
getting some offens going our defense
wasn't<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.059> bad<00:00:36.360> surprisingly<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.530> we

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
wasn't that bad surprisingly but we

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.619 
wasn't that bad surprisingly but we
really<00:00:38.010> struggled<00:00:38.489> offensively<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.390> some

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
really struggled offensively to get some

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.420 
really struggled offensively to get some
points<00:00:39.960> hopefully<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.559> game<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.219> come

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
points hopefully this game we can come

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.520 
points hopefully this game we can come
out<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.790> different<00:00:42.030> way<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.660> hopefully<00:00:43.410> we

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
out in a different way and hopefully we

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.799 
out in a different way and hopefully we
can<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.980> W<00:00:45.440> we're<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.620> home<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.390> maybe<00:00:48.660> we

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
can get the W we're at home so maybe we

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
can get the W we're at home so maybe we
might<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> better<00:00:49.739> advantage<00:00:49.950> when

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
might have a better advantage when

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.560 
might have a better advantage when
taking<00:00:51.059> our<00:00:51.360> opponent<00:00:52.350> I'm<00:00:53.160> having<00:00:53.699> Jeremy

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
taking our opponent I'm having Jeremy

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
Lin's guard me as a point guard and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.430 
Lin's guard me as a point guard and
their<00:00:56.820> defensive<00:00:57.329> matchup<00:00:57.690> he<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
their defensive matchup he is not a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
their defensive matchup he is not a
great<00:00:58.770> defender<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.030> I'm<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.660> to
