00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
four five six seven eight nine okay up

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.440 
four five six seven eight nine okay up
to<00:00:09.690> nine<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.679> will<00:00:10.980> count<00:00:11.219> up<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.700> nine<00:00:12.860> so

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
to nine it will count up to nine so

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.990 
to nine it will count up to nine so
let's<00:00:15.450> again<00:00:15.780> start<00:00:16.170> something<00:00:16.590> else<00:00:17.000> that's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
let's again start something else that's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.939 
let's again start something else that's
like<00:00:18.240> some<00:00:18.449> other<00:00:18.630> function<00:00:21.590> again<00:00:22.590> below

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
like some other function again below

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.190 
like some other function again below
below

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.130 

I<00:00:28.290> will<00:00:29.130> use<00:00:29.430> it<00:00:29.610> at<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.180> temperature<00:00:30.720> sensor

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
I will use it at that temperature sensor

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
I will use it at that temperature sensor
will<00:00:34.140> measure<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.590> temperature<00:00:35.220> of<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
will measure the temperature of this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.320 
will measure the temperature of this
room<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.290> it<00:00:37.290> can't<00:00:37.620> even<00:00:38.070> turn<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.310> my<00:00:38.700> fan<00:00:39.030> or

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
room and it can't even turn on my fan or

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.490 
room and it can't even turn on my fan or
my<00:00:39.570> heater<00:00:39.870> depend<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.560> the<00:00:40.740> temperature<00:00:41.340> oh<00:00:42.500> I

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
my heater depend on the temperature oh I

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.020 
my heater depend on the temperature oh I
have<00:00:44.450> no<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.200> about<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.730> got

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
have no have to go about and I have got

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
have no have to go about and I have got
more<00:00:48.360> downs<00:00:50.239> Pfeifer<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.690> segments<00:00:52.200> get<00:00:52.890> fat

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
more downs Pfeifer some segments get fat

are<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> temperature

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
are you are going to see the temperature

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.380 
are you are going to see the temperature
in<00:01:00.180> Celsius<00:01:00.720> wow<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.280> some<00:01:02.670> jump<00:01:02.940> onto

no<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.460> will<00:01:16.789> juice<00:01:17.149> as<00:01:17.619> my<00:01:18.619> digital<00:01:19.130> clock<00:01:19.429> to

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
no I will juice as my digital clock to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:39.360 
no I will juice as my digital clock to
see<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.780> time<00:01:25.270> okay<00:01:27.159> cam

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370

34 keypad to Alcide interface it is it

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.570 
34 keypad to Alcide interface it is it
is<00:01:45.010> entirely<00:01:45.640> far<00:01:46.240> using<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:47.170> as<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.580> calculator

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
is entirely far using it as a calculator

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.190 
is entirely far using it as a calculator
we<00:01:49.420> can<00:01:49.660> also<00:01:49.930> use<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.500> as<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:51.000> calculator<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
we can also use it as a calculator it

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.100 
we can also use it as a calculator it
has<00:01:53.470> four<00:01:54.420> arithmetical<00:01:55.420> simple<00:01:55.840> arithmetic

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
has four arithmetical simple arithmetic

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.920 
has four arithmetical simple arithmetic
a<00:01:56.470> function<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.670> class<00:01:58.000> multiplication

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
a function that is class multiplication

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
a function that is class multiplication
addition<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.650> subtraction<00:02:00.450> mean<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.950> just

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
addition and subtraction mean I just

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.550 
addition and subtraction mean I just
have<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.310> chaton<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.480> just<00:02:04.840> introduced<00:02:05.290> for

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
have the chaton so I just introduced for

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.030 
have the chaton so I just introduced for
function<00:02:05.980> in<00:02:06.070> that<00:02:06.280> function<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.440> was<00:02:08.680> to<00:02:08.860> go

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
function in that function as I was to go

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.280 
function in that function as I was to go
on<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.430> digital<00:02:09.850> clock<00:02:10.090> here<00:02:10.510> I<00:02:10.600> will<00:02:10.899> go<00:02:11.140> on

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
on the digital clock here I will go on

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.500 
on the digital clock here I will go on
the<00:02:11.320> digital<00:02:11.860> class<00:02:12.100> 60<00:02:14.490> I'm<00:02:15.490> sorry<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.240> have
