one of the most anticipated weigh-ins in

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.420 
one of the most anticipated weigh-ins in
a<00:00:18.150> long<00:00:18.330> time<00:00:18.680> Chavez<00:00:19.680> came<00:00:19.949> through<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
a long time Chavez came through on the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.880 
a long time Chavez came through on the
weight<00:00:20.609> were<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.810> concerned<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.500> we

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
weight were you at all concerned that we

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.920 
weight were you at all concerned that we
might<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.220> repeat<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> last<00:00:23.730> time<00:00:24.029> well<00:00:24.900> I

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
might have a repeat of last time well I

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.339 
might have a repeat of last time well I
certainly<00:00:25.800> wasn't<00:00:26.460> concerned<00:00:27.109> once<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
certainly wasn't concerned once I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.920 
certainly wasn't concerned once I
arrived<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.039> town<00:00:29.310> which<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:31.820> way

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
arrived in town which was a way

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.229 
arrived in town which was a way
Wednesday<00:00:33.930> evening<00:00:34.530> because<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.430> saw<00:00:35.730> him<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
Wednesday evening because I saw him and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.490 
Wednesday evening because I saw him and
I<00:00:36.800> could<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.309> away<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.940> he<00:00:39.500> weighed

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
I could see right away that he weighed

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.280 
I could see right away that he weighed
less<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.579> lot<00:00:41.910> less<00:00:41.969> than<00:00:42.480> he<00:00:42.840> did<00:00:43.230> in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
less a lot less than he did in

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.750 
less a lot less than he did in
California<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.760> no<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.600> figured<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> long

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
California so no I I figured that a long

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.470 
California so no I I figured that a long
last<00:00:48.260> he<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.469> being<00:00:49.770> responsible<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> would

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
last he was being responsible and would

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.389 
last he was being responsible and would
make<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> weight<00:00:52.140> which<00:00:52.710> he<00:00:52.890> did<00:00:53.129> quite

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
make the weight which he did quite

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.689 
make the weight which he did quite
easily<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.840> wasn't<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> guy<00:00:55.890> who

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
easily because it wasn't like a guy who

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.500 
easily because it wasn't like a guy who
went<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> scale<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.500> make<00:00:58.680> weight<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
went on the scale to make weight and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.779 
went on the scale to make weight and
they<00:01:00.510> had<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> hold<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:02.100> he<00:01:02.640> was

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
they had to hold them up because he was

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.560 
they had to hold them up because he was
so<00:01:03.000> weak<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.570> made<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> easily<00:01:04.700> right<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:06.180> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
so weak he made it easily right now I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
so weak he made it easily right now I
know<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.080> Chavez<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> those

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
