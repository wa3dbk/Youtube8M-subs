sold 15 million units just nine months
in<00:00:13.590> 2010<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.759> naturally<00:00:15.509> they<00:00:15.809> didn't<00:00:16.109> mess

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230

the<00:00:18.240> same<00:00:18.420> product<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> few<00:00:19.619> enhancements

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the same product with a few enhancements

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.640 
the same product with a few enhancements
and<00:00:20.460> upgrades<00:00:20.930> yet<00:00:21.930> still<00:00:22.289> not<00:00:22.470> perfect

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and upgrades yet still not perfect

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.320 
and upgrades yet still not perfect
either<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.580> we'll<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.210> moment

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so first things first we'll step back

tablet in a nutshell now the ipad 2 does
build<00:01:04.320> upon<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.979> original<00:01:05.430> ipad<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.540> number

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
build upon the original ipad in a number

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
build upon the original ipad in a number
of<00:01:06.840> ways<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.650> first<00:01:07.979> things<00:01:08.220> first<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
of ways so first things first it is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.450 
of ways so first things first it is
definitely<00:01:09.240> faster<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:10.860> runs<00:01:11.220> on

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
definitely faster so it now runs on

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.789 
definitely faster so it now runs on

Apple's new a5 chip it's a dual-core
processor<00:01:14.549> which<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.240> having<00:01:15.420> two

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
processor which is like having two

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
processor which is like having two
engines<00:01:16.080> under<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> hood<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.070> car<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
engines under the hood of the car is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.789 
engines under the hood of the car is
what<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> say<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.500> you're<00:01:19.650> definitely

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
what I like to say so you're definitely

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.200 
what I like to say so you're definitely
going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> notice<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.520> speed<00:01:20.790> improvement

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
going to notice this speed improvement

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
going to notice this speed improvement
for<00:01:21.330> example<00:01:21.689> let<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:21.900> launch<00:01:22.159> infinity<00:01:23.159> blade

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
for example let me launch infinity blade

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
for example let me launch infinity blade
here<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> you'll<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.420> how<00:01:24.540> fast<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> loads<00:01:25.290> up

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
here and you'll see how fast it loads up

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
here and you'll see how fast it loads up
check<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.189> out<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.600> fast

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
check that out so really really fast

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.109 
check that out so really really fast
performance<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.909> in

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
performance there and it's not just in

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.969 
performance there and it's not just in
loading<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> games<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:31.140> loading<00:01:31.530> apps<00:01:31.680> like

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
loading the games or loading apps like

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.460 
loading the games or loading apps like
the<00:01:32.189> iBooks<00:01:32.700> app<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.360> your<00:01:33.600> Safari<00:01:34.229> web

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the iBooks app or your Safari web

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
the iBooks app or your Safari web
browser<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.430> also<00:01:35.579> runs<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.329> much

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
browser but it also runs that much

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.660 
browser but it also runs that much
faster<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:37.290> well<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.100> definitely<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.549> going

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
faster as well so definitely are going

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
faster as well so definitely are going
to<00:01:38.729> notice<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.150> speed<00:01:39.360> improvement<00:01:39.930> apple

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
to notice the speed improvement apple

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039 
to notice the speed improvement apple
says<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.369> twice<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.850> fast<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
says it's about twice as fast as the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
says it's about twice as fast as the
original<00:01:43.470> iPad<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.399> inclined<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.909> agree

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
original iPad I'm inclined to agree

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.020 
original iPad I'm inclined to agree
that's<00:01:45.570> about<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:46.049> though<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> might<00:01:47.130> say

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that's about right though I might say

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.300 
that's about right though I might say
that<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.479> nine<00:01:48.869> times<00:01:49.170> better<00:01:49.500> graphics

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that the nine times better graphics

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.580 
that the nine times better graphics
performance<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:51.000> debatable<00:01:51.600> your<00:01:52.170> games<00:01:52.409> are

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
performance is debatable your games are

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.920 
performance is debatable your games are
not<00:01:52.710> running<00:01:52.920> nine<00:01:53.220> times<00:01:53.460> faster<00:01:53.930> but

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
not running nine times faster but

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.030 
not running nine times faster but
definitely<00:01:55.560> you'll<00:01:55.680> see<00:01:55.829> an<00:01:55.890> improvement

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
definitely you'll see an improvement

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.380 
definitely you'll see an improvement
when<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.490> comes<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> loading<00:01:56.969> your<00:01:57.180> apps

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
when it comes to loading your apps

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.600 
when it comes to loading your apps
running<00:01:57.750> them<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.189> multitasking<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.369> well

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
running them and multitasking as well

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.459 
running them and multitasking as well
even<00:02:00.060> though<00:02:00.329> Apple<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.229> quiet

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
even though Apple is a little quiet

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.270 
even though Apple is a little quiet
about<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> RAM

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
about the RAM

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.450 
about the RAM
that's<00:02:02.610> involved<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.860> but<00:02:04.860> overall<00:02:05.159> much

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
that's involved here but overall much

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
that's involved here but overall much
faster<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.000> that's<00:02:06.150> number<00:02:06.299> one<00:02:06.570> number<00:02:06.869> two

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
faster so that's number one number two

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
faster so that's number one number two
is<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> inclusion<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:08.009> two<00:02:08.220> cameras<00:02:08.700> there's

it<00:03:00.720> all<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> app<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.440> that's<00:03:01.739> also<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
it all on the app and that's also the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.090 
it all on the app and that's also the
same<00:03:02.310> price<00:03:02.580> five<00:03:02.850> bucks<00:03:03.150> where<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.950> think<00:03:04.950> this

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
same price five bucks where I think this

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.949 
same price five bucks where I think this
product<00:03:05.519> falls<00:03:05.700> short<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.630> still

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
product falls short is in the still

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.930 
product falls short is in the still
photography<00:03:07.560> department<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.430> while<00:03:08.760> this

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
photography department so while this

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.360 
photography department so while this
shoots<00:03:09.299> 720p<00:03:09.660> video<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.799> doesn't<00:03:11.070> even<00:03:11.160> take

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
shoots 720p video it doesn't even take

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.580 
shoots 720p video it doesn't even take
one<00:03:11.579> megapixel<00:03:11.970> stills<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.959> think<00:03:13.350> that's<00:03:13.470> a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
one megapixel stills I think that's a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.990 
one megapixel stills I think that's a
huge<00:03:13.799> oversight<00:03:14.280> i<00:03:14.310> think<00:03:14.579> it's<00:03:14.670> using

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
huge oversight i think it's using

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.150 
huge oversight i think it's using
probably<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> same<00:03:15.720> camera<00:03:16.170> as<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.620> 4th

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
probably the same camera as the 4th

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.069 
probably the same camera as the 4th
generation<00:03:17.400> ipod<00:03:18.120> touch<00:03:18.150> where<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.930> takes

great<00:03:19.320> video<00:03:19.709> but<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> still<00:03:20.940> photography<00:03:21.690> is

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930

sort of things they've added is the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
slimmer design it's now thirty three

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.270 
slimmer design it's now thirty three
percent<00:04:48.970> thinner<00:04:49.660> so<00:04:50.590> one-third<00:04:50.979> thinner

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
percent thinner so one-third thinner

definitely don't think it feels that

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.610 
definitely don't think it feels that
much<00:05:13.270> lighter<00:05:13.600> than<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.289> last<00:05:14.470> generation

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620

to control the character or its weapons

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.129 
to control the character or its weapons
I<00:05:24.250> think<00:05:24.729> that's<00:05:24.910> also<00:05:25.510> kind<00:05:25.870> of<00:05:25.990> neat

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
I think that's also kind of neat

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
Gameloft so those are the key

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.020 
Gameloft so those are the key
