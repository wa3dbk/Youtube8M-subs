00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.950
 rocker server that is not very fast in 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.200

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.389
 practically a very fast indeed not 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.679
 is going to see blog today's video is in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.120
 how about the harmonics here we have 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.120
 our silver star d honneur 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.660
 and well, consented of all 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.000
 It's one of my harmonies that I already have as 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.029
 a year and a half with her silver star and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.350
 today the new member has arrived 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.290
 blues harp modular janer system in the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.170
 two - tone ie let dry 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.210
 to proceed to open the good I think that 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.120
 is going to see out there there is here the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.390
 we have gentlemen and it contains what is 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.809
 because practically the harmonica itself 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.399
 instrument we can see it here I have not 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.989
 touched in fact that's why I'm 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.280
 recording because I want it to be special 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.399
 and well it contains there is a small 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.390
 booklet with them with instructions 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.950
 and well then let's make a small 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.159
 comparative between both harmonics of a 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.060
 very short very fast 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 silver star 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.179
 with the design 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.500
 already tonic plastic comb 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.970
 this is in king and blues blues harp 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.150
 modular wooden comb system quality and 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.440
 then you see the difference we can see 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.440
 and blues harp 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.350
 tonalities and here we have nothing in the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.940
 back side put and well let's go 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.460
 to let the gentlemen know that better than 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.420
 the opposite of all of you and good 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:53.370
 Well let's see the first blow 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.370
 we give him here we have the harmonica and 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.710
 i 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.660
 let's listen to piano man again 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.660
 yes 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.879
 since more or less more or less it sounds very 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.879
 well and let's listen to it with this one 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.379
 so then they are pretty different 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.840
 great I believe in sound at first 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.940
 we start from the tuning and I am very 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.920
 well the harp blues you hear very very well 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.780
 in a few videos later I'll be 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.269
 doing care to a harmonica 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.989
 diatonic with wooden comb as it is 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:38.019
 this and well then I for the moment 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.989
 I leave this has been all with the blues harp 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.000
 in hue of the finger and horner silver 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.610
 star in tonality of seeing green in which 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.680
 has always been classic and that always goes 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.630
 to be spoiled by all of us like this 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.640
 that as not with much taste first 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.220
 first sound first impressions 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.989
 first hit of the hong the blues word 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.819
 here with all of you I hope that you 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.750
