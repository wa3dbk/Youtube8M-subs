tracking movement the shutter speeds up
really<00:01:17.409> high<00:01:17.590> so<00:01:17.860> it's<00:01:18.040> got<00:01:18.189> that<00:01:18.369> sort<00:01:18.610> of

also<00:01:37.509> not<00:01:37.750> overly<00:01:38.619> aggressively<00:01:39.130> trying<00:01:39.430> to

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
also not overly aggressively trying to

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.460 
also not overly aggressively trying to
find<00:01:39.729> focus<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:40.210> fact<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.509> locked<00:01:40.750> on<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:40.960> CVS

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
find focus in fact it locked on the CVS

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.380 
find focus in fact it locked on the CVS
pharmacy<00:01:41.950> sign<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:42.880> just<00:01:43.030> stuck<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.360> that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
pharmacy sign and it just stuck to that

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.899 
pharmacy sign and it just stuck to that
and<00:01:43.960> also<00:01:44.079> I<00:01:44.200> really<00:01:44.649> like<00:01:44.860> how<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.369> tracks

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
and also I really like how it tracks

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.660 
and also I really like how it tracks
exposure<00:01:46.390> because<00:01:46.810> as<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.320> can<00:01:47.350> see<00:01:47.520> stuff<00:01:48.520> on

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
exposure because as you can see stuff on

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.950 
exposure because as you can see stuff on
the<00:01:48.759> ground<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.149> actually<00:01:49.479> pretty<00:01:49.719> well

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
the ground is actually pretty well

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.109 
the ground is actually pretty well
exposed<00:01:50.439> especially<00:01:51.070> dark-colored<00:01:51.670> vehicles

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
exposed especially dark-colored vehicles

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.330 
exposed especially dark-colored vehicles
but<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.869> sky<00:01:53.079> is<00:01:53.110> still<00:01:53.380> blue<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:54.009> hasn't

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
but that the sky is still blue it hasn't

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.010 
but that the sky is still blue it hasn't
blown<00:01:54.490> out<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.820> sky<00:01:55.030> which<00:01:55.299> is<00:01:55.479> really<00:01:55.899> really

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
blown out the sky which is really really

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.399 
blown out the sky which is really really
nice<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:56.759> now<00:01:57.759> for<00:01:57.820> our<00:01:58.420> transition<00:01:59.140> test

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
nice and now for our transition test

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.370 
nice and now for our transition test

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
darker scene again you can see the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.510 
darker scene again you can see the
tablets<00:02:05.110> subtly<00:02:05.590> over<00:02:05.799> exposing<00:02:06.159> everything

that<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:07.060> door<00:02:07.630> frame<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.410> little

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
that that door frame is just a little

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.530 
that that door frame is just a little
clip<00:02:08.979> it's<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.250> little<00:02:09.490> bright<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.330> got<00:02:10.510> a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
clip it's a little bright but it's got a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.050 
clip it's a little bright but it's got a
great<00:02:10.780> gradual<00:02:11.440> transition<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:12.190> go<00:02:12.310> from<00:02:12.670> a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
great gradual transition to go from a

bright exposure to a dark exposure and
see

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
see

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.520 
see
this<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.790> gym<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.090> now<00:02:16.330> over<00:02:16.930> exposed<00:02:17.320> as

this this gym is now over exposed as
well<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.370> see<00:02:18.460> I'm<00:02:18.550> blowing<00:02:19.030> out<00:02:19.180> there's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
well you can see I'm blowing out there's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.720 
well you can see I'm blowing out there's
like<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.810> haziness<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.800> some<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.250> these<00:02:21.370> dark

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
like a haziness to some of these dark

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.090 
like a haziness to some of these dark
elements<00:02:22.180> as<00:02:22.300> well<00:02:22.530> stopping<00:02:23.530> down<00:02:23.560> the

exposure<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.790> little<00:02:25.000> bit<00:02:25.120> helps

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
exposure just a little bit helps

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.180 
exposure just a little bit helps
tremendously<00:02:25.680> especially<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.800> go<00:02:26.890> by<00:02:27.010> those

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
tremendously especially to go by those

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.160 
tremendously especially to go by those
reflections<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.910> tablet<00:02:28.810> does<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.930> great<00:02:29.140> job

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
reflections the tablet does a great job

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.990 
reflections the tablet does a great job
of<00:02:29.350> transitioning<00:02:30.010> without<00:02:30.340> being<00:02:30.580> overly

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
of transitioning without being overly

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.880 
of transitioning without being overly
aggressive<00:02:31.570> it's<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.810> smooth<00:02:32.170> transition<00:02:32.590> it's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
aggressive it's a smooth transition it's

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.090 
aggressive it's a smooth transition it's
not<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.240> squirrely<00:02:34.240> or<00:02:34.390> hyper<00:02:34.950> transition<00:02:35.950> so

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
not a squirrely or hyper transition so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.040 
not a squirrely or hyper transition so
you<00:02:36.190> don't<00:02:36.370> feel<00:02:36.550> like<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.510> camera<00:02:37.990> is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
you don't feel like the camera is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.350 
you don't feel like the camera is
getting<00:02:38.230> out<00:02:38.320> of<00:02:38.350> control<00:02:39.360> low-light

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
getting out of control low-light

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.550 
getting out of control low-light
sensitivity<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.930> can<00:02:41.050> see<00:02:41.140> we're<00:02:41.320> really

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
sensitivity you can see we're really

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.730 
sensitivity you can see we're really
into<00:02:41.800> Skylanders<00:02:42.310> right<00:02:42.490> now<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.990> that<00:02:44.020> the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
into Skylanders right now but that the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.620 
into Skylanders right now but that the
camera<00:02:44.980> does<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> great<00:02:45.340> job<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.550> ramping<00:02:46.480> up

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
camera does a great job of ramping up

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.370 
camera does a great job of ramping up
the<00:02:47.170> ISO<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.430> get<00:02:48.760> more<00:02:49.240> detail<00:02:49.660> into<00:02:49.990> the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
the ISO to get more detail into the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.250 
the ISO to get more detail into the
video<00:02:50.620> without<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:51.070> getting<00:02:51.160> overly<00:02:51.850> noisy

getting<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> little<00:02:53.410> close<00:02:53.680> into<00:02:53.920> some<00:02:54.040> of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
getting a little close into some of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.890 
getting a little close into some of
those<00:02:54.190> macro<00:02:54.640> stuff<00:02:54.880> i<00:02:55.090> think<00:02:55.510> i<00:02:55.570> push<00:02:55.750> this

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
those macro stuff i think i push this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.120 
those macro stuff i think i push this
just<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.200> little<00:02:56.410> closer<00:02:56.560> than<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:56.920> should<00:02:57.100> have

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
just a little closer than I should have

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.590 
just a little closer than I should have
but<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.670> can<00:02:57.790> see<00:02:57.910> even<00:02:58.090> in<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.360> dark

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
but you can see even in a dark

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.990 
but you can see even in a dark
environment<00:02:58.780> cameras<00:02:59.590> doing<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.920> great<00:03:00.340> job<00:03:00.370> of

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
environment cameras doing a great job of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.970 
environment cameras doing a great job of
tracking<00:03:01.690> movement<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.350> not<00:03:02.530> getting<00:03:02.800> too

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
tracking movement is not getting too

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.340 
tracking movement is not getting too
blurry<00:03:03.400> it's<00:03:03.910> not<00:03:04.090> getting<00:03:04.450> there's<00:03:04.990> not<00:03:05.110> an

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
blurry it's not getting there's not an

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.290 
blurry it's not getting there's not an
aggressive<00:03:05.680> noise<00:03:06.400> reduction<00:03:06.670> filter<00:03:07.120> which

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
aggressive noise reduction filter which

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.480 
aggressive noise reduction filter which
turns<00:03:07.600> this<00:03:07.810> all<00:03:07.960> into<00:03:08.110> watercolor<00:03:08.590> again

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
turns this all into watercolor again

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.100 
turns this all into watercolor again
it's<00:03:09.640> a<00:03:09.700> surprisingly<00:03:10.060> decent<00:03:10.390> camera<00:03:10.690> module

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
it's a surprisingly decent camera module

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.200 
it's a surprisingly decent camera module
so<00:03:11.710> all<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.070> all<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.190> walked<00:03:12.490> away<00:03:12.640> from<00:03:13.030> the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
so all in all I walked away from the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.290 
so all in all I walked away from the
camera<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.320> Asus<00:03:15.190> infinity<00:03:15.700> really

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
camera in the Asus infinity really

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.290 
camera in the Asus infinity really
impressed<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.190> camera<00:03:18.670> module<00:03:19.060> which
