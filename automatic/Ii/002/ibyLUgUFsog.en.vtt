00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
a lot more being here than I probably

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.120 
a lot more being here than I probably
taught<00:02:02.119> these<00:02:02.359> kids<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.990> lot<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.380> them<00:02:03.499> having

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
taught these kids a lot of them having

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.269

that they can look up to is sometimes a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.650 
that they can look up to is sometimes a
really<00:02:09.560> big<00:02:09.709> thing<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:09.950> them<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:11.390> mean
