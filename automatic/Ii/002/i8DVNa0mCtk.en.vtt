00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.370
When you're building a business, you need
to write.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.130
Maybe you're writing notes for a video script.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.780
Or maybe you're writing a blog post.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.010
Or maybe you're just writing an email to a
colleague.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.100
But if you're not a writer, writing can be
so tedious and time consuming.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.400
And it can make you want to rip your hair
out.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.449
No.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.519
Hair looks too good right now.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.349
I'm Derek Halpern, and you're watching Social
Triggers, the place entrepreneurs and executives

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.589
learn to get ahead in business and life.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:30.449
And in this video, I’ll reveal a simple
5 step process for writing smarter and faster,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.879
even if you’re not a writer.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.140
Let me take you back in time.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.149
When I first started writing, I’d wake up
in the morning and get started.

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.559
I’d open a blank text document, write 2
sentences and I'd scream at my computer.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.630
After a few more screaming sessions, I’d
have about 2 paragraphs complete.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.210
I’d reread those 2 paragraphs and rewrite
them.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.670
Then I’d rewrite them again.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.670
And again.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.030
Then I’d scream a little more.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.610
And I’d give up and go clean my house.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.510
It would take me days to write a blog post.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.400
And when you're creating as much content as
I do, that's a surefire way to never write

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
anything.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.060
And I remember getting SO FRUSTRATED:

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.950
"I Just cant do it!"

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.460
“I’m not cut out for this.”

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.530
"I SHOULD JUST QUIT RIGHT NOW!"

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.530
Sound familiar?

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.050
It turns out this is how a lot of people feel
when they're writing.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.420
You kind of know what you want to say, but
you just can’t get the words out.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.060
But everything changed for me when I stumbled
on this interesting piece of advice from Eugene

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.380
Schwartz, one of the best copywriters that
ever lived.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.380
He wrote:

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.530
"Copy is never written.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.820
Copy is assembled."

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.100
And that’s when the proverbial light bulb
went off in my head.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.100
That's it!

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.210
I need to stop writing into blank pages.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.980
I need a system for writing.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.890
To write, I need facts.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.960
I need anecdotes.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.560
I need action plans!

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.590
And that's when I honed a new writing process
that allows me to pump out great content fast.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.920
First, I'll tell you how it works.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.510
Then I'll show you where you can download
a FREE worksheet to help you start using my

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.870
process today.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.870
Let's jump right in.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.500
Step 1: You want to accumulate tons of ideas.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.280
When you write for a living, you should constantly
be thinking of new ideas and new stories.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.920
When I get ready for a Social Triggers TV
video shoot, I often have a list of about

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.650
100 or 150 ideas that I want to write.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.200
Of course, all my ideas don’t make the cut.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.670
In reality, I only need about 10 or so good
ideas.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.970
But choosing 10 good ideas from a list of
100 is much easier than thinking of 10 good

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.020
ideas from nothing.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.480
So, whenever you think of a story or an idea
that you can use in your writing, be sure

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.780
to keep track of it!

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.320
Which leads me to the next step, Step 2: You
want to eliminate bad ideas.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.730
Now, you’re likely wondering, “Derek,
all my ideas are good.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.980
How can I decide which ideas are worth pursuing?”

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.660
And that’s a great question.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.670
Just because an idea is good doesn’t mean
that you should write about it.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.980
That’s why, for every idea, I look to answer
three main questions:

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.090
The first is:

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.480
Can I cite any interesting research or data
about this topic?

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.890
And if no research or data is available, do
I have any personal breakthroughs, or know

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.160
someone who had a personal breakthrough, with
this topic?

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.350
If the answer is yes, the idea stays.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.630
Now, what do I mean by “research” and
“personal breakthroughs?”

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.880
Well, look at this video, for example.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.610
The idea was to write a script about my personal
breakthrough with writing.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.000
And I knew that I could quote Eugene Schwartz.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.130
So it passed the test.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.880
Or, as another example, check out this video
about the dumb pricing mistake most people

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.130
make.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.209
That was a pricing experiment I stumbled on
in a book.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.290
So, if you have a breakthrough or research
to cite, then the idea is probably worth pursing.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.290
It's that simple.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.099
But if the answer is no, then it’s not worth
pursuing right now.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.470
That doesn’t mean to throw it away.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.240
Sometimes an idea is worth researching.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.120
But when it’s time to write, the ideas that
need additional research just don’t make

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120
the cut.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.780
So you should save them for a later time.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.700
The next question I ask myself about a topic
idea is:

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.090
Do I have an opinion about this?

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.510
This is an important question to ask.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.880
Here's why: a lot of people tend to write
what they have research about or personal

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.930
experience about, but they don’t have an
opinion about it.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.190
And that's a problem.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.660
Nowadays, people want to hear unique voices.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.279
And you can't showcase your voice if you don't
have an opinion on what you're writing about.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.139
So if the answer is no, the article gets axed.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.060
If the answer is yes, proceed to the final
question, which is:

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.569
What are the key takeaways for this video
or blog post or email?

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.059
You want to have something to cite, and having
an opinion doesn't necessarily mean you should

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:37.590
write about that topic.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.509
Since I'm in the teaching space, I also need
to be able to teach people about something.

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.879
I need to give them something that they can
take action on and implement in their business.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.210
If I can't, I often won't write about it.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.879
That said, you may not be in the teaching
space.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:51.879
And that's fine.

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.639
Instead of giving them something they can
take action on, you can give them an action

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.729
to take.

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.900
For example, you can say: “Comment and let
me know your opinion about this topic.”

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.990
I've run articles where I don't necessarily
give an action plan, but instead, I solicit

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.990
an opinion.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.990
And it works great.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.309
So, after I go through these 3 questions,
I’m usually able to whittle down my list

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:13.110
from about 100 to 20 or so ideas.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.310
That’s way more manageable.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.310
Now, what’s next?

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.340
You want to go to Step 3: you want to Get
Real Specific.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.900
From those 20 ideas, I pick the top idea on
my list, and I flesh it out completely.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.770
First, I'll outline it into a few bullet points.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.250
As an example, for this video, I started with
this:

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.250
1.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.250
How to write fast
2.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.250
Writing is important
3.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.250
But I struggled with writing
4.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.250
Then I found Eugene Schwartz.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.250
5.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.250
Here's what I do now.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.909
After you outline your idea, you move on to:

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:44.020
Step 4, which is where you turn your outline
into a blog post or an article or a video

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.020
script.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.020
Now, here's the deal.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.819
Once it’s time to write, all I have to do
is follow my outline and assemble the article

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.440
one part at a time.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.110
So that, by the end, I’ve got 4 key sections
and all I have to do it put them together

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.580
into article form.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.580
Which leads me to:

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.050
Step 5: Edit.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.119
As you might imagine, when you assemble writing
the way I do, sometimes the writing doesn't

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.559
flow as well as you want it to flow.

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:11.310
That's why after I write the first draft of
an article, I start editing it.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.909
Or I have someone else edit it.

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.439
Whatever works in your business.

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.439
The goal?

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.520
To make it flow from start to finish.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.580
And that’s my process.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.509
It enables me to write fast and write smart.

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.520
And if you’re in the business of writing,
you should follow this process too.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520
How?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.219
Well, like I said earlier, I’ve got a FREE
worksheet that will walk you right through

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:31.599
this process.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.559
All you have to do is click this BIG BUTTON
to the right.

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:36.369

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.960
And that's it.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.409
If you found this video helpful, or know someone
that WILL find it helpful, I'd greatly appreciate

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.270

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.270
You see:

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.009
I believe EVERYONE needs to write.

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:56.470
Especially if they're an entrepreneur or an
executive who's looking to get ahead in business

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.470
and life.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.629
