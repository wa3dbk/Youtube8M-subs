00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
before this game even started well I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
before this game even started well I
wanted<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> mention<00:01:24.929> another<00:01:25.319> L<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.909> was

wanted to mention another L and that was

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.359 
wanted to mention another L and that was
unfortunately<00:01:27.810> something<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> ran<00:01:29.130> into

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
unfortunately something that I ran into

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.180 
unfortunately something that I ran into

when we started out tonight's game it is

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.230 
when we started out tonight's game it is
the<00:01:32.459> L<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.209> stands<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:34.049> lag<00:01:34.590> yes<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.940> lack

the L that stands for lag yes the lack

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109 
the L that stands for lag yes the lack
was<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.929> terrible<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:38.280> end<00:01:38.549> during<00:01:38.819> this

I'm<00:01:49.140> not<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.680> seeing<00:01:50.009> any<00:01:50.340> lackin<00:01:51.060> well

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
I'm not really seeing any lackin well

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
I'm not really seeing any lackin well
the<00:01:51.930> lack<00:01:52.109> that<00:01:52.289> I'm<00:01:52.409> talking<00:01:52.829> about<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the lack that I'm talking about is the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.870 
the lack that I'm talking about is the
input<00:01:53.939> lag<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.259> basically<00:01:55.770> any<00:01:56.130> decision<00:01:56.850> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
input lag so basically any decision that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.209 
input lag so basically any decision that
I<00:01:57.090> made<00:01:57.509> out<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.960> tonight<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> court<00:01:58.799> be

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
I made out there tonight on the court be

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.459 
I made out there tonight on the court be
it<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.490> offense<00:01:59.939> or<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.420> defense<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.200> was

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it on offense or on defense it was

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.999 
it on offense or on defense it was
always<00:02:02.359> delayed<00:02:03.359> so<00:02:04.049> pretty<00:02:04.469> much<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.920> was

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
always delayed so pretty much I was

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.370 
always delayed so pretty much I was
playing<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.549> guessing<00:02:05.820> game<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.479> there<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.079> it

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
playing a guessing game out there and it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
playing a guessing game out there and it
was<00:02:07.530> definitely<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.670> best<00:02:09.149> time<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
was definitely not the best time to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.870 
was definitely not the best time to
choose<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.440> one<00:02:10.709> because<00:02:11.009> we<00:02:11.459> are<00:02:11.519> going<00:02:11.760> up

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
choose that one because we are going up

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.030 
choose that one because we are going up
against<00:02:12.239> kuda<00:02:12.660> one<00:02:13.079> of<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.320> best<00:02:13.500> players<00:02:13.769> on

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
against kuda one of the best players on

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.849 
against kuda one of the best players on
my<00:02:14.070> team<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.820> he<00:02:15.299> has<00:02:15.480> onyx<00:02:16.019> Tracy<00:02:16.380> McGrady

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
my team and he has onyx Tracy McGrady

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.610 
my team and he has onyx Tracy McGrady
and<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.730> basically<00:02:17.940> have<00:02:18.570> nobody<00:02:19.200> out<00:02:19.380> there

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
I couldn't take any jump shots because

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.220 
I couldn't take any jump shots because
the<00:03:29.580> shot<00:03:29.790> meter<00:03:30.030> was<00:03:30.240> always<00:03:30.630> off<00:03:30.840> and

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
tonight's game not gonna lie even if

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.350 
tonight's game not gonna lie even if
there<00:05:32.199> wasn't<00:05:32.500> any<00:05:32.889> lack<00:05:33.340> I'm<00:05:33.610> pretty<00:05:34.060> sure

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
there wasn't any lack I'm pretty sure

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.600 
there wasn't any lack I'm pretty sure
t-mac<00:05:35.020> he<00:05:35.259> would<00:05:35.409> have<00:05:35.530> still<00:05:35.740> converted<00:05:36.430> all

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
t-mac he would have still converted all

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.700 
t-mac he would have still converted all
of<00:05:36.639> these<00:05:36.909> shots<00:05:37.300> therefore<00:05:38.169> leaving<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.680> the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
of these shots therefore leaving to the

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.770 
of these shots therefore leaving to the
fact<00:05:39.009> that<00:05:39.219> i'm<00:05:39.490> pretty<00:05:39.759> sure<00:05:40.120> we<00:05:40.539> would<00:05:40.750> have

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
fact that i'm pretty sure we would have

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.589 
fact that i'm pretty sure we would have
been<00:05:40.990> down<00:05:41.259> by<00:05:41.740> double<00:05:41.800> digits<00:05:42.159> even<00:05:43.029> if<00:05:43.300> there

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
been down by double digits even if there

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.929 
been down by double digits even if there
wasn't<00:05:43.840> any<00:05:44.139> lag<00:05:44.439> so<00:05:44.680> once<00:05:44.860> again<00:05:45.069> we<00:05:45.759> got

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
wasn't any lag so once again we got

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:47.640 
wasn't any lag so once again we got
t-mac<00:05:46.449> it<00:05:46.659> doesn't<00:05:46.960> even<00:05:47.050> matter<00:05:47.319> who's

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650

played<00:07:38.119> a<00:07:38.329> role<00:07:38.599> in<00:07:38.659> tonight's<00:07:39.169> game<00:07:39.529> we<00:07:40.099> were

00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:40.279 
played a role in tonight's game we were

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:42.699 
played a role in tonight's game we were
too<00:07:40.579> slow<00:07:40.879> on<00:07:40.969> defense<00:07:41.869> and<00:07:42.079> we<00:07:42.529> were

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:42.709 
too slow on defense and we were

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:45.549 
too slow on defense and we were
definitely<00:07:42.949> too<00:07:43.519> slow<00:07:43.789> on<00:07:43.819> offense<00:07:44.599> therefore

00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:45.559 
definitely too slow on offense therefore

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:47.259 
definitely too slow on offense therefore
leading<00:07:46.009> to<00:07:46.159> the<00:07:46.249> fact<00:07:46.519> that<00:07:46.639> we<00:07:46.849> had<00:07:46.999> ten

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:47.269 
leading to the fact that we had ten

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:51.009 
leading to the fact that we had ten
turnovers<00:07:47.649> no<00:07:48.649> steals<00:07:49.069> and<00:07:49.459> no<00:07:50.029> blocks<00:07:50.659> that

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:51.019 
turnovers no steals and no blocks that

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.499 
turnovers no steals and no blocks that
is<00:07:51.169> definitely<00:07:51.589> a<00:07:51.679> stat<00:07:52.099> line<00:07:52.339> that<00:07:52.789> you<00:07:53.029> don't

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:53.509 
is definitely a stat line that you don't

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:55.899 
is definitely a stat line that you don't
