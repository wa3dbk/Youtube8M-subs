I hooked it up see here's how to set it
up<00:00:44.629> here's<00:00:45.629> my<00:00:45.750> hands<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> 400<00:00:47.340> watt

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
up here's my hands this is a 400 watt

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.799 
up here's my hands this is a 400 watt
amp<00:00:47.640> module<00:00:49.100> I've<00:00:50.100> hooked<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
amp module I've hooked it up here you

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
here and then they hook up to my

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.500 
here and then they hook up to my
surround<00:01:02.010> sound<00:01:05.030> connection<00:01:06.030> wires<00:01:06.270> right

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
surround sound connection wires right

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.750 
surround sound connection wires right
here<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.710> originally<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> connection

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
here this is originally the connection

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.060 
here this is originally the connection
wires<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> subwoofer<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:10.740> how<00:01:10.890> they

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
wires for the subwoofer see how they

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.840 
wires for the subwoofer see how they
take<00:01:11.820> place<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.580> spliced<00:01:14.580> them

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
take place here but I just spliced them

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
take place here but I just spliced them
how's<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.470> end<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.799> looks<00:01:16.860> just

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
