00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
restarting and we will see where it goes

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.020 
restarting and we will see where it goes
from<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.640> loading

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
from there and here we have it loading

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
from there and here we have it loading
up<00:01:51.149> again<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.140> looks<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.530> might<00:01:52.649> take

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
up again and it looks like it might take

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.249 
up again and it looks like it might take
them<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> load<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.820> let's<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.780> skip

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
them out the load so let's just skip

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
them out the load so let's just skip

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
right through that so here we have it

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.800 
right through that so here we have it

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
kind of like the default thing that pops

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.209 
kind of like the default thing that pops
up<00:02:02.430> when<00:02:03.210> you're<00:02:03.450> setting<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.049> iOS<00:02:04.469> 5<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.009> let

up when you're setting up iOS 5 so let

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.039 
up when you're setting up iOS 5 so let
us<00:02:05.250> scroll<00:02:05.820> over<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.299> go<00:02:06.509> through<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
us scroll over and go through this and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.900 
us scroll over and go through this and
here<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:09.060> can

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
here we go you can

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.480 
here we go you can
sign<00:02:10.630> up<00:02:10.750> with<00:02:10.840> your<00:02:10.930> Apple<00:02:11.110> ID<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.920> then<00:02:12.190> you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
sign up with your Apple ID and then you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.290 
sign up with your Apple ID and then you
can<00:02:12.730> basically<00:02:13.450> set<00:02:14.410> up<00:02:14.650> your<00:02:15.100> iCloud<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.090> I'm

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
can basically set up your iCloud so I'm

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.820 
can basically set up your iCloud so I'm
going<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.870> sign<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:17.920> my<00:02:18.220> apple<00:02:18.820> ID<00:02:19.830> okay

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
going to sign in with my apple ID okay

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.770 
going to sign in with my apple ID okay
so<00:02:20.980> I've<00:02:21.250> typed<00:02:21.460> in<00:02:21.640> my<00:02:21.790> itunes<00:02:22.150> ID

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
so I've typed in my itunes ID

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.080 
so I've typed in my itunes ID
credentials<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:23.920> I'm<00:02:24.010> cooking<00:02:24.400> next<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:24.940> then

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
credentials and I'm cooking next so then

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.140 
credentials and I'm cooking next so then
it<00:02:25.180> will<00:02:25.300> set<00:02:25.510> up<00:02:25.630> all<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:25.960> stuff<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.880> guess

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
it will set up all this stuff so I guess

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.370 
it will set up all this stuff so I guess
we'll<00:02:28.270> take<00:02:28.420> them<00:02:28.510> over<00:02:28.630> here<00:02:28.870> just<00:02:29.260> to

we'll take them over here just to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.610 
we'll take them over here just to
process<00:02:29.890> my<00:02:30.550> information<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.630> then<00:02:32.530> we

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
process my information and then we
