00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.350
 it does not look like it but this phone is 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.480
 totally off-road resists water 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.090
 the dust and the blows but otherwise 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.860
 is not no big hello I am marta 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.509
 franco for the cinema is in Spanish and 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.400
 this is the first look at the kyocera 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.680
 hydro icon 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.150
 its design is relatively elegant 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.760
 taking into account the solid and 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.410
 resistant that is the company boasts of 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.570
 that the hydro icon complies with standards 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.760
 military and still does not have a 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.160
 excessively heavy cover is not 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.260
 particularly thick but it resists 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.840
 falls and is waterproof to a meter 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.980
 depth and for 30 minutes the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.450
 truth is that at first glance it does not 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.550
 it seems because it does not have the slots 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.399
 sealed but as long as you have the lid 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.350
 well closed rear everything will be fine let's go 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.170
 inside it has a two processor 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.270
 1.2 gigahertz cores is not 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.910
 very fast but it's pretty decent for 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.840
 a phone that costs only $ 150 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.449
 no contract has 1.5 gb of ram 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.580
 and 8 gigs of internal storage that 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.680
 it's going to be too short so 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.110
 you will want to buy a microsd card for 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.640
 expand capacity also does not come with 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.040
 the latest version of android 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.740
 that stays in Android 4.3 and removes 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.050
 the cameras are normal and slow 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.690
 It has a front of 2 megapixels and 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.550
 an 8 megapixel main is not 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.950
 particularly good but if you have 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.840
 good uniform lighting and you're not 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.420
 taking pictures with movement you can 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.220
 achieve acceptable images also has 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.140
 some manual adjustments so you can 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 try to play the smooth or the exposure 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.860
 to get something better something else that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.140
 you will have to keep in mind is the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.540
 quality of calls and data 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.759
 Kyocera Hydro icon comes with mobile bus 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.860
 that does not offer 4g everywhere in 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.600
 regarding the quality of the calls 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.030
 well sometimes you hear it good and sometimes not 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.890
 both the kyocera hydro icon as 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.200
 other phones the company does not have 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.880
 a conventional sound system in its 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.160
 place has what the company calls a 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.020
 smart sonic receiver that transmits the 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.479
 sound through vibrations in the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.149
 cartilage of your ear the idea is to reduce 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.979
 background noise and does not work badly 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.290
 problem is that you will also listen to 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.750
 perfection all the sounds of the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.880
 boost mobile network in any case if 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.410
 you want a phone without a contract that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.630
 endure that you submerge them and that what 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.400
 torture is this 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.320
 it's pretty economical if what you 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.330
 interest is rather the performance or the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.870
 camera and you do not plan to treat it to 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.150
 kicks 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.070
 others like the motor or motorcycle g can 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.020
 to be a better option I am frank marta 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.300
 to sign in Spanish and this has been your 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.300
 First look at the uncle will be hydro icon 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.190
 ah
