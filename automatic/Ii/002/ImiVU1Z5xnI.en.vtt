00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
 the first project for children who boasts 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.000
 and it was called 'the secret' case 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.900
 and went to a work 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.459
 very funny to create complicated because it was with black light all 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.839
 then it was a northern dance we are with you these blacks for example the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.140
 nasa her hands or if they saw her there is only lava the hands and hands of with 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.230
 commercial arms 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.039
 in abc they became 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.990
 in love and they became a foot she comes from stories and then 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.480
 they covered the data appear the legs the gasol penalties towards common 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.010
 pc puzzle body very funny 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.540
 this is the first part but 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 the interest of doing works for children is why 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.440
 because if you do not start from the kids to generate a taste for art for 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.030
 the hagen dance were 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.610
 this that generates the art that is a kind of community consciousness this 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.239
 nobody imagines in the world lives recognize the world 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.850
 from worlds that are almost impossible to avoid and that can only be inhabited 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.949
 Through the art 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.510
 so when 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.990
 sanz has to be with the childhood it has to be from the children the public 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.740
 childish is I think it's the toughest audience there is a lot more 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.150
 easy the adult public unless you consulted him can give you something to go more or 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.380
 less well and you will like the child 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.770
 If you do not like it, do not like to shout. I would be hours. 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.590
 that is really a very demanding public 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.980
 so for us the experience has in fact done as three programs to 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.440
 political parties 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.330
 the secret streets after we did a repertoire program of works that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.940
 work very well for children afterwards somewhere that is a work 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.130
 very beautiful believes that he directed vÃ­ctor manuel precious about the children of the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.840
 Street 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 and now we are disappearing tighten the company is a project for children 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.420
 about the lic 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.289
 about the work of Dali the soft watches are called 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.400
 and that obviously we are going to put all this multimedia work that we have been 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.740
 they developed the last three years that interest us lots and grazing 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.960
 children is wonderful because in addition 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.780
 when you work with children you are competing with the big media like 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.830
 the television or the children is nailed cnn wii are stuck in the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.200
 non-electronic games on the computer take them to the ideal theater is 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.939
 something that impacts us 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.249
 keep them seated driver exception of the historic each block 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.249
 Lopez also very complicated really involves a job 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.479
 much greater should not know how to be able 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.979
 p put us in a world and keep them not 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
 sasol with our municipality as well as says 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.089
 damask to create what is very important 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:38.059
 especially attempt to escape after the children are written being 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.050
 replaced d 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.240
 d of the television p where all they see is violence 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.499
 the only thing we can do 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:51.669
 - art as much as possible in institutions as well as cultural ones 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.369
 gypsy girls from the tar schools 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:59.259
 the ump the latin music the class the coasts of murcia that we have here the 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.439
 first of international appointments 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.590
 discover environment because it brings me 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.729
 that is to say about this important matter 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.939
 but what they fear is particular is that we have never addressed 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:10.930
 the nation 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.050
 for children like they were fools a lot upside down we are smarter 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.559
 of all together can not give you things in common 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:22.659
 if these are single-parent in this way last year however very 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.930
 Elaborated 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.580
 and to top it off for children that we've done has always been nothing more for the 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.340
 children 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.529
 but as for the child that the adults carry inside also 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.830
 then they are spectacles that the field we go to the adults 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.510
 because the idea is that the parents of the children go and that they do not get bored 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.169
 dads shakhtar to fatah azam that universe 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:45.209
 new funny not funny that makes them reflect always defend 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.439
 until work 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.179
 ee is not that we want to put pressure on the public is impossible but 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:54.589
 If we launch a series of questions we are always interested in the public 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.359
 out 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.049
 generating questions can ask very diverse questions can be 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.790
 conceptual questions can ask technical questions can do 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:07.269
 emotional questions and that I do not know if you throw I do not know but they always come out of the 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.139
 work 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.610
 we want we do not do like 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.500
 linked to the works are not denied to have to say 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.060
 this is today this I believe closed as a closed universe not 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.209
 because when we create work that we do through questions we 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.659
 we generate questions that we try to solve in the choreographic work 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.110
 and that's the big question other new questions that we want the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.590
 public will arrive at your house 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.180
 then the work we want to remember it just because you have to pay 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.460
 effect 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.139
 but because what made me think that 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.249
 that I left thinking about my house 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.759
 after having seen the work and that is very difficult 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.389
 to achieve what they do now just when when your creation process is 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.729
 through your question do you also things as a person as an individual
