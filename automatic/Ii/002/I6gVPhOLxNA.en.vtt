00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
touchscreen underwater I don't have the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.460

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
but also my screen protector actually

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.969 
but also my screen protector actually
lays<00:01:52.350> flat<00:01:52.649> again<00:01:53.039> it's<00:01:53.159> my<00:01:53.750> my<00:01:54.750> display<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
think the people that don't have it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.350 
think the people that don't have it
laying<00:01:58.560> flat<00:01:58.860> against<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> display<00:01:59.700> are
