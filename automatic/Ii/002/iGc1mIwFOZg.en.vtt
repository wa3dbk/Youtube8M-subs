00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.740
 good morning and happy Easter to all of us e 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.540
 be amazed if the wishes of pasco ve 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.600
 I do them here from the cathedral you see it 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.940
 she is our sick mother and when she is there 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.850
 someone sick in the house if you are hoping 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.309
 if he can recover he can come back 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.970
 to life before 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.910
 that's why I'm here to tell you good 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.660
 Easter and tell you how we hope that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.810
 this cathedral could resume the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 its vitality as always us too 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.120
 our life even though we have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 the impression of being a corrupt 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.850
 in bad shape we can and we must 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.190
 hope that something can change into 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.800
 background this is the meaning of 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.350
 Easter is Jesus who asks us to do the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.000
 passage from all that is ugly that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.360
 death what a pity 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.770
 to all that is beautiful that life and that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.320
 Easter 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.289
 It may seem strange that today we must 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.140
 tell us happy easter with the times that 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.910
 they run the economic situation they have 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.289
 touched many families of the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.170
 unemployment 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.990
 the houses that are missing immigrants who 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.729
 the war is coming, someone breaks out 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.470
 will say but it takes courage to say 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.899
 happy Easter 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.720
 it does not take courage but it must be said 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.420
 because it is Jesus who came to take away 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.569
 that stone that allows us to believe 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.560
 that light is still possible to make 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.630
 Easter and feel the strength in the heart 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.959
 certainty that one cannot write to the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.509
 word enough because you know all the 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.520
 times we write the word is enough 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.720
 it is we who put ourselves into it 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.880
 tomb 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.730
 we are the ones who no longer know how to look 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.849
 which part of the light is jesus every year 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.430
 come back to tell us believe in the light look for the 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:22.800
 light and above all live with us if 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.410
 we leaf through the gospel of Jesus there 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.500
 we realize how everything he has 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.490
 fact was done in the light of 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.220
 Easter 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.750
 imagine meet the Samaritan woman e 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.480
 that woman changes life 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.090
 what a passage that made her or 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.030
 zaccheo that comes down from the tree and changes 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.690
 life or the Samaritan who was on the ground e 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.600
 the gentleman puts him back at the easter 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.700
 that means having one 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.330
 different view a different way of 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.110
 to see things not only see this 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.210
 that is ugly and sorry but knowing 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.120
 also grasp the positive 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.840
 I always say there are so many puddles 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.960
 but there is also the sky there is so much darkness but 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.980
 there is also light there is rain but it is there 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.100
 the sun 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.280
 here we look at what matters this 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.400
 that is what is good if this is true 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.990
 we do this we commit ourselves here 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.630
 that then we can have a good Easter 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.630
 to say indeed we need all of 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.480
 to hear us say Happy Easter, I wish that 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.690
 this Easter wish of hope of 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.200
 resurrection enter the heart of all of 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.110
 all in a particular way in the heart of 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.720
 those who suffer from those who have 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.250
 the body offended by the disease or us 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.800
 they have a broken heart 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.410
 happy Easter to you too the gentleman is 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.000
 with us next and this leaves us 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.520
 to hope 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.920
 let's look around and see that 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.460
 he is there is that caress of god not 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.850
 it lacks 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.800
 Happy Easter to all young people that their 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.530
 they have life in their hands as they can 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.810
 look to the future with hope 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.690
 but the elderly call elderly seniors 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.300
 load of life on the shoulders but there is 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.400
 always that ray of sunshine that shines e 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.400
 which also shines for them a good one 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.030
 Easter to all children to all 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.549
 families 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.220
 we are not offending you, I say 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.750
 Happy Easter to immigrants who 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.420
 they too can make the transition 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.630
 and can find a different life e 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.500
 they can hope for a different future 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.240
 Jesus is risen and if he is risen 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.690
 means attentive to us there may be 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.750
 he said after three days 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.420
 I just don't want to stay in a tomb but 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.570
 I want to live with them and for them us 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.030
 we remove the stones from our heart 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.790
 because we can and want too 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.850
 see the light the light of hope 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.750
 of joy and then wishes for good 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.240
 Easter 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.980

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.980
