set number seven two eight zero contains
two<00:00:23.130> pieces<00:00:23.840> recommended<00:00:24.840> building<00:00:25.230> ages<00:00:25.470> are

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
two pieces recommended building ages are

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.380 
two pieces recommended building ages are
5<00:00:25.950> through<00:00:26.189> 12<00:00:28.040> so<00:00:29.040> I'm<00:00:29.160> taking<00:00:29.399> it<00:00:29.640> you're

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
5 through 12 so I'm taking it you're

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.220 
5 through 12 so I'm taking it you're
getting<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:31.189> one<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.310> each<00:00:35.750> here's<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.960> back

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.630 

let's<00:00:40.230> open<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.250> what's<00:00:41.430> inside

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
let's open it up and see what's inside

00:00:41.640 --> 00:01:02.150 
let's open it up and see what's inside
it<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:44.420> packaged<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.750> shrink<00:00:46.290> wrap

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.340 

okay

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.560 

so<00:01:08.549> indeed<00:01:09.549> we<00:01:09.729> do<00:01:09.909> have<00:01:09.940> two<00:01:10.299> pieces<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:13.330> here

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
so indeed we do have two pieces so here

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.680 
so indeed we do have two pieces so here
we<00:01:13.690> have<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.520> crossroad<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.880> straight

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
we have the crossroad and the straight

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.430 
we have the crossroad and the straight
road<00:01:20.170> base<00:01:20.619> plates<00:01:21.210> these<00:01:22.210> are<00:01:22.479> measured<00:01:22.869> 32

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
road base plates these are measured 32

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.260 
road base plates these are measured 32
by<00:01:23.619> 32<00:01:23.920> studs<00:01:24.399> they<00:01:24.850> are<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.149> Darkrai<00:01:25.860> with

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
by 32 studs they are the Darkrai with

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.590 
by 32 studs they are the Darkrai with
white<00:01:28.270> print<00:01:28.659> work<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.970> one<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.330> course<00:01:31.360> has

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
white print work this one of course has

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.770 
white print work this one of course has
a<00:01:32.049> six<00:01:32.860> stud<00:01:33.069> wide<00:01:33.280> sidewalk<00:01:33.909> on<00:01:34.210> either<00:01:34.479> side

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
a six stud wide sidewalk on either side

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.279 
a six stud wide sidewalk on either side
of<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.960> road<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:36.550> of<00:01:36.640> course<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:37.289> crossroad

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
of the road and of course the crossroad

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.149 
of the road and of course the crossroad
has<00:01:38.619> four<00:01:39.399> six<00:01:40.149> by<00:01:40.390> six<00:01:40.750> studs<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.950> will<00:01:45.069> be

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
has four six by six studs this will be

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.930 
has four six by six studs this will be
perfect<00:01:45.399> for<00:01:45.670> any<00:01:45.970> lego<00:01:46.750> city<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.850> uptown<00:01:50.940> it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
perfect for any lego city like uptown it

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.300 
perfect for any lego city like uptown it
is<00:01:52.090> flat<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.780> smooth<00:01:53.380> for<00:01:53.649> vehicles<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.100> drive

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
is flat and smooth for vehicles to drive

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.969 
is flat and smooth for vehicles to drive
across<00:01:57.509> let's<00:01:58.509> talk<00:01:58.780> about<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.319> pros<00:01:59.649> of

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
across let's talk about the pros of

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.760 
across let's talk about the pros of
these<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.810> course<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.229> will<00:02:02.289> save<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> lot<00:02:02.709> of

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
these of course it will save a lot of

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.529 
these of course it will save a lot of
time<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.459> make<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.850> roads<00:02:04.360> for<00:02:04.570> your<00:02:04.719> city

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
time to make the roads for your city

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.300 
time to make the roads for your city
everything<00:02:07.539> is<00:02:07.630> printed<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.690> cons<00:02:10.989> are<00:02:11.320> that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
everything is printed the cons are that

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.270 
everything is printed the cons are that
these<00:02:12.549> are<00:02:12.880> sewed<00:02:13.180> together<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:14.799> example

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
these are sewed together so for example

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.680 
these are sewed together so for example
if<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.549> needed<00:02:16.410> straight<00:02:17.410> aways<00:02:17.650> or<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
if you needed straight aways or just the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.800 
if you needed straight aways or just the
intersections<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:22.180> will<00:02:22.299> be<00:02:22.420> totally

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
intersections it will be totally

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.259 
intersections it will be totally
impossible<00:02:22.930> because<00:02:23.769> they<00:02:24.489> are<00:02:24.549> only<00:02:24.730> sold<00:02:25.120> in

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
impossible because they are only sold in

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.460 
impossible because they are only sold in
groups<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.780> two<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.820> if<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.030> wanted<00:02:28.470> six

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
groups of two so if you wanted six

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.670 
groups of two so if you wanted six
straightaways<00:02:29.920> we're<00:02:30.220> also<00:02:30.340> getting<00:02:30.579> six

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
straightaways we're also getting six

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.710 
straightaways we're also getting six
intersections<00:02:32.680> that's<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.549> bummer<00:02:33.790> I'm<00:02:34.540> not

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
intersections that's a bummer I'm not

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.770 
intersections that's a bummer I'm not
sure<00:02:34.930> why<00:02:35.170> Lego<00:02:35.650> sells<00:02:36.130> them<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.640> way<00:02:36.820> it'd

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
sure why Lego sells them that way it'd

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.160 
sure why Lego sells them that way it'd
be<00:02:37.900> nice<00:02:38.079> that<00:02:38.290> they<00:02:38.410> sold<00:02:38.709> them<00:02:38.859> separately

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
be nice that they sold them separately

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.330 
be nice that they sold them separately
so<00:02:41.170> if<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.470> wanted<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.010> buy<00:02:43.620> seven<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.739> these<00:02:44.920> I

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
so if I wanted to buy seven of these I

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.870 
so if I wanted to buy seven of these I
don't<00:02:46.030> have<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.420> buy<00:02:46.600> seven<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
don't have to buy seven of the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.319 
don't have to buy seven of the
intersections<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.530> indeed<00:02:51.130> there<00:02:51.609> are<00:02:51.640> two

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
intersections so indeed there are two

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.789 
intersections so indeed there are two
base<00:02:52.600> plates<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.430> is<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.910> straight<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
base plates so this is the straight and

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.490 
base plates so this is the straight and
