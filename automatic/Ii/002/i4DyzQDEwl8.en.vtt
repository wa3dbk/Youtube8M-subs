00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
really interesting ideas but it does

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.280 
really interesting ideas but it does

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
spike some concern particularly if you

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.470 
spike some concern particularly if you
travel<00:02:49.650> abroad<00:02:49.740> what<00:02:50.520> happens<00:02:50.880> if<00:02:51.090> you're<00:02:51.330> at
