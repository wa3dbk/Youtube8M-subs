00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.380
 the staff today our application in 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.570
 highlighting takes advantage of the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.780
 touch of smartphones and tablets to use 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.730
 this gadget in our the game set or 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.960
 You enjoy that you already have a screen 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.869
 touch sensitive and instead of you 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 buy a keyboard have this built in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.300
 you explore this screen to combine and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.939
 with their peripherals at the time of the game 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 the application is called a power grid and it is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.820
 developed by the racket is a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.710
 which also develops peripherals for 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.420
 games how it works 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.640
 you have an ep that you install on your 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.800
 apparatus which can be the android 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.390
 and you also need to test an application on 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.440
 computer and these two will switch 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.450
 information 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 so here I already have scattered it's 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.460
 very complicated you just have to put 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.780
 your computer's ip and they can 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 exchange information 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.579
 the first screen the system displays and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.829
 this summary of information from the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.090
 then you have information about 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.770
 how is the frequency of 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.180
 each processor core the space 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.310
 free thank us free frog to that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.850
 the amount of pilot download network 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.460
 in use 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.210
 do you have an overview of your 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.340
 system 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.110
 the other screens by default we have 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.560
 here in the field where you can 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.689
 make a facebook feed and twitter 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.220
 subscribe rss and this is interesting 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.270
 because you can see this app 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.670
 means to make the entire screen then to the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.710
 central android notifications came up 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 so it's cool you have this flap one 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.470
 which is also very useful and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.570
 volume control 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.670
 so you see that I can change 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.290
 increase sound download 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.049
 after controlling the microphone and has also 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.579
 here the music controls advance to 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.189
 and that will also work with 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.180
 most players today available 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.159
 for windows 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.350
 but the good news is not necessarily 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.140
 these three patterns in these three tabs 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.909
 but these are two additional 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 Both these I can do what I 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.530
 For example here I put the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.799
 flaps 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.880
 I have another one that is not trackpad 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.350
 I know the catastrophe that happened 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.170
 with your mouse you may have a 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.240
 idea of ​​having to use it here but it is 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.280
 you can change these two classes then 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.050
 for example I set her and this is done 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.670
 through software 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.410
 you can choose which water you want 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.090
 Do you want to put here even the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.430
 adjustments are quite accurate so I can 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.630
 create new buttons change to cycling of 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.520
 action each 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.130
 I can create a good screen 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.750
 customized to each to each 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.430
 thing that I want to do 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.190
 The problem is that as a good software 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.630
 advanced he also worked then until 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.730
 you learn how you ride your 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.140
 itself may be that you do 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.700
 job 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.400
 fortunately phuket already has a 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.590
 legal library of ready-made grills 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.300
 for games like lol dota and even 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.000
 productivity applications then you 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.550
 have a lipo photoshop cs 6 you too 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.410
 has while showing an interface by 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.450
 flaps so even if you do not have 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.430
 patience to learn how to set up a 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.700
 you already have a legal library and 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.600
 which will already help in a series of games 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.780
 here to show a little of the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.180
 interface on the computer that already has 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.430
 those behind the pre-defined grids 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.040
 against portuguese in portugal we 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.140
 we have funny as grills but the 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.390
 we have here some standards 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.070
 I already installed additional you go 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.030
 being here I came across a defeat 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.579
 I created one here and it was very bad. 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.260
 here is a package for you to do 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.720
 these changes are very easy, you? 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.269
 comes here in the editor for example the touch 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.709
 stirring the boot grid 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.410
 so I want to create an add button 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.780
 or try it yourself on this very complicated 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.100
 tree of all possibilities and this 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.620
 is a great thing of the program and does the 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.010
 Whatever you want then comes for example 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.440
 a team here of size when four 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.190
 lines and this can change the color I can 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.190
 changing the format is well it is very varied that 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.140
 the modifications and so I finish 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.200
 I can add the grid stayed 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.989
 to vote a personal and move it 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.519
 so I just added an evil team 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.800
 aligned here and when you apply here 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.739
 I'm going to make this change in this grid and 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.700
 as soon as I did apply change it on 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.310
 tablet 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.169
 now this screen that will have beyond 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.220
 buttons that already had the standard these two 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.680
 here I added a lot of bad but it 's him 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.480
 It's cool of him that you can see has 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.560
 a lot of function here you can create 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.090
 you have system information 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.260
 interactions with programs like teens pink 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.360
 thing and such 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.490
 only as you can see also at the same time 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.930
 time it is not so simple every thing 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.130
 has a series of adjustments and modifications 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.450
 such 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.550
 so if you have the patience you 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.060
 get the screen you want 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.190
 go there by your keyboard and such 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.380
 if you do not have the patience just pick up 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.479
 some of the borders where the 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.310
 already done and download to your 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.720
 computer processing and quiet 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.669
 the process has an idea of ​​how it 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.930
 works and interacting here computer 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.550
 I'll show you this tab 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.740
 freight that is sure to be very useful 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.630
 for those who use this program a lot is the 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.740
 first button it will call flex on itself 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.120
 do you know if there what change the 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.110
 thing and such settings 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.930
 I opened a game with csa only one 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.639
 A little nostalgic here but for you to see 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.120
 here is the indication of the 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.940
 flaps and here I can get started 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.380
 already started recording the recording does not 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.190
 need to play you do not have to pay 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.240
 this monkey 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.350
 so you see here I am 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.510
 getting to record and stop 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.410
 It's just a detail that is why at 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.990
 Sometimes you have to have a little patience. 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.080
 to set things up are for 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.400
 example of a print on the flaps but 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.860
 some buttons you will sometimes have 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.070
 problems like the button that switches to 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.900
 position here gives the frame counter of the 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.789
 flex is a button that has a function 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.000
 Also in the game you'll see that I'm going 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.800
 being able to change is migrating to 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.430
 Changing the corner of the screen is this 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.229
 indication 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.599
 but at the same time the same button that does 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.210
 the print screen there for steam games 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.889
 In some moments you will have to 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.389
 pick up and make some adjustments and whistle 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.130
 proença will have to change there in the flex 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.010
 shortcut button and then change here 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.380
 but with another setting you see that it 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.620
 gain no much functionality 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.460
 Nice to the screen as nothing in the world is 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.419
 grace 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.590
 this application does not need to use 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.930
 necessarily peripheral racket 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.750
 I'm using here 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.580
 from other manufacturers and such 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.949
 it has only one limitation which is the 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.650
 number of screens present here and see that 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.449
 I have three of the standards and 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.860
 that I added I have 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.169
 only two 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.610
 so if I want more than this I will 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.720
 having to buy an area 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.090
 additional 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.669
 it's costing 99 cents and 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.340
 so you can make the switch saw 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.780
 software for example I'm going to play another 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.240
 thing that does not need the dowry I can 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.370
 change this here and apply and enter only 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.080
 that if you want to escape this 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.820
 problem of having to stay the whole time 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.979
 changing the tabs if you have to pay 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.289
 by some additional spaces 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:07.990
 You can see where it can live so much. 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.490
 well with these two here but if you 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.900
 need in the end is not 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.400
 so expensive and remembering that this here 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.340
 works with appliances 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.800
 then the android and the app itself is 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.660
 free and does not depend on peripherals 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.740
 so I think it's a good 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.169
 business 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.630
 So this one is the power grid is ours. 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.380
 The highlight of the time we see ourselves in a 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.979
 next video 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.979
 a hug
