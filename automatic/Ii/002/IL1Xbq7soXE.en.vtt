 Thank you, thank you 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.050
 the initial situation was clear the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.230
 possibility today our very good 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.840
 Round off to crown dick too 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.710
 to put exclamation points underscore 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.379
 it is in the cup alone about the result we 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.860
 We knew that personally and also 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.080
 are vigorously at the stop and knew 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.600
 the severity of the task here schalke 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.170
 then we have to insist 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.900
 decided to flat in the 4-4-2 today 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.720
 play and a first first half 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.520
 played very well defended very well 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.979
 still tactically defended well and it 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.119
 It became more and more difficult for us 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.280
 Schalke in the second half of the gate 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.659
 to prevent and prevent opportunities 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.340
 then deservedly have mine 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.280
 also accept the compensation 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.130
 need and an extraordinary answer 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 had very effective today 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.060
 scored a beautiful goal and one 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.000
 answer the gate was not so in the air 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 and tell us what we did today 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.990
 in an extraordinary way 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.689
 rewarded with an incredible 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.850
 team spirit with a will to 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.950
 spending with passion and 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.390
 with heart and have us too 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.329
 rewards many many away games for many 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.479
 in this round of the we that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.770
 had a look though we clearly 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.750
 had more game shares though we did 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.820
 were dominant 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.250
 today it was the other way round and that is 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.060
 of course, especially in the cup 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.120
 decisive 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.330
 that is why we are very very happy and 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.340
 I am very proud of the team 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.000
 be many potatoes jens cellar 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.000
 comment on the game 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.080
 I think in the first half had 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.150
 we are uncertain of my team 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.250
 seen that the last few weeks are not so 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.010
 have gone round 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.959
 we did not make it to the front 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.810
 conz torchancen rauszuspielen pressure on 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.820
 but I think we have 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.640
 also little approved in the rear 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.380
 It has nevertheless been compact 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.870
 the workers against the ball one has the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.980
 guys, they definitely want to 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.770
 but they have a certain 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.890
 uncertainty and admiration 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:05.300
 immediately punished with a mistake from us 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.220
 to 1 0 and all the more surprising or 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.470
 the more enthusiastic I was then take 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.209
 The ones who have come out the outside are always the ones 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.880
 second half have started 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.470
 until thomas kratsch and said enormous 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.260
 pressure to be developed and numerous 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.560
 played out and I believe 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.180
 not that mainz more than twice in the 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.239
 second half before our goal came 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.130
 is and therefore it is natural for us 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 it was disappointing that we did not 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.370
 have progressed 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.510
 but I can not do the team 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.400
 make an accusation 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.650
 who brought out everything from himself and 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.060
 when thomas says they look for you 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.860
 long preliminary are tired 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.170
 I think with the English weeks the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.970
 the team has already had again 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.950
 impressive as they are in the second 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.049
 halfway to its limits 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.079
 and absolutely wanted to win the game 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.060
 and after 1 1, I was sure that 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.680
 we've done the thing and now 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.739
 that we are still in the regular time 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.239
 play for us 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.670
 then we have made since the second error 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.549
 in the game and slept there and there 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.260
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, the gate fell 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.690
 and then we do not have those anymore 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.340
 morals in the boys still everything 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.769
 have tried to turn the game and 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.420
 to come back again 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.019
 but unfortunately they do not have it anymore 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.750
 made 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.849
 thank you in return for your questions 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.989
 jens keller and thomas or may 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.989
 I briefly ask the hand signal 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:35.009
 all already woman christmas mood then 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:35.009
 I have timo mÃ¼ller 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.599
 how do you have the scene with you ? 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.499
 experienced jermaine jones and what is there 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.499
 exactly occurred 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:51.610
 yes, I was so terribly frightened 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:54.309
 about the foul looking bad 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.499
 from my perspective in the theater i 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:59.679
 have me as I said really very 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:02.259
 scared and I was sure that 

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:05.289
 The marco may even be injured 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.909
 is badly hurt and got me 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:14.559
 startled by the way of the 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:16.419
 I'll ful and be in for the year 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.550
 the reaction went there 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.080
 Germain has been there several times 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.269
 sorry to marco and i'm too 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.219
 he said he wanted to go 

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:26.080
 both wanted to get him apart 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.699
 push away and pushed him away 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.610
 and said he does not need 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.569
 apologize if he enters before 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.979
 and from this has a word fight 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.669
 relax in that but nobody 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.569
 was insulting and nothing bad 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.309
 was said 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.719
 it was just back and forth and there 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:43.240
 Referee then has to me 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.369
 said that he has no choice I 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.680
 have to enter the field and that it 

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:49.499
 not allowed me and therefore he has to 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.800
 send me to the tribune 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:52.800
 that story 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.300
 heiko bushman here to the left 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.629
 Mr. Keller was able to do something 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.580
 injury by julian draxler 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:09.090
 No, we have to wait until tomorrow 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.469
 until pictures are taken 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.330
 any problems on the knee but exactly 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.819
 we can not say what he has yet 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.840
 Of course I hope that to the 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.000
 not only excrete a serious 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.280
 injury of julian to come 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.199
 yet we are staffed of course 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.270
 not so bedded on roses at the moment 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.199
 and if he will be longer 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.830
 Of course not optimal for us 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:34.120
 philipp selldorf up here 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.659

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.020
 Meanwhile , emotions leave ten seconds 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.639

 stand up better 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:57.159
