00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.120 
in his role with this defense I found it
interesting<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:38.970> trying<00:01:39.360> out

Terence<00:01:41.130> Newman<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> slot<00:01:42.180> something

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
Terence Newman in the slot something

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.999 
Terence Newman in the slot something
that<00:01:42.750> Newman<00:01:43.079> had<00:01:43.229> done<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.590> Mike<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.950> the

field but I think a lot of it's going to

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.110 
field but I think a lot of it's going to
depend<00:05:00.200> on<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.710> reliability<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.700> timing

depend on the reliability and the timing

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.240 
depend on the reliability and the timing
and<00:05:02.240> if<00:05:02.300> Cordero<00:05:02.720> can't<00:05:03.050> pick<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:03.530> up<00:05:03.560> he

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
and if Cordero can't pick that up he

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.680 
and if Cordero can't pick that up he
might<00:05:04.400> just<00:05:04.640> be<00:05:04.790> a<00:05:04.820> kick<00:05:05.090> returner<00:05:05.420> and<00:05:05.600> a

looks<00:05:45.350> like<00:05:45.530> a<00:05:45.560> good<00:05:45.770> one<00:05:45.830> at<00:05:46.070> this<00:05:46.220> point<00:05:46.490> in

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
looks like a good one at this point in

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.550 
looks like a good one at this point in
the<00:05:46.640> offseason<00:05:46.790> and<00:05:47.330> obviously<00:05:47.960> Adam<00:05:48.260> Thielen

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
the offseason and obviously Adam Thielen

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.440 
the offseason and obviously Adam Thielen
has<00:05:48.680> taken<00:05:49.070> what<00:05:49.250> he<00:05:49.430> did<00:05:49.760> last<00:05:49.790> year<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:50.270> is

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
has taken what he did last year and is

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.270 
has taken what he did last year and is
built<00:05:50.720> on<00:05:50.900> that<00:05:51.170> and<00:05:51.380> he<00:05:51.410> looks<00:05:51.890> like<00:05:51.950> a<00:05:52.040> more

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
built on that and he looks like a more

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.220 
built on that and he looks like a more
refined<00:05:52.580> receiver<00:05:53.030> as<00:05:53.240> well<00:05:53.480> in<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.810> reliable
