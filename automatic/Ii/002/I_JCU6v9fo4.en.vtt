but most of the time I like to use the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
but most of the time I like to use the
same<00:00:23.820> deck<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.109> AI<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:27.330> put<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> down<00:00:28.050> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
same deck of the AI and put it down to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.259 
same deck of the AI and put it down to
major<00:00:28.470> difficulty<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.460> way<00:00:29.699> you've<00:00:29.970> got<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
major difficulty that way you've got the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.120 
major difficulty that way you've got the
same<00:00:30.510> strengths<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> weaknesses<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.800> what

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
same strengths and weaknesses of what

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.340 
same strengths and weaknesses of what
they<00:00:32.309> get<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.239> based<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.050> lot<00:00:34.290> on

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
they get so it's really based a lot on

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.000 
they get so it's really based a lot on
the<00:00:35.040> lack<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.579> cards<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.380> if<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.770> at
