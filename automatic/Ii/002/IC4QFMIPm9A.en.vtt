00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
better like that hat this bridle and the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.979 
better like that hat this bridle and the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
saddle and saddle pad and I think this

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.139 
saddle and saddle pad and I think this
our<00:00:58.199> pad<00:00:58.500> should<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:59.039> been<00:00:59.219> blue<00:00:59.460> to<00:01:00.030> match

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
our pad should have been blue to match

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.840 
our pad should have been blue to match
the<00:01:00.449> bridle<00:01:00.980> but<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.520> where<00:01:02.699> they

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the bridle but I can see where they

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.340 
the bridle but I can see where they
would<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> pink<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> blue

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
would get the pink but I think the blue

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890 
would get the pink but I think the blue
would<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.650> been<00:01:04.830> better<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.939> um<00:01:06.210> yeah<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
would have been better but um yeah I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.560 
would have been better but um yeah I
just<00:01:07.049> need<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:07.830> English<00:01:08.340> set<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> then
