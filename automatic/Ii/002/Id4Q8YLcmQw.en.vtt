00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.840
 excom enemy wifi video analysis 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.390
 long ago I had the pleasure of making 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.670
 excom enemy unknown that despite some 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.259
 slight flaws knew how to win his 9 in 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.240
 virtue of his reinvention of a 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.430
 franchise recognized for its extreme 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.680
 difficulty and complexity a couple of times 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.300
 later it is fair axis brings us enemy 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.920
 within an expansion amount of 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.620
 enough material for dawn 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.460
 a superior note but that nevertheless 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.350
 they suffer some of spaces of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.699
 importance nothing has changed as soon as 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.589
 to the game goes refers the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.150
 aliens invade and the initiative 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.769
 excom will try to stop us 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.480
 our goal is to manage the base 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.100
 of operations and dealing with emergencies in 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.110
 everyone when it is detected 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.670
 alien presence these encounters in 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.559
 turn-based strategy bouts are 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.640
 they keep as tense as always just 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.830
 that now add the possibility of 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.360
 collect mix mails in most 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.860
 of the missions elements that 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.659
 they find in containers that they self 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.339
 will destroy after a certain amount of 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.170
 turns this changes the way you approach 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.909
 the missions because instead of moving 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.560
 calmly we will have to risk 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.390
 move forward as fast as we can 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.250
 In order to avoid losing the precious mel 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.600
 we will use the new element to equip 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.490
 our soldiers of modifications 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.170
 genetics that will improve their attributes and 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.610
 skills and implement the parts 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.350
 biomechanics to adapt to the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.890
 great meics powerful means of 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.630
 combat 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.520
 can give the enemy a true 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.570
 headache also discovered 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.040
 new modifications of the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.750
 investigation of the alien bodies 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.729
 obtained in combats transforming 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.440
 our troop in a true strength of 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.750
 shock maybe that's why a juanÃ­n de 2 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.220
 dangerous new vector enemies 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.810
 what is that sector and detour 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.670
 mechanically operated summers of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.990
 combat whose huge energy levels 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.090
 and attack power can put you in check 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.340
 to a group of inexperienced soldiers and the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.720
 terrors seekers some damn robots 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.820
 fliers that possess the unpleasant 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.470
 grace to become invisible and look 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.119
 specifically those members of the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.070
 squad that we left alone for asia 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.869
 seem them from nowhere and strangle the 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.759
 these bugs are presented in the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.830
 first missions and each new encounter 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.080
 it will be a nightmare should we not 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.910
 forget to exalted a new faction this 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.619
 constantly trying 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.940
 against excom we can investigate your 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.800
 trigger when sending an operative 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.539
 undercover to discover one of his 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.250
 cells what will culminate a combat 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.200
 against these enemies whose rise to 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.150
 emulate our own troops a 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.950
 cute added to the general variety of 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.540
 game to all this adds up a good 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.280
 variety of new armaments and items 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.630
 as well as new maps a line of 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.130
 additional story missions 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.290
 called 'operation but jenni 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.580
 originally planned as own dlc e 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.020
 including a vision 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.060
 the base itself unmeasured by 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.250
 aliens that will mean in game over 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.110
 immediately if they beat us in this 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.520
 instance however they remain 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.320
 many details that have not been 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.090
 solved the vision system follows 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.800
 acting strange with units that can 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.390
 shoot through some walls the 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.070
 soldiers that rise in rank continue 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.960
 choosing random specialties something 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.950
 very annoying when we wait for a support 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.120
 and the game keeps giving us 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.070
 snipers 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.480
 all this is forgivable as 300 points 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.430
 but the real problem is not the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.590
 game itself but its price in pc in the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.570
 winning costs 23 dollars as a download 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.910
 in pc does not require anemia non for 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.280
 work that now costs 40 dollars if 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.020
 well the full package at 63 dollars is 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.370
 slightly reasonable in relation to 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.230
 quality and duration the versions of 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.180
 consoles called n mini wing commander 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.550
 edition already include the original game and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.260
 the additional dlc and it only costs 40 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.850
 dollars is not an affordable pressure to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.230
 those who already own the pc game but yes 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.330
 for new players who want the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.160
 full experience in my pudding is a 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.420
 more than acceptable expansion in terms of 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.040
 contained but still suffering from 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.660
 some bugs from before your version of 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.160
 band in edition for consoles is the 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.720
 recommended product for new 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.459
 players while their courage started 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.810
 is acceptable to those who already have the 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.910
 Previous game for new players 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.830
 I started maybe it would be best to wait 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.160
 in offer 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.440
 the best multiple aggregates that do 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.840
 of the original game something a little more 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.960
 interesting the invasions return to 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.500
 our base the mex are great 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.870
 the worst is not solved bugs that already 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.510
 they were in the original game is very 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.600
 difficult to recommend this expansion due 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.840
 at your price point 8 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.460
