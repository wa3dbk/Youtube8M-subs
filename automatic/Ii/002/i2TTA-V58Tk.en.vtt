and<00:01:45.780> power<00:01:46.020> button<00:01:46.320> we're<00:01:46.829> using<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> device

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and power button we're using the device

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.789 
and power button we're using the device
the<00:01:47.490> expected<00:01:47.880> surge<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> push<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.680> be

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the expected surge is push here to be

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.780 
the expected surge is push here to be
able<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> hit<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
able to hit it you actually have to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
able to hit it you actually have to
almost<00:01:51.329> lift<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> device<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> hit<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
almost lift up the device and hit the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.319 
almost lift up the device and hit the
button<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.890> below<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.820> right<00:01:54.030> there

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
button down below see it's right there

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
button down below see it's right there
so<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.570> hit<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> top<00:01:55.049> you're<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so you hit the top you're not going to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.469 
so you hit the top you're not going to
make<00:01:56.250> them<00:01:56.340> contact<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.180> become<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
make them contact so that's become a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.030 
make them contact so that's become a
little<00:01:57.630> bit<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> annoying<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.619> you're<00:01:58.799> used<00:01:58.950> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
little bit of annoying if you're used to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.280 
little bit of annoying if you're used to
using<00:01:59.189> an<00:01:59.399> iPhone<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.969> example<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
using an iPhone for example you have to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.780 
using an iPhone for example you have to
sort<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> reconfigure<00:02:02.070> how<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.340> fingers<00:02:02.640> are

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
sort of reconfigure how your fingers are

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.700 
sort of reconfigure how your fingers are
something<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.479> found<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> bit

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
something that I just found to be a bit

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.260 
something that I just found to be a bit
of<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.860> pain<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.579> same<00:02:05.759> thing<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
of a pain and the same thing is going to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.499 
of a pain and the same thing is going to
be<00:02:06.360> true<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.500> volume<00:02:07.890> buttons<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
be true with the volume buttons on the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.780 
be true with the volume buttons on the
so<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.869> also<00:02:11.079> packing<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:12.129> 1/4

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
so this is also packing the 1/4

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so this is also packing the 1/4
system-on-a-chip

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
system-on-a-chip

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.080 
system-on-a-chip
clock<00:02:14.709> being<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.099> just<00:02:15.340> about<00:02:15.519> 1<00:02:15.760> gigahertz

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
clock being it just about 1 gigahertz

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.839 
clock being it just about 1 gigahertz
and<00:02:16.329> this<00:02:16.480> thing<00:02:16.659> is<00:02:16.780> very<00:02:17.140> very<00:02:17.530> very<00:02:17.890> fast

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
and this thing is very very very fast

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.149 
and this thing is very very very fast
certainly<00:02:19.480> it's<00:02:19.689> capable<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.290> handling<00:02:20.500> you

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
certainly it's capable of handling you

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.429 
certainly it's capable of handling you

know all the multitasking that's iOS 4

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.740 
know all the multitasking that's iOS 4
is<00:02:23.709> going<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.980> bring<00:02:24.250> but<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.120> also<00:02:25.269> now<00:02:25.599> is

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
is going to bring but it also now is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.179 
is going to bring but it also now is
going<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.959> be<00:02:26.049> very<00:02:26.230> capable<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.739> handling<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
going to be very capable of handling the

3d games then making their way into the
App<00:02:31.329> Store<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> lot<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.829> racing<00:02:33.310> games

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
App Store so a lot of the racing games

App Store so a lot of the racing games
and<00:02:33.849> all<00:02:33.939> the<00:02:34.030> sites<00:02:34.239> are<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.870> build

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
and all the sites are now going to build

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.530 
and all the sites are now going to build
up<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.230> form<00:02:35.500> as<00:02:35.739> they<00:02:36.220> would<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:36.730> an<00:02:36.849> iPhone<00:02:37.239> 4

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
up the form as they would on an iPhone 4

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.149 
up the form as they would on an iPhone 4
you're<00:02:38.140> gonna<00:02:38.230> be<00:02:38.349> able<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.560> really<00:02:38.709> get<00:02:38.890> that

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
you're gonna be able to really get that

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.580 
you're gonna be able to really get that
is<00:02:39.250> immersive<00:02:39.609> graphics<00:02:40.239> on<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.930> mobile<00:02:41.200> device

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
is immersive graphics on a mobile device

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.190 
is immersive graphics on a mobile device
so<00:02:41.799> certainly<00:02:42.099> kudos<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:43.180> Apple<00:02:43.480> for<00:02:43.750> doing

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
so certainly kudos to Apple for doing
