all right two one on John well today

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.730 
all right two one on John well today
we've<00:00:10.340> had<00:00:10.520> the<00:00:10.670> pleasure<00:00:10.879> of<00:00:11.410> finding<00:00:12.410> out

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
we've had the pleasure of finding out

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.320 
we've had the pleasure of finding out
that<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.010> transmission<00:00:13.639> jack<00:00:13.880> that<00:00:14.120> we<00:00:14.210> were

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
that the transmission jack that we were

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.669 
that the transmission jack that we were
planning<00:00:14.540> on<00:00:14.719> using<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:15.080> lift<00:00:15.320> up<00:00:15.469> the

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
planning on using to lift up the

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.440 
planning on using to lift up the
transmission<00:00:16.309> from<00:00:16.430> his<00:00:16.610> Ford<00:00:16.849> Explorer<00:00:17.240> with

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
transmission from his Ford Explorer with

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.030 
transmission from his Ford Explorer with
his<00:00:17.570> transfer<00:00:17.960> case<00:00:18.200> just<00:00:18.500> wasn't<00:00:18.830> going<00:00:18.980> to

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
his transfer case just wasn't going to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.920 
his transfer case just wasn't going to
be<00:00:19.099> big<00:00:19.279> enough<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:20.000> didn't<00:00:20.750> have<00:00:20.869> enough

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
be big enough and didn't have enough

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.250 
be big enough and didn't have enough
reach<00:00:21.380> to<00:00:21.410> climb<00:00:21.859> up<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.779> reach<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:23.960> actual

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
reach to climb up to reach the actual

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.859 
reach to climb up to reach the actual
transmission<00:00:25.119> because<00:00:26.119> the<00:00:26.270> truck<00:00:26.480> had<00:00:26.660> to<00:00:26.779> be

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
transmission because the truck had to be

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.000 
transmission because the truck had to be
high<00:00:27.020> enough<00:00:27.080> off<00:00:27.350> the<00:00:27.380> ground<00:00:27.710> to<00:00:27.859> get<00:00:27.949> the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
high enough off the ground to get the

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.650 
high enough off the ground to get the
transmission<00:00:28.400> out<00:00:28.730> from<00:00:28.880> underneath<00:00:29.119> it<00:00:29.390> we

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
transmission out from underneath it we

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.990 
transmission out from underneath it we
needed<00:00:29.900> a<00:00:29.960> pretty<00:00:30.199> long<00:00:30.439> reach<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:31.519> get<00:00:31.670> to<00:00:31.910> the

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
needed a pretty long reach to get to the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.549 
needed a pretty long reach to get to the
transmission<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.780> regular<00:00:33.110> floor<00:00:33.320> jack

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
transmission and the regular floor jack

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.759 
transmission and the regular floor jack
wasn't<00:00:33.949> quite<00:00:34.129> long<00:00:34.970> enough<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.390> do<00:00:35.510> that<00:00:35.739> so<00:00:36.739> I

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
wasn't quite long enough to do that so I

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.170 
wasn't quite long enough to do that so I
did<00:00:37.160> a<00:00:37.190> little<00:00:37.280> research<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:37.969> made<00:00:38.149> a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
did a little research and we made a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.630 
did a little research and we made a
conversion<00:00:38.630> here<00:00:39.079> on<00:00:39.230> our<00:00:39.380> regular<00:00:39.860> normal

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
conversion here on our regular normal

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.889 
conversion here on our regular normal
shop<00:00:40.930> kind<00:00:41.930> of<00:00:42.110> floor<00:00:42.890> jack<00:00:43.210> it's<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.329> normal<00:00:44.629> I

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
shop kind of floor jack it's a normal I

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.180 
shop kind of floor jack it's a normal I
guess<00:00:45.379> two-ton<00:00:46.070> floor<00:00:46.579> jack<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:48.260> bed<00:00:48.920> frame

this<00:00:49.640> bit<00:00:49.879> has<00:00:50.000> somewhat<00:00:50.930> modified<00:00:52.030> as<00:00:53.030> you

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
this bit has somewhat modified as you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.600 
this bit has somewhat modified as you
can<00:00:53.450> see<00:00:53.690> I've<00:00:53.989> essentially<00:00:55.239> duplicated<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
can see I've essentially duplicated the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.150 
can see I've essentially duplicated the
floor<00:00:58.610> Jack's<00:01:01.030> parallelogram<00:01:02.030> system<00:01:03.160> to

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
floor Jack's parallelogram system to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.940 
floor Jack's parallelogram system to
create<00:01:04.399> a<00:01:04.489> new<00:01:04.699> platform<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.750> will<00:01:06.470> reach<00:01:06.680> up

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
create a new platform that will reach up

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.170 
create a new platform that will reach up
to<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.430> transmission<00:01:11.049> and<00:01:12.049> I<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:13.180> changed

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
to the transmission and I have changed

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.929 
to the transmission and I have changed
out<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.320> normal<00:01:18.250> platform<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.369> sits<00:01:19.580> there

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
out the normal platform that sits there

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.080 
out the normal platform that sits there
in<00:01:20.150> favor<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.930> just<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.040> regular<00:01:22.460> half<00:01:22.759> inch

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
in favor of just a regular half inch

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.810 
in favor of just a regular half inch
bolts<00:01:23.810> eight<00:01:24.110> inches<00:01:24.439> long<00:01:24.500> that's<00:01:25.460> resting

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
bolts eight inches long that's resting

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.560 
bolts eight inches long that's resting
on<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:27.710> joint<00:01:28.009> there<00:01:28.250> because<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:29.299> allows

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
on the joint there because that allows

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.450 
on the joint there because that allows
me<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.049> both<00:01:30.470> reach<00:01:30.710> up<00:01:30.920> better<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.340> less

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
me to both reach up better and less

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.060 
me to both reach up better and less
chance<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.030> falling<00:01:32.060> off<00:01:32.479> that<00:01:32.720> platform

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
chance of it falling off that platform

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.140 
chance of it falling off that platform
plus<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.220> allows<00:01:34.430> me<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.729> lower<00:01:34.939> it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
plus it allows me to lower it

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.630 
plus it allows me to lower it
substantially<00:01:35.900> more<00:01:36.079> to<00:01:36.350> give<00:01:37.040> an<00:01:37.159> extra<00:01:37.490> 2

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
substantially more to give an extra 2

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.999 
substantially more to give an extra 2
inches<00:01:37.670> believe<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.329> or<00:01:38.420> not<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.680> can<00:01:39.829> see

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
inches believe it or not so you can see

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.660 
inches believe it or not so you can see
how<00:01:40.250> high<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.729> can<00:01:40.909> actually<00:01:41.090> reach<00:01:42.670> okay

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
how high this can actually reach okay

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.760 
how high this can actually reach okay
you've<00:01:44.210> also<00:01:44.390> probably<00:01:44.750> noticed<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.500> I've

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
you've also probably noticed that I've

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.469 
you've also probably noticed that I've
got<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.040> great<00:01:46.340> big<00:01:46.579> long<00:01:46.790> frame<00:01:47.210> with<00:01:47.360> an

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
got this great big long frame with an

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.170 
got this great big long frame with an
extra<00:01:47.750> pair<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:48.049> wheels<00:01:48.229> up<00:01:48.500> there<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:50.060> that's

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
extra pair of wheels up there and that's

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.020 
extra pair of wheels up there and that's
because<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.899> Ford<00:01:51.320> Explorer<00:01:51.880> combination<00:01:52.880> of

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
because a Ford Explorer combination of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.389 
because a Ford Explorer combination of
the<00:01:53.350> transmission<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.439> transfer<00:01:54.710> case<00:01:55.159> was

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
the transmission and transfer case was

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.069 
the transmission and transfer case was
quite<00:01:55.729> quite<00:01:56.540> heavy<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:59.360> extended<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.049> far

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
quite quite heavy and it extended so far

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.080 
quite quite heavy and it extended so far
beyond<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.829> normal<00:02:01.189> point<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.640> balance<00:02:01.790> of

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
beyond the normal point of balance of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.639 
beyond the normal point of balance of
the<00:02:02.180> jack<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.659> would<00:02:02.780> cause<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.200> tip<00:02:03.469> over

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
the jack that would cause it to tip over

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.139 
the jack that would cause it to tip over
so<00:02:04.040> any<00:02:04.219> of<00:02:04.340> those<00:02:04.430> basically<00:02:04.969> has

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
so any of those basically has

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.169 
so any of those basically has
stabilizers<00:02:05.930> wheelie<00:02:06.229> bars<00:02:06.439> if<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:06.770> like

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
stabilizers wheelie bars if you like

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.759 
stabilizers wheelie bars if you like
okay<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.390> once<00:02:08.780> there<00:02:08.989> is<00:02:09.079> weight<00:02:09.290> under<00:02:09.649> this

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
okay and once there is weight under this

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.470 
okay and once there is weight under this
you<00:02:09.979> may<00:02:10.100> have<00:02:10.190> noticed<00:02:10.429> at<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.579> center<00:02:10.880> we

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
you may have noticed at the center we

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.970 
you may have noticed at the center we
also<00:02:11.630> come<00:02:11.840> up<00:02:11.959> with<00:02:11.989> off<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.380> ground<00:02:12.739> once

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
also come up with off the ground once

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.380 
also come up with off the ground once
the<00:02:13.099> weights<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.640> they<00:02:13.730> actually<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:14.150> touch

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
the weights on it they actually do touch

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.220 
the weights on it they actually do touch
down<00:02:15.129> so<00:02:16.129> it's<00:02:16.250> quite<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:16.819> quite

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
down so it's quite it's quite

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.589 
down so it's quite it's quite
Abell<00:02:17.489> steering<00:02:18.489> wheels<00:02:18.670> front<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.150> back<00:02:19.330> so

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
Abell steering wheels front and back so

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.890 
Abell steering wheels front and back so
it's<00:02:20.019> pretty<00:02:20.230> good<00:02:20.440> okay<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:22.510> join<00:02:22.720> up

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
it's pretty good okay to join up

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.240 
it's pretty good okay to join up
underneath<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.500> transmission<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.099> you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
underneath the transmission that you

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.890 
underneath the transmission that you
decide<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:24.760> best<00:02:24.909> way<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.150> lift<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.659> by<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
decide the best way to lift it is by the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.740 
decide the best way to lift it is by the
edge<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.349> pan<00:02:26.590> rail<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.849> these<00:02:28.030> two<00:02:28.510> are

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
edge of the pan rail so these two are

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.350 
edge of the pan rail so these two are
this<00:02:28.959> big<00:02:29.200> part<00:02:29.379> these<00:02:29.470> four<00:02:29.739> bolts<00:02:30.209> rest<00:02:31.209> up

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
this big part these four bolts rest up

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.630 
this big part these four bolts rest up
against<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> pan<00:02:32.019> rail<00:02:32.370> careful<00:02:33.370> not<00:02:33.459> to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
against the pan rail careful not to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.280 
against the pan rail careful not to
damage<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.239> pan<00:02:34.480> real<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.870> they're

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
damage the pan real and they're

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.229 
damage the pan real and they're
adjustable<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.069> fine-tune<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:37.090> for

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
adjustable so you can fine-tune it for

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.289 
adjustable so you can fine-tune it for
the<00:02:37.299> height<00:02:37.480> angle<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.620> get<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.299> transmission

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
the height angle to get the transmission

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.210 
the height angle to get the transmission
exactly<00:02:41.019> lined<00:02:41.230> up<00:02:41.440> when<00:02:41.650> it's<00:02:41.769> time<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.010> go

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
exactly lined up when it's time to go

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.559 
exactly lined up when it's time to go
back<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.670> especially<00:02:43.239> that's<00:02:43.299> quite

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
back in especially that's quite

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.380 
back in especially that's quite
important<00:02:44.400> okay<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.459> just<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.090> little<00:02:46.239> bit<00:02:46.329> of

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
important okay so just a little bit of

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.410 
important okay so just a little bit of
fine-tuning<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:47.200> get<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.590> all<00:02:47.709> right<00:02:48.420> we've

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
fine-tuning to get it all right we've

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.170 
fine-tuning to get it all right we've
also<00:02:49.629> found<00:02:50.079> these<00:02:50.680> are<00:02:51.040> just<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.400> pieces

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
also found these are just the pieces

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.050 
also found these are just the pieces
from<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.920> legs<00:02:53.920> for<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.400> for<00:02:54.730> them<00:02:54.819> from<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
from the legs for the for them from the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.599 
from the legs for the for them from the
bed<00:02:55.299> rail<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.829> they<00:02:56.829> tend<00:02:57.129> to<00:02:57.190> be<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.340> little

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
bed rail and they tend to be a little

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.550 
bed rail and they tend to be a little
bit<00:02:57.819> flimsy<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.840> under<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.230> weight<00:02:59.349> of<00:02:59.500> that

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
bit flimsy and under the weight of that

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.250 
bit flimsy and under the weight of that
transmission<00:03:00.190> they<00:03:00.489> kind<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.849> pushed<00:03:01.090> out<00:03:01.359> so

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
transmission they kind of pushed out so

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.729 
transmission they kind of pushed out so
I<00:03:02.290> found<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.920> simply<00:03:03.519> adding<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.390> load<00:03:05.379> strap

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
I found that simply adding a load strap

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.490 
I found that simply adding a load strap
around<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.190> outside<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:08.260> those<00:03:08.920> four<00:03:08.980> legs

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
around the outside of those four legs

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.640 
around the outside of those four legs
will<00:03:11.500> allow<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.060> stay<00:03:13.060> nice<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.230> snug<00:03:14.500> up

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
will allow it to stay nice and snug up

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.770 
will allow it to stay nice and snug up
against<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.010> pan<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:16.090> we<00:03:16.209> just<00:03:16.359> put<00:03:16.540> them<00:03:16.660> on

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
against the pan so we just put them on

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.330 
against the pan so we just put them on
there<00:03:16.989> snug<00:03:17.739> them<00:03:17.890> up<00:03:17.920> nice<00:03:18.129> and<00:03:18.160> tight

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
there snug them up nice and tight

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.809 
there snug them up nice and tight
against<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.849> pan<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:20.019> Bob's<00:03:20.319> your<00:03:20.560> uncle<00:03:20.819> so

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
into these slots here the bed rails were

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.160 
into these slots here the bed rails were
actually<00:04:33.230> four<00:04:34.600> it<00:04:35.600> could<00:04:35.750> be<00:04:35.810> used<00:04:35.990> for<00:04:36.050> a

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
actually four it could be used for a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.170 
actually four it could be used for a
double<00:04:36.530> or<00:04:36.680> queen-size<00:04:37.250> or<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.520> king-size<00:04:38.000> so

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
double or queen-size or a king-size so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.000 
double or queen-size or a king-size so
it<00:04:38.300> has<00:04:38.420> various<00:04:38.750> slots<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.320> extend<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.830> rails

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
it has various slots to extend the rails

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.540 
it has various slots to extend the rails
so<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.060> use<00:04:41.300> those<00:04:41.450> same<00:04:41.750> slots<00:04:42.170> to<00:04:42.950> allow<00:04:43.220> me<00:04:43.400> to

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
so I use those same slots to allow me to

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.100 
so I use those same slots to allow me to
move<00:04:43.700> these<00:04:43.850> legs<00:04:44.120> forwards<00:04:44.570> or<00:04:44.660> aft<00:04:44.840> as

up together so you can see I have it

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.980 
up together so you can see I have it
partially<00:05:37.880> dismantled<00:05:39.490> over<00:05:40.490> here<00:05:40.810> okay<00:05:41.810> we

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
partially dismantled over here okay we

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.630 
partially dismantled over here okay we
have<00:05:42.170> the<00:05:42.850> two<00:05:43.850> parallelogram<00:05:44.660> parts<00:05:45.350> and<00:05:45.640> the

have the two parallelogram parts and the
I<00:05:47.330> guess<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.780> part<00:05:47.990> that<00:05:48.140> goes<00:05:48.230> underneath

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
I guess the part that goes underneath

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.090 
I guess the part that goes underneath
the<00:05:49.810> pan<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:51.110> two<00:05:51.230> little<00:05:51.470> legs<00:05:51.620> sticking<00:05:51.980> up

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
the pan the two little legs sticking up

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.820 
the pan the two little legs sticking up
in<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.340> bolts<00:05:52.670> and<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:53.140> big<00:05:54.140> long<00:05:54.350> bolt<00:05:54.650> that

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
in the bolts and the big long bolt that

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.730 
in the bolts and the big long bolt that
I<00:05:54.860> explained<00:05:55.250> about<00:05:55.370> earlier<00:05:56.410> one<00:05:57.410> thing<00:05:57.590> that

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
I explained about earlier one thing that

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.500 
I explained about earlier one thing that
to<00:05:57.920> know<00:05:58.100> is<00:05:58.610> that<00:05:58.880> what<00:05:59.030> I<00:05:59.180> was<00:05:59.330> rather

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
to know is that what I was rather

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.550 
to know is that what I was rather
important<00:05:59.960> with<00:06:00.050> this<00:06:00.140> is<00:06:00.290> that<00:06:00.440> you

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
important with this is that you

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.980 
important with this is that you
carefully<00:06:01.130> carefully<00:06:01.580> measure<00:06:01.990> particularly

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
carefully carefully measure particularly

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.540 
carefully carefully measure particularly
where<00:06:03.140> you<00:06:03.290> drill<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.590> holes<00:06:03.950> because

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
where you drill the holes because

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.010 
where you drill the holes because
remember<00:06:04.760> this<00:06:04.940> is<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.090> parallelogram<00:06:05.540> and<00:06:05.960> in

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
remember this is a parallelogram and in

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.440 
remember this is a parallelogram and in
order<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.320> lift<00:06:06.530> straight<00:06:06.890> everything<00:06:07.880> has<00:06:08.210> to

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
order to lift straight everything has to

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.120 
order to lift straight everything has to
be<00:06:08.570> exactly<00:06:09.080> parallel<00:06:09.650> which<00:06:09.770> means<00:06:09.980> the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
be exactly parallel which means the

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.730 
be exactly parallel which means the
pivot<00:06:10.670> points<00:06:11.030> have<00:06:11.300> to<00:06:11.330> be<00:06:11.540> very<00:06:12.080> exact

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
pivot points have to be very exact

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:23.490 
pivot points have to be very exact
you<00:06:13.310> see<00:06:13.460> both<00:06:13.640> holes<00:06:13.850> money<00:06:15.070> yep

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.800 

so<00:06:24.370> be<00:06:24.730> careful<00:06:24.910> when<00:06:25.270> you<00:06:25.360> measure<00:06:25.570> now

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
so be careful when you measure now

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.660 
so be careful when you measure now
measure<00:06:26.200> twice<00:06:26.500> drill<00:06:26.890> once<00:06:27.100> we<00:06:27.310> hope<00:06:27.490> you'll

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
measure twice drill once we hope you'll

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.300 
measure twice drill once we hope you'll
say<00:06:27.880> right<00:06:28.180> and<00:06:28.650> make<00:06:29.650> sure<00:06:29.800> that<00:06:29.860> you<00:06:29.980> have<00:06:30.160> it

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
say right and make sure that you have it

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.350 
say right and make sure that you have it
right<00:06:30.340> so<00:06:30.730> that<00:06:30.880> when<00:06:31.000> you're<00:06:31.120> putting<00:06:31.270> it

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
right so that when you're putting it

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.390 
right so that when you're putting it
together<00:06:31.510> that<00:06:32.290> it'll<00:06:32.740> lift<00:06:32.920> nice<00:06:33.160> and

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
together that it'll lift nice and

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.740 
together that it'll lift nice and
straight<00:06:33.730> not<00:06:34.030> on<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.210> funky<00:06:34.900> angle<00:06:35.280> I<00:06:36.750> also

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
straight not on a funky angle I also

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.350 
straight not on a funky angle I also
found<00:06:38.530> that<00:06:38.680> the<00:06:39.040> bolts<00:06:39.760> that<00:06:39.850> I<00:06:39.970> used<00:06:40.210> to

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
found that the bolts that I used to

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.230 
found that the bolts that I used to
adjust<00:06:40.690> the<00:06:40.780> pan<00:06:41.080> height<00:06:41.380> in<00:06:41.560> all<00:06:41.650> those<00:06:41.770> four

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
adjust the pan height in all those four

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.010 
adjust the pan height in all those four
adjustable<00:06:43.240> ones<00:06:43.390> I<00:06:43.570> went<00:06:43.750> a<00:06:43.810> little<00:06:43.900> too

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
adjustable ones I went a little too

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.930 
adjustable ones I went a little too
short<00:06:44.440> if<00:06:44.650> you<00:06:44.740> notice<00:06:45.010> over<00:06:45.190> here<00:06:45.340> again<00:06:45.790> the

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
short if you notice over here again the

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.210 
short if you notice over here again the
closer<00:06:46.570> I<00:06:46.810> think<00:06:46.840> 2h<00:06:47.350> bolts<00:06:47.740> I<00:06:47.800> think<00:06:48.070> next

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
closer I think 2h bolts I think next

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.740 
closer I think 2h bolts I think next
time<00:06:48.430> I<00:06:48.460> would<00:06:48.670> have<00:06:48.790> stepped<00:06:48.940> up<00:06:49.150> to<00:06:49.360> 4<00:06:49.630> H

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
time I would have stepped up to 4 H

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.900 
time I would have stepped up to 4 H
bolts<00:06:50.080> to<00:06:50.170> give<00:06:50.320> you<00:06:50.440> more<00:06:50.590> range<00:06:50.920> to<00:06:51.640> get<00:06:51.790> your

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
bolts to give you more range to get your

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.600 
bolts to give you more range to get your
adjustment<00:06:52.390> just<00:06:52.600> the<00:06:52.690> way<00:06:52.810> you<00:06:52.870> like<00:06:53.110> it<00:06:53.610> I

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
adjustment just the way you like it I

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.490 
adjustment just the way you like it I
also<00:06:55.420> had<00:06:55.780> two<00:06:55.960> on<00:06:56.290> one<00:06:56.680> spot<00:06:58.110> add<00:06:59.110> a<00:06:59.140> little

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
also had two on one spot add a little

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.860 
also had two on one spot add a little
tab<00:06:59.770> to<00:07:00.340> move<00:07:00.520> my<00:07:00.640> pivot<00:07:00.850> point<00:07:01.180> slightly<00:07:01.690> and

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
tab to move my pivot point slightly and

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.830 
tab to move my pivot point slightly and
that<00:07:01.900> allowed<00:07:02.770> the<00:07:02.980> jack<00:07:03.880> to<00:07:04.090> come<00:07:04.300> down<00:07:04.540> an

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
that allowed the jack to come down an

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.900 
that allowed the jack to come down an
extra<00:07:05.170> 2<00:07:05.350> inches<00:07:05.710> it<00:07:05.890> was<00:07:06.010> quite<00:07:06.340> significant

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
extra 2 inches it was quite significant

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.190 
extra 2 inches it was quite significant
actually<00:07:07.240> where<00:07:07.360> I<00:07:07.390> had<00:07:07.510> originally<00:07:07.870> put<00:07:08.050> the

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
actually where I had originally put the

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.220 
actually where I had originally put the
bolts<00:07:09.010> didn't<00:07:09.310> work<00:07:09.490> quite<00:07:09.700> as<00:07:09.970> well<00:07:10.180> that<00:07:11.110> was

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230 
bolts didn't work quite as well that was

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.900 
bolts didn't work quite as well that was
a<00:07:11.260> little<00:07:11.440> modification<00:07:12.220> I<00:07:12.280> made<00:07:12.430> after<00:07:12.610> my

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910 
a little modification I made after my

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.570 
a little modification I made after my
initial<00:07:13.090> try<00:07:13.540> and<00:07:13.860> certainly<00:07:14.860> made<00:07:15.070> a<00:07:15.100> made<00:07:15.550> a

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
initial try and certainly made a made a

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.330 
initial try and certainly made a made a
huge<00:07:15.910> difference<00:07:16.120> so<00:07:16.600> I<00:07:17.290> hope<00:07:17.620> that<00:07:17.680> was<00:07:18.010> was

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
huge difference so I hope that was was

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.340 
huge difference so I hope that was was
helpful<00:07:18.730> to<00:07:18.760> you<00:07:19.360> can<00:07:19.540> see<00:07:19.660> that<00:07:19.840> our<00:07:19.930> jack<00:07:20.169> is

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.350 
helpful to you can see that our jack is

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.780 
helpful to you can see that our jack is
almost<00:07:20.590> back<00:07:20.830> to<00:07:20.890> normal<00:07:21.070> I<00:07:21.370> got<00:07:21.490> two<00:07:21.640> more

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:21.790 
almost back to normal I got two more

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.909 
almost back to normal I got two more
bolts<00:07:22.120> to<00:07:22.210> take<00:07:22.419> off<00:07:22.660> to<00:07:22.810> take<00:07:22.960> the<00:07:23.200> pad<00:07:23.800> is

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 
bolts to take off to take the pad is

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.920 
bolts to take off to take the pad is
still<00:07:24.100> off<00:07:24.280> and<00:07:24.550> then<00:07:24.700> it's<00:07:25.450> back<00:07:25.660> to<00:07:25.840> our

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
still off and then it's back to our

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.020 
still off and then it's back to our
normal<00:07:26.080> floor<00:07:26.440> jack<00:07:26.650> so<00:07:27.490> thanks<00:07:27.790> again<00:07:27.880> for

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030 
normal floor jack so thanks again for

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.580 
normal floor jack so thanks again for
watching<00:07:28.180> I<00:07:28.570> hope<00:07:28.720> that<00:07:28.930> was<00:07:29.080> helpful<00:07:29.110> to<00:07:29.440> you
