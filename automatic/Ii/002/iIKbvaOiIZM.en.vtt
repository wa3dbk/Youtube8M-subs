00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160 
so again the final finished product is
second<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> none<00:01:53.659> plastic<00:01:54.659> line<00:01:54.840> clip<00:01:55.049> again

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
second to none plastic line clip again

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.230 
second to none plastic line clip again
so<00:01:55.619> no<00:01:55.860> damage<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.430> line<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:56.909> certainly

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
so no damage to line or certainly

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
so no damage to line or certainly
fluorocarbons<00:01:57.960> which<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.229> use<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> lot<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
fluorocarbons which I use a lot of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
fluorocarbons which I use a lot of
they're<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> lot<00:01:59.549> thicker<00:01:59.790> than<00:01:59.909> mono<00:02:00.210> so

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
they're a lot thicker than mono so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.209 
they're a lot thicker than mono so
there's<00:02:00.990> no<00:02:01.110> danger<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> plastic<00:02:02.070> line

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
there's no danger of the plastic line

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.270 
there's no danger of the plastic line
clip<00:02:02.460> actually<00:02:03.110> indenting<00:02:04.110> onto<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> floor

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
clip actually indenting onto the floor

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.819 
clip actually indenting onto the floor
oh<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:06.119> 3k<00:02:06.570> weave<00:02:06.810> as<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.259> see<00:02:07.439> carries

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
oh the 3k weave as you can see carries

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.199 
oh the 3k weave as you can see carries
on<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> lot<00:02:08.250> further<00:02:08.489> up<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> rod<00:02:09.000> this

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
on a lot further up the rod this

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.130 
on a lot further up the rod this
actually<00:02:09.539> goes<00:02:09.690> right<00:02:09.989> past<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.940> spigot

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
actually goes right past the spigot

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.230 
actually goes right past the spigot
a lot<00:02:13.319> more<00:02:13.500> responsive<00:02:14.130> action<00:02:14.460> down<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
a lot more responsive action down in the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.600 
a lot more responsive action down in the
butt<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> lot<00:02:15.870> more<00:02:16.050> strength<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.490> it's

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
butt and a lot more strength so and it's

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.280 
butt and a lot more strength so and it's
like<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.910> old-school<00:02:18.240> textured<00:02:18.870> finish<00:02:19.200> you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
like the old-school textured finish you

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.870 
like the old-school textured finish you
know<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.830> do<00:02:19.950> like<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.370> rod<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> think

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
know I really do like this rod I think

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.490 
know I really do like this rod I think
it<00:02:21.000> gives<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.330> lot<00:02:21.450> more<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.900> lot<00:02:22.440> more

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
it gives it a lot more a lot more

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.970 
it gives it a lot more a lot more
individuality<00:02:23.130> than<00:02:24.030> any<00:02:24.209> other<00:02:24.390> sort<00:02:24.750> of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
individuality than any other sort of

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.430 
individuality than any other sort of
manufacturer<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.100> I've<00:02:26.340> seen<00:02:27.290> we've<00:02:28.290> got

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
manufacturer that I've seen we've got

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.690 
manufacturer that I've seen we've got
that<00:02:28.560> custom-built<00:02:29.130> field<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
that custom-built field of the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
handwritten logo of the suppressor there

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.640 
handwritten logo of the suppressor there
on<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.820> book<00:02:33.000> section<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.020> again

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
on the on the book section and again

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.260 
on the on the book section and again
what's<00:02:34.860> what<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.430> manufactured<00:02:36.060> form

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
what's what this is manufactured form

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.360 
what's what this is manufactured form
it's<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.450> processor<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.050> HPC<00:02:37.680> again<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> XT

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
it's a processor the HPC again the XT

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.910 
it's a processor the HPC again the XT
100<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.120> know<00:02:39.510> don't<00:02:40.440> not<00:02:40.530> only<00:02:40.770> have<00:02:40.860> you

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
100 so you know don't not only have you

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.559 
100 so you know don't not only have you
got<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.160> 3k<00:02:41.550> we've<00:02:41.790> what<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> process

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
got the 3k we've what the process

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.940 
got the 3k we've what the process
involved<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.230> manufacturing<00:02:43.770> means

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
involved in the manufacturing means

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.290 
involved in the manufacturing means
you've<00:02:44.069> got<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> rod<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.850> never<00:02:45.150> going<00:02:45.270> to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you've got a rod that is never going to

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.720 
you've got a rod that is never going to
let<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.540> down
