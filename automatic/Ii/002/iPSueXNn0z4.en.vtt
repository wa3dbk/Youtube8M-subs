according<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:37.040> Ward's<00:02:37.459> supplies<00:02:38.150> are<00:02:38.420> low

according to Ward's supplies are low

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.080 
according to Ward's supplies are low
because<00:02:38.810> sales<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.650> new<00:02:39.800> cars<00:02:40.069> plummeted<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
because sales of new cars plummeted the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.509 
because sales of new cars plummeted the
last<00:02:41.300> several<00:02:41.599> years<00:02:41.989> due<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.920> recession

last several years due to the recession

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.940 
last several years due to the recession
so<00:02:44.000> there<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.569> aren't<00:02:44.750> as<00:02:44.989> many<00:02:45.170> used<00:02:45.650> cars

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950

to but I just think that there's a

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.570 
to but I just think that there's a
tendency<00:06:33.110> to<00:06:33.350> brush<00:06:33.560> aside<00:06:33.710> the<00:06:34.010> leaf<00:06:34.190> because

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
tendency to brush aside the leaf because

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.250 
tendency to brush aside the leaf because
it's<00:06:35.030> almost<00:06:35.180> like<00:06:35.390> this<00:06:35.540> historic<00:06:35.930> moment<00:06:36.050> is

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
it's almost like this historic moment is

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.830 
it's almost like this historic moment is
not<00:06:36.410> happening<00:06:37.060> and<00:06:38.060> i'm<00:06:38.360> not<00:06:38.510> sure<00:06:38.660> why<00:06:38.810> that

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
not happening and i'm not sure why that

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.140 
not happening and i'm not sure why that
is<00:06:38.990> it<00:06:39.620> for<00:06:40.160> me<00:06:40.190> this<00:06:40.430> or<00:06:40.580> not<00:06:40.670> is<00:06:40.820> the<00:06:40.970> most

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
is it for me this or not is the most

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.700 
is it for me this or not is the most
significant<00:06:41.960> car<00:06:42.110> though<00:06:42.260> they're<00:06:42.590> already

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
significant car though they're already

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.940 
significant car though they're already
selling<00:06:43.810> 150,000<00:06:44.810> a<00:06:44.840> year<00:06:44.900> and<00:06:45.740> there<00:06:45.860> were<00:06:45.920> no

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
selling 150,000 a year and there were no

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.430 
selling 150,000 a year and there were no
where<00:06:46.250> before<00:06:46.460> exactly<00:06:47.360> if<00:06:47.810> the<00:06:47.930> cadence<00:06:48.290> was

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
where before exactly if the cadence was

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.920 
where before exactly if the cadence was
different<00:06:48.920> I<00:06:49.130> think<00:06:49.880> you'd<00:06:50.030> have<00:06:50.060> winners<00:06:50.450> all

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
different I think you'd have winners all

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.600 
different I think you'd have winners all
across<00:06:51.230> the<00:06:51.440> board<00:06:51.470> you<00:06:51.920> know<00:06:52.040> you<00:06:52.100> know<00:06:52.340> you

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
across the board you know you know you

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.640 
across the board you know you know you
could<00:06:52.790> have<00:06:52.820> volt<00:06:53.300> one<00:06:53.510> year<00:06:53.750> sonata<00:06:54.230> one<00:06:54.440> year

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.110 
could have volt one year sonata one year
leaf<00:06:54.950> one<00:06:55.160> year<00:06:55.400> but<00:06:55.610> they're<00:06:55.760> all<00:06:55.880> together

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120

this<00:06:56.480> year<00:06:56.540> but<00:06:57.170> my<00:06:57.380> pic<00:06:57.650> is<00:06:57.830> the<00:06:57.860> bolt<00:06:58.190> I<00:06:58.460> just

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
this year but my pic is the bolt I just

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.480 
this year but my pic is the bolt I just
think<00:06:58.970> it's<00:06:59.120> phenomenal<00:06:59.780> and<00:07:00.010> you<00:07:01.010> drive<00:07:01.310> it

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
think it's phenomenal and you drive it

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.130 
think it's phenomenal and you drive it
and<00:07:01.550> you<00:07:01.640> become<00:07:01.940> a<00:07:01.970> believer<00:07:02.150> the<00:07:02.570> problem<00:07:02.990> is

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.140 
and you become a believer the problem is

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.920 
and you become a believer the problem is
it's<00:07:03.770> going<00:07:04.100> to<00:07:04.190> take<00:07:04.430> a<00:07:04.640> 45-minute<00:07:05.480> drive<00:07:05.690> in

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
it's going to take a 45-minute drive in

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.440 
it's going to take a 45-minute drive in

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.450 
somebody on a test drive to see that

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.440 
somebody on a test drive to see that

switch over between both sources of

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.420 
switch over between both sources of
power<00:07:11.690> to<00:07:11.990> really<00:07:12.380> get<00:07:12.560> it<00:07:12.740> because<00:07:13.160> when<00:07:13.340> you

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
power to really get it because when you

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.060 
power to really get it because when you
do<00:07:13.550> that<00:07:13.730> it<00:07:13.910> clicks<00:07:14.120> me<00:07:14.510> go<00:07:14.660> I<00:07:14.930> think<00:07:15.920> there's

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
do that it clicks me go I think there's

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.700 
do that it clicks me go I think there's
going<00:07:16.160> to<00:07:16.250> be<00:07:16.310> a<00:07:16.370> little<00:07:16.610> bit<00:07:16.760> of<00:07:16.940> volt<00:07:17.840> fatigue

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
going to be a little bit of volt fatigue
