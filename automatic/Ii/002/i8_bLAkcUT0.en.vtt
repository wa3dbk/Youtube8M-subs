00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 we may find the system 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.540
 for to have a little bit more at 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.540
 round ball 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.510
 knew that by coming here it is 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 it was going to be like that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.050
 for that 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.050
 think they 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.970
 indeed 2 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.560
 to answer present in the duels and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.280
 patroller and this space is what we 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.280
 happens to do in 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.170
 the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.310
 begins to veil some shift 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.400
 who will have to correct 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.380
 take this goal to help us but 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.800
 to convince the state of mind for 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.800
 try to catch up 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.219
 to obviously show everything in slow motion 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.680
 knowing that buses and beginnings of 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.270
 causeways 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.300
 let mister fautrel keep all the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.300
 world 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.960
 its compoteÃ©e ferule 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.969
 ibrahimovic is relieved 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.210
 a wave of Parisian people who 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.210
 were 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.870
 throw on their beats 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.850
 What you need what makes 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.850
 a believer 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.550
 every year it's the riba that's what 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.640
 happened 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.600
 we 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 quietly of a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.140
 it is live the region of rona 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.420
 it looks like one and the other 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.560
 idle from the beginning of the situation he will have 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 in a few seconds 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.880
 me the soul had not warned 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.920
 just like calibrating the beach 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.250
 but not very solid for another 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.960
 american on cuba then it is he who will 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.729
 push it 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.890
 he is the one who will look for 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.119
 web to yes sir ibrahimovic is a 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.659
 great player but I do not agree 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.950
 with you if you do not agree we had 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.750
 reason to take our time run 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.460
 the whole story its beginning 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.630
 until the end and that's it 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.350
 and we know it's free and molitor 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.850
 just wait exactly 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.299
 melicie mavuba did not quite miss you 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.299
 his clients 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.530
 the surprise is clear 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.490
 but when just did it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.490
 they received him alone 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.980
 and you 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.660
 with c 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.660
 natural
