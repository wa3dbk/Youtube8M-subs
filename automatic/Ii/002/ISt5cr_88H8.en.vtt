00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.340
 According Hello and welcome 22 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.769
 today the topic sorting systems and the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.420
 for the third time already mentioned 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.000
 that I have another design already 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.460
 one day after the last episode had 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800
 Although the result 18 it must now exactly 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.090
 to be a week ago 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 I'll have it on the following day 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 again a whole new construction 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.579
 built I also advance times already 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.620
 kinda in the back of my mind 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.160
 but then had forgotten again 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.980
 and then meant and poor around it 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.379
 should actually be possible that 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.239
 just to make rockers 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.190
 he was a bit right, too 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 I rebuilt everything completely it must 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.010
 work and it works 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.809
 fast and absolute to 100 percent 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.219
 Reliable that is the error rate 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.550
 not because the absolute zero percent 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.430
 after several group as I have guests 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.320
 which plant have had and me 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.200
 not a single old sense that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 next to it land is land and the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.540
 disadvantage, however, is that the plant 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.450
 it is not loud because it is loud 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.759
 she just works but if for me 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.850
 works then she is extremely loud at 10 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.920
 was 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.830
 what is there now is a plant or 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.479
 because it is generally very red here 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.409
 to be obstructed or whether it also 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.830
 game is because I'm so tight here 20 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.330
 fps racing stalls which is not so good but 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.570
 that does not matter 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:54.549
 So be a self explaining klop 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.830
 and it always emits a signal 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:05.039
 in about a tick distance 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.039
 the best zande the group of course 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:17.850
 your text will be controlled 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.630
 I have no idea, as well as in car 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.950
 while being driven once a day 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:36.640
 and we have one accordingly 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.160
 quite high transfer with and funnel 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:51.489
 those under the building suck the items 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:53.680
 almost copy as before if that 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.720
 ever does that he made 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.880
 was looking though the annoying animal and 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.880
 why I now do to the end of the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.920
 The club does not even activate it 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.239
 that if I that the direction of travel of the 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.700
 sortie direction 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.790
 the old age less instant 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:21.370
 be passed through and yes that is very 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.450
 disadvantageous for the whole to be yes 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.760
 then stop sorting away like that 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.640
 fast and with that you have one 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.030
 Correspondingly, a reverse error rate 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.620
 of almost 100 percent 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.330
 and I just have to work around that 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.550
 thought it should be that 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.060
 whole 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.280
 to build against this direction 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.370
 I have to build a rapper and then I have 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.610
 also made and how you see it when 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.190
 you are energized by the group 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.930
 and yet if they are driven for 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.840
 always if here on a remote line 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.930
 stream comes he automatically becomes 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.320
 two adjacent there with driven 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.000
 So, just like in the case of 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.220
 last resort where I still have him 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.489
 Judge had since I had him that way 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.410
 built and in the reason it is exactly that 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.650
 same principle is this from torch 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.500
 and again others with the troupe 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:25.870
 activated and these are precisely as well as 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.490
 that is actually already the 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.380
 actual explanation at the whole 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.410
 plant she is damn fast 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.980
 I just measured something at 15 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.900
 minutes 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.820
 that is faster than the system 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.560
 with water and double tick signal the 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.320
 then also pretty and reliable 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:52.060
 is very accurate 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.410
 yes yes that's all I really am 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.270
 to say to that I could not know now 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.740
 how to explain the session in a great way 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.720
 what should I explain the great 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.990
 function should be clear 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.770
 same as before, only now 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.370
 my body have more in between 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:17.150
 the items can be imported because 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:20.250
 the goal is a pass and shepherd shield yes 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.199
 what was actually in the reason of this 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.560
 By the way, we have one right now 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:30.360
 update received regarding the webshop 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.699
 we have now 13 05 b and has changed 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.210
 the fact but nothing so each 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.909
 nothing relevant gave a few bugfixes 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:43.740
 but nothing that I show here now 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:45.539
 I could be up the next days 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.509
 every now and again a little something 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.800
 tree I hope if we again good 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:54.389
 it comes to mind and I am like this 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.360
 Bit unimaginative and if something 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.190
 I will be able to get something tree right away 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.319
 would need to be up to date again 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.639
 hold and I wish you so long 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.659
 never fun now 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.659
 See you
