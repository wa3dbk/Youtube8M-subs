 is and the most beautiful immersive experience games on the PC 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.650
 although game computers such as the knee is this and I was shocked as well 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.699
 but the true connoisseurs still use a game PC or notebook 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 today i'm talking to two hema experts 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.120
 jeroen van tuyl special to your work as a journalist and a game industry 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.489
 for solo console as president 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.489
 he knows a lot about games breaking a leg 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.850
 also always that there is a clear separation between clear and texel 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.040
 there would be a check 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.320
 that used to be very bad 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 but that is now almost no longer the case 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.450
 And certainly now that the Playstation 3 is being cautious even though it is plenty 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.530
 they are busy they are ideally suited for the pc 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.550
 women have no injured tomorrow 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.840
 the automaker chrysler have tried to bring consoles 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.810
 will stay there 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.930
 just failed that got right there 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.800
 In addition, a number of studied media investigates via Schiphol 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.820
 fire on the upper floor and operating systems 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.100
 today he tells us more about the technology behind demy pcs 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.330
 it has of course been a battle going on for years between demos on computers and 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.140
 games on the console why would you choose another computer 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.130
 The big advantage is that you always use the latest 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.870
 technologies a new hard drive the faster video cards nice 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.770
 screens 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.110
 and the manufacturer of games that make clever use of the Sabbath 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.920
 use of the latest technology 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.330
 if you are looking for a plot convinced that its all with 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.649
 Specifications 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.050
 the better the processor and the better it really goes too far 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.310
 the more you can enjoy the smashing effects in denys 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.240
 In addition to the basics of a computer, the screen is of course also important 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.770
 the more i will hedge them nice view on better game 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.560
 I was looking for charities a little jealous of some things 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.110
 pay attention 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.250
 it is for good video cards that determines what appears on your screen 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.039
 also want to play a nice 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.229
 the Stone Age the necessary attention to perhaps also with a keyboard 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.489
 In addition to the standard keyboard is the keyboard with which the self-written 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.579
 songs 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.370
 another time the memory does not save or your memory includes more memory 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.209
 the faster your computer is controlled 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.649
 and in this case no unnecessary luxury 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.839
 this is the first time there is no 77 50 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.959
 the circumstances are no more than that 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 I know there is one of the most extreme computers that can currently be 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:26.629
 find 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.069
 equipped with a superfast Kortfoort Intel core i7 processor 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.380
 the fast gavira who brought her back fifty-eight 15 jokers 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.889
 and comes with water 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.029
 how to get with this system to the most reliable and extreme performance 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:38.899

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.279
 the citizen is equipped with two hard disks and comes with a motion 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 TV canteen of sports club 15 keyboard 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.249
 spacious 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.159
 the same goes for the pond mountain made hugo chÃ¡vez said his party 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.999
 to be 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.690
 I had achieved the 17 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.009
 he would make it worse so we are very fat the computer 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.349
 a very large graphic card 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.390
 So yes then you know that it is the best thing we developers have their relationship with 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.109
 the best the graphical work all recorded 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.089
 and that everything goes fast for the time being without a hitch after that is to follow a PC 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:29.049
 with bee 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.720
 the game is a dead horse is upside down an answer is that you must find 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.099

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.179
 just a serious December 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:50.139
 the conclusion is clear it is about the experience and then there is fast processor 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.189
 and video card the basis of a good game and PC 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.009
 apparently that percentage is a lot of money on purchasing 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.029
