00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.859
 fifth how this book was born 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:42.030
 this book was born at the request of one 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:44.789
 series of friends and people that a case 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.300
 every now and then at home but why you 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.949
 don't write a book about yourself about yourself 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.719
 because you have written a series of books 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:57.510
 that bring your ideas ideas 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.140
 ok, it's not just two that have been around for long 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 far 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.040
 you have elaborated them and enriched them 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.190
 then the productions a book but you know that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.710
 who reads a book and I for example are 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.900
 one of those when I go to the bookstore 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.660
 look for a book I want to know 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.450
 the idea that is in here but who has it 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.880
 written these things who was this 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.380
 person as he came to mind of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.410
 get to these ideas 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.220
 what was the life he did for which e 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.450
 produced this i am very curious 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.290
 I'm going to read the story right away 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.380
 the author then gives me that thing 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.450
 an incredible wealth because not 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.420
 just tells me the author's thought 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 but he tells me how the building from where 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.290
 is born 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.420
 mauro having these requests to a certain one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.680
 point the heightened and he wants to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.500
 write about him so this book is a 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.080
 book that could also be called 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.330
 praise of freedom because it is a book 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.820
 written in total freedom where he has 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.070
 written things he said he wrote 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.450
 lightly and written compassion 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.780
 there are also things 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.290
 a bit harsh in his life but he has them 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.450
 written lightly and then here 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.030
 inside there are also a collection of 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.750
 many stories that many of you have 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.880
 heard at the table or during the courses and on 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.970
 below 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.640
 and then there are also things instead 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.590
 which are more life lessons than 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.590
 they come from far away 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.050
 cool men and gray officials of the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.100
 anonymous bureaucracy are occupying the 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.700
 last living spaces making it tiring 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.540
 our every gesture in companies like 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.180
 in the university or in the hospitals in a 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.870
 world dominated by them there is no place for 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.420
 children for plants and for animals or for 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.910
 a generation of new ideas 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.010
 the current global crisis is not financial 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.410
 but spiritual 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.350
 we need colorful men from 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.520
 poets with a warm researcher heart 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.790
 authentic capable of making us glimpse 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.310
 virgin land not polluted by dogmas e 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.860
 plaster casts of the mind where new ideas 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.630
 and new lifestyles can be generated 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.630
 and then speaks of hand
