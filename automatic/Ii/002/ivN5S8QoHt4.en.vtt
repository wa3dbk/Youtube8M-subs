00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.530
 blessings today will be teaching the 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.830
 grateful tutorial from me in san marcos 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.830
 and the first part of the basic song 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.860
 yes 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.950
 Y 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.439
 and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.650
 and the notes of these figures are sun 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:54.870
 sun sharp sharp sharp sun 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:59.449
 They are re held to sun retained and how 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.449
 being heard 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.320
 all right 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.030
 this first part you're only going to 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.030
 play when you sing when you sing 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.450
 this second part is only going to 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.450
 play each time you sing gratefully 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.680
 I 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.780
 Y 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.780
 the notes of these figures are retained 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.760
 for detainee 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.760
 that is heard 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.330
 if you want you can put octaves that 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.330
 it would be heard 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.560
 if you want they added more you add a 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.950
 sun to the octaves you would hear 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.950
 would be harness had they are sustained 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.970
 they were on Saturdays 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.870
 and so you want to play the song without 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.430
 no kind of effect only piano 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.650
 then it is less 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.140
 sustained 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.970
 sustained and if we see 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.710

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.990
