00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
right there in the bottom so put it to

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.700 
right there in the bottom so put it to
cool<00:05:14.510> it<00:05:14.720> of<00:05:14.840> course<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.170> do<00:05:15.260> get<00:05:15.440> your<00:05:15.590> own

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:51.420 

sliced<00:05:29.240> ice<00:05:37.390> and<00:05:38.390> sliced<00:05:38.780> three<00:05:38.990> times

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.220 

so<00:05:52.430> there<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:53.360> go<00:05:53.480> you<00:05:53.660> got<00:05:53.900> your<00:05:54.050> three

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
attacks now apparently there is going to

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.850 
attacks now apparently there is going to
be<00:05:56.720> something<00:05:57.020> else<00:05:57.200> that's<00:05:57.440> going<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.620> really

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
be something else that's going to really

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.150 
be something else that's going to really
going<00:05:58.280> to<00:05:58.370> be<00:05:58.460> released<00:05:58.790> I<00:06:00.040> think<00:06:01.040> it's

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
going to be released I think it's

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.040 
going to be released I think it's
another<00:06:01.340> faceplate<00:06:01.970> that<00:06:02.210> comes<00:06:02.420> with<00:06:02.600> a<00:06:02.630> key

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
another faceplate that comes with a key

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.350 
another faceplate that comes with a key
that<00:06:03.350> goes<00:06:03.950> into<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.730> slot<00:06:05.120> right<00:06:05.330> here<00:06:06.130> and

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
that goes into the slot right here and

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.210 
that goes into the slot right here and
it<00:06:08.360> will<00:06:08.450> unlock<00:06:08.660> different<00:06:09.530> noises<00:06:09.770> and

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
it will unlock different noises and

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.790 
it will unlock different noises and
whatnot<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:10.640> people<00:06:11.390> have<00:06:11.660> you<00:06:11.900> know<00:06:11.930> hacked

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
whatnot and people have you know hacked

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.580 
whatnot and people have you know hacked
it<00:06:13.160> to<00:06:13.580> get<00:06:14.390> those<00:06:14.570> different<00:06:14.900> features<00:06:15.260> out

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
it to get those different features out

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.920 
it to get those different features out
of<00:06:15.830> it<00:06:15.980> I'm<00:06:16.550> not<00:06:16.610> going<00:06:16.880> to<00:06:16.940> do<00:06:17.060> that<00:06:17.210> because<00:06:17.450> I

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
of it I'm not going to do that because I

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.690 
of it I'm not going to do that because I
like<00:06:18.410> to<00:06:18.620> do<00:06:18.740> things<00:06:18.920> the<00:06:19.100> official<00:06:19.580> way<00:06:19.670> I

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
like to do things the official way I

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.030 
like to do things the official way I
feel<00:06:20.150> like<00:06:20.300> I'm<00:06:20.450> kind<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:20.860> cheating<00:06:21.860> myself

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
feel like I'm kind of cheating myself

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.890 
feel like I'm kind of cheating myself
out<00:06:22.340> of<00:06:22.370> the<00:06:22.490> full<00:06:22.670> experience<00:06:23.000> if<00:06:23.360> I<00:06:23.480> go<00:06:23.750> in

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
out of the full experience if I go in

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.890

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
and hack if so I'm basically just going

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.690 
and hack if so I'm basically just going
to<00:06:26.960> show<00:06:27.140> it<00:06:27.260> off<00:06:27.380> as<00:06:27.590> is<00:06:27.950> this<00:06:28.310> does<00:06:28.520> have
