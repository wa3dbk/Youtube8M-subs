particular design and that's the only

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.660 
particular design and that's the only
part<00:01:03.440> where<00:01:03.620> it<00:01:03.739> gets<00:01:03.980> a<00:01:04.070> little<00:01:04.100> tricky

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
is with the color side facing down I

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.539 
is with the color side facing down I
want<00:01:51.079> to<00:01:51.110> go<00:01:51.200> ahead<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.590> fold<00:01:51.860> my<00:01:52.130> paper<00:01:52.159> in

want to go ahead and fold my paper in

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.679 
want to go ahead and fold my paper in
half<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.969> want<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.180> make<00:01:53.270> sure<00:01:53.299> you've

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
half and you want to make sure you've

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.109 
half and you want to make sure you've
got<00:01:53.719> it<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.439> that<00:01:54.590> you're<00:01:55.039> folding<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.610> half<00:01:55.640> to

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
got it so that you're folding in half to

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.569 
got it so that you're folding in half to
keep<00:01:56.299> all<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.930> on<00:01:57.170> one<00:01:57.469> side<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.399> if<00:01:58.490> it

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
keep all of this on one side so if it

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.219 
keep all of this on one side so if it
makes<00:01:58.789> it<00:01:58.969> easier<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.299> can<00:01:59.600> make<00:01:59.780> sure<00:01:59.810> that

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
makes it easier you can make sure that

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.529 
makes it easier you can make sure that
you're<00:02:00.380> folding<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:00.950> over<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.390> see

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
you're folding that over and you can see

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.399 
you're folding that over and you can see
all<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.110> pattern<00:02:03.500> there<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.840> make<00:02:05.990> sure<00:02:06.170> you

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
all the pattern there and make sure you

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.160 
all the pattern there and make sure you
can<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.890> little<00:02:07.310> logo<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.149> QR<00:02:08.930> code

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
can see the little logo and the QR code

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.230 
can see the little logo and the QR code
when<00:02:09.410> you're<00:02:09.530> done<00:02:09.680> so<00:02:10.610> put<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.120> side

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
when you're done so put that to the side

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.870 
when you're done so put that to the side
and<00:02:11.720> then<00:02:12.320> with<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.920> other<00:02:13.040> one<00:02:13.250> here<00:02:13.670> I'm

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
and then with the other one here I'm

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.760 
and then with the other one here I'm
going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:14.330> my<00:02:14.540> pattern<00:02:14.960> side<00:02:15.170> facing<00:02:15.620> up

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
going to have my pattern side facing up

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.220 
going to have my pattern side facing up
with<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.100> pattern<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.910> QR<00:02:17.300> code<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.780> I'm

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
with a pattern in the QR code and I'm

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.949 
with a pattern in the QR code and I'm
just<00:02:18.350> going<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> fold<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:18.920> half<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.400> way<00:02:19.640> to

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.479 

when<00:02:24.959> both<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.349> those<00:02:25.469> are<00:02:25.739> folded<00:02:26.159> in<00:02:26.280> half

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
when both of those are folded in half

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.130 
when both of those are folded in half
what<00:02:27.090> we're<00:02:27.209> going<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.359> do<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.569> take<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.989> one

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
what we're going to do is take the one

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.770 
what we're going to do is take the one
with<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.439> roof<00:02:28.650> open<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.909> and<00:02:30.209> I'm<00:02:30.629> going

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
with the roof open it up and I'm going

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.110 
with the roof open it up and I'm going
to<00:02:30.900> slide<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.530> other<00:02:31.650> one<00:02:31.950> inside<00:02:32.579> you<00:02:32.879> want

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to slide the other one inside you want

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.449 
to slide the other one inside you want
to<00:02:33.150> make<00:02:33.299> sure<00:02:33.329> that<00:02:33.689> you're<00:02:33.870> basically

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
to make sure that you're basically

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.459 
to make sure that you're basically
having<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.640> pattern<00:02:36.209> with<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.659> QR<00:02:37.079> code<00:02:37.290> in

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
having this pattern with the QR code in

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.390 
having this pattern with the QR code in
the<00:02:37.500> logo<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.219> bottom<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:40.220> have<00:02:41.220> them

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
the logo on the bottom and have them

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.979 
the logo on the bottom and have them
sandwich<00:02:41.879> down<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.359> that<00:02:42.480> they<00:02:42.599> essentially

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
sandwich down so that they essentially

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.220 
sandwich down so that they essentially
line<00:02:43.349> up<00:02:43.560> but<00:02:44.010> not<00:02:44.519> back-to-back<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.959> this

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
line up but not back-to-back just this

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.470 
line up but not back-to-back just this
way<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.340> you've<00:02:47.459> got<00:02:47.609> those<00:02:47.760> two<00:02:47.819> lined<00:02:48.269> up

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
way so you've got those two lined up

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.690 
way so you've got those two lined up
make<00:02:48.900> sure<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.230> paper<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.769> really<00:02:50.159> nice<00:02:50.370> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
make sure your paper is really nice and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.819 
make sure your paper is really nice and
snug<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.299> if<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.959> wanted<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.469> at<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.620> point

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
you could put a center crease in just to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.929 
you could put a center crease in just to
help<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.109> along<00:02:55.439> or<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:56.189> can<00:02:56.400> use<00:02:56.609> the

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
you can reduce one of the creases which

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.140 
you can reduce one of the creases which
is<00:03:01.500> always<00:03:01.650> nice<00:03:01.889> I'm<00:03:02.669> going<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.909> take

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
into the center and at this point you

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.500 
into the center and at this point you
want<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.370> try<00:03:08.579> your<00:03:08.730> best<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:09.090> kind<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.329> keep

want to try your best to kind of keep

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.170 
want to try your best to kind of keep
things<00:03:09.870> as<00:03:10.230> straight<00:03:10.829> keep<00:03:11.609> all<00:03:11.760> those<00:03:11.939> layers

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
things as straight keep all those layers

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.869 
things as straight keep all those layers
of<00:03:12.359> paper<00:03:12.659> together<00:03:13.049> if<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.530> can<00:03:13.639> get<00:03:14.639> a<00:03:14.669> good

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
of paper together if you can get a good

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.970 
of paper together if you can get a good
crease<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.569> here<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.079> then<00:03:16.769> we're<00:03:16.950> just

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
crease going here and then we're just

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.679 
crease going here and then we're just
going<00:03:17.159> to<00:03:17.220> open<00:03:17.669> up<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:17.939> the<00:03:17.970> middle<00:03:18.359> here<00:03:18.659> so

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
going to open up in the middle here so

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.679 
going to open up in the middle here so
that<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.019> get<00:03:19.200> two<00:03:19.409> flaps<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.980> each<00:03:20.159> side<00:03:20.689> push

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
that you get two flaps on each side push

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.140 
that you get two flaps on each side push
it<00:03:21.900> out<00:03:22.049> here<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:23.220> when<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.609> smoosh<00:03:24.120> it
