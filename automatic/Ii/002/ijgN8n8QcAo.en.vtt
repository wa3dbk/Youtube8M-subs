00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.759 

I<00:00:10.629> think<00:00:11.629> it's<00:00:11.780> a<00:00:11.870> more<00:00:12.019> adventure<00:00:12.530> than<00:00:12.559> a

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
I think it's a more adventure than a

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.410 
I think it's a more adventure than a
rally

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:26.740 

you<00:00:17.420> need<00:00:17.570> to<00:00:17.720> survive<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.260> rubber

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.710 

the<00:00:27.750> stages<00:00:28.170> are<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:28.770> probably<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:30.090> best

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the stages are I think probably the best

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.150 
the stages are I think probably the best
in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.900> world<00:00:30.960> most<00:00:31.560> scenic<00:00:31.830> most

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160

picturesque<00:00:32.760> and<00:00:33.239> some<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.320> most

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
picturesque and some of the most

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:49.920 
picturesque and some of the most

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.850 

two<00:03:19.060> stages<00:03:19.360> left<00:03:19.690> we<00:03:19.900> broke<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> gearbox<00:03:20.650> and

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.830 
just had the first and second gear so it
was<00:03:23.320> quite<00:03:24.040> difficult<00:03:24.280> because<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:25.210> can't<00:03:25.690> go

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
was quite difficult because you can't go

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.190 
was quite difficult because you can't go
so<00:03:26.020> fast<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.920> mean<00:03:27.300> still<00:03:28.300> it's<00:03:28.480> many<00:03:28.840> races
