out<00:03:01.209> there<00:03:01.239> now<00:03:01.540> that's<00:03:01.810> tailored<00:03:02.260> more

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
out there now that's tailored more

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.399 
out there now that's tailored more
towards<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.700> riding<00:03:03.909> even<00:03:04.359> if<00:03:04.480> they're

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
towards not riding even if they're

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.589 
towards not riding even if they're
