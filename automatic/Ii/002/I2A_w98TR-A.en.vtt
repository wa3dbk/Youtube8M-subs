00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
in place while you drill out the rest of

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:14.199 
in place while you drill out the rest of
the<00:01:59.690> holes<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.500> frame<00:02:12.790> okay<00:02:13.790> first<00:02:14.090> we'll

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the holes in the frame okay first we'll

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.490 
the holes in the frame okay first we'll
drill<00:02:14.450> our<00:02:14.600> holes<00:02:14.810> towards<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.200> rear<00:02:15.380> of

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
drill our holes towards the rear of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.229 
drill our holes towards the rear of
vehicle<00:02:15.920> we'll<00:02:16.310> start<00:02:16.550> off<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.670> quarter<00:02:17.090> inch

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
vehicle we'll start off the quarter inch

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.620 
vehicle we'll start off the quarter inch
bit<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.480> work<00:02:17.840> away<00:02:18.050> up<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.290> 1/2<00:02:19.450> we<00:02:20.450> won't

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
bit and work away up to 1/2 we won't

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.449 
bit and work away up to 1/2 we won't
throw<00:02:20.840> out<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.080> little<00:02:21.470> forward<00:02:21.830> hole<00:02:22.040> here

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
throw out the little forward hole here

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.440 
throw out the little forward hole here
next

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
next

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.800 
next
and<00:02:25.450> it'll<00:02:25.629> move<00:02:25.720> over<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.170> driver<00:02:26.379> side

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
and it'll move over to the driver side

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.759 
and it'll move over to the driver side
all<00:02:28.810> right<00:02:28.870> now<00:02:29.049> we'll<00:02:29.230> follow<00:02:29.439> it<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:29.650> a

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
all right now we'll follow it up with a

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.589 
all right now we'll follow it up with a
half<00:02:29.890> inch<00:02:30.040> bit<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.610> kind<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.120> wall<00:02:31.299> off<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
half inch bit and kind of wall off the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:50.340 
half inch bit and kind of wall off the
hole<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.930> make<00:02:32.110> thread<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.920> bolt

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.420 

alright<00:02:51.350> next<00:02:51.500> we'll<00:02:51.680> install<00:02:51.890> our<00:02:52.100> hardware

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
alright next we'll install our hardware

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.590 
alright next we'll install our hardware
inside<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.940> frame<00:02:53.180> here

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
inside the frame here

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.270 
inside the frame here
they<00:02:53.900> require<00:02:54.140> using<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.560> handle<00:02:54.860> nut<00:02:55.040> it's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
they require using this handle nut it's

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.220 
they require using this handle nut it's
a<00:02:55.340> pretty<00:02:55.520> simple<00:02:55.700> basically<00:02:56.570> spend<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.200> a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
a pretty simple basically spend it to a

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.440 
a pretty simple basically spend it to a
match<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:58.100> angle<00:02:58.460> of<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.670> frame<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.180> going

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
match the angle of the frame and going

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.770 
match the angle of the frame and going
over<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.840> bolt<00:03:07.480> alright<00:03:08.480> we'll<00:03:08.630> do<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
over to the bolt alright we'll do the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.290 
over to the bolt alright we'll do the
same<00:03:08.960> thing<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.440> other<00:03:09.470> location<00:03:10.150> on<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
hole on this side of the frame -

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.560 
hole on this side of the frame -
actually<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.460> holes<00:03:19.670> on<00:03:19.940> both<00:03:19.970> sides<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
actually the holes on both sides of the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.650 
actually the holes on both sides of the
frame<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.560> can<00:03:21.680> install<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.070> hardware

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
frame so you can install the hardware

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.270 
frame so you can install the hardware
whichever<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.810> easier<00:03:24.680> for<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.010> do<00:03:25.100> if<00:03:25.190> you

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
easiest way to do it is get yourself

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.180 
easiest way to do it is get yourself
piece<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.760> safety<00:04:08.450> wire<00:04:08.890> basically<00:04:09.890> any

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
piece of a safety wire basically any

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.740 
piece of a safety wire basically any
kind<00:04:10.280> of<00:04:10.400> wire<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:10.850> can<00:04:11.000> bend<00:04:11.270> and<00:04:11.450> hold

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
kind of wire that you can bend and hold

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.410 
kind of wire that you can bend and hold
its<00:04:11.930> shape<00:04:12.490> and<00:04:13.490> what<00:04:13.610> you<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.820> do<00:04:13.910> is<00:04:14.060> thread

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
its shape and what you can do is thread

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.390 
its shape and what you can do is thread
it<00:04:14.540> through<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:15.770> hole<00:04:15.800> you<00:04:16.040> want<00:04:16.100> pull<00:04:16.310> the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
it through the hole you want pull the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.759 
it through the hole you want pull the
bolt<00:04:16.579> through<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.150> back<00:04:17.989> out<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.350> access

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
bolt through and back out the access

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.700 
bolt through and back out the access
hole<00:04:21.760> take<00:04:22.760> your<00:04:22.880> block<00:04:23.410> thread<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.530> through

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
hole take your block thread it through

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.360 
hole take your block thread it through
there<00:04:25.660> go<00:04:26.660> ahead<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.990> push<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:28.100> into<00:04:28.220> position

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
there go ahead and push it into position

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.730 
there go ahead and push it into position
so<00:04:28.880> it'll<00:04:29.060> fall<00:04:29.240> right<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.990> follow<00:04:30.230> a<00:04:30.290> wire<00:04:30.560> it

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
so it'll fall right to follow a wire it

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.970 
so it'll fall right to follow a wire it
right<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:30.980> place<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:33.669> then<00:04:35.620> take<00:04:36.620> your<00:04:36.740> bolt
