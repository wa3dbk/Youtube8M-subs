00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.079
 ah 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.040
 to 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.040
 ah 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.150
 How are you girls, I'm Raquel, this is 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.270
 the nail art design that we're going to 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.010
 be doing now let's start for the 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.779
 first design I'm going to start by applying 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.740
 a purple enamel in a low tone 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 about all my one 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.260
 now using an art glaze I'm going 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 to make a line going sideways and I'm going to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.559
 do exactly the same thing about the other 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.020
 side is also as if we were 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.090
 creating a letter be 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.710
 on the bottom I'm also going to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 do exactly the same thing 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.359
 and that's it for this design let's start 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.359
 with the one that follows 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 for this design I will be using 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.310
 a glaze in blue and what I'm going to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.230
 do using the brush of my enamel 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.760
 I'm going to leave a space in the part of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.190
 down but same and also could 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.620
 fill the entire nail I'm leaving 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.309
 a crescent below and filling the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.309
 top part 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.040
 now using an art enamel in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.490
 white color I'm going to do a series of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490
 vertical lines 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.220
 using nail art color 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.710
 gold I will be delineating the crescent 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.510
 what we did 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.700
 and now we start working on the nail 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.500
 gold this is the easiest of all 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.100
 they start to apply an enamel on 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.229
 gold color on all your nails 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.560
 I will make sure to put all the scares 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.850
 to use the description section 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.700
 followed by this we are going to apply a 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.260
 enamel with glitters in gold color 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.720
 all the nail 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.550
 and that's it for this nail now 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.290
 let's start with the design that follows 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.270
 for this nail I'm going to apply a 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 enamel in pink in a very tone 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 low over my entire nail 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.190
 followed by this I will be painting 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.920
 some little marquitas going 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.550
 to the side in a more pink shade 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.550
 strong 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.280
 using a dark brown color I will 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.900
 be going around each of the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.900
 pink marks that I made 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.060
 and that's it for this design let's start 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.880
 with the one that follows for this nail I decided in 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.890
 use the green color using my 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.110
 my enamel brush I will leave a 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.870
 unpainted space on the part of 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.670
 down creating the crescent and then I'm going 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.870
 to fill all the top part with 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.870
 my enamel in green 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.990
 using a pointer in a measure 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.180
 small I will be doing a series 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.180
 of five points in white 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.270
 now using an art enamel in 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.870
 gold color I will be delineating the 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.870
 half Moon 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.430
 and that's it, that 's how they're going to achieve 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.290
 this nail art design I hope that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.180
 have enjoyed this video and that 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.190
 make this design using your colors 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.180
 Take care and see each other for the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.180
 next goodbye
