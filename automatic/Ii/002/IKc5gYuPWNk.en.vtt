00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
 string3 the television with blue cross today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.679
 it was 17 years of his last 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.929
 league championship and it seems that every 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.670
 season the set is armed in such 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 way that says they're going to fight for the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.230
 title simply has not come the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.430
 coveted objective of the directive 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.630
 players but especially the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.010
 fans 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.830
 johan rodríguez part of that team 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.340
 champion although he was not in the final what 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.340
 remember 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.420
 they say that to remember is to live they have passed 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.030
 already 17 years of the last league championship 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.770
 of blue cross and although johan rodríguez no 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.450
 the grand finale was present after 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.550
 the expulsion he suffered against atlante 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.559
 in the semifinals still the former canterano 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.620
 that ended up being forged in the ferris wheel 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:53.330
 he has that glory day very present 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.290
 I had little time in anticipation of my 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.610
 half a year a year because to me it was like something 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.470
 very very fortunate in life not that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.049
 have little time in a team of 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.430
 prevention is in consolidating champions 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.700
 as 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.030
 it's a huge prize I lived it at 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.920
 maximum because basically we do not 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.870
 they recognized many people 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.490
 víctor manuel vucetich was the man who 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.830
 he gave the opportunity to johan rodríguez 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.260
 within the first machine equipment and 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.330
 in the maximum circuit although their relationship 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.280
 it was neither good nor bad with Luis 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.229
 fernando had the midfielder has 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.979
 recognized the good work of the people 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.080
 as a coach I think more important and 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.330
 the smartest thing about him is that he is 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.700
 intelligent in how to know how to take a 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.220
 player to a player from hierarchy to a 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.610
 young 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.650
 psychology works a lot to tell you 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.650
 what happens what will happen if you win to 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.020
 happen if you lose a lot of ideas from 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.240
 the good and the bad do not try to take 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.980
 well with how much the players after 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.170
 that last title that that has only 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.480
 reached five finals in tournaments 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.590
 short ones simply staying in the 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.900
 tried 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.630
 leaving again a long drought 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.030
 in the norm that I tell you 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.680
 today it remains the same for two 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.960
 when once champions you follow the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.900
 failures have not happened to me games of all 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.690
 kind of all nationalities this 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.690
 coach is what was born 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.040
 boys girls who 17 years ago valencia 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.650
 they knew that we were champions and now 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.630
 continue to grow is 7 years old and continue 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
 seeing his team that is not a champion 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.930
 doubt Rodriguez talks about who could 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.500
 be the culprit is this problem to have 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.459
 all this means that the amateur 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.880
 managers the players the coach 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.850
 The promoters 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.120
 this yoke that all in blame a 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.490
 little bit of everything and it seems that when you're 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.710
 of a team all participate when 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.140
 You win is the winner when you want 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.750
 you lose so he will leave 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.870
 I even recognize who is sad 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.090
 see a machine submerged in this here 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.640
 I do not know if I feel lucky or I 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.890
 I feel as sad as shame 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.260
 that I was two of the last champions 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.420
 in 97 with consul I do not know you and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.210
 we photo anything because he has not done it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.440
 I have a sadness like the 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.230
 courage that after two years can not 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.120
