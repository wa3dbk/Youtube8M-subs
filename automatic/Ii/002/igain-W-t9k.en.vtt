it's not to confuse anyone recently I

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.210 
it's not to confuse anyone recently I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
started a campaign a fundraiser of sorts

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.210 
started a campaign a fundraiser of sorts
in<00:00:22.220> order<00:00:22.490> to<00:00:23.289> get<00:00:24.289> enough<00:00:24.470> money<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:25.070> get<00:00:25.160> a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
in order to get enough money to get a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.750 
in order to get enough money to get a
new<00:00:25.280> computer<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:26.030> I<00:00:26.060> can<00:00:26.119> make<00:00:26.360> a<00:00:26.390> new<00:00:26.600> album

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760
