-A Stilinski in the center of this whole mess, what a shocker. Think you can answer

-But he did have to slow down

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.670

-Alright how 'bout this, next time I see him I'll

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.050
give him a field sobriety test, okay, we'll do the alphabet start with F and with U.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.219
-How 'bout you just tell me what the hell happened here?

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:38.219
-I don't know what happened here, I was stuck in the elevators the whole time.
