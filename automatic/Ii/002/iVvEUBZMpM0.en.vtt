00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:07.639 
update here on this pc engine duo are

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.509 
update here on this pc engine duo are
when<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.670> got<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.030> home<00:00:09.059> here<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:10.250> plugged<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.370> in

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
when I got it home here I plugged it in

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.700 
when I got it home here I plugged it in
and<00:00:11.730> there<00:00:12.360> was<00:00:12.480> no<00:00:12.690> power<00:00:12.929> going<00:00:13.230> through<00:00:13.590> it

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and there was no power going through it

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.440 
and there was no power going through it
at<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.429> wouldn't<00:00:14.700> even<00:00:14.730> turn<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
at all it wouldn't even turn on so I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.750 
at all it wouldn't even turn on so I
ripped<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.809> apart<00:00:15.980> took<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> look<00:00:17.190> at<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.460> and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
ripped it apart took a look at it and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.750 
ripped it apart took a look at it and
the<00:00:18.180> AC<00:00:18.930> adapter<00:00:19.619> part<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.400> was<00:00:20.520> connected

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the AC adapter part that was connected

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.689 
the AC adapter part that was connected
to<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.320> board<00:00:22.320> had<00:00:22.710> actually<00:00:23.100> broken<00:00:23.340> free

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
to the board had actually broken free

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.509 
to the board had actually broken free
from<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.000> solder<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.529> resolder<00:00:26.250> dit

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
from the solder so I resolder dit

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.870 
from the solder so I resolder dit
scrubbed<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> up<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.740> working<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.130> it's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
scrubbed it up and it's working now it's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.730 
scrubbed it up and it's working now it's
working<00:00:30.090> pretty<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.480> actually<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
working pretty good actually so I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.709 
working pretty good actually so I
figured<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.460> turn<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.000> show<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
figured it turn that on and show you a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
figured it turn that on and show you a
little<00:00:33.899> bit<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.950> guess<00:00:35.160> we'll

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
little bit of that and I guess we'll

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.910 
little bit of that and I guess we'll
just<00:00:35.399> use<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.110> free<00:00:37.110> game<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.559> got<00:00:37.739> in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
just use the free game that I got in

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.690 
just use the free game that I got in
there<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.489> Bomberman<00:00:39.450> 93<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.649> kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> flip

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
there so Bomberman 93 so kind of flip

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.000 
there so Bomberman 93 so kind of flip
the<00:00:41.730> switch<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:43.370> take<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> look<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.020> we've

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the switch on here take a look and we've

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.100 
the switch on here take a look and we've
got<00:00:47.250> picture<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:51.090> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> figured

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
got picture so I'm I kind of figured

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.080 
got picture so I'm I kind of figured
that<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.829> anything<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.640> would<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> first

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that if anything this would be the first

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720 
that if anything this would be the first
thing<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> would<00:00:54.930> work<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.949> usually<00:00:56.309> on

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
thing that would work because usually on

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.319 
thing that would work because usually on
these<00:00:56.940> pc<00:00:57.449> engines<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.579> card<00:00:59.579> ports<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
these pc engines the card ports are the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.049 
these pc engines the card ports are the
easy<00:01:00.510> ones<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.800> hard<00:01:02.039> ones<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.730> working

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
easy ones the hard ones to get working

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.789 
easy ones the hard ones to get working
are<00:01:03.480> usually<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.489> DVD<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> laser

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
are usually the DVD or the the laser

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
are usually the DVD or the the laser
portion<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:08.970> usually<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
portion of it they usually have the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.760 
portion of it they usually have the
biggest<00:01:09.780> problem<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:10.619> usually

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
biggest problem when they don't usually

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.859 
biggest problem when they don't usually
want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> read<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.350> do<00:01:13.350> take<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.630> stop<00:01:15.630> this

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
want to read so do take this stop this

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.109 
want to read so do take this stop this
move<00:01:16.650> our<00:01:16.830> controller<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> way

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
move our controller here out of the way

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.289 
move our controller here out of the way
a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.420> bit<00:01:18.560> that's<00:01:19.560> what's<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.979> there

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
a little bit that's what's out of there

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.249 
a little bit that's what's out of there
take<00:01:21.299> our<00:01:21.540> card<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.520> usually<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:24.600> with

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
take our card and like I usually do with

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.140 
take our card and like I usually do with

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
most of my most of my pc engine do ours

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.969 
most of my most of my pc engine do ours
when<00:01:30.540> i<00:01:30.570> first<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.380> i<00:01:31.590> usually<00:01:31.950> use

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
