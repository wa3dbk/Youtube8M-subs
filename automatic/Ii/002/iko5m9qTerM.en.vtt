time by hand two decades ago when I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.070 
time by hand two decades ago when I
first<00:00:16.949> started<00:00:17.369> ninth<00:00:17.640> training<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.930> all

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
first started ninth training really all

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.330 
first started ninth training really all
we<00:00:19.260> had<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.800> homemade<00:00:20.699> wooden<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:22.340> aluminum

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
we had was homemade wooden and aluminum

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.939 
we had was homemade wooden and aluminum
knives<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.119> although<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.230> felt<00:00:25.500> like<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.830> were

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
knives and although we felt like we were

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.970 
knives and although we felt like we were
training<00:00:26.279> hard<00:00:26.720> there's<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:27.990> only<00:00:28.410> so

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
training hard there's really only so

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.429 
training hard there's really only so
much<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.929> then

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
much that you can do with this and then

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.250 
much that you can do with this and then
safety<00:00:32.130> becomes<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.700> problem<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:33.989> hitting

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
safety becomes a problem if I'm hitting

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
safety becomes a problem if I'm hitting
meaty<00:00:35.100> parts<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.880> body<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.600> these

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
meaty parts of my body with these

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.750 
meaty parts of my body with these
aluminum<00:00:37.410> knives<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.129> wooden<00:00:38.430> knives

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
aluminum knives of these wooden knives

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.600 
aluminum knives of these wooden knives
it's<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.960> no<00:00:40.110> problem<00:00:40.219> but<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.340> soon<00:00:41.520> as

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it's really no problem but as soon as

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.700 
it's really no problem but as soon as
you<00:00:41.760> start<00:00:42.059> stabbing<00:00:42.420> into<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> ribs<00:00:43.379> or

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and you know years ago when we were

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.330 
and you know years ago when we were
training<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.719> constantly<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.920> swollen

feel little chips there in the bone

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600 
feel little chips there in the bone
of<00:01:04.049> course<00:01:04.320> you'd<00:01:04.500> never<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.250> hit<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
of course you'd never want to be hit in

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.910 
of course you'd never want to be hit in
the<00:01:05.700> head<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.840> teeth<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.590> so

the head or in the teeth with this so

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.100 
the head or in the teeth with this so
everybody<00:01:08.700> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.060> stayed<00:01:09.360> away<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
everybody kind of stayed away from the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.830 
everybody kind of stayed away from the
face<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:11.040> worse<00:01:11.580> than<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> you'd<00:01:12.420> gear

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
face or worse than that you'd gear

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.469 
face or worse than that you'd gear
yourself<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.619> you'd<00:01:13.890> put<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.310> hockey<00:01:14.939> gloves

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
yourself up you'd put on hockey gloves

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.550 
yourself up you'd put on hockey gloves
and<00:01:15.900> headgear<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.770> helmet<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.750> really<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and headgear and helmet and really that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
and headgear and helmet and really that
gets<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> way<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.610> training<00:01:20.970> because

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
gets in the way of your training because

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.880 
gets in the way of your training because
it<00:01:21.540> gives<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> false<00:01:22.200> sense<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.830> security

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
it gives you a false sense of security

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
it gives you a false sense of security
and<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.790> end<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.180> crashing<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.110> doing

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and you end up crashing in and doing

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.429 
and you end up crashing in and doing
things<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.400> never<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:28.049> fear

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
things you would never do if that fear

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.219 
things you would never do if that fear
of<00:01:28.680> getting<00:01:28.829> hit<00:01:29.220> was<00:01:29.490> still<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
of getting hit was still there so it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.760 
of getting hit was still there so it
ended<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.850> changing<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.600> reality<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.619> way

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
ended up changing the reality of the way

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.109 
ended up changing the reality of the way
we<00:01:35.009> trained<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:37.369> decided<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:38.729> had<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
we trained so I decided that they had to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
we trained so I decided that they had to
be<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> better<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.170> then<00:01:40.500> came<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.920> with

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
be a better way and then came up with

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
be a better way and then came up with
look<00:01:41.340> knives<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.420> again<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> show<00:01:45.110> you'd

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
look knives and again just to show you'd

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.289 
look knives and again just to show you'd
never<00:01:46.380> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.549> shot<00:01:48.030> off<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
never want to take that shot off the

never want to take that shot off the
bone<00:01:49.939> okay<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> homemade<00:01:52.320> aluminum

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950

really a dangerous way to train so we
came<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:08.970> nook<00:02:09.179> knives
