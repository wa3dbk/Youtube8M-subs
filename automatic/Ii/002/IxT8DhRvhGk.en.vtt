00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
shot it's a little bit difficult to do

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.410 
shot it's a little bit difficult to do
the<00:02:28.430> other<00:02:28.550> thing<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:28.820> want<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.180> show<00:02:29.360> you

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
the other thing I just want to show you

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.170 
the other thing I just want to show you
is<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.470> also<00:02:30.980> do<00:02:31.310> have<00:02:31.340> these<00:02:31.820> sort<00:02:32.120> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
is that you also do have these sort of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.170 
is that you also do have these sort of
mini<00:02:32.420> apps<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.800> one<00:02:34.100> down<00:02:34.340> here<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.850> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
mini apps and one down here is the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.030 
mini apps and one down here is the
remote<00:02:35.570> control<00:02:36.050> if<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.320> can<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:36.620> tap<00:02:36.830> on<00:02:36.980> that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
remote control if I can just tap on that

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.080 
remote control if I can just tap on that
and<00:02:38.500> you'll<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.160> opened<00:02:40.610> up<00:02:40.730> here

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
and you'll see that it's opened up here

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.390 
and you'll see that it's opened up here
so<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.110> can<00:02:42.140> still<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.710> doing<00:02:42.950> things<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
so you can still be doing things in the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.310 
so you can still be doing things in the
background<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.090> flicking<00:02:44.600> through<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.200> your

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
background and flicking through to your

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.590 
background and flicking through to your
different<00:02:45.850> controllers<00:02:46.850> here<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.390> can

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
different controllers here so I can

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.690 
different controllers here so I can
change<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.960> channel<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.680> set-top<00:02:49.190> box<00:02:49.430> or

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
change the channel on the set-top box or

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.310 
change the channel on the set-top box or
some<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.750> main<00:02:50.960> controls<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:53.320> TV

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
some of the main controls on the TV

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.640 
some of the main controls on the TV
whilst<00:02:54.680> actually<00:02:55.180> doing<00:02:56.180> things<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:57.470> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
whilst actually doing things in the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.050 
whilst actually doing things in the
background<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:58.340> for<00:02:58.490> example<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.910> could<00:02:58.970> have

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
background so for example I could have

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.580 
background so for example I could have
YouTube<00:02:59.540> up<00:02:59.780> and<00:02:59.930> I<00:02:59.990> still<00:03:00.230> got<00:03:00.380> remote

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
YouTube up and I still got remote

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.610 
YouTube up and I still got remote
control<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.880> can<00:03:02.120> control<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.870> television

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
control and I can control the television

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.620 
control and I can control the television
and<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.310> set-top<00:03:04.760> box<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:07.450> switch<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
and the set-top box so I can switch the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.150 
and the set-top box so I can switch the
set-top<00:03:09.080> box<00:03:09.320> back<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:11.050> could<00:03:12.050> go<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
set-top box back on I could go to the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.250 
set-top box back on I could go to the
television<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.360> could<00:03:14.570> switch<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:15.050> off

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
television and I could switch that off

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.040 
television and I could switch that off
by<00:03:15.890> whilst<00:03:16.430> I'm<00:03:16.610> still<00:03:16.820> browsing<00:03:17.240> YouTube<00:03:17.420> so
