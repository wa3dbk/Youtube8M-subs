00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
desktops that will reboot the computer

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.369 
desktops that will reboot the computer
and<00:00:59.859> enable<00:01:00.190> everything<00:01:00.699> that's<00:01:01.000> required<00:01:01.719> to

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
and enable everything that's required to

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.770 
and enable everything that's required to
take<00:01:02.770> advantage<00:01:03.190> of<00:01:03.340> this<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:04.119> save<00:01:04.330> time<00:01:04.570> for

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
take advantage of this to save time for

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.960 
take advantage of this to save time for
us<00:01:04.900> I've<00:01:05.080> already<00:01:05.350> done<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.970> more

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
us I've already done that more

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.780 
us I've already done that more
importantly<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.750> next<00:01:07.990> step<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.830> create<00:01:09.430> a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
importantly the next step is to create a

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.420 
importantly the next step is to create a
virtual<00:01:10.060> desktop<00:01:10.479> template<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:11.860> this<00:01:12.100> will<00:01:12.280> be

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
virtual desktop template so this will be

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.420 
virtual desktop template so this will be
the<00:01:12.549> basis<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.530> each<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.070> virtual

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
the basis of each of the virtual

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.460 
the basis of each of the virtual
desktops<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.240> will<00:01:16.390> be<00:01:16.570> associated<00:01:17.259> with

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
desktops that will be associated with

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.840 
desktops that will be associated with
the<00:01:18.540> multi-point<00:01:19.590> stations<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:21.549> we'll<00:01:21.700> kick

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
the multi-point stations so we'll kick

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.660 
the multi-point stations so we'll kick
that<00:01:22.000> off<00:01:22.030> now<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.890> can<00:01:24.009> either<00:01:24.130> point<00:01:24.460> this

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
that off now you can either point this

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.719 
that off now you can either point this
at<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.450> share<00:01:26.320> where<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.740> keep<00:01:26.950> your<00:01:27.220> golden

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
at a share where you keep your golden

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.450 
at a share where you keep your golden
image<00:01:27.939> of<00:01:28.150> Windows<00:01:28.479> 7<00:01:28.810> or<00:01:28.990> 8<00:01:29.110> enterprise<00:01:29.560> or

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
image of Windows 7 or 8 enterprise or

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.179 
image of Windows 7 or 8 enterprise or
you<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.790> point<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.150> at<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.420> DVD<00:01:32.110> that's<00:01:33.009> in

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
you can point it at the DVD that's in

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.060 
you can point it at the DVD that's in
the<00:01:33.310> DVD<00:01:33.640> drive<00:01:34.049> okay<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:35.110> now<00:01:35.740> we<00:01:35.799> have<00:01:35.920> a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
the DVD drive okay so now we have a

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.249 
the DVD drive okay so now we have a
template<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.610> we<00:01:36.700> just<00:01:36.880> created<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.479> the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
template that we just created and the

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.929 
template that we just created and the
next<00:01:38.500> step<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.920> process<00:01:39.100> will<00:01:39.579> be<00:01:39.610> to

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
next step in the process will be to

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.910 
next step in the process will be to
customize<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.750> template<00:01:41.170> with<00:01:41.710> the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
customize that template with the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.410 
customize that template with the
applications<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.880> settings<00:01:43.210> that<00:01:43.270> we

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
applications and the settings that we

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.289 
applications and the settings that we
want<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.659> be<00:01:43.780> available<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:44.259> all<00:01:44.470> users<00:01:45.299> okay

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
want to be available to all users okay

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.819 
want to be available to all users okay
having<00:01:46.630> made<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.899> customizations<00:01:47.619> that<00:01:47.710> I

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
now that we have our customized template

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.910 
now that we have our customized template
is<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:03.250> actually<00:02:04.200> associate<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.409> template

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
is to actually associate that template

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.630 
is to actually associate that template
with<00:02:06.219> the<00:02:06.520> multi-point<00:02:07.210> server<00:02:07.329> workstations

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
with the multi-point server workstations

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.640 
with the multi-point server workstations
so<00:02:09.640> if<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.450> run<00:02:10.629> into<00:02:10.869> an<00:02:10.989> instance<00:02:11.349> where<00:02:11.620> you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
so if you run into an instance where you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.530 
so if you run into an instance where you
have<00:02:11.950> some<00:02:12.550> piece<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.879> software<00:02:13.239> that<00:02:13.360> you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
have some piece of software that you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.040 
have some piece of software that you
really

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
really

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.380 
really
to<00:02:14.260> run<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:15.280> requires<00:02:15.700> its<00:02:16.090> own

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
to run and that requires its own

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.930 
to run and that requires its own
operating<00:02:16.960> system<00:02:17.280> virtual<00:02:18.280> desktops<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
operating system virtual desktops is a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.680 
operating system virtual desktops is a
solution<00:02:19.270> for<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.680> thanks
