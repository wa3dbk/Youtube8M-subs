 the grade 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.320
 we are in the cartoon factory 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.850
 where Mourinho series is produced in 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.250
 especially before 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.280
 we came to know the backstage of this 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.290
 true factory is to discourage and nothing 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.420
 better than we were with a man who 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.879
 inspired this series 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.870
 thank you josé mourinho for luxa receive 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.800
 in your house 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 I thank you for coming eventually 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.059
 to be successful on the spot in a short time 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 time is a test we are used to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.600
 to see in your face is what it took to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.659
 to set up a project of this size very 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.310
 strength and dedication 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.710
 such as in football it is a game of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.900
 team in a production as this sanction is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 a united and motivated team when 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.540
 we get first factor becomes 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.950
 possible 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.380
 but then how does this work? 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.630
 team did not happen in the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 this later creating the concept of the series 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.680
 it is necessary to write the scripts where 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.360
 is all the story and the games 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.530
 the moments our credits are always 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.970
 was synchronized with studies of environments 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 with drawings in 2d 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:51.380
 before in 3D modeling after 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:51.380
 defined is to paint it illuminating 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.619
 we arrived at its production 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:16.700
 we have a serious and competent team 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:16.700
 so what it does 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.310
 It's really the other world. 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.980
 freedom the orange shirts are stones 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.040
 But I promise if one day we'll get to 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.810
 being a professional team is 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.880
 respectively for everyone is 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.950

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.910
 The game of our life is to test a lot 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.250
 grab a lot of soul was now forced 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.630
 I was barred and I'm going to try 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.680
 it's time we go there, give us problems 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.600
 nor goals like we hope 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.230

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:26.230

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.700
 all controlled block are one more voice 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.390
 higher than the one that gives a touch like this 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.330
 but it was in that frame for what goes 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.459
 result here is a good one that does not 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.110
 that the work comes the sporting finds 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.900
