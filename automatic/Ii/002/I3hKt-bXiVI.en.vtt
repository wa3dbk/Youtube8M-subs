00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 I have eleven new movies from the cinema 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.759
 seen on the month of august and that 's why 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.189
 Here my top and flop movies from the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.139
 cinema month august 2015 and we 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.969
 giving away 3 x 2 tickets for the movie 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.170
 by the same one also in this one 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.170
 month is started 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.279
 franck is a very different film 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 I'm sure it's creative 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.670
 many people give the film good 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.170
 be found but with me he has times like this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.240
 not ignited and that's why 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.010
 From me four points continue to hitman 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.990
 again a big flop our still 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 worse than its predecessor codename 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.040
 Anke looks mega stylish and cool 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.149
 has great camera rides and the music 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.800
 is also super cool 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.090
 Unfortunately, the main characters even fit 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.309
 not just the stories anymore 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.170
 as boring a pity there would have been 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.730
 I can get much more out of it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.160
 Great superhero movie fan banner 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.200
 fantastic four just disappointing 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.850
 In the film, there's hardly anything that looks like it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.739
 we did not know there is little 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.809
 action the characters are cold and the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.190
 Effects are just lamers since I am 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.559
 but I did not fall asleep 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.559
 Here are well-intentioned 55 points 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.960
 Place number 7 I really hate here 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.640
 German films that it is no secret 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 more but at seven is something 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.940
 other it is a teenage film adaptation 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.100
 the easy science fiction and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.050
 historically scanned maze scans 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.460
 be runner tribute of panem and co 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.690
 Probably have fun here 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.200
 entertaining teen movie for 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.840
 German conditions 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.220
 above average is family 65 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 points and I try to film three 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.070
 sometimes two tickets just write me in 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.300
 the comments if you watch the movie 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.790
 wanted and then with a little luck 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.340
 Can the friends and my friends spend 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.690
 I come from the central valley the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.690
 desert behind the hollywood hills 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.920
 especially actor waiters and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.390
 wannabe celebrities live alone 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.470
 could not afford to be young on the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.020
 sixth place 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.610
 mario double zac efron plays a 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.720
 Emerging dj because of course 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.220
 wants to become better known 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.570
 You can follow the movie well 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.790
 even if you are not on budget 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.290
 junk and techno music knows it goes 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.580
 also for friendship and love the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.710
 chemistry between the lovers here 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.210
 agrees zac efron plays well and the film 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.280
 is boring at no point beautiful 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.840
 tells for fans of zac efron and dj 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.780
 techno music is probably here 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.069
 A must have 67 points 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.560
 one is the harder part quite well 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.730
 understand but that's just too much 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.250
 one before you explode number five soft 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.380
 power pop lids wood plays here 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.270
 successful boxer dramatic 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.100
 changes in life he imminent 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.600
 gets into the darkest moments of his life 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.850
 sometimes it 's all life 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.590
 bit too dramatic and the movie becomes 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.569
 This is a really hard hunk jack 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.069
 played but extra class 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.260
 not only physically does he look like 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.670
 a boxer he behaves so me too 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.830
 would not be surprised if here is one 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.180
 mini tion for him at the film comes around 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.709
 in itself is actually a very good one 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.750
 but unfortunately too predictable 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.489
 and plays with many clichÃ©s who 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.260
 many box movies and sports movies seen 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.760
 has recognized this movie before he 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.140
 but who has not seen him yet 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.880
 has seen many movies of this kind 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.459
 should absolutely watch the movie 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.650
 from me because there's only 68 points 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.310
 we have one of the best today 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.670
 youth choirs of the world visit us 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.670
 greeted with me 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.690
 in square number four is the choir in 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.240
 the film is about a boy in the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.920
 Chorus sings yes I know that sounds mega 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.690
 boring and not interesting at all 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.610
 but the film proves that you are from everyone 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.020
 theme can make a good film of 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.370
 film a beautiful story which is very good 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.970
 has been implemented and therefore there's 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.630
 Here are seven points now where your powers 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.030
 dwindle 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.500
 they feel immortal we offer 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.790
 the most creative minds of humanity 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.790
 more time for their exploit potential 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.530
 Place number three is service 11 it is 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.370
 a science fiction mystery thriller with 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.960
 Ryan Reynolds 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.370
 It's about being an older man 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.990
 Consciousness in a younger body 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.220
 but something has changed 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.450
 not and the film is developing too 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.980
 a mystery thriller 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.810
 the film is very exciting and above all 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.130
 very well cut the story is indeed 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.660
 no masterful story and has 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.709
 maybe a few gaps but still 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.630
 she is also interesting and exciting 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:08.480
 enough 76 points 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.200
 you have to get yourself through 250,000 meters 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.700
 boil liters of pressurized water 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:21.000
 and that no metal on the body wear 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:22.919
 no oxygen bottles on the second 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.450
 place we have mission impossible roc 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.680
 I already had one nation for the film 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.360
 made a review and I had one 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.010
 Given 7.9 but I have in the movie 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.260
 again looked at and noticed 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.820
 simply one of the best 2015 films 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.740
 For me, this one is definitely the one 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.360
 best mission impossible for ingenious 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.700
 handmade of the action super 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.740
 interesting story great characters a lot 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.540
 humor a great look and more 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.580
 a cool villain the movie has 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:50.010
 just everything that has to have such a film 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.470
 popcorn cinema of the finest 83 points if 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.450
 you have the chance to change the situation 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.690
 change 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:05.820
 what to do when the beat starts 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:07.919
 you do it through the street is clear that 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.290
 was and in the first place the 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.970
 best movie this month is straight 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.620
 outta compton the movie got me first 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.120
 not at all interested and I wanted 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.280
 the movie does not look at all but the 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.720
 film has surprised me tremendously therefore 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.090
 the story of the hip-hop group end 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.860
 July just masterfully told that 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.450
 this is a very good biopic which 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.669
 just been staged very mega good 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.470
 is easy for fans of dr dre and co 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.940
 a dream movie and for everyone else 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.700
 who is not interested in that 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.560
 this is still a strong movie 86 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.419
 points which are your top films 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.020
 in august or which ones you are watching 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.000

 Write me in the comments clicks 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.700
