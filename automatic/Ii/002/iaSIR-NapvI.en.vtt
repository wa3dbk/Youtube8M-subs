quick tutorial making it go fool I know

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.270 
quick tutorial making it go fool I know
it's<00:00:08.760> not<00:00:08.849> very<00:00:08.910> exciting<00:00:09.360> but<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:10.110> was<00:00:10.950> hunting

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
it's not very exciting but I was hunting

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.740 
it's not very exciting but I was hunting
around<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.790> try<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.090> find<00:00:12.240> out<00:00:12.389> how<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.509> make

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
around to try and find out how to make

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.460 
around to try and find out how to make
room<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.170> project<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:15.230> that's<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:16.379> I'd

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
room for a project and that's what I'd

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.720 
room for a project and that's what I'd
make<00:00:16.650> quick<00:00:16.920> video<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> show<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.580> how

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
make quick video to show you how

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.810 
make quick video to show you how
actually<00:00:18.090> ends<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.630> doing<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.160> go

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
actually ends up doing it so here you go

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.170 
actually ends up doing it so here you go
got<00:00:21.090> create<00:00:21.920> polygons<00:00:22.920> primitive<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.029> then

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
got create polygons primitive and then

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.960 
got create polygons primitive and then
go<00:00:24.570> platonic<00:00:25.670> slits<00:00:27.349> didn't<00:00:28.349> hear<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
go platonic slits didn't hear that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.530 
go platonic slits didn't hear that
and<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.890> y'all<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:32.130> two<00:00:32.340> mesh<00:00:34.070> smooth

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
and then y'all got two mesh smooth

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.500 
and then y'all got two mesh smooth
smooth<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.750> MUX<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.850> good<00:00:38.969> idea<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
smooth out for MUX so it's good idea to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.160 
smooth out for MUX so it's good idea to
say<00:00:39.750> things<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.829> good<00:00:41.070> yeah<00:00:41.700> fly<00:00:42.170> guys

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
say things are so good yeah fly guys

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170 
say things are so good yeah fly guys
that<00:00:43.410> neon<00:00:43.890> Krypton<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> channel<00:00:45.000> books

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that neon Krypton here to channel books

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.560 
that neon Krypton here to channel books
and<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.809> poly<00:00:46.079> smooth<00:00:46.440> faces<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.570> but

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
and go on poly smooth faces one but

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.799 
and go on poly smooth faces one but
method<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.260> Linea<00:00:50.190> that's<00:00:50.850> quite<00:00:51.239> important

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
method on Linea that's quite important

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.049 
method on Linea that's quite important
you<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.829> make<00:00:53.070> sure<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
you do that so make sure you do that and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.130 
you do that so make sure you do that and
then<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> divisions<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.449> cannot<00:00:57.870> do

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
then get up to divisions you cannot do

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080 
then get up to divisions you cannot do
two<00:00:58.469> or<00:00:58.680> three<00:00:59.219> depending<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.910> how<00:01:00.030> many

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
two or three depending on how many

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.170 
two or three depending on how many
little<00:01:01.079> faces<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.890> wouldn't<00:01:02.250> say<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:04.890> think<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
little faces you wouldn't say I think I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.929 
little faces you wouldn't say I think I
don't<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.540> three<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:08.159> then<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.729> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
don't do three and then you want to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.160 
don't do three and then you want to
smooth<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:09.990> left<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.470> key<00:01:10.799> border<00:01:11.250> off

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
smooth you these left on key border off

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:21.190 
smooth you these left on key border off
and<00:01:13.729> keep<00:01:14.729> selection<00:01:15.240> border<00:01:15.540> off<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.960> well

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.620 

divisions<00:01:22.200> per<00:01:22.710> edge<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:26.390> haven't<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.450> back

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
divisions per edge I haven't go back

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.660 
divisions per edge I haven't go back
second<00:01:28.110> hit<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.490> actually<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.560> divisions

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
second hit that to actually on divisions

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.190 
second hit that to actually on divisions
edge<00:01:32.900> freeing<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.350> way<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.180> then<00:01:36.200> push

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
edge freeing that this way and then push

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.410 
edge freeing that this way and then push
straight<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> point<00:01:38.759> 5<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.970> one

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
straight go to point 5 and then this one

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.370 
straight go to point 5 and then this one
point<00:01:42.659> five<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.850> scare<00:01:45.090> us<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
point five just scare us out we have a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.719 
point five just scare us out we have a
line<00:01:46.770> from<00:01:47.130> screen<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.579> want

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
line from screen and then what we want

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.569 
line from screen and then what we want
to<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.290> up<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.860> edit<00:01:53.670> mesh<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.390> champ

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
to do is get up to edit mesh and champ

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.340 
to do is get up to edit mesh and champ
champ<00:01:56.579> fat<00:01:57.290> vertex<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:59.719> make<00:02:00.719> sure<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.170> have

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
champ fat vertex and make sure you have

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.040 
champ fat vertex and make sure you have
this<00:02:01.500> set<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.060> zero<00:02:03.060> point<00:02:03.479> double<00:02:04.409> three<00:02:04.770> five

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.820 

well<00:02:08.319> that's<00:02:08.590> pretty<00:02:08.830> normal<00:02:09.009> anyway<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.640> apply

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
well that's pretty normal anyway I apply

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.120 
well that's pretty normal anyway I apply
close<00:02:11.830> that<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.310> then<00:02:12.520> you<00:02:12.670> will<00:02:12.790> see<00:02:13.120> that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
close that and then you will see that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.770 
close that and then you will see that
you<00:02:15.130> have<00:02:15.810> little<00:02:16.810> shapes<00:02:18.120> spice<00:02:19.120> up<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.569> bit<00:02:19.750> I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
you have little shapes spice up a bit I

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.460 
you have little shapes spice up a bit I
can<00:02:20.050> see<00:02:20.290> what's<00:02:20.410> going<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.540> then<00:02:23.230> you

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
can see what's going on and and then you

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.350 
can see what's going on and and then you
want<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.709> go<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.890> faces<00:02:25.140> select<00:02:26.140> all<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.500> faces

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
want to go to faces select all the faces

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.030 
want to go to faces select all the faces
then<00:02:28.360> go<00:02:28.510> edit<00:02:28.900> mesh<00:02:29.110> extrude<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.900> it's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
then go edit mesh extrude and it's

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.259 
then go edit mesh extrude and it's
important<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.519> make<00:02:34.300> sure<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:35.730> key<00:02:36.730> faces

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
important to make sure that key faces

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:45.210 
important to make sure that key faces
together<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.989> turned<00:02:38.530> off<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:42.540> then<00:02:44.069> what<00:02:45.069> you

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
together is turned off and then what you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.590 
together is turned off and then what you
can<00:02:45.280> do<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:47.700> couple<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.970> ways<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.120> can<00:02:49.420> do

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
can do is a couple of ways you can do

00:02:49.600 --> 00:03:13.450 
can do is a couple of ways you can do
that

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.120 

do<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.700> but<00:03:15.420> man<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.320> said<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.620> he<00:03:17.460> can<00:03:18.080> get

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
do that but man if I said I he can get

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:34.710 
do that but man if I said I he can get
in<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.190> bit

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.510 

and<00:03:35.720> then<00:03:36.290> you'll<00:03:36.650> meet<00:03:36.800> Jay<00:03:37.070> again

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
and then you'll meet Jay again
