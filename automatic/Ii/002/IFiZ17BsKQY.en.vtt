00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
Jr 1977 here what I have today is card

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
Jr 1977 here what I have today is card
for<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.400> PSP<00:00:08.700> out<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.380> psp-3000<00:00:10.380> I'm<00:00:10.980> not

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
for the PSP out of the psp-3000 I'm not

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.299 
for the PSP out of the psp-3000 I'm not
sure<00:00:11.429> if<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.730> will<00:00:11.849> work<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:13.049> 1000<00:00:13.769> I'm

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
sure if it will work for the 1000 I'm

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.240 
sure if it will work for the 1000 I'm
assuming<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.849> will<00:00:15.000> work<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> 2000<00:00:16.250> but

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
assuming it will work for the 2000 but

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.390 
assuming it will work for the 2000 but
uh<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.670> think<00:00:18.300> even<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> 3000<00:00:19.650> when<00:00:20.369> I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
uh I think even for the 3000 when I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.859 
uh I think even for the 3000 when I
looked<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:20.880> they<00:00:21.119> said<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.660> only

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
looked up they said that you can only

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.080 
looked up they said that you can only
put<00:00:22.080> up<00:00:22.230> an<00:00:22.680> 8<00:00:22.859> gigabyte<00:00:23.130> card<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:23.880> something

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
put up an 8 gigabyte card or something

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.109 
put up an 8 gigabyte card or something
in<00:00:24.359> there<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> can't<00:00:24.840> remember<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
in there I can't remember the the

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.970 
in there I can't remember the the
largest<00:00:27.119> card<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> chicken<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.619> largest

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
largest card the chicken the largest

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.380 
largest card the chicken the largest
capacity<00:00:29.099> card<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.910> supposed<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
capacity card it's supposed to be the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
capacity card it's supposed to be the
handle<00:00:31.009> but<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.219> went<00:00:32.700> out<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.149> got<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:34.340> dual

handle but I went out and I got a a dual
slot<00:00:35.640> adapter<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.960> pro<00:00:37.170> duo<00:00:37.410> dual<00:00:38.309> slot

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
slot adapter it's a pro duo dual slot

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.900 
slot adapter it's a pro duo dual slot
adapter<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.399> has<00:00:41.610> micro

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
adapter and as you can see it has micro

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.160 
adapter and as you can see it has micro
SD<00:00:42.420> card<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.989> micro<00:00:43.890> SD<00:00:44.190> cards<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.750> 16

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
SD card to micro SD cards and I got 16

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
SD card to micro SD cards and I got 16
gigabytes<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> piece<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
gigabytes of piece so for all you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.560 
gigabytes of piece so for all you
mathematicians<00:00:49.289> that's<00:00:49.469> 32<00:00:49.800> well<00:00:50.670> you're

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
mathematicians that's 32 well you're

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
mathematicians that's 32 well you're
gonna<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> format<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.379> which<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.800> gonna

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
gonna have to format it which is gonna

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.439 
gonna have to format it which is gonna
take<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.399> little<00:00:53.579> bit<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:53.910> data<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
take up a little bit of your data so I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.020 
take up a little bit of your data so I
think<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.899> ended<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.469> 29<00:00:55.860> gigs<00:00:56.190> roughly

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
think it I ended up with 29 gigs roughly

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.680 
think it I ended up with 29 gigs roughly
which<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> still<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.620> considerable<00:00:59.430> amount

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
which is still a considerable amount

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.240 
which is still a considerable amount
more<00:01:00.690> than<00:01:00.930> you're<00:01:01.410> gonna<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.859> gonna<00:01:01.980> take<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
more than you're gonna it's gonna take a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.039 
more than you're gonna it's gonna take a
while<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> fill<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:03.780> PSP

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
while to fill up you know for your PSP

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.380 
while to fill up you know for your PSP
unless<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.460> loaded<00:01:05.880> down<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.060> stuff

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
unless you really loaded down with stuff

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.649 
unless you really loaded down with stuff
but<00:01:06.600> um<00:01:07.460> these<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.520> only<00:01:08.820> class<00:01:09.030> twos

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
but um these are only class twos

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
but um these are only class twos
I'd<00:01:10.409> recommend<00:01:10.830> maybe<00:01:11.159> something<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> little

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I'd recommend maybe something a little

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.469 
I'd recommend maybe something a little
faster<00:01:11.909> than<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.299> class<00:01:12.510> 2<00:01:13.010> but<00:01:14.330> these<00:01:15.330> are

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
faster than the class 2 but these are

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.429 
faster than the class 2 but these are
class<00:01:15.659> twos<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
class twos and

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.120 
class twos and
it<00:01:17.950> saves<00:01:18.640> just<00:01:19.000> fine<00:01:19.289> any<00:01:20.289> data<00:01:20.560> just<00:01:20.890> fine

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
it saves just fine any data just fine

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.100 
it saves just fine any data just fine
now<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.850> videos<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.570> pictures<00:01:22.719> when<00:01:23.079> they

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
now the videos and pictures when they

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.080 
now the videos and pictures when they
click<00:01:23.380> on<00:01:23.590> them<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:24.009> takes<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:24.460> second<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.880> get

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
click on them it takes a second to get

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.889 
click on them it takes a second to get
to<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.500> know<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.490> different<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.780> know

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
to you know to the different you know

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.560 
to you know to the different you know
videos<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.619> stuff<00:01:29.829> to<00:01:30.700> get<00:01:30.820> into<00:01:31.149> there<00:01:31.329> where

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
videos and stuff to get into there where

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.330 
videos and stuff to get into there where
you<00:01:31.630> can<00:01:31.750> watch<00:01:31.899> them<00:01:32.140> but<00:01:32.289> once<00:01:32.799> I<00:01:32.920> get<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.219> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
you can watch them but once I get to the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.039 
you can watch them but once I get to the
video<00:01:33.579> and<00:01:33.759> click<00:01:33.939> on<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.689> runs<00:01:34.869> very

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
video and click on it it runs very

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.120 
video and click on it it runs very
smoothly<00:01:35.679> with<00:01:36.520> no<00:01:36.670> problems<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.710> uh<00:01:38.770> I

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
smoothly with no problems but uh I

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.740 
smoothly with no problems but uh I
picked<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.670> adapter<00:01:40.179> up<00:01:40.270> for<00:01:40.420> like<00:01:40.509> five

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
picked the adapter up for like five

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.440 
picked the adapter up for like five
fifty<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:42.250> two<00:01:42.460> micro<00:01:42.789> SD<00:01:43.030> s<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.210> think<00:01:43.390> I

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
fifty and the two micro SD s I think I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.529 
fifty and the two micro SD s I think I
got<00:01:43.630> for<00:01:43.810> 60<00:01:44.110> bucks<00:01:44.289> for<00:01:44.710> both<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.520> it's<00:01:46.360> not

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
got for 60 bucks for both so it's not

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.139 
got for 60 bucks for both so it's not
really<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:46.899> expensive<00:01:47.700> considering<00:01:48.700> that

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
really that expensive considering that

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.020 
really that expensive considering that
once<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.929> get<00:01:50.049> this<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.349> basically<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.880> know

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
once you get this you basically you know

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.760 
once you get this you basically you know
you<00:01:52.659> basically<00:01:52.869> are<00:01:53.170> not<00:01:53.319> gonna<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.649> get

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
you basically are not gonna have to get

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.850 
you basically are not gonna have to get
a<00:01:53.799> memory<00:01:54.069> card<00:01:54.310> for<00:01:54.459> your<00:01:54.520> PSP<00:01:54.939> for<00:01:55.709> the<00:01:56.709> rest

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
a memory card for your PSP for the rest

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.940 
a memory card for your PSP for the rest
of<00:01:57.069> the<00:01:57.700> time<00:01:57.909> you<00:01:58.030> have<00:01:58.209> it<00:01:58.240> basically<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.920> uh

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
of the time you have it basically but uh

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.389 
of the time you have it basically but uh
I<00:02:00.340> definitely<00:02:00.640> would<00:02:01.090> recommend<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.679> now<00:02:02.679> the

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
I definitely would recommend it now the

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.609 
I definitely would recommend it now the
only<00:02:03.520> downside<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.569> is<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.289> card

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
only downside to it is is this card

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.949 
only downside to it is is this card
itself<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.189> rarely<00:02:06.580> really<00:02:07.420> really<00:02:07.659> fragile

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
itself is rarely really really fragile

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.050 
itself is rarely really really fragile
I've<00:02:08.649> got<00:02:08.799> to<00:02:08.920> really<00:02:09.069> be<00:02:09.220> careful<00:02:09.250> with<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.849> I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
I've got to really be careful with it I

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.900 
I've got to really be careful with it I
mean<00:02:10.959> it's<00:02:11.380> just<00:02:11.470> really<00:02:11.920> Chengzhi<00:02:12.459> it's<00:02:12.700> made

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
mean it's just really Chengzhi it's made

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.449 
mean it's just really Chengzhi it's made
out<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.060> really<00:02:13.269> thin<00:02:13.540> plastic<00:02:14.519> but<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:16.000> know

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
out of really thin plastic but you know

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.089 
out of really thin plastic but you know
it's<00:02:17.909> not<00:02:18.090> really<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.360> bad<00:02:18.989> because<00:02:19.230> you

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
it's not really that bad because you

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.500 
it's not really that bad because you
don't<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.489> need<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.790> take<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.360> here

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
don't really need to take it out of here

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.780 
don't really need to take it out of here
like<00:02:21.629> I<00:02:21.810> did<00:02:22.140> which<00:02:23.069> put<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.549> there<00:02:23.700> you

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
like I did which put it in there you

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.430 
like I did which put it in there you
basically<00:02:24.150> cuz<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.599> transfer<00:02:24.989> anything

that's you know hardcore gamer as far as

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.350 
that's you know hardcore gamer as far as
PSP<00:02:39.000> goes<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> needs<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.170> lot<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.319> memory

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
PSP goes and it needs a lot of memory

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.369 
PSP goes and it needs a lot of memory
like<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.420> said<00:02:42.599> on<00:02:42.720> them<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:42.959> it'll<00:02:43.079> work<00:02:43.140> for

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
like I said on them if it'll work for

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.170 
like I said on them if it'll work for
the<00:02:43.440> 1000<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.129> I'm<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.489> know<00:02:44.790> it'll<00:02:44.940> work<00:02:45.060> for

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the 1000 but I'm I know it'll work for

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.300 
the 1000 but I'm I know it'll work for
the<00:02:45.269> 3000<00:02:45.900> which<00:02:45.989> is<00:02:46.110> what<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> got<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.040> I'm

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the 3000 which is what I got and I'm

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.940 
the 3000 which is what I got and I'm
assuming<00:02:47.519> it'll<00:02:47.849> work<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.090> 2,000<00:02:48.859> but<00:02:49.859> I'm

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
assuming it'll work for 2,000 but I'm

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.369 
assuming it'll work for 2,000 but I'm
not<00:02:50.040> sure<00:02:50.220> about<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.930> not<00:02:51.930> sure<00:02:52.079> if<00:02:52.230> it'll

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
not sure about the not sure if it'll

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.210 
not sure about the not sure if it'll
work<00:02:52.530> for<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:53.010> 1000<00:02:53.790> or<00:02:53.879> not<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.780> think<00:02:55.220> go

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
work for the 1000 or not and I think go

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.670 
work for the 1000 or not and I think go
has<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.609> different<00:02:57.090> type<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.480> card<00:02:57.989> if<00:02:58.560> I

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
has a different type of card if I

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.430 
has a different type of card if I
remember<00:02:59.099> but<00:02:59.519> I'm<00:02:59.579> not<00:02:59.730> sure<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.239> think<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.319> has

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
remember but I'm not sure I think it has

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.960 
remember but I'm not sure I think it has
a<00:03:01.470> different<00:03:01.859> type<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.010> card<00:03:02.340> but<00:03:02.549> if<00:03:02.670> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
a different type of card but if it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.520 
a different type of card but if it
doesn't<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.540> I'm<00:03:03.599> sure<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.780> work<00:03:04.019> for<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.349> also

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530
