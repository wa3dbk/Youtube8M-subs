00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
getting it out of the box first we'll

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.860 
getting it out of the box first we'll
take<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.430> look<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> packaging<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.629> have

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870

take a look at the packaging you have
very<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.440> nice<00:00:52.680> thick<00:00:53.070> closed<00:00:53.610> cell<00:00:54.149> foam

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
very very nice thick closed cell foam

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
very very nice thick closed cell foam
and<00:00:54.899> i<00:00:55.079> don't<00:00:55.260> usually<00:00:55.410> talk<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:55.770> packaging

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and i don't usually talk about packaging

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.500 
and i don't usually talk about packaging
that<00:00:56.489> i<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> mention<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.210> because

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that i want to mention it here because

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
that i want to mention it here because
these<00:00:57.930> boxes<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.469> often<00:00:58.859> used<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.280> reshape

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
these boxes are often used to reshape

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.630 
these boxes are often used to reshape
full<00:01:00.300> computer<00:01:00.840> builds<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:02.399> very

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
full computer builds and that's very

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.520 
full computer builds and that's very
nice<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:02.940> extra<00:01:03.090> padding<00:01:03.539> also<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> black

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
nice to have extra padding also a black

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
shroud that protects the finish when you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.820 
shroud that protects the finish when you
first<00:01:06.299> take<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> white

look<00:01:18.659> from<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> corsair<00:01:19.590> graphite<00:01:20.040> 600<00:01:20.700> t<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
look from the corsair graphite 600 t a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.609 
look from the corsair graphite 600 t a
little<00:01:21.420> bit<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.930> style<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.500> much

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
little bit but in style it's really much

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.429 
little bit but in style it's really much
closer<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.369> recent<00:01:23.549> 230<00:01:24.360> t<00:01:24.689> i<00:01:24.900> do

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
closer to the more recent 230 t i do

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560 
closer to the more recent 230 t i do
really<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:26.939> metal<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
really like that there is more metal to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.330 
really like that there is more metal to
the<00:01:27.659> finish<00:01:28.020> although<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:28.740> still<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> lot

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the finish although there's still a lot

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
the finish although there's still a lot
