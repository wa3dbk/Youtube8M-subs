00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
make guns illegal and I could still walk

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.300 
make guns illegal and I could still walk
up<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.230> street<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.770> gun<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.160> wrong

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
up the street and get a gun the wrong

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.240 
up the street and get a gun the wrong
time<00:03:50.610> right<00:03:51.270> I<00:03:51.630> think<00:03:52.530> if<00:03:52.590> they<00:03:52.680> put<00:03:52.709> some<00:03:53.130> in

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
time right I think if they put some in

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.220 
time right I think if they put some in
place<00:03:53.489> like<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.060> can<00:03:54.209> have<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.420> gun<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:54.780> you're

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
place like you can have a gun but you're

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.630 
place like you can have a gun but you're
not<00:03:55.320> allowed<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.620> shoot<00:03:55.770> yourself<00:03:56.010> with<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.580> I

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
not allowed to shoot yourself with it I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.670 
not allowed to shoot yourself with it I
think<00:03:56.820> they<00:03:57.510> did<00:03:57.690> something<00:03:58.020> like<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.380> then

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
think they did something like that then

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.470 
think they did something like that then
