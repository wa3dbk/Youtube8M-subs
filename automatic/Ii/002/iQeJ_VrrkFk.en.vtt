00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
disregard this figure but I think it's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.580 
disregard this figure but I think it's
really<00:00:20.150> overlooked<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.390> underrated<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
really overlooked and underrated it's a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
really overlooked and underrated it's a
really<00:00:22.859> solid<00:00:23.070> figure<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.119> want<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.420> show

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
really solid figure and I want to show

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.609 
really solid figure and I want to show
it<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.830> she<00:00:26.340> stands<00:00:27.619> about

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it to you so here it is she stands about

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.040 
it to you so here it is she stands about
six<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.010> quarter<00:00:29.369> inches<00:00:29.670> tall<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
six and a quarter inches tall and I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.200 
six and a quarter inches tall and I
think<00:00:31.679> I'm<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> hundred<00:00:32.369> percent<00:00:32.520> sure<00:00:33.030> but

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
think I'm not a hundred percent sure but

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.930 
think I'm not a hundred percent sure but
I<00:00:33.270> think<00:00:33.870> every<00:00:34.800> single<00:00:35.040> part<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.700> figure

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
I think every single part of this figure

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.299 
I think every single part of this figure
is<00:00:36.300> unique<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.170> figure<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.950> that's<00:00:38.070> one

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
is unique to this figure and that's one

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.130 
is unique to this figure and that's one
of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> things<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.870> not

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
of the things I like about it it's not

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.229 
of the things I like about it it's not
just<00:00:40.530> another<00:00:40.829> remould<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.790> something<00:00:42.120> we've

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
just another remould of something we've

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.750 
just another remould of something we've
seen<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.450> hundred<00:00:42.719> times<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.860> pay<00:00:44.250> naps<00:00:44.489> are

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
seen a hundred times the pay naps are

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.410 
seen a hundred times the pay naps are
decent<00:00:45.270> they're<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.950> especially<00:00:46.950> good<00:00:47.430> I've

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
decent they're not especially good I've

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
decent they're not especially good I've
got<00:00:48.480> some<00:00:48.809> scratches<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.590> there<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.010> we

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
got some scratches going on there but we

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
got some scratches going on there but we
won't<00:00:50.670> count<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.510> we'll<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.750> look<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
won't count that we'll just look at the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.430 
won't count that we'll just look at the
paint<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.789> didn't<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.960> came<00:00:55.170> from<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
paint that didn't that came from the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.770 
paint that didn't that came from the
factory<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.309> red<00:00:56.489> lines<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.390> torn

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
factory so the red lines on the torn

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.290 
factory so the red lines on the torn
shirt<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.219> best

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
shirt are the best

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.630 
shirt are the best
it<00:01:00.629> does<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.989> some<00:01:01.020> washing<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.309> where

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
it does have some washing going on where

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.369 
it does have some washing going on where
the<00:01:02.820> metal<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.539> looks<00:01:03.719> pretty<00:01:03.899> good

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the metal is so that looks pretty good

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320 
the metal is so that looks pretty good
she's<00:01:04.830> got<00:01:05.010> black<00:01:05.250> fingertips<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.150> sure

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
she's got black fingertips I'm not sure

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.660 
she's got black fingertips I'm not sure
why<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.439> that's<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> best<00:01:08.400> either

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
why so that's not really the best either

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.820 
why so that's not really the best either
she<00:01:08.909> does<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.240> some<00:01:09.299> airbrushed<00:01:09.900> shading<00:01:10.680> on

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830

she does have some airbrushed shading on
the<00:01:11.400> brown-pants

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the brown-pants

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
the brown-pants
not<00:01:12.570> too<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.930> shading<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
not too much shading going on on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.740 
not too much shading going on on the
white<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.700> face<00:01:14.970> paint<00:01:15.270> would<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.600> been

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
white the face paint would have been

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.170 
white the face paint would have been
good<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> wasn't<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:16.979> of

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
good if it wasn't for a little bit of

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.350 
good if it wasn't for a little bit of
problems<00:01:18.590> around<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> Hat<00:01:20.009> thingy<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.030> that's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
problems around the Hat thingy so that's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660 
problems around the Hat thingy so that's
not<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> best<00:01:21.930> either<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:23.009> overall<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.610> mean

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
not the best either but overall I mean

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340 
not the best either but overall I mean
it<00:01:23.880> looks<00:01:24.030> fine<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> Shelf<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.049> nothing

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
underneath the vest which i think is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.059 
underneath the vest which i think is
pretty<00:02:08.879> cool<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> softer<00:02:10.349> material<00:02:10.890> so

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
pretty cool this is a softer material so

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.320 
pretty cool this is a softer material so
it<00:02:11.220> won't<00:02:11.520> get<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> way<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
it won't get in the way of the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.640 
it won't get in the way of the
articulation<00:02:12.599> too<00:02:13.170> much

but I guess Hasbro thought or not has

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.369 
but I guess Hasbro thought or not has
draw<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.700> toy<00:02:29.879> business<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.480> yeah

does it say toy biz yeah toy biz might
have<00:02:37.230> thought<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.409> was<00:02:37.650> too<00:02:37.829> risky<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.430> put

it's a good figure I mean it's nothing

special<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:11.189> just<00:03:11.310> one<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:11.700> really

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
special but it's just one that really

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.729 
special but it's just one that really
nobody<00:03:12.209> ever<00:03:12.480> talks<00:03:12.750> about<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.290> wanted<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
nobody ever talks about so I wanted to

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.860 
nobody ever talks about so I wanted to
and<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.790> think<00:03:15.000> if<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.180> don't<00:03:15.299> have<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.659> in<00:03:15.750> your

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
and I think if you don't have it in your

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.990 
and I think if you don't have it in your
fan<00:03:16.079> of<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.319> x-men<00:03:16.680> or<00:03:16.889> Marvel<00:03:17.220> Legends<00:03:17.549> fan<00:03:17.760> I

fan of the x-men or Marvel Legends fan I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.390 
fan of the x-men or Marvel Legends fan I
