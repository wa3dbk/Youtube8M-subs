00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.550 
this point I think this game looks like
it's<00:02:04.970> pretty<00:02:05.270> much<00:02:05.420> out<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.659> reach<00:02:05.930> well<00:02:06.409> it's

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's pretty much out of reach well it's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.559 
it's pretty much out of reach well it's
only<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.799> two<00:02:07.070> possession<00:02:07.310> game<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.179> these<00:02:08.300> guys

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
only a two possession game so these guys

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.140 
only a two possession game so these guys
won't<00:02:08.810> give<00:02:09.140> up<00:02:09.319> suppose<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.190> quick<00:02:10.550> score<00:02:10.910> an
