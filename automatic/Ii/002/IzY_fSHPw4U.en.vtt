00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
it on the ground like if you hop on each

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
it on the ground like if you hop on each
leg<00:00:37.760> figure<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.690> higher

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
on that way you can figure out what

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.440 
on that way you can figure out what
switch<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:44.450> strong<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.230> she's<00:00:46.440> gonna<00:00:46.649> put<00:00:46.920> her

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
switch is strong so she's gonna put her

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
switch is strong so she's gonna put her
left<00:00:48.450> foot<00:00:48.660> down<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.289> she's<00:00:49.649> gonna<00:00:49.860> try<00:00:50.610> and
