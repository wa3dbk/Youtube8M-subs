video so here it is mono color the final
frontier<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:07.140> anyway<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.129> said<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.340> was

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
frontier so anyway like I said I was

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.029 
frontier so anyway like I said I was
using<00:02:08.610> red<00:02:08.910> he<00:02:09.479> was<00:02:09.599> using<00:02:09.780> purple<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.890> just

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
using red he was using purple and I just

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.260 
using red he was using purple and I just
had<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.190> leave<00:02:11.370> too<00:02:11.459> swellow<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.209> i

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
had to leave too swellow just because i

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.559 
had to leave too swellow just because i
like<00:02:12.480> swallow

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
like swallow

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.140 
like swallow
and<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.499> know<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.280> know<00:02:15.400> protect<00:02:15.849> and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and you know I you know protect and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.879 
and you know I you know protect and
stuff<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:17.019> just<00:02:17.049> really<00:02:17.290> good<00:02:17.530> as<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.650> lead

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:17.889 
stuff it's just really good as a lead

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.440 
stuff it's just really good as a lead
and<00:02:18.219> I<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.730> turn<00:02:18.909> on<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.180> well<00:02:19.329> Oh<00:02:19.359> too

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
and I have you turn on this well Oh too

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.910 
and I have you turn on this well Oh too
but<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.900> don't<00:02:19.989> think<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.319> actually<00:02:20.439> I<00:02:20.650> figured

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
but I don't think I actually I figured

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.190 
but I don't think I actually I figured
that<00:02:21.159> ever<00:02:21.400> used<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.909> so<00:02:22.359> I<00:02:22.389> predict<00:02:22.870> his<00:02:22.989> fake

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
that ever used it so I predict his fake

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.449 
that ever used it so I predict his fake
out<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.560> go<00:02:23.650> with<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.799> protect<00:02:24.189> pretty

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
out and go with the protect pretty

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.780 
out and go with the protect pretty
obvious<00:02:24.849> stuff<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.329> I<00:02:25.780> get<00:02:25.930> um<00:02:26.609> poison<00:02:27.609> that<00:02:27.730> I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
obvious stuff and I get um poison that I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.610 
obvious stuff and I get um poison that I
side<00:02:27.969> to<00:02:28.090> go<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.359> a<00:02:28.389> facade<00:02:28.749> and<00:02:29.019> see<00:02:29.319> switches

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
side to go for a facade and see switches

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.119 
side to go for a facade and see switches
into<00:02:29.849> vaporeon<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.170> they<00:02:32.170> porns<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.709> pretty

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
into vaporeon and they porns a pretty

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.009 
into vaporeon and they porns a pretty
bulky<00:02:33.340> wall<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:33.969> I'm<00:02:34.180> guessing<00:02:34.689> if<00:02:34.930> he's

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
bulky wall but I'm guessing if he's

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.149 
bulky wall but I'm guessing if he's
switching<00:02:35.200> into<00:02:35.409> it<00:02:35.620> he's<00:02:35.739> probably<00:02:35.920> gonna

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
switching into it he's probably gonna

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.789 
switching into it he's probably gonna
try<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.459> toxic<00:02:37.030> stall<00:02:37.269> me<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.319> predicted<00:02:38.709> to

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
try to toxic stall me so I predicted to

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.250 
try to toxic stall me so I predicted to
protect<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.459> goes<00:02:39.609> and<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:40.030> go<00:02:40.209> into<00:02:40.389> a<00:02:40.540> lot<00:02:40.989> eos

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
protect and goes and I go into a lot eos

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.619 
protect and goes and I go into a lot eos
and<00:02:41.879> yeah<00:02:42.879> I'm<00:02:42.969> just<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.239> go<00:02:43.299> for<00:02:43.599> the

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
and yeah I'm just going to go for the

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.690 
and yeah I'm just going to go for the
Draco<00:02:43.870> meteor<00:02:44.079> this<00:02:44.409> is<00:02:44.530> my<00:02:44.650> specs<00:02:44.919> latias<00:02:45.310> and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
Draco meteor this is my specs latias and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.899 
Draco meteor this is my specs latias and
he<00:02:46.599> goes<00:02:46.750> into<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.019> muck<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:47.700> muck<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.819> a

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
he goes into a muck and muck is a

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.569 
he goes into a muck and muck is a
special<00:02:49.419> wall<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.590> sorts<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.189> look<00:02:51.370> how<00:02:51.459> much

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
special wall of sorts but look how much

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.220 
special wall of sorts but look how much
damage<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.969> did<00:02:52.000> anyway<00:02:52.510> that's<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:52.900> pretty

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
damage I did anyway that's just pretty

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.740 
damage I did anyway that's just pretty
amazing<00:02:53.769> but<00:02:54.760> just<00:02:54.969> in<00:02:55.030> case<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.239> don't<00:02:55.389> kill<00:02:55.599> it

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
amazing but just in case I don't kill it

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.569 
amazing but just in case I don't kill it
I'm<00:02:56.230> just<00:02:56.409> going<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.709> try<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.919> switch<00:02:57.159> out<00:02:57.310> into

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
I'm just going to try to switch out into

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.259 
I'm just going to try to switch out into
salamence<00:02:58.030> since<00:02:58.329> most<00:02:58.949> mux<00:02:59.949> are<00:03:00.159> physical<00:03:00.639> so

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
salamence since most mux are physical so

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.550 
salamence since most mux are physical so
I<00:03:01.299> go<00:03:01.569> into<00:03:01.719> salamence<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.319> he's<00:03:02.409> just

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
I go into salamence and he's just

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.770 
I go into salamence and he's just
explodes<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.280> right<00:03:03.489> there<00:03:03.699> I'm<00:03:03.879> like<00:03:04.090> oh<00:03:04.359> wow

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
explodes so right there I'm like oh wow

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.830 
explodes so right there I'm like oh wow
but<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.560> wasn't<00:03:06.069> saying<00:03:06.340> by<00:03:06.579> my<00:03:06.790> saved<00:03:07.449> by<00:03:07.659> my

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
but I wasn't saying by my saved by my

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.170 
but I wasn't saying by my saved by my
intimidate<00:03:08.349> and<00:03:08.530> salamence<00:03:09.489> barely<00:03:09.849> survived

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
intimidate and salamence barely survived

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.689 
intimidate and salamence barely survived
which<00:03:10.449> is<00:03:10.569> not<00:03:10.719> bad<00:03:10.930> for<00:03:11.290> me<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.280> he<00:03:12.430> goes<00:03:12.519> back

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
which is not bad for me so he goes back

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.520 
which is not bad for me so he goes back
in<00:03:12.819> ambipom<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.599> know<00:03:13.659> the<00:03:13.959> fake-out<00:03:14.230> kind

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
in ambipom and I know the fake-out kind

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.199
