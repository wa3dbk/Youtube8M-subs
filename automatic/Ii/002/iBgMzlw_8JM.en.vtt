have a break I have flint and steel and
I<00:03:58.910> have<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.060> mask<00:03:59.500> now<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.590> may<00:04:00.680> be<00:04:00.709> wondering<00:04:00.859> a

I have a mask now you may be wondering a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.640 
I have a mask now you may be wondering a
beach<00:04:01.850> tip<00:04:02.120> eponymous<00:04:02.660> why<00:04:03.230> do<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:03.440> have<00:04:03.620> a

beach tip eponymous why do you have a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.120 
beach tip eponymous why do you have a
brick<00:04:04.100> flint<00:04:04.519> and<00:04:04.579> steel<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.180> mask<00:04:06.130> Lacey

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
brick flint and steel on a mask Lacey

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.670 
brick flint and steel on a mask Lacey
let's<00:04:07.430> start<00:04:07.700> off<00:04:07.790> with<00:04:07.819> a<00:04:07.940> brick<00:04:08.530> when<00:04:09.530> we

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
let's start off with a brick when we

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.190 
let's start off with a brick when we
pull<00:04:09.920> in<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.130> fish<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.760> might<00:04:11.600> still<00:04:11.900> be<00:04:12.049> alive

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
pull in the fish it might still be alive

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.770 
pull in the fish it might still be alive
so<00:04:13.069> we<00:04:13.670> got<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.970> give<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.180> little<00:04:14.269> pounding

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
so we got to give it a little pounding

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.330 
so we got to give it a little pounding
with<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:14.930> break<00:04:15.200> in<00:04:15.530> order<00:04:15.829> to<00:04:15.949> knock<00:04:16.160> its

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
with the break in order to knock its

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.699 
with the break in order to knock its
brains<00:04:16.579> out<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:16.820> kill<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:18.109> also<00:04:18.350> helps

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
brains out and kill it this also helps

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.560 
brains out and kill it this also helps
if<00:04:18.859> we<00:04:19.010> like<00:04:19.699> hooks

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
if we like hooks

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.590 
if we like hooks

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
lines such as a pig a donkey a zebra I

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.600 
lines such as a pig a donkey a zebra I
don't<00:04:24.500> know<00:04:24.560> oh<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:25.100> don't<00:04:25.400> know<00:04:25.490> where

you're gonna pull up out of this lake

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.620 
you're gonna pull up out of this lake
and<00:04:27.730> second<00:04:28.730> we<00:04:28.790> have<00:04:28.820> flint<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.180> steel<00:04:29.300> I'll

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
and second we have flint and steel I'll

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.720 
and second we have flint and steel I'll
show<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:29.900> that<00:04:29.930> in<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.170> second<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.730> then

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
show you that in a second and then

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.970 
show you that in a second and then
wither<00:04:31.940> skeleton<00:04:32.420> winter<00:04:33.260> scaled<00:04:33.590> with<00:04:33.950> ur

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
wither skeleton winter scaled with ur

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.320 
wither skeleton winter scaled with ur
skeleton<00:04:34.610> skull<00:04:35.230> you<00:04:36.230> have<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.410> put<00:04:36.590> this<00:04:36.680> on

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
skeleton skull you have to put this on

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330 
skeleton skull you have to put this on
so<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.510> scares<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.960> fish<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:39.440> people<00:04:40.070> do<00:04:40.220> not

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
so it scares the fish and people do not

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.860 
so it scares the fish and people do not
know<00:04:40.400> it's<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:40.970> just<00:04:41.300> in<00:04:41.420> case<00:04:41.450> we're

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
here so now the flint and steel run up

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.750 
here so now the flint and steel run up
to<00:04:52.850> a<00:04:52.880> tree<00:04:53.950> try<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.010> light<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.190> on<00:04:55.340> fire<00:04:55.400> and

fire do not get lit on fire yourself
very<00:05:01.640> important<00:05:02.030> step<00:05:03.580> then<00:05:04.580> let<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.000> burn<00:05:05.210> for

a little bit now this folks is what you

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.990 
a little bit now this folks is what you
call<00:05:08.420> a<00:05:08.480> controlled<00:05:08.990> burn<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:10.610> kind<00:05:10.910> of

oxygen and carbon dioxide into the air

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.370 
oxygen and carbon dioxide into the air
makes<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.760> fish<00:05:17.090> kind<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.480> come<00:05:17.660> alive<00:05:17.990> makes

makes the fish kind of come alive makes

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.890 
makes the fish kind of come alive makes
a<00:05:18.470> little<00:05:18.710> hungry<00:05:18.920> there's<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.790> bonus<00:05:20.570> this

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
a little hungry there's a bonus this

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.870 
a little hungry there's a bonus this
also<00:05:21.080> doesn't<00:05:21.320> clear<00:05:21.620> out<00:05:21.710> some<00:05:21.890> wildlife<00:05:22.520> so

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.610 
also doesn't clear out some wildlife so
some<00:05:23.120> might<00:05:23.330> be<00:05:23.540> coming<00:05:23.810> down<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:24.140> this<00:05:24.230> pond

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
some might be coming down to this pond

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.410 
some might be coming down to this pond
and<00:05:24.920> we<00:05:25.040> could<00:05:25.220> fish<00:05:25.400> for<00:05:25.580> them<00:05:25.670> I<00:05:27.880> just<00:05:28.880> really

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
and we could fish for them I just really

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.150 
and we could fish for them I just really
hope<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.870> guy<00:05:30.020> that<00:05:30.260> owns<00:05:30.380> this<00:05:30.590> land<00:05:30.800> isn't

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160
