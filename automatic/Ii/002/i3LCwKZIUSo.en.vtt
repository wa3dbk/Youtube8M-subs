00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.630 

okay<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.250> got<00:03:10.489> it

okay I got it

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.740 
okay I got it

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.980 

all<00:03:15.750> right<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.830> here<00:03:17.160> we<00:03:17.280> are<00:03:17.540> there<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
all right so here we are there is the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.850 
all right so here we are there is the
charger<00:03:19.590> itself<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.340> right<00:03:20.610> here<00:03:20.819> we<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
charger itself and right here we have a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.370 
charger itself and right here we have a
quick<00:03:22.860> little<00:03:23.100> guide<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.720> show<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:24.990> how<00:03:25.319> to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
quick little guide to show you how to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.990 
quick little guide to show you how to
charge<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:26.100> get<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.340> all<00:03:26.430> set<00:03:26.640> up<00:03:26.670> but

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
charge it and just get it all set up but

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.520 
charge it and just get it all set up but
it's<00:03:27.300> pretty<00:03:27.540> straightforward<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.380> don't

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it's pretty straightforward so you don't

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.840 
it's pretty straightforward so you don't
really<00:03:28.740> need<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.010> look<00:03:29.250> at<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:31.290> let's

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
really need to look at this so let's

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.970 
really need to look at this so let's
take<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.970> top<00:03:33.120> part<00:03:33.390> off<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.380> here<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.770> the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
take the top part off and so here is the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.160 
take the top part off and so here is the
battery<00:03:35.160> pack<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.540> actual<00:03:36.959> battery

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
battery pack this is the actual battery

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.280 
battery pack this is the actual battery
itself<00:03:37.800> right<00:03:38.700> here<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.150> looks<00:03:39.180> very<00:03:39.660> similar

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
itself right here it looks very similar

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.780 
itself right here it looks very similar
to<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:42.680> little<00:03:43.680> battery<00:03:44.310> pack<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.730> you

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
to the little battery pack that you

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.310 
to the little battery pack that you
would<00:03:44.970> put<00:03:45.150> your<00:03:45.239> two<00:03:45.750> with<00:03:45.989> double-a

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
would put your two with double-a

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.620 
would put your two with double-a
batteries<00:03:46.709> into<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.910> fact<00:03:48.150> for<00:03:48.390> us<00:03:48.480> this

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
batteries into just the fact for us this

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.800 
batteries into just the fact for us this
is<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.780> rechargeable<00:03:49.640> version<00:03:50.640> so<00:03:51.600> there's

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
is the rechargeable version so there's

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.720 
is the rechargeable version so there's
that<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:52.440> here<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.860> actual<00:03:53.130> USB

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
that and then here is the actual USB

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.680 
that and then here is the actual USB
cable<00:03:57.650> there<00:03:58.650> we<00:03:58.800> go<00:03:58.980> they<00:03:59.550> Microsoft<00:04:00.300> really

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
cable there we go they Microsoft really

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.160 
cable there we go they Microsoft really
packaged<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.670> kind<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.790> annoyingly<00:04:03.269> really

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
packaged this kind of annoyingly really

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.449 
packaged this kind of annoyingly really
crazy<00:04:05.120> anyway<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:06.180> here<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.170> actual

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
crazy anyway so here is the actual

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.890 
crazy anyway so here is the actual
charging<00:04:08.459> USB<00:04:08.970> cable<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:09.690> got<00:04:09.870> a

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
charging USB cable so it's got a

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.830 
charging USB cable so it's got a
standard<00:04:10.470> USB<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:11.070> on<00:04:11.700> one<00:04:11.940> end<00:04:12.150> right<00:04:12.300> here<00:04:12.690> I

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
standard USB on on one end right here I

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.699 
standard USB on on one end right here I
believe<00:04:13.590> it's<00:04:13.739> USB<00:04:13.980> 2.0<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:16.200> then<00:04:16.350> we<00:04:16.500> have

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
believe it's USB 2.0 and then we have

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.469 
believe it's USB 2.0 and then we have
the<00:04:16.950> actual<00:04:17.370> connector<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.359> would

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
the actual connector that you would

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.050 
the actual connector that you would
charge<00:04:18.780> or<00:04:19.169> plug<00:04:19.709> into<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.400> controller

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
charge or plug into the controller

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.740 
charge or plug into the controller
itself<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:24.090> then<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.330> got<00:04:24.479> this<00:04:24.600> little

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
itself and then you got this little

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.450 
itself and then you got this little
indicator<00:04:25.169> light<00:04:25.560> here<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.979> let<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.340> know

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
indicator light here to let you know

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.230 
indicator light here to let you know
what<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.600> status<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.350> of<00:04:28.620> your<00:04:29.520> controllers

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
what the status is of your controllers

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.950 
what the status is of your controllers
battery<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.440> assumed<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:32.190> would<00:04:32.340> be<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:33.240> red

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
battery so I assumed it would be a red

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.990 
battery so I assumed it would be a red
or<00:04:34.290> orange<00:04:34.590> color<00:04:35.100> if<00:04:35.340> it's<00:04:35.490> charging<00:04:35.910> and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
or orange color if it's charging and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.510 
or orange color if it's charging and
then<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.180> course<00:04:36.210> green<00:04:36.660> when<00:04:36.960> it's<00:04:37.080> done<00:04:37.520> but

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
then of course green when it's done but

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.040 
then of course green when it's done but
I'm<00:04:38.700> not<00:04:38.820> too<00:04:39.000> sure<00:04:39.030> on<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.540> I'll<00:04:39.750> have<00:04:40.020> to

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
I'm not too sure on that I'll have to

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.409 
I'm not too sure on that I'll have to
post<00:04:40.350> in<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.500> description<00:04:40.740> once<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.280> know<00:04:41.419> but

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
post in the description once I know but

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.870 
post in the description once I know but
anyway<00:04:42.510> here<00:04:43.290> is<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.590> controller<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.669> you

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
anyway here is the controller that you

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.969 
anyway here is the controller that you
could<00:04:45.030> put<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:45.479> like<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.530> was<00:04:46.620> saying

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
could put it in like I was saying

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.730 
could put it in like I was saying
earlier<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.080> standard<00:04:49.500> little

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
earlier this is the standard little

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.190 
earlier this is the standard little
battery<00:04:50.040> pack<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.610> would<00:04:50.729> get<00:04:51.020> with<00:04:52.020> the

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
battery pack that you would get with the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.480 
battery pack that you would get with the
controller<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.710> have<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.950> put<00:04:53.100> double-a

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
controller you have to put double-a

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.330 
controller you have to put double-a
batteries<00:04:53.880> in<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.210> which<00:04:54.479> I<00:04:55.010> really<00:04:56.010> don't<00:04:56.160> see

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
batteries in to which I really don't see

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.940 
batteries in to which I really don't see
why<00:04:56.669> Microsoft<00:04:57.300> did<00:04:57.870> this<00:04:58.080> particularly

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
why Microsoft did this particularly

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.860 
why Microsoft did this particularly
because<00:04:59.460> it's<00:04:59.789> kind<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.090> annoying<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.510> have<00:05:00.660> to

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
because it's kind of annoying to have to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.570 
because it's kind of annoying to have to
keep<00:05:01.050> putting<00:05:01.289> double-a<00:05:01.740> batteries<00:05:02.130> into<00:05:02.340> the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
keep putting double-a batteries into the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.260 
keep putting double-a batteries into the
controller<00:05:03.150> every<00:05:03.479> time<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.780> runs<00:05:03.900> out<00:05:05.240> so<00:05:06.240> I

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
controller every time it runs out so I

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.969 
controller every time it runs out so I
kind<00:05:06.600> of<00:05:06.660> wish<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:06.870> Microsoft<00:05:07.470> would<00:05:07.710> have

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
kind of wish that Microsoft would have

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.219 
kind of wish that Microsoft would have
packaged<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.580> with<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.240> controller<00:05:09.630> but<00:05:09.990> I

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
packaged this with the controller but I

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.469 
packaged this with the controller but I
guess<00:05:10.740> it's<00:05:10.919> not<00:05:11.010> too<00:05:11.070> big<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.550> deal<00:05:11.700> but

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
guess it's not too big of a deal but

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.659 
guess it's not too big of a deal but
anyway<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:13.680> way<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:14.039> put<00:05:14.220> it<00:05:14.310> on<00:05:14.430> it

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
anyway the way you just put it on it

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.550 
anyway the way you just put it on it
works<00:05:14.880> just<00:05:15.539> like<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.960> would<00:05:16.110> put<00:05:16.350> this

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
works just like you would put this

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.620 
works just like you would put this
little<00:05:16.860> battery<00:05:17.190> pack<00:05:17.220> on<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.880> just<00:05:18.030> put<00:05:18.270> the

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
little battery pack on and just put the

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.980 
little battery pack on and just put the
bottom<00:05:19.020> first<00:05:19.590> like<00:05:20.280> so<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:21.630> there<00:05:21.780> you<00:05:21.870> go

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
bottom first like so and there you go

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.640 
bottom first like so and there you go
you<00:05:22.050> clip<00:05:22.349> it<00:05:22.440> into<00:05:22.590> place<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:23.070> your

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
you clip it into place and your

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.999 
you clip it into place and your
good<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.100> go<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.780> then<00:05:25.960> you<00:05:26.080> just<00:05:26.290> use<00:05:26.710> this

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
good to go and then you just use this

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.870 
good to go and then you just use this
end<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:28.000> plug<00:05:28.240> directly<00:05:28.479> over<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.880> headset

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
end to plug directly over the headset

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.909 
end to plug directly over the headset
parts<00:05:32.820> if<00:05:33.820> it<00:05:34.120> will<00:05:34.410> actually<00:05:35.410> doesn't<00:05:35.830> even

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
parts if it will actually doesn't even

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.860 
parts if it will actually doesn't even
want<00:05:36.100> to<00:05:36.160> fit<00:05:36.370> okay<00:05:37.090> I'll<00:05:37.180> have<00:05:37.389> to<00:05:37.509> figure<00:05:37.690> out

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
want to fit okay I'll have to figure out

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.330 
want to fit okay I'll have to figure out
where<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.229> connector<00:05:38.590> actually<00:05:38.949> goes<00:05:39.130> I

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
where the connector actually goes I

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.100 
where the connector actually goes I
assume<00:05:39.699> it<00:05:39.880> goes<00:05:39.910> there<00:05:40.270> but<00:05:40.419> it<00:05:40.539> doesn't<00:05:40.870> look

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
assume it goes there but it doesn't look

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.490 
assume it goes there but it doesn't look
like<00:05:41.139> it<00:05:41.650> really<00:05:42.009> wants<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.840> but<00:05:43.840> anyway<00:05:44.169> oh

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
like it really wants to but anyway oh

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.230 
like it really wants to but anyway oh
actually<00:05:45.100> there<00:05:45.460> you<00:05:45.610> go<00:05:45.699> in<00:05:45.759> there<00:05:45.880> mine<00:05:46.030> it

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
actually there you go in there mine it

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.990 
actually there you go in there mine it
goes<00:05:46.360> on<00:05:46.509> the<00:05:46.600> back<00:05:47.220> there<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.250> go<00:05:48.430> now<00:05:48.759> that

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
goes on the back there you go now that

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.939 
goes on the back there you go now that
is<00:05:49.180> where<00:05:49.330> you<00:05:49.509> plug<00:05:49.690> it<00:05:49.840> in<00:05:49.960> I<00:05:50.169> got<00:05:50.680> kind<00:05:50.919> of

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
is where you plug it in I got kind of

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.350 
is where you plug it in I got kind of
confused<00:05:51.100> there<00:05:51.580> for<00:05:51.910> a<00:05:51.940> moment

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
confused there for a moment

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.110 
confused there for a moment
so<00:05:52.990> buddy<00:05:53.139> that<00:05:53.530> is<00:05:53.740> where<00:05:53.949> it<00:05:54.250> connects<00:05:54.789> to

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
so buddy that is where it connects to

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.500 
so buddy that is where it connects to
the<00:05:55.900> controller<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:57.490> then<00:05:57.610> you<00:05:57.850> can<00:05:58.090> plug

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
the controller and then you can plug

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.150 
the controller and then you can plug
this<00:05:58.690> into<00:05:58.960> your<00:05:59.050> Xbox<00:05:59.440> 360

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
this into your Xbox 360

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.879 
this into your Xbox 360
and<00:06:00.820> you're<00:06:01.539> off<00:06:01.690> and<00:06:01.720> running<00:06:01.930> so<00:06:02.380> basically

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
and you're off and running so basically

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.000 
and you're off and running so basically
that<00:06:03.160> is<00:06:03.220> it<00:06:03.400> of<00:06:03.820> the<00:06:04.570> Xbox<00:06:05.050> 360<00:06:05.710> playing

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
that is it of the Xbox 360 playing
