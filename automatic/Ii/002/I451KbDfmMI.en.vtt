weathering but you know we don't have a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.899 
weathering but you know we don't have a
big<00:01:01.800> magnet<00:01:02.159> here<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.519> it's<00:01:02.610> either<00:01:02.699> produce

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
big magnet here so it's either produce

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.790 
big magnet here so it's either produce
the<00:01:03.150> most<00:01:03.330> sound<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> stiffest

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.969 

let's<00:01:25.659> take<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.869> look<00:01:26.020> at<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.229> m-step<00:01:26.470> speaker

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.399 

so<00:01:31.549> here<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:32.390> know<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.840> biggest<00:01:33.020> difference

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
so here you know the biggest difference

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.179 
so here you know the biggest difference
is<00:01:33.590> how<00:01:33.920> large<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.670> magnet<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:36.289> case<00:01:36.740> of

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
is how large the magnet is the case of

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.779 
is how large the magnet is the case of
the<00:01:37.369> baskets<00:01:38.180> made<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.390> stamp<00:01:38.659> steel<00:01:38.960> and

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
the baskets made of stamp steel and

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.069 
the baskets made of stamp steel and
you'll<00:01:40.789> notice<00:01:41.030> now<00:01:41.210> we<00:01:41.270> have<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.450> tweeter<00:01:41.719> so

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
you'll notice now we have a tweeter so

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.389 
you'll notice now we have a tweeter so
one<00:01:42.679> thing<00:01:42.890> you're<00:01:42.979> gonna<00:01:43.070> get<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.250> lot<00:01:43.369> more

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
one thing you're gonna get a lot more

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.560 
one thing you're gonna get a lot more
bass<00:01:43.640> he'll<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.909> speaker<00:01:44.240> because<00:01:44.360> have<00:01:44.539> a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
bass he'll the speaker because have a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.779 
bass he'll the speaker because have a
much<00:01:44.750> better<00:01:45.140> wolfram<00:01:45.890> material<00:01:46.310> you

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
much better wolfram material you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.429 
much better wolfram material you
actually<00:01:47.119> have<00:01:47.329> a<00:01:47.360> tweeter<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:48.020> time<00:01:48.200> around

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
actually have a tweeter this time around

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.809 
actually have a tweeter this time around
so<00:01:48.890> now<00:01:49.130> you're<00:01:49.220> going<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.399> hear<00:01:49.520> those<00:01:49.610> highs

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
so now you're going to hear those highs

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.669 
so now you're going to hear those highs
the<00:01:50.390> nice<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:50.659> let<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.840> MTX<00:01:51.140> speakers<00:01:51.439> you<00:01:51.590> can

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
the nice to let the MTX speakers you can

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.499 
the nice to let the MTX speakers you can
actually<00:01:51.799> pivot<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:52.399> because<00:01:53.270> high

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
actually pivot this because high

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.990 
actually pivot this because high
frequency<00:01:54.490> sounds<00:01:55.490> are<00:01:55.610> actually<00:01:55.729> really

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
frequency sounds are actually really

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.020 
frequency sounds are actually really
directional<00:01:56.569> so<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:58.310> will<00:01:58.490> help<00:01:58.700> direct<00:01:58.819> a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
directional so this will help direct a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.399 
directional so this will help direct a
more<00:01:59.179> towards<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.450> listeners<00:01:59.750> ears<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.229> their

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
more towards the listeners ears to their

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.600 
more towards the listeners ears to their
need<00:02:00.590> because<00:02:00.829> typically<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.250> speaker's

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
need because typically a speaker's

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.120 
need because typically a speaker's
located<00:02:02.060> low<00:02:02.210> okay<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:03.110> for<00:02:03.470> our<00:02:03.799> last<00:02:03.950> example

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
located low okay so for our last example

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.460 
located low okay so for our last example
we<00:02:04.520> have<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.789> MT<00:02:05.090> X<00:02:05.240> component<00:02:05.840> speakers<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
we have the MT X component speakers and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.559 
we have the MT X component speakers and
I'm<00:02:06.890> gonna<00:02:07.099> explain<00:02:07.490> what's<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.030> box<00:02:08.269> and

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
I'm gonna explain what's in the box and

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.120 
I'm gonna explain what's in the box and
I'll<00:02:08.899> go<00:02:09.110> over<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.380> why<00:02:09.530> there's<00:02:09.890> such<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.039> big

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
I'll go over and why there's such a big

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.870 
I'll go over and why there's such a big
deal<00:02:10.489> about<00:02:10.610> these<00:02:10.880> things<00:02:12.099> so<00:02:13.099> every

here

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.309 

let's<00:02:43.190> see<00:02:43.550> here

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.860 

they're<00:02:48.769> very<00:02:48.950> similar<00:02:49.190> same<00:02:49.730> magnets<00:02:50.300> same

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
they're very similar same magnets same

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.470 
they're very similar same magnets same
baskets<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:52.250> only<00:02:52.430> difference<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.450> have

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
baskets the only difference is you have

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.740 
baskets the only difference is you have
your<00:02:53.750> cone<00:02:53.959> down<00:02:54.319> here<00:02:54.680> with<00:02:54.860> your<00:02:54.950> woofer<00:02:55.280> and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
your cone down here with your woofer and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.449 
your cone down here with your woofer and
then<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:58.370> have<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.970> separate<00:02:59.659> tweeter<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:01.340> you

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
then you have a separate tweeter so you

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.559 
then you have a separate tweeter so you
put<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.670> speaker<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.090> can<00:03:02.120> put<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:02.330> tweeter

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
put the speaker you can put this tweeter

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.860 
put the speaker you can put this tweeter
wherever<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.049> want<00:03:03.849> so<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:05.239> can<00:03:05.629> put<00:03:05.750> this

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
wherever you want so you can put this

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.410 
wherever you want so you can put this
great<00:03:06.170> we<00:03:07.069> usually<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.489> put<00:03:07.670> these<00:03:07.760> high<00:03:08.209> up<00:03:08.330> on

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
great we usually we put these high up on

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.839 
great we usually we put these high up on
the<00:03:08.510> door<00:03:08.720> or<00:03:09.019> on<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.530> e<00:03:09.560> pillar<00:03:09.950> bouncing<00:03:10.760> off

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
the door or on the e pillar bouncing off

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.789 
the door or on the e pillar bouncing off
the<00:03:10.970> windshield<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.569> way<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.810> give<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
the windshield that way you give the

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.640 
the windshield that way you give the
imaging<00:03:13.670> sensation<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.290> singers

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
imaging sensation that the singers

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.300 
imaging sensation that the singers
singing<00:03:16.069> in<00:03:16.340> front<00:03:16.519> of<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.730> not<00:03:17.060> fired<00:03:17.930> me<00:03:18.310> and

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
singing in front of you not fired me and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.069 
singing in front of you not fired me and
then<00:03:19.670> with<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.819> crossover<00:03:20.180> here<00:03:20.480> all<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.870> does

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
then with a crossover here all this does

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.080 
then with a crossover here all this does
is<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.500> separates<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.069> highs<00:03:22.310> from<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.549> Losos

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
is it separates the highs from the Losos

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.770 
is it separates the highs from the Losos
in<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.360> lows<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.900> mids<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.440> your<00:03:25.720> it's<00:03:26.720> your

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
in the lows and mids to your it's your

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.750 
in the lows and mids to your it's your
woofer<00:03:27.260> over<00:03:27.500> here<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.129> your<00:03:28.370> highs<00:03:28.489> go<00:03:28.700> to

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
woofer over here and your highs go to

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.000 
woofer over here and your highs go to
here<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.930> don't<00:03:30.019> want<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.410> really<00:03:30.620> play<00:03:30.799> low

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
here you don't want to really play low

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.289 
here you don't want to really play low
lows<00:03:31.310> out<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.849> here<00:03:32.000> that's<00:03:32.150> what<00:03:32.209> a

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
this or like this where it can be

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.029 
this or like this where it can be
mounted<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.930> your<00:04:48.020> door<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:48.530> it's<00:04:48.860> gonna<00:04:48.949> be

mounted in your door and it's gonna be

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.379 
mounted in your door and it's gonna be
mounted<00:04:49.129> down<00:04:49.370> low<00:04:49.550> because<00:04:49.759> it<00:04:49.970> has<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.180> clear

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
mounted down low because it has to clear

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.180 
mounted down low because it has to clear
all<00:04:50.479> the<00:04:50.569> windows<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.110> everything<00:04:51.500> where

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
all the windows and everything where

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.760 
all the windows and everything where
it's<00:04:52.310> mainly<00:04:52.789> firing<00:04:53.210> at<00:04:53.300> your<00:04:53.479> knee<00:04:53.770> this

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
it's mainly firing at your knee this

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.499 
it's mainly firing at your knee this
sounds<00:04:55.039> a<00:04:55.099> lot<00:04:55.220> more<00:04:55.789> natural

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
sounds a lot more natural

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.809 
sounds a lot more natural
much<00:04:57.020> better<00:04:57.199> for<00:04:57.319> imaging<00:04:57.770> but<00:04:58.430> it's<00:04:58.639> more

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
much better for imaging but it's more

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.909 
much better for imaging but it's more
expensive<00:04:58.909> to<00:04:59.270> install<00:04:59.720> and<00:05:00.650> some<00:05:00.830> more

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
expensive to install and some more

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.249 
expensive to install and some more
expensive<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.370> buy<00:05:01.659> so<00:05:02.659> this<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:03.080> where<00:05:03.199> you

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
expensive to buy so this is where you

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:04.600 
expensive to buy so this is where you
have<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.470> figure<00:05:03.650> out<00:05:03.800> your<00:05:04.130> budget<00:05:04.490> and

have to figure out your budget and

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.110 
have to figure out your budget and
everything<00:05:04.819> what's<00:05:05.599> it<00:05:05.750> worth<00:05:05.840> to
