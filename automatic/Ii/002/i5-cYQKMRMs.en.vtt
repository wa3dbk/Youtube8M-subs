with<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.049> stew<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.860> obviously<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.430> want<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
with the stew and obviously you want to

make<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.030> big<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.600> thick<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.140> they'll<00:01:16.320> hold

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
make that big and thick so they'll hold

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
make that big and thick so they'll hold
up<00:01:16.860> under<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.790> cooking<00:01:18.060> time<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.450> still

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
up under all that cooking time and still

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.330 
up under all that cooking time and still
be<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.229> piece<00:01:19.500> by<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> time<00:01:19.979> somebody

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
be in one piece by the time somebody

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.380 
be in one piece by the time somebody
gets<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> eat<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> other<00:01:21.960> hand

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
gets to eat it on the other hand

gets to eat it on the other hand
75%<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.630> guesstimating<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.860> usage<00:01:26.430> of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
75% I'm guesstimating the usage of

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.670 
75% I'm guesstimating the usage of
mirepoix<00:01:27.470> usually<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.880> made<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.680> for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
mirepoix usually is made in use for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.280 
mirepoix usually is made in use for
adding<00:01:32.070> flavor<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> aromas<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.810> come

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
adding flavor and the aromas that come

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
adding flavor and the aromas that come
from<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.650> three<00:01:34.920> vegetables<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.790> whatever

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
from these three vegetables to whatever

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.310 
from these three vegetables to whatever
it<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.299> you're<00:01:36.540> making<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.110> they

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it is that you're making and then they

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.940 
it is that you're making and then they
get<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.280> mirepoix<00:01:38.579> gets<00:01:39.000> discarded<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.710> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
get the mirepoix gets discarded and it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.300 
get the mirepoix gets discarded and it's
not<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.090> many<00:01:42.210> cases<00:01:42.560> how<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.799> cut<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
not use so in many cases how it's cut is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.300 
not use so in many cases how it's cut is
not<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.700> important<00:01:45.270> except<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> amount

the<00:04:36.040> carrot<00:04:36.400> wanted<00:04:37.270> in<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.450> carrot<00:04:37.690> rather

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
the carrot wanted in the carrot rather

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.380 
the carrot wanted in the carrot rather
was<00:04:38.110> small<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:38.710> tapered<00:04:39.250> so<00:04:39.880> I'm<00:04:39.970> gonna<00:04:40.150> want

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
was small and tapered so I'm gonna want

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.350 
was small and tapered so I'm gonna want
to<00:04:40.480> approach<00:04:40.960> how<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.910> selectively<00:04:42.910> cut<00:04:43.240> it

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
to approach how I selectively cut it

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.660 
to approach how I selectively cut it
prior<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:43.990> cutting<00:04:44.170> it<00:04:44.410> across<00:04:44.680> differently

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
prior to cutting it across differently

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.040 
prior to cutting it across differently
than<00:04:45.820> in<00:04:45.940> make<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.270> fatter<00:04:46.540> end<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.960> the

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
than in make the fatter end of the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.020 
than in make the fatter end of the
carrot<00:04:47.380> but<00:04:48.070> every<00:04:48.310> single<00:04:48.490> carrot<00:04:48.940> is

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
carrot but every single carrot is

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.360 
carrot but every single carrot is
different<00:04:49.450> every<00:04:50.050> time<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.440> cut<00:04:50.920> every

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
different every time you cut every

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.010 
different every time you cut every
single<00:04:51.400> carrot<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.420> have<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.660> make<00:04:52.810> that

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
single carrot you have to make that

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.660 
single carrot you have to make that
determination<00:04:53.200> if<00:04:53.860> you're<00:04:54.070> looking<00:04:54.400> for<00:04:54.610> a

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
determination if you're looking for a

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.920 
determination if you're looking for a
specific<00:04:54.910> size<00:04:55.570> okay<00:04:57.750> now<00:04:58.750> I've<00:04:58.900> got

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
specific size okay now I've got

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.640 
specific size okay now I've got
something<00:04:59.350> that's<00:04:59.680> close<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.610> same<00:05:00.820> size

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
something that's close to the same size

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.520 
something that's close to the same size
as<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.890> celery<00:05:03.280> there<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:04.230> let's<00:05:05.230> just<00:05:05.410> do

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
as the celery there so let's just do

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.050 
as the celery there so let's just do
that<00:05:05.560> carrot<00:05:06.010> one<00:05:06.190> more<00:05:06.370> time<00:05:06.670> so<00:05:06.910> you'll

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
that carrot one more time so you'll

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.750 
that carrot one more time so you'll
understand<00:05:07.450> what<00:05:07.540> I<00:05:07.570> mean<00:05:07.720> again<00:05:08.020> see<00:05:08.760> see

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
understand what I mean again see see

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.100 
understand what I mean again see see
this<00:05:09.910> is<00:05:10.060> a<00:05:10.090> lot<00:05:10.270> smaller<00:05:10.540> than<00:05:10.750> this<00:05:10.840> since

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
this is a lot smaller than this since

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.630 
this is a lot smaller than this since
we've<00:05:11.320> cut<00:05:11.530> this<00:05:11.650> in<00:05:11.830> half<00:05:11.860> we'll<00:05:12.250> cut<00:05:12.460> this

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
we've cut this in half we'll cut this

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.640 
we've cut this in half we'll cut this
half<00:05:12.930> slightly<00:05:13.930> differently<00:05:14.290> it<00:05:14.380> might<00:05:14.500> be

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
half slightly differently it might be

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.040 
half slightly differently it might be
able<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.890> get<00:05:15.040> a<00:05:15.280> second<00:05:16.060> slice<00:05:16.390> out<00:05:16.690> of<00:05:16.900> that

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
able to get a second slice out of that

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.730 
able to get a second slice out of that
top<00:05:17.350> half<00:05:17.650> see<00:05:18.430> one<00:05:18.730> two<00:05:19.570> when<00:05:20.230> I<00:05:20.320> get<00:05:20.530> down

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
top half see one two when I get down

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.550 
top half see one two when I get down
here<00:05:21.100> then<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:21.910> cut<00:05:22.180> this<00:05:22.420> one<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.690> half<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:23.260> only

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
here then I cut this one in half I only

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.230 
here then I cut this one in half I only
get<00:05:23.770> one<00:05:23.800> slice<00:05:24.310> down<00:05:24.670> the<00:05:24.730> middle<00:05:25.030> because

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
get one slice down the middle because

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.480 
get one slice down the middle because
this<00:05:25.540> isn't<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.870> carrot<00:05:26.140> so<00:05:26.290> much<00:05:26.440> smaller<00:05:26.740> now

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
this isn't a carrot so much smaller now

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.610 
this isn't a carrot so much smaller now
these<00:05:27.880> will<00:05:28.120> both<00:05:28.300> be<00:05:28.480> the<00:05:28.630> same<00:05:28.870> size<00:05:29.200> when

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
these will both be the same size when

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.130 
these will both be the same size when
I'm<00:05:29.740> done<00:05:29.920> this<00:05:30.100> is<00:05:30.390> important<00:05:31.390> only<00:05:31.540> relative

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
I'm done this is important only relative

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.290 
I'm done this is important only relative
to<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.500> visual<00:05:32.920> aspect<00:05:33.430> or<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.790> length<00:05:34.090> of

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
to the visual aspect or the length of

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.880 
to the visual aspect or the length of
time<00:05:34.630> that<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:35.050> mirepoix<00:05:35.230> is<00:05:35.440> going<00:05:35.680> to<00:05:35.770> be

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
time that the mirepoix is going to be

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:43.770 
time that the mirepoix is going to be
cooked

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.750 

so

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
so

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.780 
so
carrots<00:05:46.450> celery<00:05:46.540> onions<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.790> general

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
carrots celery onions the general

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.420 
carrots celery onions the general
proportion<00:05:49.660> of<00:05:49.750> these<00:05:49.930> two<00:05:50.320> are<00:05:50.710> not<00:05:51.070> always

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
proportion of these two are not always

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.590 
proportion of these two are not always
equal<00:05:52.980> usually<00:05:53.980> the<00:05:54.610> carrot<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:55.210> the<00:05:55.330> onion

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
equal usually the carrot and the onion

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.540 
equal usually the carrot and the onion
are<00:05:55.720> equal<00:05:56.200> in<00:05:56.530> terms<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.130> amount<00:05:57.400> let's

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
are equal in terms of the amount let's

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.790 
are equal in terms of the amount let's
say<00:05:57.670> you<00:05:57.760> have<00:05:57.970> one<00:05:58.210> cup<00:05:58.420> of<00:05:58.540> onions<00:05:58.900> 1<00:05:59.380> cup<00:05:59.410> of

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
say you have one cup of onions 1 cup of

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.820 
say you have one cup of onions 1 cup of
carrot<00:06:00.190> you<00:06:01.030> would<00:06:01.180> normally<00:06:01.570> have<00:06:01.750> only<00:06:01.990> 1/2

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
carrot you would normally have only 1/2

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.300 
carrot you would normally have only 1/2
to<00:06:03.130> 2/3<00:06:03.670> of<00:06:03.880> a<00:06:04.000> cup<00:06:04.030> excuse<00:06:04.780> me<00:06:04.990> of<00:06:05.170> celery<00:06:06.010> as

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
to 2/3 of a cup excuse me of celery as

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.120 
to 2/3 of a cup excuse me of celery as
part<00:06:07.000> of<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.210> basic<00:06:07.480> mirepoix<00:06:08.130> combination

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
part of the basic mirepoix combination

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.980 
part of the basic mirepoix combination
so<00:06:09.820> there's<00:06:09.970> always<00:06:10.120> a<00:06:10.240> little<00:06:10.510> bit<00:06:10.720> less

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
so there's always a little bit less

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.110 
so there's always a little bit less
celery<00:06:11.470> in<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:11.860> rear<00:06:12.010> plot<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.730> so<00:06:12.880> there<00:06:13.030> you

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
celery in the rear plot and so there you

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.490 
celery in the rear plot and so there you
go<00:06:13.270> so<00:06:13.480> if<00:06:13.570> you<00:06:13.630> have<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:13.810> recipe<00:06:13.990> for<00:06:14.200> mirepoix

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
go so if you have a recipe for mirepoix

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.370 
go so if you have a recipe for mirepoix
this<00:06:15.070> is<00:06:15.220> basically<00:06:15.490> what<00:06:15.670> you<00:06:15.790> need<00:06:16.230> you<00:06:17.230> can

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
this is basically what you need you can

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.340 
this is basically what you need you can
mix<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:17.710> together<00:06:20.220> in<00:06:21.220> there<00:06:22.140> just<00:06:23.140> a<00:06:23.200> nice

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
mix it together in there just a nice

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.120 
mix it together in there just a nice
little<00:06:23.530> medium-sized<00:06:24.160> dice<00:06:24.520> rear<00:06:24.880> part
