00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.059
 new call of duty ghost video in which 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.889
 the monster in the third dlc of the game 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.900
 we are talking about new inversion 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.900
 downloadable content available from 3 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.880
 June on xbox 360 and xbox one and how to 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.519
 will usually come out for sony and pc far consoles 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.250
 about a month the weight is about one gig 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.589
 and 500 megabytes while the price of 10 e 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.090
 14 euros and 90 but I remind everyone that it is 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.580
 free for those who have purchased 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.260
 the season pass the contents introduced 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.910
 with belgium they are not four new 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.070
 multiplayer maps and the third chapter 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.170
 of the new saga of extinction or 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.000
 awakening is very strange that 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.470
 this time but also the introduction of 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.630
 a new weapon as it was for the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.550
 maverick is there for in the precedents of al 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.230
 yes let's start immediately with a brief analysis 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.090
 of the four maps I tried in 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.290
 a private session to show them at 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.600
 better all the details 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.700
 the first map departed set in 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.680
 mexico in a country town remembers 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.290
 the dia of the instrument a feast of the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.119
 deceased typical of Mexican culture is 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.869
 structured in three lanes an average 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.460
 size 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.320
 what characterizes it and the presence of 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.299
 a large skeleton, a caricature 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.979
 representation of death what 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.810
 really distinguishes thirty 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.549
 of the other maps the reward that 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.740
 we could get through the directives 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.630
 it will be possible to impersonate the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.999
 mariachis of death a fearsome 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.770
 skeleton with two guns eliminating two 

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.780
 enemies we can get as many 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 in fact other two mariachis allies 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.079
 will appear from nowhere to help us 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.880
 eliminate opponents 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.679
 impersonating this fearsome skeleton 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.149
 we will be very fast we will have a view 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.890
 particular that will allow us to 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.140
 identify enemies even through the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.819
 walls the second multiplayer map e 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.409
 para or set in a site 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.090
 archaeological site of ancient Egypt both 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.469
 multi-level stars and from an average 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.479
 greatness is one of the most fascinating 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.429
 of the four introduced because in it 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.439
 we will be able to find isoardian hieroglyphics that 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.119
 walls and sarcophagi with inside the 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.579
 mummies over a view of a pyramid 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.289
 distance the specialty of the maps la 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.209
 blessing of anubis a reward 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.009
 obtainable through the directives that the 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.109
 will allow you to play with everyone 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.189
 for bad at the same time you will be 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.499
 really invincible 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.090
 the third multiplayer and mutile map is 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.770
 set in a port of the sea of ​​the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.060
 Caribbean in a place that serves as a den 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.980
 secret of pirates 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.810
 besides being prisons buildings 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.610
 commercial is a ship from which it is 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.950
 possible to have a total view of the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.270
 map by completing the directives will be 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.520
 possible to get the equipment 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.230
 ghost of ghosts will appear 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.599
 in fact at your side to give it 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.819
 alternatively you can get support 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.620
 the barrage of cannons will appear in 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.019
 remotely a vessel that will bomb i 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.940
 enemies with cannon balls the fourth ed 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.769
 last multiplayer map and pave la 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.360
 repetition of the same map 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.790
 present in call of duty modern warfare 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.440
 2 who played the latter a lot 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.420
 will remember perfectly in points 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.590
 strategic and elevated structures e 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.569
 present in the area 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.250
 complete the directives will be possible 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.010
 eliminate enemies from above thanks to the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.840
 bayda y 8 you can hit them with 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.849
 several switchable weapons at the moment 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.590
 we have finally come to talk about the 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.290
 new episode of extinction mode 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.000
 we are talking about awakening this 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.739
 new map set in the underground 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.540
 specifically in the pyramid that 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.900
 we saw in the final movie of may 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.030
 day 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.680
 the goal will be to penetrate into the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.360
 the allies happen to recover a 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.610
 important object but I prefer not 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.230
 say more to avoid probable spoilers 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.850
 the setting is very different from 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.410
 those seen previously indeed yes 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.579
 note clearly that we are in a 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.500
 alien territory 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.690
 there are many new features including three new ones 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.640
 types of aliens the gargoyles the bombers 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.109
 and the mammoth beyond the possibility of 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.480
 jump much higher than usual 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.890
 feature due perhaps a different gravity 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.970
 in the area where we are 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.069
 a new one is also introduced 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.450
 weapon upgrade called arc 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.100
 which will allow you to take down the enemies 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.989
 more easily 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.400
 finally we point out the presence of five 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.500
 new relics that will put a strain on 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.359
 test your survival and new ones 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.430
 Arsenal upgrades obtainable 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.170
 as always by spending your teeth one 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.970
 big flaw though is the lack of one 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.530
 battle with a boss since everyone there 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.060
 we would have expected a car even more 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.040
 great of the crac breeder 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.930
 summing up we can say that the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.760
 four new multiplayer maps are 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.680
 really special and well cared for 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.720
 like the one we extinction despite 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.250
 this is the final judgment greatly influenced 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.470
 from the failure to introduce a new one 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.180
 weapon and above all a final boss who 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.220
 of a true awakening spirit 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.109
 as always if you wish to see gods 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.700
 gameplay of els invasion but also 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.680
 in the last games released as a watchdog 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.269

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.959
