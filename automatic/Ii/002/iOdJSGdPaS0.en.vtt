cover up I don't know what to use it
enough<00:02:53.050> for<00:02:53.230> should<00:02:53.410> shave<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:54.010> off<00:02:54.130> or<00:02:54.550> send

it<00:02:55.090> down<00:02:55.270> I'm<00:02:56.050> kind<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.350> lost<00:02:56.560> at<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.830> moment

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
it down I'm kind of lost at the moment

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.500 
it down I'm kind of lost at the moment
so<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.340> think<00:02:57.460> what<00:02:57.760> I'm<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.360> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
so I think what I'm going to do is the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.810 
so I think what I'm going to do is the
easiest<00:02:58.690> thing<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.930> do<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.440> buy<00:02:59.710> a<00:03:00.070> flat

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
easiest thing to do is just buy a flat

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.790 
easiest thing to do is just buy a flat

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
details that go on the leg those I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.150 
details that go on the leg those I
ordered<00:03:16.150> from<00:03:16.330> resin<00:03:16.660> parts<00:03:16.900> calm<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:18.070> I

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
still haven't received anything so it

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.850 
still haven't received anything so it
may<00:03:23.920> take<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.160> while<00:03:24.990> finally<00:03:25.990> I<00:03:26.440> want<00:03:26.770> to

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.150 
may take a while finally I want to
through<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.760> skin<00:03:28.209> I<00:03:28.240> made<00:03:29.010> using<00:03:30.010> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
through the skin I made using the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.720 
through the skin I made using the
tutorial<00:03:30.850> from<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.840> Astro<00:03:32.530> Mac<00:03:32.680> dotnet<00:03:33.280> site

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.330 
tutorial from the Astro Mac dotnet site
I<00:03:36.730> think<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:37.630> called<00:03:37.840> more<00:03:38.530> than<00:03:38.950> one<00:03:39.160> way

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
I think it's called more than one way

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.420 
I think it's called more than one way
it's<00:03:39.519> just<00:03:39.580> going<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.970> droid<00:03:41.160> when<00:03:42.160> I'm<00:03:42.250> not

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
it's just going to droid when I'm not

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:50.850 
it's just going to droid when I'm not
fitting<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:42.790> right<00:03:43.000> now<00:03:49.560> it's<00:03:50.560> going<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:50.769> go

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
fitting this right now it's going to go

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.160 
fitting this right now it's going to go
on<00:03:50.890> like<00:03:51.010> this

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
on like this

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.360 
on like this
well<00:03:53.170> obviously<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:54.070> going<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.250> go<00:03:54.340> on

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
well obviously it's going to go on

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.160 
well obviously it's going to go on
better<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.790> just<00:03:54.880> I'm<00:03:55.540> just<00:03:55.750> showing<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.019> what

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
better I just I'm just showing it what

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.160 
better I just I'm just showing it what
it's<00:03:56.290> looking<00:03:56.590> like<00:03:56.620> at<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:56.950> moment<00:03:57.959> it's<00:03:58.959> two

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
it's looking like at the moment it's two

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.140 
it's looking like at the moment it's two
layers<00:03:59.440> or<00:03:59.590> styrene<00:04:01.200> plus<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:03.549> details<00:04:03.940> cut

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
layers or styrene plus the details cut

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.720 
layers or styrene plus the details cut
out<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:05.470> far<00:04:05.650> that's<00:04:05.890> what<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.100> have<00:04:06.400> it's

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
not wonderful it's not perfect but it

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.110 
not wonderful it's not perfect but it
will<00:04:12.730> get<00:04:12.970> there<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.239> hope<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:14.850> that's<00:04:15.850> where

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
will get there I hope and that's where
