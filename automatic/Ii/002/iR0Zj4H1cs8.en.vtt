00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that makes it hard to get the right hand

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
that makes it hard to get the right hand
on<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> strings<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.170> arch<00:01:16.380> your

end

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.249 
end
push<00:01:27.299> forward<00:01:27.540> slightly<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.439> hand

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
push forward slightly with this hand

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.600 
push forward slightly with this hand
just<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> slight<00:01:32.009> angle<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
just so that you get a slight angle this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.719 
just so that you get a slight angle this
way<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.619> that<00:01:34.619> makes<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.070> lot<00:01:35.220> easier<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
way and that makes it a lot easier to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.300 
way and that makes it a lot easier to
get<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> right<00:01:36.299> hand<00:01:36.600> onto<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> strings<00:01:37.439> I

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
notes randomly with the two fingers and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:58.210 
notes randomly with the two fingers and
the<00:03:41.180> thumb<00:03:56.290> once<00:03:57.290> you've<00:03:57.500> worked<00:03:57.680> out<00:03:57.950> how<00:03:58.160> to

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
the thumb once you've worked out how to

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
play a few notes with the right hand

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.220 
play a few notes with the right hand
it's<00:04:00.440> time<00:04:00.710> to<00:04:00.830> get<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.070> left<00:04:01.280> hand<00:04:01.580> involved

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
pressing the left hand down you're going

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.050 
pressing the left hand down you're going
to<00:04:09.470> change<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.860> sound<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.490> string<00:04:10.790> like

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060
