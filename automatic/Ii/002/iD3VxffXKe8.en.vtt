00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.020
 hello welcome to my channel abc today les 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 I'm going to show you how to make rice atole 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.970
 We are going to need 2 liters of milk 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.910
 a teaspoon of vanilla one 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.660
 spoonful of cinnamon powder a cup of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.970
 rice this rice is 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:33.119
 I know how these are soaked must 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.119
 rinse it and sugar to taste 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.250
 since we have our our rose 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.590
 rinsed 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.590
 we are going to put it to our milk 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.200
 While the milk boils, let's leave 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.200
 this is soaked a little 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.469
 this rate is two cups we already have a 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.649
 cup of rice I'm going to put a cup of 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.649
 milk 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.460
 to 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.570
 What you do now is add the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.380
 cinnamon 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.240
 to our milk if you do not like cinnamon 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.720
 to dust you can put a hairline 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.720
 cinnamon 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.439
 well now what we are going to do is 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.700
 add our milk together with the water 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.700
 to our blender 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.310
 ah 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.770
 I like it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.770
 now 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.490
 two 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 two 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.799
 and we are going to grind it as much as possible 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.849
 immediately they have what 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.750
 will be in your milk because you will be where 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.750
 the seats are left 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.650
 Y 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.090
 i 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.370
 i 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.370
 plus 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.120
 let's drink a little water and go 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.330
 to rinse out very well what was left of 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.330
 rice 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.189
 good and our atole must be 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.189
 moving constantly 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.650
 until it thickens 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.020
 good since it 's people I try to give them 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.020
 let's add half a cup of sugar 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.799
 and the teaspoon of vanilla 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.099
 and we will keep moving 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.610
 let's let it boil 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.710
 in that is our tone 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.190
 how can you see 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.040
 this thick 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.440
 not so thick 7 like very thick you 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.440
 you can put another half cup of rice 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.460
 and I tried it the truth it was very 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.130
 I do not know if they dare to do it anymore 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.150
 you know if they do comment on how they 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:10.250
 If you liked the recipe, share it and 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.250
