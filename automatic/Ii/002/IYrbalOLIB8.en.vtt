00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
levels of neutral density which just

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.430 
levels of neutral density which just
makes<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.260> cinch<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> nail<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.670> exposure

for<00:01:02.609> me<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.969> star<00:01:03.210> feature<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.840> thing<00:01:04.080> has

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
for me the star feature this thing has

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.060 
for me the star feature this thing has
to<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.339> super<00:01:05.670> slow<00:01:05.909> motion<00:01:06.979> slow<00:01:07.979> motion

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to be the super slow motion slow motion

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.109 
to be the super slow motion slow motion
is<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.610> cool<00:01:09.619> super<00:01:10.619> super<00:01:11.220> fun<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.909> take

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
is just cool super super fun to take

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.560 
is just cool super super fun to take
normal<00:01:12.900> action<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:14.159> slow<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> down<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
normal action and just slow it down and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.320 
normal action and just slow it down and
see<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:17.159> detail<00:01:17.610> that's<00:01:17.759> happening

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
see all of the detail that's happening

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.660 
see all of the detail that's happening
there<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.580> camera<00:01:20.790> has<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.979> 128<00:01:22.979> frame<00:01:23.430> per

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
there so this camera has a 128 frame per

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.870 
there so this camera has a 128 frame per
second<00:01:24.320> 240<00:01:25.320> frames<00:01:25.619> per<00:01:25.799> second<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.460> if

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
second 240 frames per second and if

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
second 240 frames per second and if
you're<00:01:27.030> willing<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.270> sacrifice<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:28.049> quality

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you're willing to sacrifice some quality

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.399 
you're willing to sacrifice some quality
you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.920> also<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.420> 480<00:01:30.420> frame<00:01:30.810> per<00:01:30.990> second

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you can also do a 480 frame per second

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.190 
you can also do a 480 frame per second
and<00:01:31.560> even<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.479> 960<00:01:33.479> frames<00:01:33.630> per<00:01:33.900> second

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and even a 960 frames per second

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.020 
and even a 960 frames per second
although<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> quality<00:01:34.770> does<00:01:35.340> suffer<00:01:35.790> quite<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
although the quality does suffer quite a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.390 
although the quality does suffer quite a
bit<00:01:36.290> here<00:01:37.290> we've<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.590> some<00:01:37.770> tests<00:01:38.040> kind<00:01:38.340> of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
bit here we've got some tests kind of

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520
