00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.330
 good I bring you a visual you are flames 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.570
 zero ok is a visual is there very good 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.570
 is created I do not remember who the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.040
 creator of the theme but well I'm going to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.579
 be leaving in the inscription the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.100
 video 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.620
 the creator of the subject ok and I do not remember 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.469
 How it is called but the topic name 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.339
 it's called sub zero as they see the menu 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:00.309
 home is quite elegant let's say 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.489
 they are professional subjects that is to say they are 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.850
 created by professionals are themes 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.850
 Unique are themes with a different style 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.650
 what 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.030
 Most of the youtubers are 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.220
 going up 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.520
 or have gone up 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.480
 as in the start menu is a little glass 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.570
 as you are seeing below is a 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.780
 little glass the truth that is very but 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.850
 very good as the icons all what 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.460
 they are seeing on the desktop is 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.310
 I will be leaving everything down in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.950
 the rare point file that also 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.160
 bring them the root skin to put that is 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.040
 the truth is that it is very good but it brings 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.040
 a little problem for the users 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.220
 of d 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.010
 that have small monitors or 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.130
 low resolution for example like mine 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.790
 the king is not going to work so well 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.910
 meter because the king meter is created and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:10.770
 designed for large monitors that 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:13.300
 resolutions of 1920 x 1080 those 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.580
 big monitors 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.450
 that's why the skin of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.130
 really what is going to be going up 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.130
 it is also 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.100
 showing how the king stays in 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.230
 those monitors the truth that is very 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.230
 good the king to say as well now 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.610
 the author wanted the same author 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.739
 who made the skin and did the icons ok 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.230
 that the truth that they are very good as 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.590
 come is combine 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.099
 well pretty well combined with the theme 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.010
 As you can see, it's a bit weird the color is a 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.550
 medium blue throwing light blue color 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.460
 about the topic 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.680
 as you see in the icons are blue no no 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:07.200
 hits both the theme with color 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.290
 because the color of the subject is bizarrely 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.560
 you are leaving the links below in the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.630
 description of the video as it is done in 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.680
 borat fly and by schorno 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.100
 they wait for 5 seconds of advertising and 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.070
 it will be 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.870
 in the download server that is today 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.780
 destroying several servers like this is not 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.570
 the link is only erased by time 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.240
 are erased and others have already passed me several 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.880
 times they remove 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.090
 they have deleted the same service has 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.570
 erased by several downloads as I 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.000
 did dropbox that there was a lot of traffic in 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.670
 that link 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.670
 so I 'll be leaving it in several 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.230
 servers I think there are 10 servers 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.300
 what a maximum that I will be leaving the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.860
 ok file can also upload to my 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.900
 Canal ban ban 7 and the channel 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.959
 of these in the box 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.860
 and so I do not expect you to like it 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.290
 I will also be sharing 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.670
 themes of this style are 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.670
 of professional creators let's say they are 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.670
 creators 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.070
 that create visuals quite well 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.800
 style 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:37.199
 how they are seeing are unique styles 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:40.670
 as they are not subjects like several youtubers 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:43.990
 they are going up now and have gone up 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:47.770
 I will also be creating packs with 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.780
 different styles of topics that for 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.870
 windows 7 and also for windows 8 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.380
 our point of being creating is going to 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.220
 be giving a little just for 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:05.600
 the theme of searching and looking for icons 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:10.160
 more not all everything but complete it 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:14.740

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:18.740

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:22.730
