00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.170 

comes<00:02:37.890> up<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.910> Sprint

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
comes up just like that the Sprint

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.000 
comes up just like that the Sprint

this way and pull on the wire and that

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.960 
this way and pull on the wire and that
looks<00:04:02.390> like<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.540> nice<00:04:03.580> positive<00:04:04.580> connection

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970
