sport<00:01:26.540> watch<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:27.910> could<00:01:28.910> also<00:01:29.030> imagine<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.570> you

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
sport watch I could also imagine it you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.050 
sport watch I could also imagine it you
know<00:01:29.840> it's<00:01:29.960> got<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.770> strap<00:01:31.040> is<00:01:31.250> big<00:01:31.820> enough

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
know it's got a the strap is big enough

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.760 
know it's got a the strap is big enough
that<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.300> think<00:01:32.510> it<00:01:32.630> could<00:01:32.750> fit<00:01:32.990> over<00:01:33.050> your<00:01:33.440> like

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
that I think it could fit over your like

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.520 
that I think it could fit over your like
a<00:01:33.800> wetsuit<00:01:34.280> or<00:01:34.430> something<00:01:34.730> like<00:01:34.880> that<00:01:35.530> however

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
a wetsuit or something like that however

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.649 
a wetsuit or something like that however
it's<00:01:36.920> only<00:01:37.040> water<00:01:37.460> resistant<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.000> 30<00:01:38.270> meters

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
it's only water resistant to 30 meters

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.170 
it's only water resistant to 30 meters
so<00:01:38.960> it's<00:01:39.200> not<00:01:39.440> necessarily<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.280> dive<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:40.670> great

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
so it's not necessarily a dive a great

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.200 
so it's not necessarily a dive a great

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
so there you have it this is the sento

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.890 
so there you have it this is the sento
vector<00:01:59.580> I'll<00:01:59.910> just<00:02:00.090> put<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.390> my<00:02:00.540> wrist<00:02:00.690> one

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
vector I'll just put it on my wrist one

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.540 
vector I'll just put it on my wrist one
more<00:02:01.020> time<00:02:01.230> so<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:01.470> can<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:01.830> sense<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.400> what

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
more time so you can get a sense of what

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.270 
more time so you can get a sense of what
it<00:02:02.640> looks<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.560> it's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.620> little<00:02:04.800> bit<00:02:04.920> hard<00:02:05.220> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it looks like it's a little bit hard to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.250 
it looks like it's a little bit hard to
read<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> display<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.510> video<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.080> but<00:02:07.200> I

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
read the display on the video here but I

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.680 
read the display on the video here but I
can<00:02:07.500> tell<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.800> in<00:02:08.190> actuality<00:02:08.820> it's<00:02:09.330> it's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
can tell you in actuality it's it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.870 
can tell you in actuality it's it's
quite<00:02:09.899> easy<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.260> read<00:02:10.560> um<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.460> also<00:02:11.610> does<00:02:11.850> have

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
quite easy to read um it also does have

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.810 
quite easy to read um it also does have
a<00:02:12.060> bi-directional<00:02:13.130> bezel<00:02:14.130> here<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.700> not

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
a bi-directional bezel here it's not

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.400 
a bi-directional bezel here it's not
ratcheting<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.570> just<00:02:15.720> got<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> nice<00:02:16.050> smooth

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
ratcheting it's just got a nice smooth

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.570 
ratcheting it's just got a nice smooth
movement<00:02:16.880> that's<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.090> something<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.510> note

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
movement that's just something to note

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
movement that's just something to note
and<00:02:21.110> overall<00:02:22.110> I'd<00:02:22.260> very<00:02:22.530> attractive<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:24.000> this

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
and overall I'd very attractive so this

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.590 
and overall I'd very attractive so this
is<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> sinto<00:02:25.170> vector<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:27.300> hope<00:02:27.480> you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
is the sinto vector and we hope you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.420 
is the sinto vector and we hope you
