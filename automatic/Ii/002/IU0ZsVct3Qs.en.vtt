00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550 
some places even have it at 54 so I
locked<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.490> 54<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.470> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
locked it in at 54 I just don't think I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
locked it in at 54 I just don't think I
you<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.710> last<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.130> these<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> play<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> 17-16

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you know last of these to play a 17-16

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.469 
you know last of these to play a 17-16
game<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.409> don't<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.700> defense<00:01:50.939> has<00:01:51.270> got

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
game I don't think the defense has got

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.960 
game I don't think the defense has got
any<00:01:51.750> worse<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.729> both

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
any worse and you know I know both

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
any worse and you know I know both
officers<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.689> maybe<00:01:55.020> gotten<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.409> little

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
officers have maybe gotten a little

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.810 
officers have maybe gotten a little
better<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.219> don't<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.610> they've

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
better but I don't know if they've

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.749 
better but I don't know if they've
gotten<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.380> much<00:01:58.680> better<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.340> any

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
gotten you know that much better in any

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.450 
gotten you know that much better in any
year<00:02:00.000> son<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:01.860> time<00:02:02.130> off<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
year son I think the more time off a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.060 
year son I think the more time off a
team<00:02:02.850> has<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.390> harder<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.799> get<00:02:05.009> in

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
team has the harder it is to get in

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.429 
team has the harder it is to get in
these<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> huge<00:02:06.000> scoring<00:02:06.450> match<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.869> takes<00:02:07.229> it

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
these a huge scoring match up takes it

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.529 
these a huge scoring match up takes it
seemed<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.310> get<00:02:08.489> into<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.420> swing

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
seemed like I have to get into the swing

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.050 
seemed like I have to get into the swing
of<00:02:09.750> things<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:11.099> know<00:02:11.220> probably<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.879> team

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
of things and you know probably the team

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
of things and you know probably the team
that<00:02:12.239> gets<00:02:13.080> into<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.560> office

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
that gets into the office

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.160 
that gets into the office
the<00:02:14.040> swing<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.310> things<00:02:14.430> uh<00:02:14.940> first<00:02:15.569> will<00:02:16.140> win

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
the swing of things uh first will win

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.440 
the swing of things uh first will win
this<00:02:16.560> matchup<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.520> either<00:02:17.700> way<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.060> is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
this matchup but either way I think is

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.110 
this matchup but either way I think is
pretty<00:02:18.600> safe<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.080> finally<00:02:19.590> under<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:21.030> I
