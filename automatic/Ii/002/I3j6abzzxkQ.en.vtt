we're<00:00:42.239> doing<00:00:42.390> anything<00:00:42.510> exciting<00:00:42.899> today<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
we're doing anything exciting today I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.650 
we're doing anything exciting today I
know<00:00:43.950> brian<00:00:44.309> has<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.300> homework<00:00:45.480> done

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
know brian has all of this homework done

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.200 
know brian has all of this homework done
that<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.559> due<00:00:46.980> within<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.460> next<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.000> think

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that is due within the next like I think

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.819 
that is due within the next like I think
three<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.570> five<00:00:48.960> days<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.410> something<00:00:49.559> like

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
three or five days or something like

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.729 
three or five days or something like
that<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> maybe<00:00:51.539> you'll<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.110> more<00:00:52.350> but

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that so maybe you'll do some more but

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.250 
that so maybe you'll do some more but
probably<00:00:53.460> nothing<00:00:53.820> crazy<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.239> maybe<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.110> can

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
probably nothing crazy so maybe we can

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
probably nothing crazy so maybe we can
do<00:00:55.410> something<00:00:55.620> today<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.280> doubt<00:00:56.430> we'll<00:00:56.579> go

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
do something today but I doubt we'll go

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
do something today but I doubt we'll go
anywhere<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.379> mean<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.469> looks<00:00:58.559> beautiful

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
anywhere I mean it looks beautiful

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
anywhere I mean it looks beautiful
outside<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.059> don't<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.359> we'll

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
outside but I just I don't think we'll

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.610 
outside but I just I don't think we'll
go<00:01:00.570> anywhere<00:01:00.870> today<00:01:00.989> we'll<00:01:01.260> probably<00:01:01.469> just

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
go anywhere today we'll probably just

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.050 
go anywhere today we'll probably just
stay<00:01:01.890> home<00:01:02.070> today<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.329> relax<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.729> yeah<00:01:05.729> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
