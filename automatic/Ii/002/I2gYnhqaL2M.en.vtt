00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.149
 hello my name is ' la and basurto what 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:10.740
 let's do now is when placing 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.940
 our mica on our tablet 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.940
 one wing brand 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 what what what we are going to do is 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:25.240
 first see our what to put 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.150
 our mica on the tablet where you 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.810
 comes the catalog 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.600
 a fiber cloth the solution and a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.930
 spatula 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.920
 and the mica 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:44.260
 half to put on the tablet what 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.540
 first we do is turn off our 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.920
 I talked 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.920
 we have to turn it off 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.770
 I hope it goes out completely 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.160
 The first thing we do is with our 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.130
 fiber cloth 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.630
 is to clean our screens so that 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.590
 there is no residue 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.590
 no trace 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.210
 that is very clean 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.680
 that cleanses me 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 a gleaming screen 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.970
 the second step is to spray with the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.970
 solution on the screen 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.829
 the third step is to take the mica wet it 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.829
 the fingers 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.660
 ah 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.849
 jump half 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.300
 you have to spray the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.950
 here spray it 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.950
 and then place it 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.850
 and with another spatula 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.850
 we take everything 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.730
 the residue 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.610
 so that there is no voice left 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.610
 of air 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.850
 and finally 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.720
 we dry our 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.720
 I have been 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.049
 from the same solution 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.049
 yes campus 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.090
 so that it is totally 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.090
 dry clean 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.900
 and that would be our bet and nothing 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.900
 stable 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.070
 well this is the 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.070
 the 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.330
 the test of how to put a half 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.460
 Thank you
