call<00:02:45.610> out<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> position<00:02:46.300> but<00:02:47.230> because<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
call out a position but because the

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.770 
call out a position but because the
stacks<00:02:48.040> are<00:02:48.250> deep<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:49.090> would<00:02:49.270> have<00:02:49.420> plenty

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780

I<00:02:52.690> would<00:02:53.560> simply<00:02:53.769> elect<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.430> 4-bit<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> size
