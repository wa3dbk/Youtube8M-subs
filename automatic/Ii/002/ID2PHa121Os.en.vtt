early jitteriness the next one is MagTek
this<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.880> supposed<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.420> improve<00:01:18.840> memory

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
this one is supposed to improve memory

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
this one is supposed to improve memory
um<00:01:20.479> well<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:22.080> combining<00:01:22.890> goat<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.280> cell

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
um well like combining goat with cell

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.840 
um well like combining goat with cell
tap<00:01:24.920> like<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> product<00:01:26.840> altogether<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
tap like I use a product altogether and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
tap like I use a product altogether and
of<00:01:29.850> course<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.329> recognize<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.990> caffeine

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
of course I can recognize the caffeine

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.780 
of course I can recognize the caffeine
because<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.680> focusing<00:01:34.790> concentration

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
because of the focusing concentration

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.660 
because of the focusing concentration
and<00:01:35.970> energy<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.229> couldn't<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.369> tell

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and energy but I couldn't really tell

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
and energy but I couldn't really tell
these<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:39.030> apart<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.530> do

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
these two apart because I think they do

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590

the same thing this is supposed to be

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.740 
the same thing this is supposed to be
for<00:01:42.990> memory<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.040> also<00:01:44.640> increase<00:01:44.939> your<00:01:44.970> memory

like I said taking cell top alone gave
me<00:02:41.770> an<00:02:42.190> effect<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.180> clarity<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.290> increased

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
me an effect of clarity and increased

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.030 
me an effect of clarity and increased
memory<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.150> can<00:02:46.870> safely<00:02:47.170> say<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.530> taking

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
memory but I can safely say that taking

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.210 
memory but I can safely say that taking
them<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.580> conjunction<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:50.010> more<00:02:51.010> beneficial

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
them in conjunction is more beneficial

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.920 
them in conjunction is more beneficial
there<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:54.520> sort<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> synergetic

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
there is this sort of a synergetic

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.830 
there is this sort of a synergetic
effect<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:56.980> think<00:02:57.250> natural<00:02:58.240> stacks<00:02:58.510> got

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
effect and I think natural stacks got

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.390 
effect and I think natural stacks got
the<00:02:59.110> combination<00:03:00.040> right<00:03:01.800> okay<00:03:02.800> so<00:03:02.860> lastly

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
the combination right okay so lastly

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.830 
the combination right okay so lastly
results<00:03:05.040> well<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:07.440> got<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.610> 97%<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:10.240> one<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
results well I got a 97% on one of the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.870 
results well I got a 97% on one of the
exams<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.590> other<00:03:12.250> one<00:03:12.550> icon<00:03:12.880> 85<00:03:13.720> percent<00:03:14.170> and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
exams the other one icon 85 percent and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.000 
exams the other one icon 85 percent and
the<00:03:15.880> last<00:03:16.210> one<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.810> got<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:17.460> 92%<00:03:18.460> so<00:03:19.650> he<00:03:20.650> told<00:03:20.890> me

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
the last one I got a 92% so he told me

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.450 
the last one I got a 92% so he told me
if<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.190> works<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.610> did<00:03:21.790> not<00:03:22.830> study<00:03:23.830> any<00:03:24.160> harder

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
if it works I did not study any harder

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.820 
if it works I did not study any harder
than<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:24.760> had<00:03:25.180> previously<00:03:25.510> actually<00:03:26.410> studied

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
than I had previously actually studied

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.540 
than I had previously actually studied
less<00:03:28.080> like<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.170> said<00:03:29.410> these<00:03:30.330> products<00:03:31.330> really
