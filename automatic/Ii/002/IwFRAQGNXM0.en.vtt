course<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:46.890> problems<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> dam

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
course there are problems with the dam

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.580 
course there are problems with the dam
to<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.120> displaced<00:00:48.539> millions<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.020> people<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
to it displaced millions of people and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.770 
to it displaced millions of people and
it's<00:00:49.739> built<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.219> seismically<00:00:50.789> active<00:00:51.149> zone

it's built in a seismically active zone

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's built in a seismically active zone
thus<00:00:52.320> threatening<00:00:52.680> catastrophic<00:00:53.520> failure

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
thus threatening catastrophic failure

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200 
thus threatening catastrophic failure
and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.809> may<00:00:54.960> cause<00:00:55.230> tremendous<00:00:55.829> damage<00:00:56.280> by

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and it may cause tremendous damage by

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
and it may cause tremendous damage by
disrupting<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.899> natural<00:00:58.230> sediment<00:00:58.649> flow<00:00:58.829> in

disrupting the natural sediment flow in
the<00:00:59.070> river<00:00:59.300> but<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> bigger<00:01:00.870> threat

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the river but there is a bigger threat

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.470 
the river but there is a bigger threat
to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> damn<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.430> 3,000<00:01:03.120> tons<00:01:03.329> of
