00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.029
 how about youtube people I bring you a 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.859
 new video in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.509
 teach how to surround almost any 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.179
 Android device is low-end 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.790
 up to high end and only with one 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.349
 application without pc or that the bce is 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.200
 install the application that I'm going to 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.200
 leave in my blogspot we will install 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.779
 the only detail of this application is 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:30.419
 which is an application with Chinese language 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:35.190
 so you do not understand much but it's 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.190
 pretty functional works 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.530
 almost any device as of 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.470
 people 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.620
 what 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.290
 that comes to us in the description and 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.980
 works on samsung htc devices 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.730
 Huawei 7 and another 10,000 phones 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.510
 mobile or that as in my case an asus 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 then let's see the application 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.820
 until 30 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.530
 and once we open it we're going 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.680
 put this that is going to put this you are 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.540
 four options five options 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.940
 and what we are going to do is give in the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.450
 first option that says and we're going to give it 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.040
 this option in this option I'll leave 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.410
 to leave the instructions on my blog 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.810
 spot so they do not get confused so much and 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.650
 once we see there we will leave 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.650
 this 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.420
 and what we are going to do is click below 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.520
 on the green button that says error that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.050
 here we are going to click and then 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.600
 this will not come out 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.630
 that are going to be marking these four 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.460
 options and it's going to be 100% then already 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.910
 will be jack of our device like this 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.940
 easy this takes less than a minute 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.030
 at least on my device I do not know how much 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.770
 late on others please leave on 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.400
 what device did he use in how much 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.180
 it took there is some problem and some that 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.180
 another problem 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.950
 and is that good to me when I give in the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.370
 first time I wanted to surround it with click 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.130
 in that mistake it came out this was filled to the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.310
 100% and I pulled out of the application when 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.530
 the search had already been installed 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.260
 uninstall alone then if it happens to them 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.620
 this is going to go to the play store again 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.670
 and we're going to be here again and we'll do 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.069
 the process that we already told you after 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.749
 that on the green button below 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.219
 and now if we pick up the phone 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:55.590
 this time it will not leave the application 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:59.670
 we will stay there we have to give 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.200
 click on the back button or on the button 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.389
 home and we would already be raffled in 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.579
 our paint phone to check 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.250
 this we use an application like 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.900
 what is the hot explorer 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.840
 screen theater some application that 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.840
 we need to try with front explorer 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.200
 when the permits are marked and we give 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.420
 in allowed to deny what they come 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.980
 being the root permissions well in Chinese 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.630
 I will explain how to ride in 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.630
 allow and how they give to deny you 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.860
 ok when it's a road application 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.200
 when we open a roll application 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.569
 we want to do something with rock 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.950
 here we will leave this window do not come out 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:52.150
 two buttons one green and one white that 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:56.860
 one white are in china the bronze is 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:59.140
 in the green if we want to give and allow 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.270
 what is being superuser give the 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.160
 superuser permissions we can in 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.350
 white to deny the permits of 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.010
 superuser then 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:14.750
 I stop surfing and there we see that no 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.989
 can change and if we give in allow the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.380
 superuser permissions 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.930
 let's see the green 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.480
 we are green and we can change 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.370
 What is the application that 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.020
 let us install him to use the face 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.270
 example a hot screen recorder 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.760
 explorer is important if we settle 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.120
 a file explorer does not erase 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.849
 things that we do not know ok because we could 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.610
 look at our phone 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.909
 let's say with what we did when 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.309
 We do rondo nothing happens no no no no 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.800
 will open the phone or anything after 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:52.089
 that we root and we install 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.399
 applications we move files of the 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:56.679
 system that can be located in our 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:05:01.389
 phone so keep an eye on what's coming 

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:04.389
 all these folders being for you 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.099
 example this system that I give them 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.009
 I recommend that you do not modify anything here 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:11.969
 it only exists in knowledge to the living room 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:15.629
 in what saying this 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:17.129
 and good would be everything I hope that 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:21.599
