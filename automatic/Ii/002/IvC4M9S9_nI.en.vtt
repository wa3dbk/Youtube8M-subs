because of the air also you heard me say

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.149 
because of the air also you heard me say
put<00:01:58.920> two<00:01:59.189> drops<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.570> brand<00:02:01.079> new<00:02:01.290> mascara

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
put two drops in your brand new mascara

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.200 
put two drops in your brand new mascara
if<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> half<00:02:03.899> used<00:02:04.530> mascara<00:02:05.490> tube<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
if you have a half used mascara tube and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.910 
if you have a half used mascara tube and
want<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> start<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.940> just<00:02:08.940> put<00:02:09.119> one<00:02:09.330> drop<00:02:09.509> in

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
want to start this just put one drop in

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.680 
want to start this just put one drop in
so<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.760> hard<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.000> tell<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.480> half

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
so I know it's hard to tell if it's half

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.610 
so I know it's hard to tell if it's half
full<00:02:12.720> or<00:02:13.080> not<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.440> if
