pouch right here to carry it around and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.619 
pouch right here to carry it around and
then<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.469> lens<00:00:46.770> caps<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.550> basically<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
then to lens caps because basically the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.819 
then to lens caps because basically the
lenses<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:50.120> either<00:00:51.120> side<00:00:51.629> essentially<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
lenses are on either side essentially so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.819 
lenses are on either side essentially so
the<00:00:53.420> pouch<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.199> used<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> clean<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the pouch can be used to clean the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.580 
the pouch can be used to clean the
lenses<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.489> soft<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.030> micro<00:00:57.750> suede<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.469> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
lenses it's soft and micro suede if you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
lenses it's soft and micro suede if you
will<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.879> used<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.210> clean<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
will so it can be used to clean the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
will so it can be used to clean the
lenses<00:01:01.379> off<00:01:01.590> when<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> need<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.489> then

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
lenses off when you need to and then

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.000 
lenses off when you need to and then
these<00:01:03.090> lens<00:01:03.300> caps<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.930> kind<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.559> click<00:01:04.799> right

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
these lens caps just kind of click right

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.190 
these lens caps just kind of click right
over<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.580> protect<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> lenses<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.080> they're

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

over and protect the lenses when they're
not<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.470> use<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:07.979> basically<00:01:08.909> how<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.240> works

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
not in use now basically how this works

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.469 
not in use now basically how this works
is<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.990> either<00:01:10.710> side<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.430> clip<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:12.240> are

x macro and the fisheye and then on the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
x macro and the fisheye and then on the
other<00:01:19.290> side<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.280> wide-angle<00:01:20.580> as

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
with that on but basically once it's on
there<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.810> two<00:01:57.810> different

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
there you have you know of two different

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.420 
there you have you know of two different
lenses<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.469> either<00:01:58.590> side<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> choose<00:01:59.159> from<00:01:59.399> now

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
lenses on either side to choose from now

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 
lenses on either side to choose from now
right<00:01:59.790> now<00:02:00.270> I've<00:02:00.420> got<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.810> wide<00:02:01.049> angle<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
right now I've got the wide angle on so

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.459 
right now I've got the wide angle on so
in<00:02:02.189> order<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.790> use<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.210> macro<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.200> case

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
in order to use the macro in this case

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.819 
in order to use the macro in this case
the<00:02:05.070> macro<00:02:05.430> 10<00:02:05.729> times<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.689> unscrew<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
the macro 10 times you unscrew and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.699 
the macro 10 times you unscrew and
remove<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.759> wide<00:02:09.270> angle<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.080> reveals

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
remove the wide angle and that reveals

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.760 
remove the wide angle and that reveals
the<00:02:11.340> macro<00:02:11.819> 10<00:02:12.270> times<00:02:12.569> which<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.930> right<00:02:13.110> there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the macro 10 times which is right there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.340 
the macro 10 times which is right there
and<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:15.750> super<00:02:15.960> close

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and for that you have to get super close

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.680 
and for that you have to get super close
in<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.160> see<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:18.000> order<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.630> to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
in as you can see in order for it to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.780 
in as you can see in order for it to
focus<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.320> right<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.680> top<00:02:20.070> as<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.580> see

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
focus like right on top as you can see

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.350 
focus like right on top as you can see
and<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.840> ten<00:02:22.290> times<00:02:22.590> macro<00:02:23.100> gives<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.610> really

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
and the ten times macro gives you really

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.470 
and the ten times macro gives you really
nice<00:02:24.630> detail<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.640> might<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.300> can

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
nice detail you can be I might and I can

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.780 
nice detail you can be I might and I can
even<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.350> know<00:02:28.470> close<00:02:29.160> enough<00:02:29.220> there

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
even be like you know close enough there

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.240 
even be like you know close enough there
you<00:02:29.850> go<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.060> can<00:02:30.150> see<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.450> lens<00:02:30.860> right<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.010> top

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
you go you can see the lens right on top

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.110 
you go you can see the lens right on top
of<00:02:32.460> things<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:33.540> not<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:34.170> crazy<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:36.000> I

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
of things but not like crazy and so if I

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.820 
of things but not like crazy and so if I
could<00:02:36.300> see<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.600> go<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.870> here<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.680> see

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
could see if I go in here you can see

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.700 
could see if I go in here you can see
that<00:02:37.950> focus<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:38.670> nicely<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.510> 15<00:02:40.380> times

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
that focus is really nicely the 15 times

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.540 
that focus is really nicely the 15 times
macro<00:02:41.460> is<00:02:42.000> even<00:02:42.390> crazier<00:02:42.870> smaller<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.130> more

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
macro is even crazier smaller and more

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.550 
macro is even crazier smaller and more
detailed<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.570> did<00:02:45.750> find<00:02:45.990> when<00:02:46.200> using<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
detailed and I did find when using the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.490 
detailed and I did find when using the
macro<00:02:46.800> lenses<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.320> hold

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
macro lenses that you have to hold

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.110 
macro lenses that you have to hold
things<00:02:49.650> very<00:02:49.980> set<00:02:50.250> steady<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.850> don't<00:02:51.000> want

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
things very set steady you don't want

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.450 
things very set steady you don't want
any<00:02:51.270> kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.540> noise<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:52.050> shaking<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.710> your

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
any kind of noise or shaking of your

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.280 
any kind of noise or shaking of your
subject<00:02:54.390> when<00:02:54.540> you're<00:02:54.690> shooting<00:02:54.900> with<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
subject when you're shooting with the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.970 
subject when you're shooting with the
macro<00:02:55.770> lenses<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.510> results<00:02:58.020> in<00:02:58.230> you

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
macro lenses because that results in you

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.040 
macro lenses because that results in you
know<00:02:59.070> blurry<00:02:59.340> pictures<00:02:59.820> but<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.480> fisheye<00:03:00.990> is

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
know blurry pictures but the fisheye is

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.990 
know blurry pictures but the fisheye is
probably<00:03:01.650> my<00:03:01.860> favorite<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.700> again<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:02.970> just

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
probably my favorite and again you just

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.330 
probably my favorite and again you just
flip<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.450> around<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:04.410> get<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.830> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
flip this around to get to that the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.250 
flip this around to get to that the
fisheye<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.760> probably<00:03:06.120> my<00:03:06.270> favorite<00:03:06.720> lens<00:03:06.930> it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
fisheye is probably my favorite lens it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.050 
fisheye is probably my favorite lens it
just<00:03:07.470> gives<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.800> really<00:03:08.160> unique<00:03:08.340> look<00:03:08.910> at

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
just gives you a really unique look at

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.250 
just gives you a really unique look at
things<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:10.410> know<00:03:10.530> just<00:03:11.160> really<00:03:11.370> cool<00:03:11.700> images

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
things you know just really cool images

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.930 
things you know just really cool images
the<00:03:13.260> wide-angle<00:03:13.520> just<00:03:14.520> gives<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.790> more

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
the wide-angle just gives you more

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.550 
the wide-angle just gives you more
detail<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.570> know<00:03:15.660> allows<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.140> spread<00:03:16.380> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
detail you know allows you to spread the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.770 
detail you know allows you to spread the
image<00:03:16.770> out<00:03:16.920> wider<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.640> capture<00:03:18.060> more<00:03:18.090> what's

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
image out wider and capture more what's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.840 
image out wider and capture more what's
around<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.560> love<00:03:20.010> using<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.550> at<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
around you I love using that at the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.600 
around you I love using that at the
beach<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.710> was<00:03:22.830> talking<00:03:23.040> obviously<00:03:23.580> I

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
beach so as I was talking obviously I

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.980 
beach so as I was talking obviously I
popped<00:03:23.880> up<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.120> couple<00:03:24.270> images<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.930> that's

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
popped up a couple images and that's

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.840 
popped up a couple images and that's
what<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.230> wanted<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.560> show<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:26.130> do<00:03:26.520> have<00:03:26.670> a

around tech comm obviously and you can
see<00:03:33.510> all<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.050> detail<00:03:34.410> on<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.610> you
