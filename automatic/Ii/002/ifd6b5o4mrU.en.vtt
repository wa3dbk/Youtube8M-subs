00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
powered off now most likely I like to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.030 
powered off now most likely I like to
add<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> virtual<00:00:34.530> disk<00:00:34.770> when<00:00:34.920> it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
add to the virtual disk when it's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.889 
add to the virtual disk when it's
powered<00:00:35.340> off<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.149> kind<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> what

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
powered off because that's kind of what

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.600 
powered off because that's kind of what
I<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> real<00:00:37.800> world<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
I like to do in the real world so the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
I like to do in the real world so the
operating<00:00:39.000> system<00:00:39.330> recognizes<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.080> when<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
operating system recognizes it when it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
operating system recognizes it when it
boots<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.250> sometimes<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.880> real<00:00:42.060> world

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
boots up but sometimes in the real world

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.880 
boots up but sometimes in the real world
we<00:00:42.480> don't<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.930> luxury<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.680> I'm<00:00:43.740> going

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
we don't have that luxury so I'm going

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
we don't have that luxury so I'm going
to<00:00:43.950> go<00:00:44.040> ahead<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.340> add<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.490> here<00:00:45.120> while<00:00:45.630> it's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to go ahead and add one here while it's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.540 
to go ahead and add one here while it's
powered<00:00:46.080> on

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.860 

now<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.760> through<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.210> procedure<00:00:54.360> no

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
now we go through the same procedure no

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.060 
now we go through the same procedure no
matter<00:00:55.110> whether<00:00:55.380> it's<00:00:55.590> powered<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.010> or

you power off or revert to the snapshot

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.690 
you power off or revert to the snapshot
so<00:03:55.930> remember<00:03:56.350> this<00:03:56.500> they're<00:03:56.890> discarded<00:03:57.430> when
