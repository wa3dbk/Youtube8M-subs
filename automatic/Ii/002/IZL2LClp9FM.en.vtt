00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.180
 welcome today I am going to teach you the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.210
 third special valentine and they're going to 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.809
 be these hearts made with clay 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.369
 polymeric in this case I'm going to use what 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.590
 that I showed you lately that is the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.420
 clay is drying l'air are as 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.340
 was a different type and then done 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.690
 this basket to put those that the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 district if you like how it has been 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.510
 oslo teach in the following tutorial if 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 you ask me, okay, it 's very easy 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.040
 we make strips like the ones you see here 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.750
 baseball sometimes fairly equal 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.150
 more craft courses is better than 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.210
 do not remain the same because sometimes it is 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.660
 nice and then it 's very easy we're going 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.020
 tracing osea pegaditas we're going 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.220
 sticking and tangling 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.220
 I do not know if it looks good 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.200
 so the whole strip more or less that are from 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200
 the same measurement 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.409
 what a long nap then you have to cut them 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.040
 and then it does not matter what happens to the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.040
 lake worth 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.380
 once you have it already braided more or 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.680
 least try that the braid is left 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.570
 same 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 with a cutter I have chosen the one of 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.680
 obviously, we are in 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.050
 special valentine for more or less 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.140
 you are cutting 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.520
 the measurements for your cutter 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.520
 and once cut 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.260
 more or less to the same extent 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.640
 then once cut 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.050
 we are going to join each other in 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.340
 this case this air drying clay 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.290
 as it joins alone it is not necessary 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.070
 press hard and swiftly immediately 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 alone is subject you see how it goes 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.430
 staying 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.659
 then as there is no need for staff and 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.060
 nothing I join them and they are 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:31.480
 they dry then together and you do not have to take 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.790
 no glue and as there is no need 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.140
 baked in this case also nothing nothing 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.850
 you are leaving 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.040
 and it is already 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.040
 we are still tangled forgetting well 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.320
 and we repeat the same thing until 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.630
 that you arrive for the mold that you have 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.970
 chosen me in this case chosen this that 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.740
 it's not very big he cited that kid 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.740
 then I will not need 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.470
 cut a lot 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.470
 ah 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.780
 let's unite 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.370
 and what I told you how it sticks with 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.700
 rabbits and with the hand will already be held 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.700
 single 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.459
 bird seville 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.750
 more or less 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.750
 let's do with this 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.680
 and I to smooth it down its three plates that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.050
 I bought it in a store of a 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.700
 my pastry friend that's called the 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.100
 kitchen downstairs if you want to search 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.140
 facebook's is like a palette that I 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.050
 I use it for many craft things 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.360
 to stretch to knead studying 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.260
 a use that we go as if there 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.260
 bought ten years ago 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.100
 once they are all united 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.100
 we plan a little bit well 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.980
 very easy we squeeze with the cutter well 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.530
 strong 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.510
 and what I do is I'm removing the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.890
 edges because this mass is better 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.890
 so it is removed alone 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.020
 to see that I leave here one and if I 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.020
 I forgot 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.780
 as you see is a spectacular heart 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.850
 because it looks like wool here I saw 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.470
 the other three and then I have thought 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.380
 to give it to my boy in 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.330
 I described the statistic with 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.310
 the same technique and with a bowl I 'm telling you 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.710
 If you're interested, you can ask me 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.440
 tutorial because nothing I hope that I have 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.440
 liked this first year of special san 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.200
 valentine and many kisses for everyone and a 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.380
 very important advice that you be happy 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.380
