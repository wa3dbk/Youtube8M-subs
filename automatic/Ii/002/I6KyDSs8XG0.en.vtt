00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.820
 watts everyone knows I'm coming 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.710
 especially for homes that news finally 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.389
 it's more of a bonus video about 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.120
 game gta 5 so we're not going 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.770
 actually here talk about the game in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.029
 party animal and ruia to the game since I you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.460
 spoke as indicates the title is good 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.199
 of an actor of the game yes because I 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.609
 think you know it all 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.930
 developers all like for example 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.490
 crunch star to create their game they have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.650
 need of actors of people who are going 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 not having to do the gentle gestures and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.859
 will put some kinds of combinations 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.480
 with plenty of sensors they will be equipped 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.100
 outdoor sensors these actors there and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 then after like his ball and gestures 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.040
 will already be done it's true it's 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 much simpler on their part and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 and then more than just creating graphics 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.399
 all that with the forms and its accesses of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 doubts as to the actor in fact this is 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.000
 very very strong and that's called everything 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.039
 simply 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 steven org who confided everything 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.320
 simply a mytf1 so a kind of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 west this is the famous chain and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.680
 and then he had some kind of interviews all 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.539
 that to which he responded to some 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.940
 thing and he explained his background 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.729
 how all that brief about 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.590
 rockstar who have it they asked for 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.240
 work by that they asked for 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.100
 work and to play you the role of a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 actor and that's right he explained as 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.299
 what finally and I wanted to just 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.799
 after and well I quote exactly what 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.380
 that he said and although it's true that 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.659
 finally here is the world of low video games 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.680
 now that's really it took 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.479
 so big that it's still 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.580
 more important than the movies that's to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.479
 to say that here even though certainly he did 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.060
 in a video game 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.979
 if you want economic power 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.090
 video game beats widely at the level of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.430
 movies it's crazy stuff 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.750
 and so here he is going to explain everything to you 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.400
 that and then I found that quite 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.810
 interesting even we could talk about it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.100
 it's true that it's shocking 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.049
 finally the video games took 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.490
 much more ample stops although the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.710
 films that is to say here they have a 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 they asked of them they asked these 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.020
 steven dogues people who plays the role 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 de trevor is good to play the role 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.810
 of work well he 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 limit it's like it's a role 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.229
 in a movie and even that is still 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.179
 more than that at the it was said so I 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.579
 spent a casting like for any 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.229
 what role in cinema on television or 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.520
 at the theater but not my request and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.110
 different media to pass 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.690
 audition with the casting director 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.039
 then so the colback e second audition 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.430
 after a first selection 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.720
 so this is ndlr place at rockstar where 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.310
 they tried several associations 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.709
 actors for the three roles in order to 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.500
 see if he committed the act i me 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.629
 excuse me so basically took all that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.940
 if it makes very good in it I have 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.709
 never thought about anyone's reaction 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.420
 the only thing that mattered to me 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.849
 it was that the job was well done that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.190
 the character to provide is fun and 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.780
 to and brings as many colors as 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.400
 possible to play it's not easy 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 when you have to do a character 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.299
 as crazy and psychopathic but I did 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.290
 never had any pressure just that 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.269
 that I put myself 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.910
 I felt indebted to the 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.560
 director so rod edge the authors and 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.329
 everyone at rockstar I did not want 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.019
 especially not disappoint them with such 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.420
 character as iconic as this has 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.220
 been a real pleasure to play very 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.319
 down which actor did not want to leave 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.500
 express himself his unpredictable nature his 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.750
 impulsiveness his anger traits the most 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.060
 big challenge was actually find there 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.489
 a little humanity to such a monster with 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.780
 supp of the violent attacks this was at 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.250
 the soul at a time so fun and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.810
 stimulating to embody 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.760
 I tried to bring a little 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.370
 of humor which allowed me to inject 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.739
 some touches of humanity do not 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.000
 necessarily and well the character in 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.609
 himself very good he must be 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.989
 complained but good to civray nogues 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.280
 so here's his finances ensures laughs 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.450
 investing small information for 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.160
 to tell you how finally the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.569
 business where that video games has 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.590
 tremendously climb there will be very 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.780
 soon of course information 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.489
 offers gta 5 game and yes it's 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.230
 always possible since there will be 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.639
 Nevertheless future DLC stuff that 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.560
 will arrive very soon at 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.410
 of the game there will be updates for 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.209
 keep you updated about all that 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.290
 serves you here you know little by little 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.630
 about what will happen at 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.280
 of this game and then there will be a lot of 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.359
 things finally so here we are doing 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.680
 a little thing to find that that's 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.480
 interesting in what in air debate in 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.140
 the comment bar about 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.940
 that's what for you 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.910
 it should the young and video games of 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.140
 fees will have to have this this form there 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.090
 that is to say this importance where 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.920
 do you think it's a bit 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.750
 exaggerated finally that's when 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.670
 even enough profiteers or other is 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.290
 true we can talk about it so we can kill 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.870
 a little bit but both the two things 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.970
 are pretty much can be an answer 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.320
 after that depends on crazy all that but 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.880
 this is it can be interesting to 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.830
 talk about it and then it's true at 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.630
 level of movies should know that as 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.160
 I say them elsewhere and well I was at 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.260
 5 at the development level it cost 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.480
 several million to several million 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.750
 euros normally and if you want 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.950
 down that finally so no excuse me 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.180
 in those three hundred thousand euros I 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.900
 thought that development if I'm 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.310
 no nonsense I think it's a 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.210
 thing like that what's crazy it's not 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.470
 several million I was wrong 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.090
 in my head I'm thinking about it actually 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.800
 because if you want at the level of 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.180
 sales hit was at 5 and c up 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.380
 estimated at several million 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.750
 copies 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.360
 and well he finally realizes again 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.280
 more sales than some movies that 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.040
 have made a huge success if it takes 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.600
 know that at the level of 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.130
 elbow of game development is good 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.380
 it cost even more than the movie 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.390
 avatar are still necessary to say to themselves I 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.919
 already five it cost them 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.510
 even more expensive because produce by 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.880
 example the movie avatar what is right 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.200
 a huge movie all this so must when 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.820
 bah even say a lot of things by 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.290
 against for example the famous movie 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.260
 movie the famous pirate series of 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.510
 caribbean is well above gta 5 may 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.130
 that same gta 5 after video games 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.750

 on it but it makes everything thank you to put

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.760
 important is to me on my page
