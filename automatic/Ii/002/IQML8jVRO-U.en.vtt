00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.420
America... the word rings in our ears like a song

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.560
a way

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.730
a way forward, a way of life, a way of living

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.070
the working man is the noblest of men

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.580
speaking now of the work of the factory man

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.380
the farmer

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.590
the fry cook

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.250
the office people in concrete buildings

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.360
a nation built by the work of hands

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.500
speaking now of hands and the work they do

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.760
and what it means to construct a dream

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.880
the dream we all dream of being free

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.170
and being together

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.380
in our homes

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.860
in our yards

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.860
on our farms and ranches

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.960
knowing that making children

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.100
and making families

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.060
and doing what it takes to make us American

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.820
is a good thing

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.560
and to give our lives

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.580
to lifetimes working

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.580
and away from working

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.390
time given to all things other than work

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.949
and in our love of these things green and growing

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680
and giving back, these too are good things

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.060
helping the homeless

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.960
going to the ballpark

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.520
mowing the lawn

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.050
making meals together

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.850
all very good things

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.160
Thank You, America

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.000
Thank You
