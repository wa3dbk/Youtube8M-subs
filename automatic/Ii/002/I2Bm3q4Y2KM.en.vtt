one that gets the assault vest over
Slowbro<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:38.159> spore<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:39.409> good<00:01:40.409> but

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
Slowbro because spore is good but

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.289 
Slowbro because spore is good but
assault<00:01:41.159> vest<00:01:41.400> makes<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.820> thing<00:01:42.030> into<00:01:42.150> an

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
assault vest makes this thing into an

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.630 
assault vest makes this thing into an
offensive<00:01:42.630> tank<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:44.159> awesome<00:01:44.399> we

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
offensive tank and that's awesome we

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.859 
offensive tank and that's awesome we
could<00:01:44.759> even<00:01:44.880> turn<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.149> into<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.420> call<00:01:45.630> mine

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
could even turn this into a call mine

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
could even turn this into a call mine
slipper<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.590> wanted<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> which<00:01:47.310> could<00:01:47.790> be

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
slipper if we wanted to which could be

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.840 
slipper if we wanted to which could be
interesting<00:01:48.770> because<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.369> could<00:01:50.490> still<00:01:50.640> take

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
interesting because it could still take

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.980 
interesting because it could still take
knockoffs<00:01:51.329> all<00:01:51.630> day<00:01:53.360> but<00:01:54.360> yeah<00:01:54.479> both<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> these

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
knockoffs all day but yeah both of these

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.520 
knockoffs all day but yeah both of these
would<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.409> would<00:01:55.680> probably<00:01:55.920> slightly<00:01:56.670> modify

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.490 
would I would probably slightly modify
just<00:01:58.530> ever<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.130> slightly<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.960> big<00:02:01.110> start<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
just ever so slightly the big start of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.100 
just ever so slightly the big start of
the<00:02:01.560> show<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:02.250> assault<00:02:02.790> vest<00:02:03.030> TTR<00:02:03.509> which<00:02:03.780> gets

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the show was assault vest TTR which gets

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.440 
the show was assault vest TTR which gets
an<00:02:04.350> insane<00:02:04.829> special<00:02:05.430> defense<00:02:05.729> boost<00:02:06.030> from<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
an insane special defense boost from the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.919 
an insane special defense boost from the
sandstorm<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.489> the<00:02:08.489> assault<00:02:08.849> vest<00:02:09.090> putting

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
sandstorm and the assault vest putting

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.210 
sandstorm and the assault vest putting
it<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:11.099> uh

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
it at like uh

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.210 
it at like uh
something<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:12.930> 500<00:02:13.930> special<00:02:14.800> defense<00:02:15.070> or

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
something like 500 special defense or

something like 500 special defense or
something

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
something

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.790 
something

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
focus blast bounced off I think this

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.540 
focus blast bounced off I think this
thing<00:02:19.960> can<00:02:20.110> actually<00:02:20.140> take<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> mega<00:02:20.950> Alakazam

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
thing can actually take a mega Alakazam

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.450 
thing can actually take a mega Alakazam

Focus Blast a modest mega Alakazam focus
blast<00:02:24.670> live<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.690> then<00:02:25.810> kill<00:02:26.080> as<00:02:26.320> long<00:02:26.800> as<00:02:26.920> it's

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
blast live and then kill as long as it's

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.940

this<00:02:29.950> was<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.190> good<00:02:30.340> talonflame<00:02:30.790> stop<00:02:31.300> though<00:02:31.510> I

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
this was a good talonflame stop though I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.840 
this was a good talonflame stop though I
think<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.080> what<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.260> ran<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:33.340> pretty<00:02:33.760> much

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
think this is what I ran to pretty much

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.180 
think this is what I ran to pretty much
check<00:02:34.180> talonflame<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.530> lot<00:02:35.710> of<00:02:35.740> weaker

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
check talonflame and a lot of weaker

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.000 
check talonflame and a lot of weaker
special<00:02:36.640> attackers<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:38.680> works<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:38.980> well

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
special attackers it works so well

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.620 
special attackers it works so well
against<00:02:39.340> talonflame<00:02:39.700> because<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.240> pursuits

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
against talonflame because it pursuits

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.080 
against talonflame because it pursuits
and<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.200> could<00:02:41.350> Bluff<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.830> choice<00:02:42.220> band<00:02:42.490> so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
and you could Bluff a choice band so

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.700 
and you could Bluff a choice band so
it's<00:02:43.240> pretty<00:02:43.390> awesome<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:44.140> could<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.410> come

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
it's pretty awesome it could like come

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.430 
it's pretty awesome it could like come
in<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:45.040> something<00:02:45.610> like<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:47.110> know<00:02:47.230> a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
in on something like you know a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.650 
in on something like you know a
superpower<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.310> think<00:02:48.520> it's<00:02:48.670> good<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.240> go<00:02:49.390> set

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
superpower to think it's good to go set

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.120 
superpower to think it's good to go set
up<00:02:49.750> with<00:02:49.840> SD<00:02:50.200> or<00:02:50.350> something<00:02:50.740> and<00:02:50.890> then<00:02:50.980> you

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
up with SD or something and then you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.910 
up with SD or something and then you
like<00:02:51.340> stone<00:02:51.700> edge<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.060> instead<00:02:52.920> something

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
like stone edge it instead something

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.640 
like stone edge it instead something
like<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.600> but<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.500> pretty

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
like that but this is a pretty

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.380 
like that but this is a pretty
interesting<00:02:56.890> team<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.490> wouldn't<00:02:58.060> mind<00:02:58.210> trying

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
interesting team I wouldn't mind trying

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.770 
interesting team I wouldn't mind trying
it<00:02:58.630> again<00:02:58.690> -<00:02:58.870> no<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:59.140> actually<00:02:59.520> we<00:03:00.520> had<00:03:00.640> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
it again - no you actually we had a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.120 
it again - no you actually we had a
standard<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:02.200> especially<00:03:02.560> defensive

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
standard like especially defensive

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.730 
standard like especially defensive
clefable<00:03:03.630> which<00:03:04.630> is<00:03:04.780> pretty<00:03:05.020> decent<00:03:05.290> we<00:03:05.590> might

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
clefable which is pretty decent we might

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.050 
clefable which is pretty decent we might
want<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:05.920> change<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.430> physically

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
want to change this to physically

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.780 
want to change this to physically
defensive<00:03:07.480> though<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:08.490> don't<00:03:09.490> know<00:03:09.550> I'd<00:03:09.670> have

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
defensive though I don't know I'd have

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.890 
defensive though I don't know I'd have
to<00:03:09.880> mess<00:03:10.060> around<00:03:10.210> with<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> team<00:03:10.720> and

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
to mess around with the team and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.680 
to mess around with the team and
actually<00:03:10.990> test<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.530> out<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.940> seems<00:03:13.300> like<00:03:13.510> a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
actually test it out but it seems like a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.150 
actually test it out but it seems like a
few<00:03:13.900> things<00:03:14.200> do<00:03:14.380> need<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.590> change<00:03:14.800> this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
few things do need to change this

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.280 
few things do need to change this
doesn't<00:03:15.520> really<00:03:15.640> need<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.820> solve<00:03:16.120> s<00:03:16.330> this<00:03:16.960> may

doesn't really need to solve s this may

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.200 
doesn't really need to solve s this may
need<00:03:17.440> assault<00:03:17.770> best<00:03:18.010> but<00:03:18.220> probably<00:03:18.580> not<00:03:18.820> since

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
need assault best but probably not since

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.720 
need assault best but probably not since

t tar and clefable are already pretty

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.210 
t tar and clefable are already pretty
defensive<00:03:22.090> as<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.770> we<00:03:23.770> could<00:03:23.890> just<00:03:24.070> make

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
defensive as it is we could just make

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.650 
defensive as it is we could just make
especially<00:03:24.550> defensive<00:03:25.270> instead<00:03:25.600> of

physically defensive I don't know either
one's<00:03:27.580> pretty<00:03:28.150> good<00:03:28.210> here<00:03:28.710> I<00:03:31.560> probably

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
one's pretty good here I probably

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.110 
one's pretty good here I probably
honestly<00:03:32.710> at<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.580> end<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.820> day<00:03:33.910> I'd

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
honestly at the end of the day I'd

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.610 
honestly at the end of the day I'd
probably<00:03:34.300> just<00:03:34.600> take<00:03:34.750> off<00:03:34.900> assault<00:03:35.230> vest<00:03:35.440> on

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
probably just take off assault vest on

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.740 
probably just take off assault vest on
solo<00:03:35.860> bro<00:03:36.070> maybe<00:03:36.340> put<00:03:36.520> on<00:03:36.670> calm<00:03:37.360> mind<00:03:37.600> or

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
solo bro maybe put on calm mind or

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.360 
solo bro maybe put on calm mind or
something

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
something

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.180 
something
obviously<00:03:40.060> genesect<00:03:40.540> can't<00:03:40.900> be<00:03:41.260> used<00:03:41.680> anymore

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
obviously genesect can't be used anymore

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.280 
obviously genesect can't be used anymore
so<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> good<00:03:42.850> substitute<00:03:43.120> would<00:03:43.570> probably<00:03:44.140> be

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
so a good substitute would probably be

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.440 
so a good substitute would probably be
another<00:03:44.530> steel<00:03:44.920> type<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.490> can<00:03:45.760> do<00:03:46.030> some<00:03:46.240> work

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
another steel type that can do some work

furs<00:03:52.150> wouldn't<00:03:52.480> be<00:03:52.540> bad<00:03:52.750> here<00:03:52.959> because<00:03:53.230> I

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
furs wouldn't be bad here because I

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.500 
furs wouldn't be bad here because I
think<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.620> was<00:03:53.830> i<00:03:54.160> can't<00:03:54.940> reward<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.330> well<00:03:55.480> I

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
think this was i can't reward it well I

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.180

think<00:03:55.630> was<00:03:55.930> expert<00:03:56.350> belt<00:03:58.560> yeah<00:03:59.560> steel<00:03:59.950> type

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190
