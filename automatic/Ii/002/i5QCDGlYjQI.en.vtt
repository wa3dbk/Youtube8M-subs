GBE well what you tuned to an open chord
so<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.660> doing<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.870> how<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.649> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so it's not doing and how you do that is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.029 
so it's not doing and how you do that is
you<00:00:58.980> leave<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.609> e<00:00:59.640> string<00:01:00.239> alone<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:01.710> take

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you leave the e string alone you take

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.030 
you leave the e string alone you take
the<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> string<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.539> tune<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.199> Abby<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the a string and you tune up to Abby and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.679 
the a string and you tune up to Abby and
then<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.990> over<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.909> deep

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
then this over here this is the was deep

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.219 
then this over here this is the was deep
it's<00:01:10.229> moved<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.070> whole<00:01:11.280> step<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:12.060> tune<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> up

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it's moved up a whole step to tune it up

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's moved up a whole step to tune it up
to<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> me<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.659> G<00:01:16.430> becomes<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to and me and then the G becomes a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.100 
to and me and then the G becomes a
g-sharp<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.950> middle<00:01:20.790> note<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> G

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
g-sharp which is the middle note of a G

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
g-sharp which is the middle note of a G
core<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.009> leave<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> B<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.150> e

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
core and then you leave the B and the e

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.429 
core and then you leave the B and the e
alone<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.939> miraculously<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
alone and so miraculously you know you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.560 
alone and so miraculously you know you
don't<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.369> all<00:01:29.400> these<00:01:29.729> chord<00:01:30.180> shapes

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
don't have to do all these chord shapes

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.440 
don't have to do all these chord shapes
but<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.290> move<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.310> slide<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.180> just

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
but you just move the slide and you just

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
but you just move the slide and you just
hold<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.900> at<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.170> threat<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> an<00:01:35.430> open

lick by Elmore James called dust my

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.680 
lick by Elmore James called dust my
broom<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:49.380> very<00:01:50.100> unsure<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:51.060> heard<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.509> or

broom it's very unsure you heard it or

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:03.320 
broom it's very unsure you heard it or
same<00:01:51.960> variation<00:02:01.580> that's<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:03.000> fourth

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
same variation that's the fourth

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.760 
same variation that's the fourth
position<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.340> an<00:02:05.580> E<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.350> then<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.560> is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
position so that's an E and then this is

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.350 
position so that's an E and then this is
a<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.380> Blues<00:02:10.770> will<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> 145

a this you know Blues will have a 145

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.740 
a this you know Blues will have a 145
progression<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.380> then<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.540> beam<00:02:17.750> no

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
progression and then this is the beam no

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.430 
progression and then this is the beam no
I'm<00:02:19.080> not<00:02:20.000> dexterous<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.300> I'll<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.810> best<00:02:21.989> I
