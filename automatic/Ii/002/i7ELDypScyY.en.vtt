00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
going to always be difficult to forget

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.410 
going to always be difficult to forget
what<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.250> experienced<00:00:26.820> last<00:00:26.910> year<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> don't

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
what I experienced last year I don't

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.029

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
severe coming along on the table you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.200 
severe coming along on the table you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
maybe struggled a little bit in the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.030 
maybe struggled a little bit in the
first<00:00:39.360> half<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.840> last<00:00:40.500> two<00:00:40.649> months<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> when

towards<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> back<00:00:47.129> end<00:00:47.309> house<00:00:47.550> also

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
towards the back end house also

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.940 
towards the back end house also
performed<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> lot<00:00:48.480> better<00:00:48.660> early<00:00:49.559> part<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
performed a lot better early part of the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.130

season<00:00:49.980> didn't<00:00:50.460> play<00:00:50.579> fantastic<00:00:51.140> mainly

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
season didn't play fantastic mainly

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
season didn't play fantastic mainly
probably<00:00:52.590> because<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> few<00:00:53.340> nerves<00:00:53.610> being

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
probably because a few nerves being

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.130 
probably because a few nerves being
world<00:00:54.120> champion<00:00:54.539> putting<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> lot<00:00:55.110> more

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
is not always going to be the case but

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.209 
is not always going to be the case but

last<00:01:02.489> week<00:01:02.730> gives<00:01:03.059> me<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.359> confidence

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
last week gives me a lot of confidence

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.230 
last week gives me a lot of confidence
going<00:01:03.780> into<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> crucible<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> don't<00:01:06.119> think

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
going into the crucible so I don't think

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.280 
going into the crucible so I don't think
there's<00:01:06.390> ever<00:01:06.479> been<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.720> blow<00:01:06.900> he's<00:01:07.080> won<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
there's ever been a blow he's won the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
there's ever been a blow he's won the
China<00:01:07.619> Open<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.729> win<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
China Open then then going on to win the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.460 
China Open then then going on to win the
World<00:01:09.270> Championship<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.049> Trump<00:01:10.290> could

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
World Championship I think Trump could

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
World Championship I think Trump could
want<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> final<00:01:11.790> few

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
want it and then go to the final few

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240 
want it and then go to the final few
years<00:01:12.210> later<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.780> how<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> feel<00:01:14.220> about

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
more than enough time to recover and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
more than enough time to recover and
prepare<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> mean<00:01:23.280> I'm<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> go

artist<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.489> sure<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:14.879> I<00:02:15.090> mean<00:02:15.360> it's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
artist that's for sure but I mean it's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.970

such<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> hard<00:02:15.900> tournament<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.379> win<00:02:16.500> even<00:02:16.680> just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
such a hard tournament to win even just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.160 
such a hard tournament to win even just
one<00:02:17.129> time<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.060> win<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.300> last<00:02:18.390> year<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:19.110> the

one time so to win it last year for the
first<00:02:19.230> time<00:02:19.560> was<00:02:19.739> great<00:02:20.010> try<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.730> defend<00:02:20.970> it

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150

will<00:02:21.269> probably<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.540> twice<00:02:21.810> as<00:02:21.840> difficult<00:02:22.140> but

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
will probably be twice as difficult but

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.199 
will probably be twice as difficult but
I'll<00:02:22.800> give<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.010> my<00:02:23.099> best<00:02:23.190> shot<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:24.180> course

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
I'll give it my best shot and of course

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.670 
I'll give it my best shot and of course
