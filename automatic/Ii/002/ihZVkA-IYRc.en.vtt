00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.180
 Hello, good morning, Miriam speaks to you. 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.370
 make Colombian aesthetics what I do not 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.759
 know today master in the moviment 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.150
 action and I wanted to invite you to my videos 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.000
 tutorials that I have on my course page 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.759
 dotcom permanent makeup i have it 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.130
 with a price of $ 100 heart attacks 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.119
 with this price I am giving the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.999
 opportunity to many people to study 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.640
 here since I can not be present 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.250
 this she has the opportunity to pass to 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.050
 I'm going to study because I know there's 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.140
 many people who like this race 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.230
 technique and does not have the possibilities of 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.840
 study so it's very expensive in the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.359
 in this tutorial I'm entering the 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.969
 videos that I am making in my classes 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.359
 I 've seen here in Lima and you are going 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.519
 there observing in detail everything that 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.789
 It happens while we do some eyebrows 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.789
 Eyes the lips how we take the 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.700
 measures as we grab the love or the 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.369
 hand position 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.090
 place ourselves on the sides of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.759
 patient is not imad the pigments that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.219
 we choose the mixtures we make of 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.710
 according to his skin tone and then with 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:24.240
 these you are going to study and go to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.990
 help a lot I think it's a price 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.600
 economic good anyway do 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.780
 one page and keep it up to date 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.539
 videos that's your expensive that's taken care of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.360
 a person especially make them 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:43.979
 then the videos that are already are already 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.140
 from the theoretical say part 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.259
 then they are already lowering everything that is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 the parts where we are already working 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.060
 directly with the student so 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.549
 they will always be watching new 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.159
 videos new videos but everything with its 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.619
 due time they have a little bit of 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.829
 patience because videos like them 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.479
 I said they are long 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.569
 he will also find the reprint 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.099
 complete of a reprint where all the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.700
 specialization courses that I have 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.970
 fact I have rescued the most important thing that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.040
 it's like my little boy my little book then 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.590
 I'm also sending it to the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.349
 people who enter this course and if 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.950
 they are interested in being charged the 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.129
 Certificate of completion of the course 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.230
 Well, he also sent them 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.360
 it's there included that was pressed but 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.090
 I think it's cheaper nobody can 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.540
 as the propaganda says I also wanted 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.640
 tell them to keep asking me not to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.299
 ask by mail I thank you 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.190
 ask me about youtube 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.430
 ask so that everyone can 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.000
 read and everything can learn from here is that 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.260
 this is like a family like a fire 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.480
 where we tell each other our failures and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.430
 our triumphs because I do not think that in 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.670
 ladder movement all of happiness 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.010
 do not 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.110
 the skin respond differently 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.700
 although they have worked well on the skin 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.319
 he wanted to go out with another color 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.010
 then they think they have done wrong or not 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.840
 they have many origins many factors 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.420
 that one already with experience we already know 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.209
 and still does not have the right answer that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.760
 give the customer and is like when 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.910
 doctors operate and something went wrong 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.880
 you know why this could have happened no 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.870
 Just one is bored with the years 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.590
 one is learning and then when 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.540
 something happens that is not so abnormal that it is 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.750
 because not what I'm pretty the tone 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.470
 so I did not stay a little bit in 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.739
 boy or I did not like the color and what 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.420
 I want more clarito or darker the 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.640
 so at the smallest detail we can not 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.299
 solve quietly but for that 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.860
 you have to know how to do it and know how to explain 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.810
 to our customers what we are going 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.680
 to do you know that there is 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.569
 depigmentation there is camouflage 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.409
 exist 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.560
 of corrections and corrections 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.680
 of scars repopulating or explaining the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.470
 many things that we can solve 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.610
 so I hope you keep asking 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.280
 I gladly'm going to 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.070
 answer and you know they are invited 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.169
 cordially to my tutorials so that 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.599
 study and you will go super 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.889
 economic and they will learn a lot 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.889
 Bye
