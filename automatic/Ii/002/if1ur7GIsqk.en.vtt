00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.640
 hello to all space friends 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.860
 welcome back to my post today 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.330
 I show you how to connect the controller 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.490
 of the playstation 3 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.800
 all ipad this is possible thanks to two 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.300
 applications one for computer and one for 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 jailbroken devices 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.310
 in the case of the computer it is called six per 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.230
 allows you to pair the controller with the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.140
 device that can be an ipad or 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.540
 similarly also an iphone while the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.310
 tweak that we find on cydia will allow 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.590
 then actually using the 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.730
 controller with some games then 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.980
 we will see in a moment first of all 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.220
 we pair the controller with the iPad like 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.160
 you download six for the from the links that 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.250
 found in the article in this case for 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.110
 mac but the procedure for windows is 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.219
 quite similar however you find all of them 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.899
 the steps explained in the article la 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.069
 first time we follow the application 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.329
 15 will ask if we want to launch it is 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:14.399
 the application asks us to connect 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.549
 that the controller then we take a 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.130
 mini usb cable and connect the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.159
 computer controller 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:29.459
 at this point place ps3 six axis 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.770
 controller connected and asks us to 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:37.049
 connect the device we take the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.039
 ipad cable and connect it to the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.039
 computer 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:49.409
 at this point the ipad of mario will appear 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.939
 7.0 point 4 and the option will be active for 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.499
 controller to ipad 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.109
 the rich and everything is already done 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.259
 that is, the controller was paired 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.169
 with the ipad lasted a few seconds 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.719
 we note that the LEDs have turned on and are 

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:09.340
 flashing lights we can also disconnect 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:14.709
 everything e 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:19.530
 remove the mac and concentrate on the ipad 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:27.610
 so what should we do? 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:29.739
 install controller for all from cydia e 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.150
 we've already done it 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:37.690
 settings find a new entry that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.390
 it's called bt stack activate stack clothes 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.819
 if it is not already active at this point we are 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.340
 ready these procedures must be performed 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.349
 not every time we need to 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.269
 to play but only as a configuration 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.819
 Basic 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:56.709
 we start the application for example mini 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.260
 color and these messages will appear which 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.290
 say press the ps button for 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.319
 connect the control once pressed 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.260
 it passes from the four flashing leds to 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.379
 a led and the message will also appear 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.430
 within the application like 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:21.489
 notification at this point we can play 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:28.389
 using in this case the two joypads 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:30.849
 analog joysticks and go on like this 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.680
 so definitely much, much more 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.849
 comfortable especially in the summer of hiv 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.400
 aids which is quite large and therefore 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.530
 it could be a little awkward to use 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.440
 the on-screen controller that how 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.450
 you see they were even turn off ok 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.750
 let's see other applications 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.489
 here we have gta vice city 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.549
 unfortunately it is still not compatible though 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.980
 is compatible gta san andreas 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.540
 so maybe it will only be one 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.389
 question of time the same also scared 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.190
 2014 a game that I would like to try with 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:09.609
 joypad and yet it is not compatible 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.130
 instead we note for example asphalt that is 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.269
 ready to be used with 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.230
 this procedure 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.269
 we have launched a new application 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.269
 you have to press the button again 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:32.729
 and we're ready now I don't know why but 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.729
 on the other hand, we are not discouraged 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:41.860
 then joe classic fast race like 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.949
 see unfortunately these options is not 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.919
 You can select it from the 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:53.050
 controller will therefore still need to 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.550
 interact with this device 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.620
 could be a bit obnoxious though 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.979
 we want to connect the device to the 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:05.979
 television thing plausible and use 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:07.810
 the controller just to play though a 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.319
 this point if we connect the device 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.879
 to the tribe with the cable then we will have to 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:16.090
 still stay near the 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:22.779
 device to play in the menus e 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:25.839
 then select the challenges in this 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:31.000
 case we note that it is very reactive 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:35.050
 really very fast ie I didn't give one 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.889
 difference between playing on the controller and 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.050
 play with 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.240
 the controls on the screen indeed 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:48.259
 of course it is much more convenient to benefit 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:56.689
 to physical control also work 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:06:01.370
 other commands such as braking on 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:03.340
 change of the screen this is the 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.199
 screen with handbrake 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:12.469
 in short, I was an attack here, this is it 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:15.319
 the turbo church so we can go 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:16.610
 go on like this with all the various games 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.129
 compatible 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.189
 another of the compatible games is also 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:24.500
 birds or what we see right 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:28.719
 very quickly and then there is a whole 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:33.229
 list that you still find on the site 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:35.120
 but let's say the list is not much 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:40.129
 reliable also because for example ho 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:44.750
 tried sonic and and for the moment not 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:46.159
 it works like you always see the speech 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:54.099
 which I said before must anyway 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:54.099
 interact with the display 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.729
 and in this case this command has given 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.280
 from the display unless there is a 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:12.590
 command on the trio controller ignore 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:14.449
 because I'm trying very hard now 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.280
 this case if we want to activate ad 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:24.680
 example the power up there is the button on the 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:28.699
 controller that must put us here and 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:34.219
 also the pause for example against 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:35.629
 how to get out of the break and then there is 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:38.500
 this small inconvenience 

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:38.500
 naturally 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:45.150
 brings great advantages can 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:48.690
 re-use the joypad for now is 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:52.130
 all if there will be any other news there 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:55.170
 we will keep you updated directly on the site 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.880
 for any problem or doubt you can 

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.280
 refer to article e 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.920
 use the comments to the article 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.920
 see you at the next hello video
