00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.529
 new part of my model railway under construction 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.920
 that the 13th 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.840
 So first I have to say yes it has 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.160
 took a long time until now again 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.250
 I arrived in the summer 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 just did not have much desire 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.390
 and not so much time and then 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.320
 I have another one now in the fall holidays 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.960
 week on vacation and yes but I hope so 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.630
 you like it anyway 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.940
 and here it still continues to well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.940
 Ok, now I'll show you first 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.730
 progress and so here in the bottom 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.920
 in fact, there is nothing at all 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.170
 done 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.239
 but here at the back of my system page 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.070
 I have now decided that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.780
 to come here because you are 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.789
 actually get there her car system 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.640
 this whole stretch long here everywhere 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.320
 and yes I do not do it now 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.939
 because there is not enough space here and me 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 do not want to continue growing and that's why 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.810
 I want to build dwarfs here 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.820
 Here you see it a bit 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.750
 I already have fly screens 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.229
 designed as I want them, and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.670
 with here daddy and then there is still 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.850
 There's something about that, I have it back here 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.259
 And yes , yes, yes 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.509
 I will then the next day yet 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 and back here where the cars 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.829
 actually should have driven in a circle 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.659
 I just got a little mini-state 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:47.540
 built down so to speak small village with 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.540
 three so only two houses here one 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.730
 I also painted that before 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.340
 that was completely gray, I hope so 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.960
 now looks a bit better've 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 I'm also a bit on top of it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.780
 glued to it that a bit older 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.300
 looks and now I do not know 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.150
 what is it some alm hut 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:19.980
 or administration is executed or come so 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:21.210
 and here's a church moment yes and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:29.130
 the three buildings are all too 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:31.620
 illuminated as this also lit and 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.880
 the church is also lit in general 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.010
 I now have all the houses on the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:43.200
 plant lit and yes because of k system 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:47.310
 this is going to be here now 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.450
 small circle but only there 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.250
 I already have such a small one 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:58.830
 template for made moment i will show you 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:11.390
 Let's have a closer look at the pasta here 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:11.390
 I can just put it on the moment 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:24.380
 that's what they are about 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.810
 come here because that happens 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.600
 Matura rat simply pass the cars 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.840
 a bit in a circle and here in 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.620
 In the middle then are still small animals 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.250
 are the somehow experience or something 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.600
 no idea 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.710
 In any case, that works 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.890
 somehow everything is not right yet 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.080
 I have to revise that again and 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.730
 yes I have all the houses with me now 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.650
 that is, every house is provided with light 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.940
 the number was on lights except for that 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.100
 soft spot center here 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.390
 Rear interlocking 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.030
 that can not shine but otherwise 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.770
 All houses can shine and have that 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:07.040
 I here my two light controller 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.690
 Made here you can see the right one 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.630
 different houses build on two 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.860
 different houses 2 the burning house 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:19.310
 has two functions of farmers and 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.270
 So there is one and there above 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.290
 the small one and the house on the right 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:31.550
 is that has its own light yes 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:34.570
 that's what it was and then until then 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.570
 next time bye
