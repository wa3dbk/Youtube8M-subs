00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.910
 two clubs that make their debut in the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.309
 São Paulo soccer has the structures 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.529
 doors with seven years of foundation 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 the red bull has its own ts in it 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.539
 level of corinthians and palm trees are 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.080
 Paulo 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.279
 already the capivariano and 96 years of foundation 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.109
 does not have a ct 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.460
 the team trains in their own stadium 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.789
 who has been retired to the championship 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.789
 paulista 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.030
 we have today a structure 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 privileged said but our opinion 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.440
 You will have some fields in the city right 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.719
 champion does not yet have a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.340
 training since the age of 14 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.260
 when the athlete signed a contract of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.960
 training to the professional 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.110
 all have the same infrastructure 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 a future project in you 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.180
 We hope to have somebody there. 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.039
 some areas in the city that we 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.109
 used for this training 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.390
 are four official training camps 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.449
 structure of locker rooms medical part 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.180
 part was formed housing school of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.619
 English restaurant finally to all that the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.869
 people need to do the work in 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.720
 high level the red bull makes available 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.110
 but today is the majority of the preparation is 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.090
 done here except when we are 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 an inter season stays in some other 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.040
 place that gives us this condition of 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.040
 training 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720
 tomorrow 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.910
 the medium-term objective is to close the year 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.130
 in the Brazilian series c and in the series a-1 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.620
 faces first goal of any 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.750
 inside the team is staying right to 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.240
 that we have to make a good paulista 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.970
 classified from the first phase to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.369
 then understand how it is the way 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 to the vacancy in series d in which the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.930
 first year the championship is 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.510
 structuring one was easy but I think 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.190
 remaining in the first division 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.500
 subsequently to obtain a vacancy in the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.290
 d series is already a big achievement 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.750
 living step step the next goal is 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.150
 win the capivariano Saturday that our 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.590
 premiere is to be able to start a 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.340
 walk that enables us 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.340
 to rank 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.989
 I have sponsors. 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.129
 most are from the city today in the first 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.920
 We are having some 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:35.830
 sponsors outside the city who 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.489
 saw in the brand a possibility of 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.579
 something bigger 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.159
 so we do not talk about values ​​that 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.930
 We do not have club policy. 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.930
 do not deal with financial amounts 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.450
 ae 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.840
 I
