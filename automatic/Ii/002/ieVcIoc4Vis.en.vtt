00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.020 
store but face-to-face in a fun
environment<00:04:52.100> we<00:04:53.100> believe<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.460> without

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
environment we believe that without

environment we believe that without
charging<00:04:54.630> an<00:04:54.720> admission<00:04:55.139> fee<00:04:55.380> there's<00:04:55.830> more

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
charging an admission fee there's more

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.830 
charging an admission fee there's more
likely<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.760> be<00:04:56.880> more<00:04:57.090> people<00:04:57.479> who<00:04:57.630> come

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
likely to be more people who come

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.629 
likely to be more people who come
through<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.229> gates<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:59.250> gives<00:04:59.430> these

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
through the gates and it gives these

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.100 
through the gates and it gives these
rescue<00:05:00.030> groups<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:00.570> shelters<00:05:00.930> an

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
rescue groups and shelters an

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.170 
rescue groups and shelters an
opportunity<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.889> educate<00:05:02.010> more<00:05:02.490> people<00:05:02.550> and

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
opportunity to educate more people and

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.830 
opportunity to educate more people and
what<00:05:03.690> we<00:05:03.840> found<00:05:04.139> is<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.669> our<00:05:05.669> vendors<00:05:06.510> are

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
what we found is that our vendors are

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.529 
what we found is that our vendors are
selling<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.560> lot<00:05:08.010> more<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.669> as<00:05:08.970> are<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.330> rescue

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
selling a lot more and as are the rescue

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.870 
selling a lot more and as are the rescue
groups<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.260> are<00:05:10.380> demonstrating<00:05:11.190> there<00:05:11.700> are

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
groups that are demonstrating there are

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.029 
groups that are demonstrating there are
goods<00:05:12.150> at<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.780> event<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:13.320> they're<00:05:13.710> actually

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
goods at the event that they're actually

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.860 
goods at the event that they're actually
selling<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.580> lot<00:05:14.789> more<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.389> think<00:05:15.419> it's

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
selling a lot more and I think it's

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.360 
selling a lot more and I think it's
probably<00:05:16.229> because<00:05:16.470> there<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:17.010> no<00:05:17.190> admission

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
probably because there is no admission

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.140 
probably because there is no admission
fee<00:05:17.669> and<00:05:18.650> there's<00:05:19.650> just<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.280> dog<00:05:20.490> walk<00:05:20.789> where

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
fee and there's just the dog walk where

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.000 
fee and there's just the dog walk where
we<00:05:21.300> kick<00:05:21.479> it<00:05:21.630> off<00:05:21.750> at<00:05:21.960> noon<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.470> we<00:05:22.590> actually
