00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.790
 nice girl i'm at who's not 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.280
 and today as I have already warned you in 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.380
 my previous video I want to talk to you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.750
 of a film that has the dinosaurs of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.369
 one of the most body production houses 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.670
 always the one hundred million asylum 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.730
 I said the dinosaur war a movie 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.380
 science fiction that disappointed me not 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.240
 little 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.240
 now you wonder, it's such a thing 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:41.730
 why disappointed if you make a shape 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.760
 just bullshit 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.520
 we'll get after unoccupied 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.570
 meanwhile we start talking about the plot 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.910
 the film is about a scientist and goes to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.320
 save his friends trapped in the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.020
 past and more precisely around 70 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.979
 millions forward christ 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.410
 if you have understood the protagonists well 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.590
 they go back in time up to 70 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.600
 million forward christ and the movie yes 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.400
 entitled one hundred million put 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.900
 something like 100 million antichrist does 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.560
 I think a little so there are only 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.780
 how many 30 million years of difference 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.970
 and that will never be 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.600
 but let's keep this very small 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.730
 problem and let's move on 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 after finding the companions they return to the 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.060
 obviously present but with gold it goes 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.920
 also a dinosaur that once there 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.340
 combines casinos then the plot below 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.909
 many views is enough 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.220
 pathetic to say true the first part for 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.909
 something that 's already enough 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.650
 acceptable while the second is 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.649
 truly a catastrophe to make you a 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:14.290
 example the beautiful dinosaurs there 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.989
 they show and emphasize beautiful 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.799
 you have seen what is more beautiful than 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.980
 these lizards probably all 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.660
 you are right but we go on people 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.510
 because the things they did to me 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.459
 really not angry yet 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.890
 unfortunately you end up in acting 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.370
 mediocre but ultimately 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.200
 who cares or at least at the beginning there is 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.630
 I did not even so much case by the way 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.930
 of the fact that everything else 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.110
 really done with the ass 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.100
 and then what is there to say about the ending well 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.850
 in many ways it's shit 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.310
 instead from other points of view 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:06.110
 no he always admits it 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.850
 beginning film scientist goes into the present 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.080
 or rather its counterpart of the years 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:16.310
 fifty and help his friends to send 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.510
 home the dinosaur a final 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.860
 completely by chance at least in my opinion e 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.510
 it's not over 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.480
 there is one last thing I did not understand 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.480
 how come the men who have been 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.740
 back in time on their return they have 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.710
 developed supernatural potential 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.660
 to give you an example, the super-speed la 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:44.360
 fucking super speed as possible 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.880
 how but have they really been back 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:53.150
 over time or I went to 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:55.790
 train on the planet then say caio 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.810
 Now let's get back to the question at the beginning 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.080
 video 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.540
 in what sense I was disappointed if 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:08.290
 this production house ergo the asylum 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.290
 it just creates garbage 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.570
 well the answer to tell the truth a lot 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.780
 simple because I saw jacques born 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.260
 or shark I see I don't know how it should be 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.520
 read but that movie was yes anyway 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.130
 ugly but exaggerated is there I say which ones 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.950
 go back to which director 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.910
 psychopath could never come into an idea 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:38.690
 similar is precisely for this reason me 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.160
 I enjoyed a casino seeing him not 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.740
 I never had so much fun 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.870
 watching a bad movie and 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.780
 consequently I had thought that the film of 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.800
 this movie house could 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.950
 even like them in their own way I didn't believe 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.169
 that they could shoot a similar dr 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.900
 rubbish or better a movie 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.080
 I rescued myself where the true spirit is lacking 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.469
 of the phylum as I call it 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.729
 it is not from that exaggeration conquered 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:15.229
 in jacques nest making it more like 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:20.029
 an involuntary trash then this movie 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:23.689
 I advise you that no more either 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:26.360
 lover the trash recommend this stuff 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.219
 so with this I conclude if the video 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.979
 you liked put it like it and if 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:33.259
 you want to subscribe to the channel if it is not there 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:37.039
 liked put I do not like but doing 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:39.680
 so ends makes it sad is an invitation 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.319
 especially to comment on why me 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.909
 interest your opinions on the films of 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.550
 I talk to you about 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:49.370
 and if you want to recommend someone, do it 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.889
 well with this I conclude and give you 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.050
 appointment in an upcoming video in which 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:57.830
 I will tell you about a video game that I 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:01.689
 I consider it too overrated for 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.689
 shock master system
