low<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:59.510> WWE<00:01:00.510> wrestling<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.859> we're

experiencing now I think that it's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.700 
experiencing now I think that it's
largely<00:01:06.960> due<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:08.060> new<00:01:09.060> PG<00:01:09.869> direction

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
largely due to this new PG direction

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
largely due to this new PG direction

making<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.260> impossible<00:02:28.820> for<00:02:29.820> adults<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.709> even

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
making it impossible for adults and even

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.380 
making it impossible for adults and even
people<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:33.959> their<00:02:34.170> high<00:02:34.470> teens<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:36.000> really<00:02:36.239> get

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
people in their high teens to really get

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
people in their high teens to really get
into<00:02:36.750> their<00:02:36.900> product<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:39.720> think<00:02:40.290> it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
into their product and I think it's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.809 
into their product and I think it's
going<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.650> suffer<00:02:41.120> ultimately<00:02:42.120> because<00:02:43.400> if<00:02:44.400> I

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
going to suffer ultimately because if I

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.479 
going to suffer ultimately because if I
have<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> kid<00:02:45.540> I'm<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.709> going<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.130> watching

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
have a kid I'm not going to be watching

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.180 
have a kid I'm not going to be watching
wrestling<00:02:47.970> with<00:02:48.390> my<00:02:48.720> kid<00:02:48.959> right<00:02:49.590> now<00:02:49.769> i'm<00:02:50.010> not

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
wrestling with my kid right now i'm not

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.509 
wrestling with my kid right now i'm not
i'm<00:02:50.459> not<00:02:50.489> going<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.030> tuning<00:02:51.359> in<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.600> WWE

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
i'm not going to be tuning in the WWE

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.520 
i'm not going to be tuning in the WWE
therefore<00:02:53.519> he<00:02:54.000> or<00:02:54.120> she<00:02:54.359> may<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.720> become<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.109> WWE

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
therefore he or she may not become a WWE

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.569 
therefore he or she may not become a WWE
fan<00:02:56.190> i<00:02:56.840> think<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.139> just<00:02:58.290> market<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:59.069> product

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
fan i think to just market the product

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:07.129 
fan i think to just market the product
for<00:03:00.510> kids<00:03:01.170> only<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:03.269> really<00:03:03.720> dumb<00:03:04.200> idea<00:03:06.139> you

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
for kids only is a really dumb idea you

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.080 
for kids only is a really dumb idea you
know<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.440> might<00:03:07.650> pay<00:03:07.889> off<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.430> two<00:03:08.880> or<00:03:09.060> three

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
know it might pay off for two or three

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.000 
know it might pay off for two or three
years<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.630> kid<00:03:09.930> might<00:03:10.139> get<00:03:10.319> into<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.769> really

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
years a kid might get into it really

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.699 
years a kid might get into it really
enjoy<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.609> but<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:12.569> they<00:03:12.840> grow<00:03:13.079> up<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:13.590> become

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
enjoy it but as they grow up and become

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.400 
enjoy it but as they grow up and become
more<00:03:13.889> wise<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.819> world<00:03:15.060> their<00:03:15.989> interest<00:03:16.260> is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
more wise to the world their interest is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.050 
more wise to the world their interest is
probably<00:03:16.739> going<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:16.980> taper<00:03:17.220> off<00:03:17.400> because<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
probably going to taper off because the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.780 
probably going to taper off because the
products<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.630> watered<00:03:19.019> down<00:03:19.639> you<00:03:20.639> know<00:03:20.760> I'm

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.810 
products so watered down you know I'm
not<00:03:21.060> some<00:03:21.930> bloodthirsty<00:03:22.319> wrestling<00:03:23.280> fan<00:03:23.579> but

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
not some bloodthirsty wrestling fan but

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.690 
not some bloodthirsty wrestling fan but
at<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> same<00:03:24.329> time

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
at the same time

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.030 
at the same time
and<00:03:24.819> I<00:03:25.120> find<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.810> really<00:03:25.989> hard<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.440> swallow<00:03:26.830> a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.940 
and I find it really hard to swallow a
pill<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:28.300> hell<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.110> cell<00:03:29.140> event<00:03:29.680> where

turned<00:06:31.530> I<00:06:31.710> tuned<00:06:31.980> in<00:06:32.160> and<00:06:32.280> I'm<00:06:32.400> like<00:06:32.430> this<00:06:32.760> is

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
turned I tuned in and I'm like this is

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.630 
turned I tuned in and I'm like this is
the<00:06:33.090> most<00:06:33.270> trashiest<00:06:33.870> horrible<00:06:34.640> television

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
the most trashiest horrible television

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.480 
the most trashiest horrible television
that<00:06:35.790> anyone<00:06:36.150> can<00:06:36.300> ever<00:06:36.510> possibly<00:06:36.780> watch<00:06:37.490> I've

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
that anyone can ever possibly watch I've

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.700 
that anyone can ever possibly watch I've
noticed<00:06:38.910> that<00:06:39.000> the<00:06:39.120> in-ring<00:06:39.630> action<00:06:39.840> of<00:06:40.260> TNA

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
noticed that the in-ring action of TNA

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.060 
noticed that the in-ring action of TNA
has<00:06:41.090> improved<00:06:42.090> maybe<00:06:42.450> it's<00:06:42.660> just<00:06:42.780> me<00:06:43.230> but<00:06:43.500> I

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
has improved maybe it's just me but I

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.250 
has improved maybe it's just me but I
think<00:06:44.550> that<00:06:44.610> the<00:06:44.880> actual<00:06:45.300> wrestling<00:06:45.810> matches

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
think that the actual wrestling matches

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.770 
think that the actual wrestling matches
have<00:06:46.740> gotten<00:06:47.130> a<00:06:47.220> lot<00:06:47.370> better<00:06:47.670> and<00:06:48.090> you<00:06:48.660> know

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
have gotten a lot better and you know

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.050 
have gotten a lot better and you know
frankly<00:06:49.200> I'm<00:06:49.560> in<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:49.860> to<00:06:49.890> watch<00:06:50.190> the<00:06:50.640> wrestling

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
frankly I'm in it to watch the wrestling

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.180 
frankly I'm in it to watch the wrestling
matches<00:06:51.360> you<00:06:51.780> know<00:06:51.900> the<00:06:52.020> backstage<00:06:52.470> drama<00:06:52.800> and

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
matches you know the backstage drama and

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.740
