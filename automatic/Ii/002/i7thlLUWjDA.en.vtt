00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
monolith ziggurat pyramid thing that I'm

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.580 
monolith ziggurat pyramid thing that I'm
standing<00:05:53.960> on<00:05:54.080> right<00:05:54.469> now<00:05:54.879> for<00:05:55.879> quite<00:05:56.029> a<00:05:56.060> while

the<00:05:57.590> idea<00:05:57.680> with<00:05:58.009> this<00:05:58.159> is<00:05:58.969> it's<00:05:59.270> are<00:05:59.569> going<00:05:59.779> up

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
the idea with this is it's are going up

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.659 
the idea with this is it's are going up
and<00:05:59.960> down<00:06:00.110> I'll<00:06:00.770> figure<00:06:01.099> out<00:06:01.189> how<00:06:01.279> to<00:06:01.400> get<00:06:01.490> that

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
and down I'll figure out how to get that

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.300 
and down I'll figure out how to get that
working<00:06:02.020> soon<00:06:03.020> there's<00:06:03.860> gonna<00:06:04.009> be<00:06:04.189> another

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
working soon there's gonna be another

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.399 
working soon there's gonna be another
one<00:06:04.400> there<00:06:04.610> that<00:06:04.669> else<00:06:04.819> goes<00:06:05.029> up<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.330> down<00:06:05.409> um

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
one there that else goes up and down um

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.360 
one there that else goes up and down um

like man this just looks evil and gonna
have<00:06:15.770> to<00:06:15.860> change<00:06:16.099> its<00:06:16.310> use<00:06:16.490> looks<00:06:17.000> like<00:06:17.150> go

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
have to change its use looks like go

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.820

with<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.389> dragon<00:06:17.779> in<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.900> background<00:06:18.289> so

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
with the dragon in the background so

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.589 
with the dragon in the background so
I'll<00:06:18.889> just<00:06:18.979> jump<00:06:19.039> down<00:06:19.400> and<00:06:19.669> you<00:06:20.210> know<00:06:20.300> get<00:06:20.569> a

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
I'll just jump down and you know get a

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.390 
I'll just jump down and you know get a
nice<00:06:20.719> view<00:06:20.930> of<00:06:21.050> it<00:06:21.199> this<00:06:21.830> could<00:06:22.039> be<00:06:22.189> a<00:06:22.219> long

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
nice view of it this could be a long

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.850 
nice view of it this could be a long
fall<00:06:22.750> now<00:06:23.750> one<00:06:23.960> person<00:06:24.139> pointed<00:06:24.620> out<00:06:24.710> in<00:06:24.800> the

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
fall now one person pointed out in the

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.619 
fall now one person pointed out in the
forum<00:06:25.189> that<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.939> stuff<00:06:26.120> I<00:06:26.210> make<00:06:26.389> looks

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629 
forum that the stuff I make looks

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.269 
forum that the stuff I make looks
nothing<00:06:26.839> like<00:06:26.990> the<00:06:27.110> render<00:06:27.529> and<00:06:27.800> that's

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:28.279 
nothing like the render and that's

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.159 
nothing like the render and that's
understandable<00:06:28.819> the<00:06:29.300> reason<00:06:29.569> being<00:06:29.719> is<00:06:29.960> I

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
understandable the reason being is I

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.350 
understandable the reason being is I
haven't<00:06:30.439> actually<00:06:30.710> made<00:06:31.069> a<00:06:31.129> shader<00:06:31.490> yet<00:06:31.849> I've

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
haven't actually made a shader yet I've

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.360 
haven't actually made a shader yet I've
encoded<00:06:32.870> it<00:06:32.990> for<00:06:33.439> the<00:06:33.500> way<00:06:33.620> I<00:06:33.889> wanted<00:06:34.219> to

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
encoded it for the way I wanted to

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.249 
encoded it for the way I wanted to
appear<00:06:34.669> or<00:06:35.240> to<00:06:35.389> make<00:06:35.509> it<00:06:35.629> look<00:06:35.779> similar<00:06:35.990> to<00:06:36.229> a

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
appear or to make it look similar to a

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.019 
appear or to make it look similar to a
blender<00:06:36.620> render<00:06:36.740> right<00:06:37.490> now<00:06:37.610> I'm<00:06:37.699> just<00:06:37.879> using

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:38.029 
blender render right now I'm just using

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:40.570 
blender render right now I'm just using
two<00:06:38.419> shading<00:06:38.919> but<00:06:39.919> honestly<00:06:40.159> I<00:06:40.219> really<00:06:40.339> like

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
two shading but honestly I really like

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.429 
two shading but honestly I really like
the<00:06:40.669> toon<00:06:40.849> shader<00:06:40.879> so<00:06:41.240> I'm<00:06:41.930> not<00:06:42.110> sure<00:06:42.169> what<00:06:42.379> I'm

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:42.439 
the toon shader so I'm not sure what I'm

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:44.379 
the toon shader so I'm not sure what I'm
gonna<00:06:42.529> do<00:06:42.830> in<00:06:42.979> the<00:06:43.099> end<00:06:43.250> but<00:06:44.000> this<00:06:44.180> is<00:06:44.330> the

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
gonna do in the end but this is the

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:45.939 
gonna do in the end but this is the
thing<00:06:44.509> you<00:06:44.629> just<00:06:44.750> watch<00:06:44.899> we<00:06:45.020> make<00:06:45.199> how<00:06:45.860> much

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
thing you just watch we make how much

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.700 
thing you just watch we make how much
guys<00:06:46.159> think<00:06:46.449> if<00:06:47.449> you<00:06:47.569> noticed<00:06:47.899> you<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.289> the

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
guys think if you noticed you the the

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.439 
guys think if you noticed you the the
red<00:06:48.889> comes<00:06:49.310> down<00:06:49.520> a<00:06:49.550> little<00:06:49.729> bit<00:06:49.879> down<00:06:50.060> here

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
red comes down a little bit down here

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.959 
red comes down a little bit down here
it's<00:06:50.930> because<00:06:51.139> I<00:06:51.229> had<00:06:51.349> aid<00:06:51.529> decimate<00:06:52.490> modifier

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:52.969 
it's because I had aid decimate modifier

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:55.029 
it's because I had aid decimate modifier
which<00:06:53.479> I<00:06:53.659> didn't<00:06:53.960> before<00:06:54.259> I<00:06:54.289> stopped<00:06:54.889> the

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 
which I didn't before I stopped the

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.010 
which I didn't before I stopped the
