00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
piece of what you enjoy the wine is the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.499 
piece of what you enjoy the wine is the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to aerate get oxygen into the wine so

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.770 
to aerate get oxygen into the wine so
you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.340> better<00:01:47.490> smell<00:01:48.030> those<00:01:48.210> aromas<00:01:48.600> and
