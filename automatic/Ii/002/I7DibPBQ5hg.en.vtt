look<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.829> now's<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> time<00:01:59.460> when

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
look like you know now's the time when

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.030 
look like you know now's the time when
we<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.030> look<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> different<00:02:00.840> options<00:02:01.290> so

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
we can look at the different options so

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.880 
we can look at the different options so
you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.880> history<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:03.899> shown<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.439> darker

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
you know history has shown the darker

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.270 
you know history has shown the darker
color<00:02:05.130> cause<00:02:05.520> tend<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.810> little<00:02:07.280> more

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
color cause tend to have a little more

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.449 
color cause tend to have a little more
percussion<00:02:09.030> e<00:02:09.119> sound<00:02:09.450> where<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.560> more<00:02:10.830> blonde

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
percussion e sound where the more blonde

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.119 
percussion e sound where the more blonde
or<00:02:11.790> traditional<00:02:12.420> orange<00:02:12.930> red<00:02:13.319> color<00:02:13.349> cause

more<00:02:17.010> resonant<00:02:17.640> sustained<00:02:18.180> sound<00:02:18.629> so<00:02:19.230> looking

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
more resonant sustained sound so looking

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.320 
more resonant sustained sound so looking
at<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.830> different<00:02:20.190> woods<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:21.030> see

at the different woods here we can see

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.059 
at the different woods here we can see
you<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:21.989> once<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.319> come<00:02:22.500> across<00:02:22.769> something

process<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.340> when<00:03:20.549> we<00:03:20.669> cut<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.120> wood<00:03:21.299> we<00:03:21.510> kept

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
process so when we cut the wood we kept

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.020 
process so when we cut the wood we kept
it<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.049> order<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.620> how<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.250> came<00:03:23.430> off<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
it in order of how it came off of the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.900 
it in order of how it came off of the
original<00:03:24.419> block<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.349> aids<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.950> ensuring

original block and that aids in ensuring

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.240 
original block and that aids in ensuring
that<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.419> get<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:28.019> nice<00:03:28.290> symmetrical<00:03:28.980> grain

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
that we get that nice symmetrical grain

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.640 
that we get that nice symmetrical grain
so<00:03:29.940> there's<00:03:30.180> great<00:03:30.480> care<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.870> I'll<00:03:31.200> give<00:03:31.410> to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.990 
second ago it's gonna allow me to glue
that<00:03:45.810> edge<00:03:46.169> and<00:03:46.470> make<00:03:47.160> sure<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.609> that's<00:03:47.849> has

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
that edge and make sure that that's has

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.259 
that edge and make sure that that's has
a<00:03:48.030> nice<00:03:48.359> tight<00:03:49.040> seamless<00:03:50.040> joint<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:51.060> now

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
a nice tight seamless joint and now

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.610 
a nice tight seamless joint and now
we'll<00:03:51.449> go<00:03:51.599> ahead<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:51.840> let<00:03:52.109> this<00:03:52.319> sit

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
we'll go ahead and let this sit

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.309 
we'll go ahead and let this sit
overnight<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.639> allow<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.910> glue<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.329> set<00:03:54.989> up

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
overnight to allow the glue to set up

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.589 
overnight to allow the glue to set up
properly<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.010> then<00:03:56.549> tomorrow<00:03:56.760> continue<00:03:57.480> on

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
properly and then tomorrow continue on

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.619 
properly and then tomorrow continue on
with<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.959> sanding<00:03:58.379> process<00:03:59.359> okay<00:04:00.359> now<00:04:00.540> I'm

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
with the sanding process okay now I'm

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.420 
with the sanding process okay now I'm
gonna<00:04:00.780> go<00:04:00.989> ahead<00:04:01.199> and<00:04:01.319> put<00:04:01.470> together<00:04:01.620> our<00:04:02.010> set

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
gonna go ahead and put together our set

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.210 
gonna go ahead and put together our set
which<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> color<00:04:03.299> matched<00:04:03.629> front<00:04:04.379> back<00:04:04.980> and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
which is a color matched front back and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.119 
which is a color matched front back and
sides<00:04:05.699> and<00:04:06.090> prepare<00:04:06.750> them<00:04:06.959> for<00:04:06.989> assembly<00:04:07.709> so

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
sides and prepare them for assembly so

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.270 
sides and prepare them for assembly so
I'll<00:04:08.250> go<00:04:08.430> ahead<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:10.040> labeled<00:04:11.040> each

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
I'll go ahead and I labeled each

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.979 
I'll go ahead and I labeled each
instrument<00:04:11.849> cuz<00:04:12.180> each<00:04:12.299> instrument<00:04:12.690> is

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
instrument cuz each instrument is

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.349 
instrument cuz each instrument is
numbered<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:13.650> went<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.459> put<00:04:14.639> it<00:04:14.790> together<00:04:14.940> as

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
numbered I went and put it together as

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.240 
numbered I went and put it together as
you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.540> see<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.139> color<00:04:16.410> match<00:04:16.709> set<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
you can see it's a color match set the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.279 
you can see it's a color match set the
front<00:04:17.489> back<00:04:17.699> in<00:04:17.910> sides<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.539> we'll<00:04:18.989> take<00:04:19.109> it

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
front back in sides and we'll take it

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.930 
front back in sides and we'll take it
over<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.500> assembly<00:04:20.099> and<00:04:20.219> start<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.579> building

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
over to assembly and start the building

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.089 
over to assembly and start the building
process<00:04:21.120> what<00:04:21.959> we'll<00:04:22.109> do<00:04:22.229> initially<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.770> do<00:04:23.070> a

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
process what we'll do initially is do a

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.350 
process what we'll do initially is do a
rosette<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:23.789> late

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
rosette in late

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.520 
rosette in late
and<00:04:24.449> this<00:04:24.720> really<00:04:24.870> depends<00:04:25.349> on<00:04:25.409> the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
and this really depends on the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.619 
and this really depends on the
instrument<00:04:26.069> if<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.699> instrument<00:04:26.970> calls<00:04:27.360> for

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 
instrument if the instrument calls for

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:29.330 
instrument if the instrument calls for
rosette<00:04:28.020> inlay<00:04:28.319> we'll<00:04:28.770> do<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.009> at<00:04:29.129> this

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
rosette inlay we'll do it at this

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.119 
rosette inlay we'll do it at this
station<00:04:29.879> this<00:04:30.629> is<00:04:30.689> a<00:04:30.870> completed<00:04:31.409> rosette<00:04:31.979> and

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 
station this is a completed rosette and

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.950 
station this is a completed rosette and
what<00:04:32.669> we've<00:04:32.819> done<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.240> we've<00:04:33.479> routed<00:04:33.719> a

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
what we've done is we've routed a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.350 
what we've done is we've routed a
channel<00:04:34.439> which<00:04:34.919> allow<00:04:35.250> us<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.669> actually<00:04:35.879> do<00:04:36.240> an

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
channel which allow us to actually do an

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.439 
channel which allow us to actually do an
inlay<00:04:36.810> or<00:04:37.020> well<00:04:37.469> we'll<00:04:37.650> in<00:04:37.919> set<00:04:38.250> each<00:04:38.729> piece<00:04:38.789> of

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
inlay or well we'll in set each piece of

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.740 
inlay or well we'll in set each piece of
Pawa<00:04:40.289> abalone<00:04:40.860> along<00:04:41.669> with<00:04:41.969> what<00:04:42.389> we<00:04:42.419> call<00:04:42.719> a

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
Pawa abalone along with what we call a

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.619 
Pawa abalone along with what we call a

but<00:04:48.180> rosette<00:04:48.599> is<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.780> decorative<00:04:49.319> inlay<00:04:49.949> it

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219 
but rosette is a decorative inlay it

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.010 
but rosette is a decorative inlay it
doesn't<00:04:50.639> enhance<00:04:50.909> the<00:04:51.180> sound<00:04:51.419> but<00:04:51.719> it<00:04:51.840> does

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
doesn't enhance the sound but it does

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.249 
doesn't enhance the sound but it does
add<00:04:52.289> Beauty<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.370> final<00:04:53.729> instrument<00:04:54.270> once

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
add Beauty to the final instrument once

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.189 
add Beauty to the final instrument once
the<00:04:55.409> rosette<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:55.979> done<00:04:56.219> the<00:04:56.969> front<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.509> back

actually split up from the sides the
fronts<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:01.800> backs<00:05:01.889> will<00:05:02.250> go<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.430> where

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
fronts and backs will go to where

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.850 
fronts and backs will go to where
they're<00:05:02.849> bracing<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.389> put<00:05:03.599> on<00:05:03.719> the<00:05:04.289> sides<00:05:04.620> will

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
they're bracing is put on the sides will

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.100 
they're bracing is put on the sides will
go<00:05:04.949> to<00:05:05.009> side<00:05:05.430> bending<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.629> way<00:05:06.780> that<00:05:06.990> we

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
go to side bending and the way that we

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.309 
go to side bending and the way that we
do<00:05:07.349> our<00:05:07.500> side<00:05:07.800> bending<00:05:08.219> is<00:05:08.539> with<00:05:09.539> a<00:05:09.750> rubberized

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
do our side bending is with a rubberized

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.680 
do our side bending is with a rubberized
heating<00:05:10.949> blanket<00:05:11.159> and<00:05:11.610> what<00:05:11.969> that<00:05:12.150> rubberized

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
heating blanket and what that rubberized

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.709 
heating blanket and what that rubberized
heating<00:05:13.110> blanket<00:05:13.289> does<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:14.370> allows<00:05:14.759> us<00:05:15.120> to

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
heating blanket does it allows us to

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:21.260 
heating blanket does it allows us to
heat<00:05:15.990> up<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.289> wood<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:18.319> get<00:05:19.319> it<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.590> about<00:05:20.270> 300

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
heat up the wood and get it to about 300

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.269 
heat up the wood and get it to about 300
degrees<00:05:21.659> and<00:05:21.930> a<00:05:22.020> little<00:05:22.289> under<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.620> minute<00:05:22.889> and

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
degrees and a little under a minute and

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:28.369 
degrees and a little under a minute and
that<00:05:24.120> heating<00:05:24.659> action<00:05:25.229> allows<00:05:26.189> us<00:05:26.550> to<00:05:27.379> lightly

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
that heating action allows us to lightly

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.700 
that heating action allows us to lightly
miss<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.219> wood<00:05:29.629> which<00:05:30.629> will<00:05:30.930> of<00:05:31.080> course<00:05:31.319> allow

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
miss the wood which will of course allow

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.129 
miss the wood which will of course allow
the<00:05:31.770> wood<00:05:32.069> to<00:05:32.190> become<00:05:32.520> pliable<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.360> then<00:05:33.960> it

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
the wood to become pliable and then it

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.260 
the wood to become pliable and then it
will<00:05:34.289> allow<00:05:34.500> us<00:05:34.529> to<00:05:34.860> bend<00:05:35.129> the<00:05:35.310> wood<00:05:35.490> into<00:05:35.789> its

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
will allow us to bend the wood into its

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.659 
will allow us to bend the wood into its
final<00:05:36.690> shape<00:05:36.800> you'll<00:05:37.800> notice<00:05:38.099> that<00:05:38.279> the<00:05:38.430> jig

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
final shape you'll notice that the jig

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.930 
final shape you'll notice that the jig
actually<00:05:39.120> represents<00:05:39.900> half<00:05:40.529> of<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:41.550> ukulele
