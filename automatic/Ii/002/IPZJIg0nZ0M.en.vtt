00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.189
 You played a really great first game, but I would like to talk about the 2nd game, because the first game was very concise 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:08.820
 and so 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.320
 What happened there? Because Twisted Fate did not work at all. 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 The problem is, TF is not a good pick against Fizz 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.380
 is really bad online but you can play passive, control your farm 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.050
 and get ganks in other lines very easily, but I have not practiced TF in a while 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.679
 I did not really know how much damage I could do to him and how much he to me 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:30.410
 Y 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.230
 it was easy to kill me in 1c1, after that, it was not all finished but its setup was much 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.770
 best 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.930
 They had Rumble, Nocturne and Fizz, so they could jump on me or Puzsu very easily 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.500
 his setup was better and we lost the early so he 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.969
 the game was lost before the 20th minute 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.500
 Why did you select that setup when the first game with that setup went well? 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.570
 We had to try, as I said, if I had played Twisted fate 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.010
 better, I think we could have won the game 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.800
 because I died 1v1, Fizz took advantage of me, I could have farmed 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.090
 better than him to a certain point and having achieved some ganks easily 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.200
 but in the only gank I could do 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.930
 Varus survived so it was bad enough In a normal game where he would have found me more 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.850
 entrusted with twisted fate, I think I could have achieved 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.430
 one or two deaths at least with the teleport and if he had not died he could have stopped the Snowball 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.430
 for its part 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.340
 yes, I think our picks were decent in early but we did not play them 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.750
 as well as we should 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.900
 So, let's talk about the 3rd game. Do you think you stood out so much for 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.930
 your experience in those picks? 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.100
 I do not know, a little maybe 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.540
 we did not come down, we were calm 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.860
 we had first pick, we could pick up the same as in the first game. 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.600
 and we did it, we picketed Kassadin ... people who worked well with him 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.930
 we needed a good team, to start, to do counter engage, and that's what we did 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.250
 and after that battle at level 1 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.110
 the game was quite in our favor, that level one was very good 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.930
 we achieved two deaths and take a great advantage 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.960
 we just needed to not throw and throw the game, which is very easy normally 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.229
 making a throw is pretty easy for anyone 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.290
 Next round, you will face against Royal 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.560
 u OMG, surely there is something inside you that says: 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.110
 "I just want to become champion again!" 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.680
 Of course, I think we currently have a lot of chances against either of those two teams 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.810
 anyway the team that I'm most worried about is SK Telecom T1 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.379
 but against the rest of the teams I think we have a lot of chances 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.910
 they are not better than 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.879
 Cloud 9, they are a good team and I think Royal or OMG will play 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:27.410
 similar to them 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.110
 maybe a little more crazy, because they play aggressively all the time, besides that 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.269
 they are a very strong team 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.480
 so if we could beat C9 I think we can defeat the rest 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.459
 finally, I know that a lot of the public supported C9, so 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.720
 you should say something to your fans 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.890
 ok, then to that with the Fnatic banner, and to that other, only two fans 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.819
 To all those who support Fnatic at any time 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.819
 thanks for being there 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.959
 Thank you very much, congratulations
