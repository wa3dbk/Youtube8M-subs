00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.199
 social technology parents 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.970
 agroecological production in full and sustainable 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.670
 more food still working in the field 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.649
 jack straw 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.649
 etc this 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.380
 this video will deal with the fourth stage of technology deployment in the country 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.340
 the construction of the chicken coop 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
 the galleys located in the center of the screen 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.730
 it initially receives from this region car it is formed and serve for 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.390
 produce the cost of gas for the producer is mainly the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.390
 that will not be used 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.030
 the construction is very simple after the placement of eight stakes will be used 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.360
 a wire mesh to close the sides 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.659
 two stakes 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.849
 will serve to support the door of the chicken coop 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.110
 the other six 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.520
 will be distributed in full and form to support the tutelage of the river 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.670
 black 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.470
 the coverage of Brazilians will be made by the producer himself using material 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.470
 available on property 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.580
 the site will be formed with dry grass with foliage available to receive 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.630
 organic compounds of the hens so the farmer will have as 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.370
 for the beds made in the property 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.460
 the chicken coop 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.930
 Also, troughs and drinkers available in the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 made by the producer 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.810
 social technology parents is integrated 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.350
 combine breeding with vegetables growing vegetables 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.220
 fruits 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.390
 and still uses inputs available on the property 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.819
 to fertilize the soil 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.999
 and control pests 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:15.339
 but remember to reduce the use of inputs from outside the property 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.299
 makes the farmer more independent 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.299
 so this is the country 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:37.489
 because we are moving from being public policy consultants to 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.300
 turn over 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.099
 political project 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.829
 although technology leaves 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.709
 from the bottom up 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.709
 we turned 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.719
 policymakers 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.409
 social technology 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.699
 parents 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.069
 more food, the labor income in the field
