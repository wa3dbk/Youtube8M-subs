00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:14.129
 The second love from the end is okay, because my brother doesn't have to worry and that Sakaguchi Kenji plays Nagakura's father 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:16.260
 Because two digits do not I run away because it is from a like fate guy because I do not run away 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.590
 I'm not thinking I 'm going to quit 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.390
 I want to make sure I can live by myself anytime and anywhere 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.960
 Bearish to be bought bad results by pounding every time the inspection of day approaches is not it be informed 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.860
 Become 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.360
 The next inspection was relieved as the relieved tears exits in 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.150
 I'm waiting I was so sorry that my feelings turned backwards 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.650
 That's why I decided to quit 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:45.700
 I think it's gonna be another serious illness from I think I'm sick Well 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:51.850
 It seems like it's no wonder if it gets into a state of one's life 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:56.500
 Hey, as Shinpei-kun , who acts on various women if that 's why I can do it myself 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.170
 I to came out very much is whether Nenene colony say is showing a smile without discrimination 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.180
 Yeah 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:06.390
 That's not what I have here 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 Well brother or rather just quite not transmitted even the brothers It is the Tteyuu such feelings 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:19.110
 That's why it 's better to know than to say, even if it is against such thoughts 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.170
 Live longer and want and so eventually to the peace of the brother recruits know to walk in my feelings 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.979
 Passed through'm not 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:29.730
 I like vomiting such words as urine jelly 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:32.730
 It may be the real figure of the side 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:38.490
 With respect to this Yakudotoro to Chinami in 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:41.910
 Kenji Sakaguchi, who plays the Nagakura rookie himself, is interviewed on the official site anyway 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 I feel that I am playing a living human after a long time 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.600
 Every character is so dark, but various changes occur and say 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:55.090
 I grow up and eat myself while playing 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.500
 There are some keywords in the script or people who seem to be missing new recruits 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.479
 For example 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:06.909
 He has in the Love &amp; Peace Toka angel as Toka kind of image 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.590
 I wish I could create a calm atmosphere + I 'm not just at the center of the circle at university alone 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:15.110
 It is a standing position that is smiling at a distant place 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:20.209
 Of tomorrow in the man you are kana fullest fun living day-to-day I have maintained now in the image of 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.140
 It is also a man who is not very planative how to live happily today than things 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.400
 Though 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.610
 And a man who grabs a woman's heart only with a refreshing smile 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:35.040
 Not laugh much at Toka do is Iryu smile recruits theme is because 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.870
 Since I played the floor, I laughed for the first time in a long time and got the character and that part is important 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.260
 I want to go on 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.360
 Say it from the work specifically with adults of youth drama 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.270
 And it is not related to age and whether the three-part Toka do that is to say to like people Toka love 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.720
 I think 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:54.610
 I have to carry various things to become an adult 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.480
 So is really not'm so also can not be free to like a young age to say of my own 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.500
 How many times it is to find love is such a story that can be 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.260
 In the end, it's like living or oil 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.370
 Everyone is full, whether rich or otherwise 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.060
 I 'm going to leave it, but how should I face it then? 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.439
 Although it is a big theme in fact, it is also a matter of course 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:22.640
 In that sense, I think it's a drama that can feel many things 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.239
 It is a drama that has parts that apply to you, some of which make you aware again 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.250
 Or 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.730
 Characters come out towards Mr. Okada MegumiKazu everyone 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.980
 It's good, and every role has a finger 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:40.440
 Because I think it is someone who really values the words and thoughts of each one 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:45.150
 I think it will be a heartful drama where the warmth of the season becomes a part of it 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.870
 My brother Cha A word for peace that says nothing but correct 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.270
 Hey 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.610
 Star 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.380
 It seems that others are convinced . Well, as I grow up, I told her that it was true and correct. 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.910
 You must have 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.660
 So when I think when young but it is do come no Omoro because not Ya and Do to was interesting 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.750
 I mean 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:07.540
 Anyway, think about it and it will be true if all the spring people become adults 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.530
 So is also the inside out Dene Well 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:15.820
 That's why Yoshino Chiaki who plays KyonKyon is such 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.780
 I can't get up right now I can't understand anyone without makeup because it's 45 bullets 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.650
 I will be told 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.710
 I'm convinced that this means 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:30.410
 Also I thought that no one rises not When you wake up in the morning and I But apart from 45 or not I will convince Bach 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:33.770
 Oh, especially the makeup of today's young girl is something like a great cold gloomy or panda 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.240
 Is not there Toka Anna makeup contains Oke said Kaa also look Anna shot real face 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.670
 It's hard to understand 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.740
 The nets and games that have actually hit the industry 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.030
 There is also a story that it was stopped at the entrance of the television station because it was no makeup 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.770
 There is a thing 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:54.990
 When I saw that end of the century's face, who is it? 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:58.660
 I'm it is pleasing drama of witty exchanges around its also true in possession 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:04.289
 Koizumi Kyoko good child Naoko and Uchida Yuki I 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:10.169
 The combination of three actresses at 8 points is quite exquisite, isn't it? 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:14.189
 However, Yuki Uchida e が 軽 い It is light in my image, I say a little bit 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:17.279
 The is why I wonder if this is the role of Mr. Yuki Uchida Taｰ 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:22.590
 I wonder if I 'm not the only person of that other hype 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:29.160
 Triple guess I'd feels a say Oh village reservation something Editor's Note gold 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:32.730
 But the opposite is that Uchida Yuki is also a Sword and is different from the image of his youth 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:37.410
 The Rutteyuu Konasemasu to Fu This refers to Yakudotoro is 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.860
 I mean this is more fun ah ah my mother in the neighborhood of the year I mean 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.610
 Ne 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:47.030
 Even notice et al family that I have come up with Yuki Uchida when looking at the first round of broadcasting 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:50.510
 ｰｰｰthat had been saying When Te a right hand almost did not speak Well Ne' 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.650
 Ne I'm worried about it, but Mr. Nagaki 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:59.510
 Did not you say that it is Morifuji Erozan or money or history 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:03.190
 I guess I wasn't doing it right now, because I'm also approaching that year ago 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.370
 I'm also a little bit grass and wood Sassahan 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:11.490
 Surely confirmation is the second last love 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.490
 We want to see well from now on Yes
