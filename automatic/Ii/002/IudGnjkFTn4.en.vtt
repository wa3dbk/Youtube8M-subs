around in my cydia and i was looking in

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.820 
around in my cydia and i was looking in
the<00:00:06.210> recent<00:00:06.569> tab<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.049> i<00:00:07.230> seen<00:00:07.470> there<00:00:07.680> was<00:00:07.799> a

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
the recent tab and i seen there was a

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.419 
the recent tab and i seen there was a
new<00:00:07.980> application<00:00:08.450> called<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.719> top<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.280> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
new application called on top and it is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.910 
new application called on top and it is
basically<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:12.000> web<00:00:12.420> browser<00:00:12.690> for<00:00:13.559> your<00:00:13.590> iphone

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
basically a web browser for your iphone

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.279 
basically a web browser for your iphone
ipod<00:00:14.250> touch<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.780> me<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
ipod touch and for me this is a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.010 
ipod touch and for me this is a
replacement<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> Safari<00:00:17.990> web<00:00:18.990> browser

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
replacement to the Safari web browser

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.929 
replacement to the Safari web browser
and<00:00:19.590> actually<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.220> think<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.609> lot<00:00:20.789> better

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and actually I think it's a lot better

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.540 
and actually I think it's a lot better
as<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.350> every<00:00:22.650> place<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.369> where

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
as you can see every place this is where

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.089 
as you can see every place this is where
my<00:00:23.580> Safari<00:00:24.480> icon<00:00:24.930> used<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:25.830> have

out<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.120> picture<00:03:37.870> i<00:03:38.019> keep<00:03:38.230> looking<00:03:38.349> has<00:03:38.590> a

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
out of the picture i keep looking has a

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.650 
out of the picture i keep looking has a
glare<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.040> my<00:03:39.340> ipod<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.639> it's<00:03:39.849> aggravating<00:03:40.299> me

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
glare on my ipod and it's aggravating me

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.470 
glare on my ipod and it's aggravating me
now<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.920> thing<00:03:42.220> i<00:03:42.549> don't<00:03:42.609> really<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.209> this

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
now this thing i don't really like this

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.530 
now this thing i don't really like this
i<00:03:43.750> think<00:03:43.959> they<00:03:44.319> should<00:03:44.500> remove<00:03:44.769> this<00:03:45.540> pictures

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
i think they should remove this pictures

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.210 
i think they should remove this pictures
you<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:46.810> tap<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.079> picture<00:03:47.290> icon<00:03:47.590> and

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
you can tap the picture icon and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.620 
you can tap the picture icon and
basically<00:03:48.579> it<00:03:48.760> just<00:03:48.790> brings<00:03:49.090> up<00:03:49.269> your<00:03:49.419> seat

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
basically it just brings up your seat

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.750 
basically it just brings up your seat
photos<00:03:50.079> which<00:03:50.650> i've<00:03:50.859> only<00:03:51.010> got<00:03:51.190> screenshots

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
photos which i've only got screenshots

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.819 
photos which i've only got screenshots
so<00:03:52.239> I<00:03:52.269> didn't<00:03:52.690> really<00:03:52.720> like<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.109> I<00:03:53.530> don't<00:03:53.620> see

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
so I didn't really like that I don't see

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.129 
so I didn't really like that I don't see
why<00:03:54.040> you'd<00:03:54.250> want<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.489> look<00:03:54.549> at<00:03:54.730> pictures<00:03:55.139> in

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139

you can get sand and you can email notes
okay<00:04:23.020> i<00:04:23.169> thought<00:04:23.320> you<00:04:23.469> could<00:04:23.590> send<00:04:23.770> pictures

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
okay i thought you could send pictures

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.390 
okay i thought you could send pictures
of<00:04:24.130> that<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.640> then<00:04:24.969> obviously<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.750> can<00:04:25.930> email

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
of that and then obviously you can email

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.570 
of that and then obviously you can email
it's<00:04:27.169> okay<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.830> that's<00:04:29.070> basically<00:04:29.250> the

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
it's okay so that's basically the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.330 
it's okay so that's basically the
features<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.210> web<00:04:30.509> browser<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.190> really<00:04:32.190> like

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
features of web browser I really like

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.960 
features of web browser I really like
this<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.850> think<00:04:32.910> it's<00:04:33.210> better<00:04:33.540> than<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.970> Safari

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
this I think it's better than the Safari

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.150 
this I think it's better than the Safari
web<00:04:36.150> browser<00:04:36.180> at<00:04:36.690> least<00:04:36.870> for<00:04:37.050> me<00:04:37.199> some<00:04:37.949> things

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
web browser at least for me some things

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.439 
web browser at least for me some things
that<00:04:38.250> they<00:04:38.430> could<00:04:38.580> do<00:04:38.699> to<00:04:38.729> make<00:04:39.000> this<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.210> little

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
that they could do to make this a little

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.870 
that they could do to make this a little
better<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.870> add<00:04:40.080> bookmarks<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:41.009> don't<00:04:41.759> really

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
better is add bookmarks I don't really

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.600 
better is add bookmarks I don't really
use<00:04:42.150> bookmarks<00:04:42.600> necessarily<00:04:43.470> but<00:04:43.680> I'm<00:04:44.190> sure

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
use bookmarks necessarily but I'm sure

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.800 
use bookmarks necessarily but I'm sure
that<00:04:44.850> would<00:04:44.940> make<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.270> lot<00:04:45.300> better<00:04:45.419> for

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
that would make it a lot better for

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.730 
that would make it a lot better for
people<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.169> people<00:04:46.259> were<00:04:46.440> like<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.620> little
