00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.289

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.420

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.830

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.780
 very little butter even start to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.780

 What do you want to do? 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.360
 Salsa can do just a little bit 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.990
 because in the end we will add 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:33.640

 That's a lot of starting salad, you're going 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.909
 reach the oven and leave it separate 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.770

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.899

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.319
 after your name has started to get 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.649

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.190
 We'll put the sour cream and 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:42.100

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.890

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.370

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.370
 milk cream 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.910
 I'll put the cream well 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.530

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.530
 I got to the right place. 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.329
 OK 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:30.760

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.760
 Okay, you do not need to go. 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.500

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.030
 I can spice it up a bit 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.670
 with olive oil with some type of sauce and 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.840

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.840
 put an eye on him 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.560
