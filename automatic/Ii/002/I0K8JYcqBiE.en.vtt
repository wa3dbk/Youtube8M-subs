00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.919
 when I see it pirlo playing when I see it 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.780
 with the ball at his feet 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.910
 I wonder if I can be considered 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.740
 really a soccer player humility is part 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.969
 of the secrets of median gennaro gattuso 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.160
 legendary of the Milan and the national team 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 which embodies the story of how many champions 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
 do not measure themselves only by the feet and now that 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.199
 the shoes are hung on the nail has 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 embarked on a coaching career 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.699
 speaks a lot about benches and former comrades a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.349
 starting from the shake-up in Milan with 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.750
 the seedorf inzaghi handover 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.180
 for one I'm happy for the other 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.489
 sorry but it's part of the game does 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.079
 part of football even if create second 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.899
 he did a good job of not being 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.239
 in society I don't know the problems there 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.300
 they were between clarence and the club 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.300
 surely there were because they have 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.670
 have decided to send him away foo 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.329
 his greatest gift everyone thought of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.280
 when he played he was very lucky for 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.469
 a fortune if he sought it out because he was one 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 who has always studied opponents has 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.450
 always lived bread and football ancelotti 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.490
 lippi the trap many masters he has 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.840
 the former AC Milan midfielder could 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.640
 and it is he himself who speaks of the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 secret of carlet and news 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.189
 brought to the national team by the current ct 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.009
 Carlo proves it to this day 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.049
 at the end of the match in the 80's conference 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.210
 a hundred players go and hug him 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.979
 let him give it to me, I think it 's special 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.680
 on this he manages to get the best 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.210
 of ideas and its players 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.659
 really so many times it's played for 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.000
 he to prandelli to the merit of having 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.460
 changed the mentality of a bit 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.670
 of Italian football play plays a little 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.920
 the Spanish like I like a game 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.590
 technician likes to bring lots and lots 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.540
 attacking men play with a 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.070
 very technical midfield today I do 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.700
 always the example if I was there in this 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.710
 national 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.820
 I find it hard to find a place to 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.820
 holder because my features 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.570
 they are not good for how they want to play 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.060
 prandelli and in my opinion has the merit of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.640
 already raised the labels a little 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.340
 catenacciari and gennaro gattuso that 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.590
 coach i try to be myself e 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.560
 normal I have to do good in 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.780
 sense that I like a temper 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.230
 talk a lot about my players 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.230
 empower my players
