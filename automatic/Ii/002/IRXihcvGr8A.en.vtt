and that they need a shadow of their own

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.229 
and that they need a shadow of their own
what<00:01:03.080> they<00:01:03.230> mean<00:01:03.440> by<00:01:03.650> shadow<00:01:04.040> at<00:01:04.430> least<00:01:04.610> my<00:01:04.760> my

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
what they mean by shadow at least my my

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.810 
what they mean by shadow at least my my
interpretation<00:01:05.900> is<00:01:06.160> they<00:01:07.160> have<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> trader<00:01:07.730> on

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
interpretation is they have a trader on

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.620 
interpretation is they have a trader on
both<00:01:08.150> sides<00:01:08.480> and<00:01:09.520> my<00:01:10.520> guess<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:11.120> that<00:01:11.150> ghost

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
both sides and my guess is that ghost

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.330 
both sides and my guess is that ghost
was<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.200> traitor<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:12.770> guys<00:01:12.890> going<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.160> watch

him<00:01:46.369> because<00:01:46.910> he<00:01:47.060> says<00:01:47.240> they're<00:01:47.420> fighting<00:01:47.720> to

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
him because he says they're fighting to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.330 
him because he says they're fighting to
get<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:48.020> back<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.560> means<00:01:48.770> there's<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.979> traitor

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340
