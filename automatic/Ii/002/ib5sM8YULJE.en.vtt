kind of wanted it to work and the reason
for<00:00:55.750> that<00:00:55.900> is<00:00:56.260> all<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.680> affiliates<00:00:57.100> were<00:00:57.280> like

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
for that is all the affiliates were like

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.720 
for that is all the affiliates were like
they<00:00:57.730> were<00:00:57.790> killing<00:00:58.180> their<00:00:58.810> 11<00:00:59.260> o'clock<00:00:59.410> news

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
they were killing their 11 o'clock news

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.820 
they were killing their 11 o'clock news
because<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.850> 10<00:01:01.030> o'clock<00:01:01.150> it<00:01:01.930> NBC<00:01:02.590> didn't

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
because the 10 o'clock it NBC didn't

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.079 
because the 10 o'clock it NBC didn't
mind<00:01:03.010> having<00:01:03.160> lower<00:01:03.430> ratings<00:01:03.850> could<00:01:04.000> have

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
mind having lower ratings could have

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.989 
mind having lower ratings could have
because<00:01:04.390> Leno<00:01:04.629> cost<00:01:04.989> them<00:01:05.229> less<00:01:05.259> right<00:01:05.829> so<00:01:06.579> the

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:06.999 
because Leno cost them less right so the

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.819 
because Leno cost them less right so the
NBC<00:01:07.539> self<00:01:07.840> didn't<00:01:08.020> mind<00:01:08.170> but<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.380> affiliates

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
NBC self didn't mind but the affiliates

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.190 
NBC self didn't mind but the affiliates
were<00:01:08.950> getting<00:01:09.219> hammered<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.049> lower

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
were getting hammered because the lower

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.620 
were getting hammered because the lower
ratings<00:01:11.710> led<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.850> lower<00:01:13.060> ratings<00:01:13.390> for<00:01:13.539> their

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
ratings led to lower ratings for their

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.789 
ratings led to lower ratings for their
news<00:01:13.810> which<00:01:13.990> is<00:01:14.020> where<00:01:14.229> they<00:01:14.320> make<00:01:14.499> most<00:01:14.679> of

news which is where they make most of

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.919 
news which is where they make most of
their<00:01:14.920> money<00:01:14.979> right<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:16.450> there<00:01:16.780> was<00:01:16.899> a
