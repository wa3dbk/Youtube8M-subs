 I bring you this look for 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.880

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.650
 how can you dress up you know this 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.050
 is according to what you have in your 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.090
 closet or if you go shopping then more or 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.130
 least you can give an idea of â€‹â€‹what 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.960
 you can search but you already know that this 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.090
 It depends on each style so I hope 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.699
 that you like those ideas and money very 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.550
 suitable for December 31st I am 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.620
 using this striped blazer and by the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.290
 bottom part this short that is this way 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.110
 a very pretty super nice color very 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.060
 happy and on the bottom only 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.520
 I'm using a basic blouse 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.130
 black that you should not miss in your closet 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.739
 and to create a balance according to the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.410
 shape of my body add me this 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.750
 necklace since he extended me a little longer this 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.290
 part of here and take away the attention of 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.290
 shoulders 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 yes 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.079
 s 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.479
 in the makeup of the eyes that you 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.420
 I have neutral colors as always 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.729
 I love these types of shadows but 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.790
 the lips I decided to put a little more 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.909
 striking not with the typical red lipstick 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.130
 but with an orange one because we can not 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.460
 use strong colors also in this 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.460
 season 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.670
 yes 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.940
 s 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.980
 is inspired by the trend right now 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.900
 that is very fashionable that is to a 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.989
 picture 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.989
 and 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.780
 and 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.340
 this last boom of is my favorite for 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.550
 the part here I'm using this 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.320
 Super thick and warm scarf is from 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.410
 those that are called I think that infinity 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.570
 escarp that are spinning is super 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.790
 great but I love it because it's with 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.400
 trend of stripes and me the stripes me 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.470
 they go crazy and in the part of here I am 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.470
 using this sweater that is from jaycee 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.720
 pen and that's how a little big the 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.630
 green was the color of this year so 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.450
 It would be a nice way to dismiss the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.540
 2013 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.540
