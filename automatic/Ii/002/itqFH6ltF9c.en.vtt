00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.980
 Americanized, some venture to say 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.219
 that this hot dog is gourmet 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.100
 I ask you as a hot dog and it's 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.630
 so popular can become something gourmet 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.580
 this is what we will now see the name of 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 raul and she left through a project 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.349
 made with me three more brothers 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.980
 we were always in love with the dog 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.010
 lived in Cuba we work 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.790
 yes there we saw that niche 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.320
 here in brazil and ended up riding 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.930
 hot dog gourmet watchdog designs 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.539
 from the bread to the young girl sausages 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 exclusive our development 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.590
 Brazilian blog source is the dog 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.600
 hot as usual 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.780
 Unfortunately, here in Brazil, it has never had 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.170
 quality health care, then the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.820
 I looked for the vinaigrette for me going there 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.340
 are ingredients that have been created to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.490
 hide sausage then the people eat 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.250
 it gives a substance but it is not 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.409
 an original né the american hot dog is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.990
 totally the opposite it is a bread of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.220
 a sausage inlay of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.189
 quality and little sauce that we have 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.770
 a partnership with a refrigerator then 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.600
