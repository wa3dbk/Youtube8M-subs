00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.320 
yogurt shop that's five out of five I've
never<00:02:34.560> seen<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> barbie<00:02:35.700> shop<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.300> this

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
never seen a barbie shop like this

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.710 
never seen a barbie shop like this
before<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.739> really<00:02:38.190> cool<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.880> think<00:02:39.420> it's

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
before so it's really cool I think it's

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.140 
before so it's really cool I think it's
fun<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.890> use<00:02:41.310> play-doh<00:02:41.640> with<00:02:41.970> this

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
fun that you can use play-doh with this

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.229 
fun that you can use play-doh with this
set<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:43.320> make<00:02:43.680> your<00:02:43.890> own<00:02:44.070> frozen<00:02:44.550> yogurt<00:02:45.090> or

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
set and make your own frozen yogurt or

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.680 
set and make your own frozen yogurt or
ice<00:02:45.570> cream<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:47.580> place<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.150> did<00:02:48.420> include

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
ice cream this place that did include

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.220 
ice cream this place that did include
just<00:02:49.380> one<00:02:49.680> chair<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.540> worked<00:02:52.020> for

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
just one chair and if I worked for

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.110 
just one chair and if I worked for
Mattel<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.770> think<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.280> would<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.790> include

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
Mattel I think I would have it include

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.360 
Mattel I think I would have it include
two<00:02:54.360> chairs<00:02:54.720> because<00:02:54.989> it's<00:02:55.440> no<00:02:55.590> fun<00:02:55.620> just

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
two chairs because it's no fun just

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.900 
two chairs because it's no fun just
eating<00:02:56.610> frozen<00:02:57.390> yogurt<00:02:57.660> alone<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.890> think<00:02:59.400> also

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
eating frozen yogurt alone I think also

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.900 
eating frozen yogurt alone I think also
if<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.390> change<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.110> shop<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.680> went<00:03:02.070> at<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.310> maybe

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
if I change the shop I went at it maybe

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.090 
if I change the shop I went at it maybe
a<00:03:03.030> little<00:03:03.540> sprinkle<00:03:04.110> machine<00:03:04.530> or<00:03:04.739> something

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
a little sprinkle machine or something

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.070 
a little sprinkle machine or something
else<00:03:05.310> because<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.180> think<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.570> would<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> lot

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
else because I think that would be a lot

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.270 
else because I think that would be a lot
of<00:03:07.200> fun<00:03:07.410> but<00:03:08.160> these<00:03:08.400> molds<00:03:08.820> do<00:03:09.090> work<00:03:09.450> very<00:03:09.480> well
