safety car came in you were about I

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:27.619 
safety car came in you were about I
think<00:07:26.279> five<00:07:26.550> seconds<00:07:26.969> of<00:07:27.029> that<00:07:27.119> fast<00:07:27.449> and

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:27.629 
think five seconds of that fast and

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:30.589 
think five seconds of that fast and
everyone<00:07:27.869> else<00:07:28.020> why<00:07:28.559> was<00:07:28.679> that<00:07:28.709> a<00:07:29.479> first<00:07:30.479> of

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 
everyone else why was that a first of

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:33.859 
everyone else why was that a first of
all<00:07:30.719> I<00:07:31.439> think<00:07:32.039> I<00:07:32.520> had<00:07:32.699> or<00:07:33.089> we<00:07:33.300> both<00:07:33.479> we<00:07:33.719> can't

00:07:33.859 --> 00:07:33.869 
all I think I had or we both we can't

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:35.869 
all I think I had or we both we can't
intermediate<00:07:34.379> eyes<00:07:34.559> on<00:07:34.800> compared<00:07:35.279> to<00:07:35.399> some

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 
intermediate eyes on compared to some

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:37.820 
intermediate eyes on compared to some
drivers<00:07:36.300> had<00:07:36.479> rain<00:07:36.959> tires<00:07:37.169> on<00:07:37.439> and<00:07:37.619> I<00:07:37.800> think

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830 
drivers had rain tires on and I think

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.399 
drivers had rain tires on and I think
that<00:07:38.129> it's<00:07:38.729> a<00:07:38.909> bit<00:07:39.059> of<00:07:39.179> a<00:07:39.270> different<00:07:39.659> although

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:40.409 
that it's a bit of a different although

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:43.159 
that it's a bit of a different although
I<00:07:40.949> was<00:07:41.249> behind<00:07:41.490> us<00:07:41.789> and<00:07:42.089> Yossi<00:07:42.509> was<00:07:42.659> flying<00:07:42.990> I

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169 
I was behind us and Yossi was flying I

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:44.929 
I was behind us and Yossi was flying I
mean<00:07:43.349> he<00:07:43.469> was<00:07:43.649> on<00:07:43.860> rain<00:07:44.249> tires<00:07:44.279> i<00:07:44.610> think<00:07:44.789> he<00:07:44.849> was

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:44.939 
mean he was on rain tires i think he was

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:46.850 
mean he was on rain tires i think he was
the<00:07:45.059> fastest<00:07:45.479> car<00:07:45.689> basically<00:07:46.080> out<00:07:46.439> there<00:07:46.679> and

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 
the fastest car basically out there and

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.559 
the fastest car basically out there and
I<00:07:47.490> thought<00:07:47.699> it<00:07:47.849> would<00:07:47.969> be<00:07:48.089> a<00:07:48.119> lot<00:07:48.209> easier<00:07:48.360> to

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:48.569 
I thought it would be a lot easier to

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:51.109 
I thought it would be a lot easier to
overtake<00:07:48.990> him<00:07:49.169> but<00:07:49.379> he<00:07:49.979> was<00:07:50.129> going<00:07:50.519> very<00:07:50.580> well

00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:51.119 
overtake him but he was going very well

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:53.689 
overtake him but he was going very well
and<00:07:51.269> he<00:07:51.479> made<00:07:51.899> it<00:07:51.929> very<00:07:52.110> difficult<00:07:52.289> to<00:07:52.649> me<00:07:52.830> how

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699 
and he made it very difficult to me how

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.849 
and he made it very difficult to me how
much
