00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.010
 very different goals for the evian 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.050
 thonon gaillard and monaco the evianais 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.090
 counts three points advanced on the 18th 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.789
 and first relegables they are 16th 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.160
 monaco on his side 4th and continues his 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.720
 Podium Quest 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.820
 the team of pascal dupraz and deprived of his 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.490
 ben ali and supplée it's monaco of his 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.980
 side evolves his wallace has suspended rajhi 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.180
 carvalho bakayoko and traoré are 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.730
 always missing the first opportunity 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.149
 and Monegasque with a very nice shot 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.610
 signed anthony martial the opening of the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.940
 score in the 18th minute second goal of the 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.110
 season 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.010
 for martial sometimes criticized for his 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.140
 lack of realism 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.430
 he manages a very nice goal and allows 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.210
 monaco to perfectly launch his match 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.000
 monaco is the best team of the 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.410
 championship away 7 wins 2 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.670
 draws and 4 losses 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.800
 a record that some teams 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.840
 would like to have at home the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.540
 Monegasque who continues and dimitar 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.020
 berbatov regales everyone with this 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.329
 great goal full of technique even 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.700
 if in the end the goal is awarded to kassim 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.890
 Abdullah against his side is Berbatov 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.860
 who does all the work in the 35th minute 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.650
 monaco leads 2-0 annecy against evian 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.790
 thonon gaillard 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.020
 a victory over the last four 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.659
 matches only for the club the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.610
 principality who needs to win this 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.470
 meet 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.390
 in the second half it's about the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.490
 same face with always 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.490
 enterprising Monegasques and this coup 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.970
 franc played by the vines race before 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.729
 is saved by benjamin leroy again 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.770
 corner played by bernado silva la 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.610
 first times and missed the second 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.010
 striking is the good 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.080
 almamy touré registered at the hour of play 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.710
 his first goal in league 1 and that's 3 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.390
 0 1 huge score for monaco 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.689
 evian thonon gaillard stays on three 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.840
 victories including the late match won 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.040
 1 0 against Lorient a few days before 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 May against Monaco this is not at all 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.689
 the same story even though evian thonon 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.229
 Gaillard wakes up at the end of the second 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.209
 period 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.340
 several interesting attempts 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.629
 especially that of mathieu duhamel but 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.629
 it's saved by subasic 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.490
 monaco won the first leg 2 0 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.950
 but will not succeed this time at 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.020
 not conceding a goal because modou sougou 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.580
 scored his first goal of the season at 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.440
 the 78th minute 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's too late to come back 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.220
 completely to the score for the players 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.390
 local and monaco retains its advantage 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.590
 nice operation for monaco who 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.250
 win 3 goals to 1 on the field 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.250
 from evian thonon gaillard
