00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.039 
we're pushing the seventh month already
I<00:01:54.259> mean<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.689> black<00:01:57.689> ops<00:01:57.869> was

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
I mean it is what it is black ops was

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.569

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
not a futuristic as I was hoping it'd be

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.700 
not a futuristic as I was hoping it'd be
and<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.229> drop<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> ball<00:02:01.680> on

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and I really think they drop the ball on

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.530 
and I really think they drop the ball on
that<00:02:01.920> here's<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> game<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> continue

Nate<00:02:08.670> fail<00:02:08.849> because<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> way<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.509> looks

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
Nate fail because like the way it looks

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.809 
Nate fail because like the way it looks
and<00:02:09.989> that's<00:02:10.800> pretty<00:02:10.979> much<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.190> i'm<00:02:11.430> using<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and that's pretty much it i'm using the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.210 
and that's pretty much it i'm using the
select<00:02:12.120> fire<00:02:12.270> i'm<00:02:12.450> using<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.810> holic

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
select fire i'm using a holic

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.950 
select fire i'm using a holic
ethic<00:02:13.490> which<00:02:13.670> basically<00:02:13.970> takes<00:02:14.210> one<00:02:14.570> percent

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
ethic which basically takes one percent

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.470 
ethic which basically takes one percent
of<00:02:15.260> your<00:02:15.560> equal<00:02:15.950> down<00:02:16.160> which<00:02:16.940> i<00:02:17.060> think<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
of your equal down which i think is the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.720 
of your equal down which i think is the
same<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.810> target<00:02:18.080> finder<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.580> pretty

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
same as the target finder so you pretty

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.030 
same as the target finder so you pretty
much<00:02:19.820> get<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.150> same<00:02:20.330> recoil<00:02:20.720> with<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.040> where

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
much get the same recoil with the where

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.650 
much get the same recoil with the where
the<00:02:22.100> eotech<00:02:22.550> as<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.850> would<00:02:23.090> like<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.270> target

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the eotech as you would like a target

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.960 
the eotech as you would like a target
finder<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.140> man<00:02:24.320> I'm<00:02:24.470> not<00:02:24.560> raining<00:02:24.950> Matt<00:02:25.640> main

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
finder and man I'm not raining Matt main

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.120 
finder and man I'm not raining Matt main
reason<00:02:26.450> I'm<00:02:26.780> not<00:02:26.960> using<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.530> target<00:02:27.890> finder

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
reason I'm not using the target finder

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.610 
reason I'm not using the target finder
is<00:02:28.910> because<00:02:29.300> people<00:02:29.330> hate<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:29.900> videos<00:02:30.380> with

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
is because people hate on videos with

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.350 
is because people hate on videos with
the<00:02:30.650> target<00:02:30.980> fighter<00:02:31.130> in<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.460> it's<00:02:32.270> not

the target fighter in it it's not

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.080 
the target fighter in it it's not
because<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.660> don't<00:02:32.750> like<00:02:33.110> using<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.650> it's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
because I don't like using it it's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.120 
because I don't like using it it's
