00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.330 
can show that better and we get to show
you<00:01:28.020> how<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.140> app<00:01:28.320> works<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.040> said<00:01:29.159> all

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you how the app works like we said all

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.740 
you how the app works like we said all
this<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.729> customized<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.630> have

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
this can be customized and we do have

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.850 
this can be customized and we do have
the<00:01:30.869> parent<00:01:31.170> lock<00:01:31.290> key<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> nice

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the parent lock key which is a nice

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.670 
the parent lock key which is a nice
little<00:01:32.100> touch<00:01:32.479> this<00:01:33.479> does<00:01:33.720> keep<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.110> child

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
little touch this does keep your child

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
little touch this does keep your child
from<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.820> messing<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.689> all

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
from going in here and messing with all

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
from going in here and messing with all
this<00:01:36.990> stuff<00:01:37.229> themselves<00:01:37.549> throws<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
this stuff themselves throws going to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.060 
this stuff themselves throws going to
slide<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.270> down<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.350> hit<00:01:40.560> new<00:01:40.740> card

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
slide this down and then hit new card

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.580 
slide this down and then hit new card
it's<00:01:41.340> extremely<00:01:42.030> simple<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.899> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it's extremely simple to do this you

i simply loaded a photo i typed in the
text<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.720> last

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
text and then the last

text and then the last
watching<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> chink<00:02:14.520> here<00:02:18.530> notebook<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.870> I'd

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
watching the chink here notebook so I'd

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.979 
watching the chink here notebook so I'd
say<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:23.209> then<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.300> test<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.810> then

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
say that then you test it and then

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.990 
say that then you test it and then
you're<00:02:25.140> done<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.950> easy<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.790> all

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you're done it is that easy so with all

you're done it is that easy so with all
of<00:02:27.180> these<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.690> easily<00:02:27.989> create<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.560> ton<00:02:28.800> of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
of these you can easily create a ton of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.830 
of these you can easily create a ton of
flashcards<00:02:29.129> for<00:02:29.489> your<00:02:29.700> child<00:02:29.970> what's<00:02:30.720> the

might be asking what's the point of this
essentially<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> idea<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.220> really

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
essentially the idea is that this really

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.830 
essentially the idea is that this really
helps<00:02:44.700> with<00:02:44.760> language<00:02:45.150> acquisition<00:02:45.330> in

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
helps with language acquisition in

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.930 
helps with language acquisition in
children<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:47.040> way<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.190> learn<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> language<00:02:47.670> is

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
children the way you learn a language is

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.460 
children the way you learn a language is
pretty<00:02:48.180> specific<00:02:48.450> you're<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.319> know<00:02:49.440> you're

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
pretty specific you're you know you're

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.380 
pretty specific you're you know you're
interacting<00:02:49.830> with<00:02:50.370> things<00:02:50.610> all<00:02:51.120> throughout

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
interacting with things all throughout

interacting with things all throughout
this<00:02:51.569> developmental<00:02:51.989> stage<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.650> your<00:02:52.739> shown

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
this developmental stage and your shown

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.589 
this developmental stage and your shown
things<00:02:53.340> like<00:02:53.579> this<00:02:53.819> would<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.150> understand

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
things like this would you understand

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.780 
things like this would you understand
intuitively<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.709> be<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:55.860> fuzzy<00:02:56.190> black<00:02:56.489> thing

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
intuitively to be a fuzzy black thing

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.160 
intuitively to be a fuzzy black thing
but<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.060> don't<00:02:57.209> know<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.420> word<00:02:57.569> for<00:02:57.599> it<00:02:57.930> so

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
but you don't know the word for it so

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.750 
but you don't know the word for it so
this<00:02:58.290> reinforces<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.069> fact<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.730> a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
this reinforces the fact that this is a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.490 
this reinforces the fact that this is a
cat<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.360> most<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.319> done<00:03:01.470> through

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
cat and most of this is done through

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.610 
cat and most of this is done through
this<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:03.540> audible<00:03:03.900> sounds<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.349> your<00:03:04.440> child

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
this the audible sounds that your child

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.589 
this the audible sounds that your child
hears<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.370> embedded<00:03:05.849> into<00:03:06.000> their<00:03:06.269> brains

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
hears this is embedded into their brains

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.600 
hears this is embedded into their brains
now<00:03:07.349> even<00:03:07.650> though<00:03:07.739> they<00:03:07.860> can't<00:03:08.099> reproduce<00:03:08.220> it

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
now even though they can't reproduce it

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.130 
now even though they can't reproduce it
themselves<00:03:08.940> they<00:03:09.060> are<00:03:09.239> absorbing<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.930> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
themselves they are absorbing this and

instance if I had a small child of my

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.460 
instance if I had a small child of my
own<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:33.030> know<00:03:33.510> they'd<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.810> around<00:03:34.079> my<00:03:34.200> cat<00:03:34.440> a

own you know they'd be around my cat a

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.620 
own you know they'd be around my cat a
lot<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.160> they<00:03:35.430> would<00:03:35.639> know<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.120> cat<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.420> I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
lot so they would know this cat and I

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.800 
lot so they would know this cat and I
could<00:03:36.780> even<00:03:36.870> name<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.230> Bella<00:03:37.730> or<00:03:38.730> whatever<00:03:39.600> the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
could even name it Bella or whatever the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.910 
could even name it Bella or whatever the
scenario<00:03:40.049> would<00:03:40.350> be<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.709> then<00:03:40.799> they'll

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
scenario would be and then they'll

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.710 
scenario would be and then they'll
understand<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.609> intuitively<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.389> be<00:03:42.480> Bella

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
understand that intuitively to be Bella

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.240 
understand that intuitively to be Bella
and<00:03:43.260> when<00:03:43.410> they<00:03:43.500> get<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> little<00:03:43.799> older<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.190> can

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
and when they get a little older you can

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.129 
and when they get a little older you can
reproduce<00:03:44.639> this<00:03:44.910> themselves<00:03:45.480> they<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:46.109> know

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
reproduce this themselves they you know

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.539 
reproduce this themselves they you know
you'll<00:03:46.380> find<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.709> your<00:03:46.889> child<00:03:47.040> has<00:03:47.190> really

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
you'll find that your child has really

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.129 
you'll find that your child has really
retained<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.970> lot<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.630> lot<00:03:48.840> quicker

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
retained a lot of this is a lot quicker

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.620 
retained a lot of this is a lot quicker
on<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.889> uptake<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.280> language<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.389> can<00:03:51.420> also

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
on the uptake of language you can also

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.069 
on the uptake of language you can also
do<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.519> for<00:03:53.519> any<00:03:54.060> family<00:03:54.540> member<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.930> you

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
do this for any family member that you

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.410 
do this for any family member that you
want<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.380> add<00:03:55.829> sister<00:03:56.579> brother<00:03:56.880> was<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> good

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
want to add sister brother was a good

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.870 
want to add sister brother was a good
way<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.599> do<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.959> too<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.530> even<00:03:58.670> better<00:03:59.670> the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
way to do that too and even better the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.610 
way to do that too and even better the
fact<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.239> it's<00:04:00.389> from<00:04:00.510> your<00:04:00.750> own<00:04:00.930> voice<00:04:01.230> is

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
fact that it's from your own voice is

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.589 
fact that it's from your own voice is
statistically<00:04:02.579> better<00:04:02.790> as<00:04:03.060> well<00:04:03.299> for

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
statistically better as well for

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.059 
statistically better as well for
language<00:04:03.900> acquisition<00:04:04.079> it's<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.650> great<00:04:04.859> thing

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
language acquisition it's a great thing

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.319 
language acquisition it's a great thing
that's<00:04:05.280> naturally<00:04:05.670> how<00:04:05.760> your<00:04:05.880> child<00:04:06.030> learns

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
is through voice recognition and they

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.940 
is through voice recognition and they
