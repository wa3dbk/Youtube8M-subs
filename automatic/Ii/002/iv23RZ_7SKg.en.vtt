00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.420
 actually still be answered 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.020

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.100
 Little increases if you understand what I mean 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 my 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 So I am very happy to you this gravel 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
 also in connection with regrets 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.000
 to be able to provide I think 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.189
 that it's the fairest way 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.899
 how can I give it to you and 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.180
 as commanded if you still get nothing 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.469
 Do not be sad the whole thing gives 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.479
 there is still a long way to go 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.460
 some gravel and I think that we 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.320
 then together 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.850
 one or the other round still gamble 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.970
 likes to write in the comments what you like 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.410
 the action holds true if it finds fair 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.970
 or not I do not have that many 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.070

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.990

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.540
