 your feelings so the ball more 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.719
 heavy what what struck you most 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.579
 today to play with a player who is 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.710
 number 60 of the atp ranking 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.670
 yes definitely representations balls 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.129
 as said there is a noticeable difference 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.790
 in comparison to the junior one then 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.560
 let's say you can play with them 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.070
 also teaches to keep up with their rhythm 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.790
 is followed by a different heaviness 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.710
 compared to normal so it's better 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.350
 he felt back from a very good one 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.850
 australian open where besides they will have 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.479
 of a season that really has you 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.759
 seen as a protagonist at junior level 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.080
 what did you bring home? 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.329
 suitcase from this semifinal 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.430
 at the Australian anyway the juniors 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.560
 however, they are a great experience at home 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.720
 I'm happy with the polite result 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.930

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.880
 excellent intensity and duration of the house 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.920
 above all the experience of being able to stay 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.610
 among very high professionals 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.500
 level indeed of maximum level therefore 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.860
 for us young people it's just an advantage 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.420
 to be able to learn from them then more 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.110
 possibility there will be half a way out 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.020

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.920
