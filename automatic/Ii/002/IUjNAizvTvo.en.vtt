in just a moment here so as you can see
here's<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.680> case<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> got<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> bit<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
here's the case there you got a bit of a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.249 
here's the case there you got a bit of a
lip<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.720> protect<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.110> screen

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
lip going on there to protect the screen

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.490 
lip going on there to protect the screen
as<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.650> imagine<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.509> ports<00:01:43.350> on

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
as you can imagine all of the ports on

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.350 
as you can imagine all of the ports on
most<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.009> these<00:01:44.100> aren't<00:01:44.399> exactly<00:01:44.759> lined<00:01:45.180> up

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
most of these aren't exactly lined up

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389 
most of these aren't exactly lined up
bang<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.020> perfectly<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.130> really

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
bang on perfectly and that was really

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.249 
bang on perfectly and that was really
disappointing<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> me<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.720> still<00:01:48.960> see

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
disappointing to me you can still see

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.990 
disappointing to me you can still see
the<00:01:49.530> unpin<00:01:50.220> whole<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> may<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.790> able<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the unpin whole you may not be able to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.249 
the unpin whole you may not be able to
actually<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.509> camera<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.020> because

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
actually see on camera right now because

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.679 
actually see on camera right now because
it's<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> focus<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:53.390> it's<00:01:54.390> actually

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
it's out of focus but it's actually

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
it's out of focus but it's actually
quite<00:01:55.049> off<00:01:55.470> center<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> little<00:01:56.610> bit

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
quite off center and it was a little bit

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.969 
quite off center and it was a little bit
concerning<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> whole<00:01:58.229> still<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.770> there

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
concerning but the whole still is there

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.679
