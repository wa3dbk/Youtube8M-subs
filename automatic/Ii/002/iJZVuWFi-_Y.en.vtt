hell Jen brewery school yep and instead
of<00:00:55.770> making<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.520> vertical<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.180> they<00:00:57.329> did<00:00:57.480> on

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
of making it vertical like they did on

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170 
of making it vertical like they did on
the<00:00:57.870> old<00:00:58.020> Keller<00:00:58.710> brewery<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.640> actually<00:00:59.910> open

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the old Keller brewery we actually open

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.639 
the old Keller brewery we actually open
the<00:01:00.270> kid<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.109> more<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.440> big

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the kid up so it's more of the big

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619 
the kid up so it's more of the big
warehouse<00:01:02.070> part<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:02.820> your

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
warehouse part here and then your

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.299 
warehouse part here and then your
suggestion<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.350> use<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.680> tower<00:01:04.920> there<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
suggestion we use that tower there and I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.350 
suggestion we use that tower there and I
think<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.580> really<00:01:05.610> gives<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.150> nice

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
think it really gives it some nice

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
think it really gives it some nice
height<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.530> helps<00:01:07.770> frame<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.220> scene

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
height and kind of helps frame the scene

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
height and kind of helps frame the scene
and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.479> also<00:01:09.630> made<00:01:09.869> good<00:01:10.049> use<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.229> some
