00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
in fact it's this one so let's go ahead

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.020 
in fact it's this one so let's go ahead
and<00:03:33.180> double<00:03:33.480> click<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.350> zoom<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.459> one

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
and double click on that and zoom in one

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.180 
and double click on that and zoom in one
last<00:03:36.360> time<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:37.080> can<00:03:37.230> see<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.739> you'll

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
last time so we can see it and you'll

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.400 
last time so we can see it and you'll
see<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.610> double<00:03:38.970> row<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.269> stitching<00:03:39.810> now<00:03:40.290> it

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
see the double row of stitching now it

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.860 
see the double row of stitching now it
does<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.890> outside<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.730> sleeve<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.570> hair

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
does go outside the sleeve just a hair

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.100 
does go outside the sleeve just a hair
so<00:03:43.560> what<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:43.860> might<00:03:44.310> want<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.730> do<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.239> adjust<00:03:45.510> my

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
so what I might want to do is adjust my

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.940 
so what I might want to do is adjust my
original<00:03:46.830> line<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.120> doesn't<00:03:48.600> occur<00:03:48.950> but

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
original line so that doesn't occur but

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.670 
original line so that doesn't occur but
what<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.400> want<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.850> do<00:03:51.030> first<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.870> change<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
what I want to do first is change the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.060 
what I want to do first is change the
color<00:03:52.950> so<00:03:53.580> right<00:03:53.910> now<00:03:54.209> you'll<00:03:55.200> see<00:03:55.470> it's<00:03:55.739> black

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
color so right now you'll see it's black

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.360 
color so right now you'll see it's black
because<00:03:56.850> they<00:03:57.510> were<00:03:57.570> designed<00:03:57.959> as<00:03:58.500> black<00:03:58.800> but

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
because they were designed as black but

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.449 
because they were designed as black but
if<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.640> click<00:03:59.940> on<00:03:59.970> red<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.320> can<00:04:01.890> fill<00:04:02.250> those

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
if I click on red I can fill those

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.970 
if I click on red I can fill those
objects<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.239> red<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.870> change<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.650> stitch

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
objects with red and change the stitch

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.150 
objects with red and change the stitch
to<00:04:05.250> whatever<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.670> wanted<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.480> because<00:04:07.380> with<00:04:07.950> my

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
to whatever I wanted and because with my

to whatever I wanted and because with my
shape<00:04:08.489> tool<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.120> can<00:04:09.330> edit<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.530> original<00:04:11.130> line

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
shape tool I can edit the original line

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.970 
shape tool I can edit the original line
let's<00:04:12.840> go<00:04:13.019> ahead<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.290> find<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.709> original

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
let's go ahead and find that original

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.800 
let's go ahead and find that original
line<00:04:14.400> it's<00:04:14.640> probably<00:04:14.940> easier<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.390> see<00:04:15.660> in

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
line it's probably easier to see in

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.990 
line it's probably easier to see in
wireframe<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:16.769> there<00:04:16.919> we<00:04:17.070> go<00:04:17.100> we'll<00:04:17.430> select<00:04:17.669> it

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
wireframe so there we go we'll select it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.810 
wireframe so there we go we'll select it
there<00:04:18.330> now<00:04:19.109> let's<00:04:19.440> go<00:04:19.620> back<00:04:19.830> to<00:04:19.859> enhanced<00:04:20.549> view

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
there now let's go back to enhanced view

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.490 
there now let's go back to enhanced view
so<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.000> can<00:04:21.090> see<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.989> if<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.169> don't<00:04:22.350> want

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
so you can see it so if I don't want

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.880 
so you can see it so if I don't want
that<00:04:22.650> overlap<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.460> simply<00:04:24.240> move<00:04:24.450> my<00:04:24.750> node<00:04:25.050> just

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
that overlap I simply move my node just

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.000 
that overlap I simply move my node just
a<00:04:26.160> hair<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:27.720> way<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.169> doesn't<00:04:28.380> stick<00:04:28.860> out

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
a hair and that way it doesn't stick out

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.340 
a hair and that way it doesn't stick out
so<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.430> can<00:04:29.700> adjust<00:04:30.180> these<00:04:30.419> after<00:04:31.169> they've

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
so you can adjust these after they've

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.239 
so you can adjust these after they've
been<00:04:31.530> applied<00:04:31.919> however<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.729> want

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:33.249 
been applied however you want

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.009 
been applied however you want
but<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.789> key<00:04:33.999> thing<00:04:34.029> I<00:04:34.449> want<00:04:34.749> you<00:04:34.929> to

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:35.019 
but the key thing I want you to

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:39.209 
but the key thing I want you to
understand<00:04:35.649> is<00:04:36.209> exactly<00:04:37.209> how<00:04:37.569> easy<00:04:37.929> it<00:04:38.259> is<00:04:38.319> to

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
understand is exactly how easy it is to

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.659 
understand is exactly how easy it is to
apply<00:04:39.519> a<00:04:40.049> hundred<00:04:41.049> and<00:04:41.199> one<00:04:41.439> different<00:04:42.039> stitch

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
apply a hundred and one different stitch

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:54.900 
apply a hundred and one different stitch
patterns<00:04:43.239> to<00:04:44.109> lines<00:04:44.529> in<00:04:45.009> CorelDraw

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910
