variations<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.310> his<00:00:23.430> signature<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.150> no

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
variations of his signature because no

variations of his signature because no
one<00:00:24.539> signature<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.170> exactly<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> same<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
one signature is exactly the same as the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.980 
one signature is exactly the same as the
last<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.029> look<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.269> happens<00:00:27.510> when<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.660> enter

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
last but look what happens when I enter

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
last but look what happens when I enter
a<00:00:28.019> very<00:00:28.170> simple<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:29.160> says<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> signature

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
a very simple one it says the signature

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.120 
a very simple one it says the signature
is<00:00:29.939> too<00:00:30.090> simple<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.750> set<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.109> security<00:00:31.560> try

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
is too simple to set for security try

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.280 
is too simple to set for security try
again<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> enter<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.630> variation

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
again and I'm going to enter a variation

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.720 
again and I'm going to enter a variation
of<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.530> name<00:00:34.710> rather<00:00:34.980> than<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.280> signature

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
of my name rather than my signature

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.860 
of my name rather than my signature
that's<00:00:36.390> number<00:00:36.600> one

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that's number one

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.330 
that's number one
we'll<00:00:37.290> hit<00:00:37.440> continue<00:00:38.540> attempt<00:00:39.540> number<00:00:39.719> two

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
we'll hit continue attempt number two

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.040 
we'll hit continue attempt number two
that's<00:00:41.340> done<00:00:41.640> we'll<00:00:42.210> hit<00:00:42.390> continue<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that's done we'll hit continue this is a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.600 
that's done we'll hit continue this is a
third<00:00:43.320> attempt<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
third attempt and I'm going to do a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.690 
third attempt and I'm going to do a
different<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.230> still<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:46.350> name<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> look

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
different one still my name and look

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.190 
different one still my name and look
what<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> says<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.180> signature<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.690> incorrect

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
what it says the signature is incorrect

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.560 
what it says the signature is incorrect
draw<00:00:49.770> signature<00:00:50.280> again<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.360> too

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
draw signature again because it's too

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
draw signature again because it's too
different<00:00:52.050> from<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> previous<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.309> attempts

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
different from the previous two attempts

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.939 
different from the previous two attempts
that<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.969> made<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.870> third<00:00:55.260> attempt<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.649> confirm

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that we made so third attempt to confirm

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
that we made so third attempt to confirm
and<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.610> backed<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> pin<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and it's backed up with the pin of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.049 
and it's backed up with the pin of
course<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.170> will<00:00:58.320> type<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.760> world's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
course I will type in the world's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
course I will type in the world's
strongest<00:01:00.300> pin<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.870> confirm<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.800> one

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
strongest pin and confirm that as one

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.930 
strongest pin and confirm that as one
two<00:01:02.219> three<00:01:02.460> four

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
two three four

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.929 
two three four
okay<00:01:03.719> okay<00:01:03.840> that's<00:01:04.650> now<00:01:04.920> set<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.790> lock

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
okay okay that's now set so if we lock

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.960 
okay okay that's now set so if we lock
the<00:01:06.090> device<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:07.200> unlock<00:01:07.790> give<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the device and then unlock give it a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
the device and then unlock give it a
second<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> pad<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.750> appear<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.619> enter

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
second for the pad to appear then enter

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.690 
second for the pad to appear then enter
the<00:01:11.040> signature<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:13.040> that's<00:01:14.040> how<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> unlocks

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the signature and that's how it unlocks

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.609 
the signature and that's how it unlocks
the<00:01:14.880> device<00:01:15.119> using<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.900> signature<00:01:16.290> once

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the device using this signature once

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.960 
the device using this signature once
you're<00:01:16.740> using<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.100> signature<00:01:17.400> unlock<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you're using a signature unlock to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
you're using a signature unlock to
unlock<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> device<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:18.960> two<00:01:19.229> extra

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
unlock the device you get two extra

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.830 
unlock the device you get two extra
options<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.580> make<00:01:20.880> signature<00:01:21.390> visible

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
options down here make signature visible

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
options down here make signature visible
and<00:01:21.990> accuracy<00:01:22.710> level<00:01:22.979> obviously<00:01:23.280> make

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and accuracy level obviously make

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.820 
and accuracy level obviously make
signature<00:01:24.240> visible<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.780> exactly<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.770> if

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
signature visible is exactly that so if

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.740 
signature visible is exactly that so if
we<00:01:25.860> take<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> tick<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> lock<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
we take the tick out there and lock it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.289 
we take the tick out there and lock it
again<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.369> can<00:01:29.369> enter<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> signature<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.210> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
again I can enter the signature but you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
again I can enter the signature but you
can't<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> screen<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.799> security

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
