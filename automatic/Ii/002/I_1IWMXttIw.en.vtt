00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:15.699
 fold what a terrible sound 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.279
 creaked got a little pebble right now I 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.720
 I'll show you a little closer now 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.720
 show you the wheel will go 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:43.290
 fold it even in the cabin heard hear 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.720
 your stomach you are not some that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.430
 which stuck a wheel from turin 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.970
 in fact there is a little small 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.420
 pebble 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.400
 got under the pad of the boat to protect 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.400
 got gives such a scary 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.550
 call on the food here it is a terrible screech 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.220
 standing in the wheel because of these 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.600
 little pebbles see a bunch of little ones 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.400
 pebbles they fly off and fall into 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.200
 the wheel comes under protection either between 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.450
 discs fall see here 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
 a bunch of these stones roll and that's such 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.240
 here's a little pebble that hits and creates 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 such a tooth 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.450
 I 'll show you now take a closer look. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.220
 see gets between the disc and the pad 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.020
 get creates such a terrible creak 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.300
 a minute will be a rattle standing in the cabin 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.950
 very audible and it seems that there 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.869
 some just don't know a piece of iron or 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.060
 the wheel disappears that is actually 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.210
 fear not need that is if we of course 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.890
 do you have this doubt that you have 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.930
 running some of the problems and of course 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.399
 you can go out and knock on the wheels 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.530
 look visually so that everything was 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.810
 ok but most likely it's small 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.700
 pebble see everywhere they roll 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.590
 like a bunch of small stones 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.979
 pebbles and somewhere he bounced off the wheel 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.070
 and came under the protection of either under the boat 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.200
 that is what protection is and then 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.270
 there is a disk and behind it is there below 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.160
 such protection is worth it shit did not fall with 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.869
 this country and can not see where it falls 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.420
 little pebbles not on all cars 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.850
 of course there is such protection but they also fall 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.070
 starting from she 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.989
 create such a screech terrible here and 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.730
 the feeling that there is something with a wheel 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.650
 not in order here see if 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.110
 Look at the moderator even seen here 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.920
 see here scratches do not know the camera 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.110
 transmits 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.330
 and does not pass the excellent student can be seen Saratov 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.010
 a pebble got there you need to scratch 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.989
 created such a sound of everything even 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.400
 Nastya I spend so I feel like 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.739
 do ethics glasses so small 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.630
 and then of course polished disc boat 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.910
 it will be polished all exactly this 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.640
 hit the teddy bear created so scary 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.790
 sound or happens when puddles puddle 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.000
 drive through there too pebbles the water went to 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.200
 boat along with a puddle and pebbles remain 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.980
 water comes out turns out 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:03.349
 so you see it turns out such a rattle 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.239
 there is these here on the block if you can see 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.310
 these are not these strips this wheel 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.860
 just wrote the other side and stood 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.540
 and such a story happened the way 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.849
 when i was eighteen 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.459
 nineteen experiences were very few and we 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.900
 in the same way a pebble fell under a shoe 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.310
 has become 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.620
 stopped began to look visually what 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.459
 there happened the wheel did not understand what 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.840
 case got the jack got the balloon key 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.569
 I wanted to shoot the wheel 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.400
 the benefit of which drove the driver already 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.230
 The experience was about thirty years he does not speak 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.700
 that they say what happened I told him 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.950
 what is the rattle say standing in 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.959
 block well, just the fear of whether something is clearly 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.640
 there is not a college pebble 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.319
 you came under protection i say yes no 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.269
 maybe this sound is worth not solo 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.920
 say such a rattle you drive it 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.349
 a little stone makes such a sound 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.060
 mining may not end up we have exceeded 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.540
 the car loses a little exact 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.430
 I turned the stone like choosing a wheel 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.260
 completely all the way look there such 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.690
 there was protection there drives there protection 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.910
 closed unbent protection fell out 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.639
 small stone just the way I am you 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.560
 showed here the chip is rubble and yes these 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.600
 little pebbles come across this 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.250
 the pebble fell I started to go and the sound 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.260
 missing that is small 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.970
 pebble creates such a sound in the cabin 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.519
 when you sit such a niche also with 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.660
 the wheel will fall off and as if here itself now 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.430
 already this story again 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.840
 happened hit let's say this pebble 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.680
 Of course he will periodically be all 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.600
 always fall 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.240
 but I think I have already made a video on this 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.530
 about so that we say if you get 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.419
 such a pebble you did not have some 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.820
 panic and you did not think that before the car already 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.889
 there in the aquator call and lead somewhere 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.750
 damla station there wheels shoot 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.970
 watch what really happened there 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.590
 then you hit a little pebble if you 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.270
 final doubts about should 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.910
 small amount of course you go 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.130
 look at the wheels visually knock on 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.139
 wheel then-0 drink it access to another 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.030
 you will be able to drop me that you were convinced 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.889
 that everything is fine with the wheels because 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.780
 if I really can do a little here 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.520
 telling that this is a little pebble 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.139
 hit really it's not a pebble 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.610
 Chambers did to this problem and 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.320
 reveal and think and yes there k-magic 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.539
 probably now fall out and then in the end 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.430
 he did not fall out of the wheel fell so of course 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.900
 can go see that is 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.560
 visually as if you know what u 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.750
 you are on the way all is well 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.980
 to recently check in for you 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.630
 there is no problem there you mean 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.970
 strongly in the pit never came across and 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.620
 Chassis did not beat means principle rather 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.330
 of all this of course but with time 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.040
 the sound you will determine you 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.400
 We went traveling somewhere to just such a cloak 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.380
 the sound of you when we heard that sound from 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.630
 you understand that this is still a pebble 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.520
 don't worry these further i'm waiting if 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.860
 doubt them have any on this 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.330
 About that, of course, go take a look at 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.940
 Generally if you like the video set 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.740
 likes subscribe to the channel will be 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.370
 add more interesting information for 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.560
 newbies 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.300
 so as if something new is interesting 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.370
 that how would people not know any such 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.229
 moment ki small even about such 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.790
 how with this wheel with that rattle 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.740
 so that there is no panic later 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.040
 Thank you all for your attention to the new ones. 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.040
 meeting
