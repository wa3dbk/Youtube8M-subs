00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello i'm clement corn tracy rs 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.189
 original and today I'm going to you 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 explain what to watch when 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.660
 we buy a vehicle at the level of 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.610
 engine 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.870
 because we're going to do we're going to get into 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.190
 the vehicle where we will put the contact 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.420
 of the vehicle and we will check on the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.350
 dashboard if there are messages 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.820
 engine warning error messages 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.900
 or alerts what can be like 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.160
 alert now on vehicles 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.430
 recent most of the time they will you 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.840
 anne 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.099
 it tells you if the vehicle is at 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.199
 revise or in how long it is 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.790
 to revise also the revision deadline a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 exceeded 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 so at first what we can 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 check this is the state of the liquids this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.670
 vehicle one pulls the gauge one wipes a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.280
 first time the oil that ensures liquid 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:53.039
 on the rod is the plunges 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.989
 a few seconds you have the minimum 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.100
 who is here and the maximum maxi cie if we 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.230
 is between the two is that the level 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.710
 oil is good there we are at about 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.270
 half 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.829
 So at the bed is no problem 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.229
 we can see that he is very clear 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.309
 which means that the drain has been 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.970
 done not long ago and that it is 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.970
 still in very good condition 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.159
 then we can check the cap of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.869
 filling the oil so the cap 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.240
 filling it up so it's next 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.130
 the engines moved differently from 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.520
 anyway you systematically 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.350
 be written so he so the oil be 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.340
 you have a small a little sign that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.840
 tell you it's the stopper 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.729
 oil filling what can 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.020
 watch it's inside the cork 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.549
 of oil if we have no small traces 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 white without mayonnaise call 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.689
 which means most of the time that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.880
 has a small problem at the joints 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.530
 including the cylinder head gasket 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 which means that there is oil 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.960
 in the water where the water in the oil can 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.119
 check the water then the liquid 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.520
 vehicle name cooling 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.220
 the same on the plugs you have you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.829
 have the sounds that allow you to 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.990
 locate the cap on so they will 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.640
 so here is the same principle to 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.649
 inside so here this one is 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.440
 perfectly dry inside when he 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.610
 there is a problem of joint we also see 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.040
 the mayonnaise so the little ones 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.060
 small white marks always the same 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.410
 which means that there can be a 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.610
 problem with the engine gaskets 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.989
 including the cylinder head gasket to check 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.970
 so it's the spars of the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.250
 vehicle so the spars these two 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.540
 sleepers that make along the vehicle 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.269
 and on the front 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.709
 motor level we can see them what he 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.720
 must be checked is that the spars 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.549
 has not been repaired if they have been 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 repaired we will see a little painting 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.880
 joints that were put back over 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.910
 color differences also at 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.140
 level of the spars if a spar has 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.230
 been redone in europe 1 ie 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.690
 the vehicle was strongly shocked at 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.760
 the front in which case you have to push 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.140
 the investigation see the bills of 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.459
 repair if it was done at a 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.100
 professional and if the vehicle has been 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.569
 gone to the marble or not on each 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.890
 vehicle no matter the builder 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.650
 you always have a maintenance book 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.000
 which is supplied with the vehicle 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.769
 you must ask for this book 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.680
 maintenance or at least the bills for 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.329
 check that engine level level 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.340
 chassis will do what the vehicle was 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.750
 maintained from a to z within the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.010
 time recommended by the manufacturer so 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.700
 let's stop in terms of years are in term 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.040
 mileage 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.530
 it must be seen that the vehicle has had its 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.069
 interviews in time to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.130
 to make a good-bye purchase and to 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.130
 soon
