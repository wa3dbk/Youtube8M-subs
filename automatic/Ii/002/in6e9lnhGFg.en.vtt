I<00:00:00.179> have<00:00:00.750> my<00:00:00.960> hand<00:00:01.230> here<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.740> satellite<00:00:02.220> in<00:00:02.399> TV

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
I have my hand here a satellite in TV

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.820 
I have my hand here a satellite in TV
area<00:00:02.970> combiner<00:00:03.389> okay<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:04.560> give<00:00:04.710> me<00:00:04.770> an

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
area combiner okay so give me an

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.019 
area combiner okay so give me an
overview<00:00:05.100> first<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.490> all<00:00:05.549> where<00:00:05.790> would<00:00:05.940> you

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
overview first of all where would you

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.030 
overview first of all where would you
use<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.330> if<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:06.990> have<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> situation<00:00:07.470> where<00:00:07.919> we

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
use this if we have a situation where we

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.890 
use this if we have a situation where we
want<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.340> run<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> satellite<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> TV<00:00:09.510> area

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
want to run a satellite on a TV area

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.020 
want to run a satellite on a TV area
into<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> room<00:00:10.650> for<00:00:11.190> example<00:00:11.580> if<00:00:11.670> we're<00:00:11.790> running

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
into a room for example if we're running

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.120 
into a room for example if we're running
a<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.240> combo<00:00:12.660> box<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.410> there's<00:00:13.559> only<00:00:13.769> one

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
a to combo box but there's only one

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.820 
a to combo box but there's only one
cable<00:00:14.549> running<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.660> location<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.619> it's

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
cable running to that location and it's

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.920 
cable running to that location and it's
quite<00:00:17.010> awkward<00:00:17.279> or<00:00:17.670> difficult<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.600> run<00:00:18.750> an

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
quite awkward or difficult to run an

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.900 
quite awkward or difficult to run an
additional<00:00:19.050> secondary<00:00:19.800> cable<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.699> use

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
additional secondary cable you can use

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.810 
additional secondary cable you can use
this<00:00:21.150> combiner<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.460> combine<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.670> two

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
this combiner to and combine the two

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.849 
this combiner to and combine the two
signals<00:00:24.269> into<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> single<00:00:24.960> cable<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:25.740> at

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
signals into a single cable and then at

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.500 
signals into a single cable and then at
a<00:00:25.890> later<00:00:26.130> point<00:00:26.369> split<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.939> back<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
a later point split them back out and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.470 
a later point split them back out and
feed<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> terrestrial<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.730> aerial<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
feed the terrestrial and aerial and the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.020 
feed the terrestrial and aerial and the
satellite<00:00:31.170> signal<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.769> individually<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
satellite signal and individually into a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.660 
satellite signal and individually into a
box<00:00:33.239> okay<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.020> how<00:00:34.200> would<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> work<00:00:34.680> well<00:00:35.340> I'm

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
box okay so how would it work well I'm

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.920 
box okay so how would it work well I'm
just<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> stand<00:00:36.239> behind<00:00:36.390> me<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
just going to stand behind me here and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.900 
just going to stand behind me here and
just<00:00:37.079> show<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.040> example<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.730> would

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
just show here the example of this would

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.850 
just show here the example of this would
be<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> typical<00:00:39.540> UHF<00:00:40.140> area<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> might<00:00:40.800> use

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
be a typical UHF area that you might use

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
be a typical UHF area that you might use
receive<00:00:41.850> C<00:00:42.120> review<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.840> below<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
receive C review and below up here is a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
receive C review and below up here is a
satellite<00:00:43.829> dish<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.550> normally<00:00:45.000> used

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
satellite dish which is normally used

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.880 
satellite dish which is normally used
for<00:00:45.390> safe<00:00:45.539> picking<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> three<00:00:46.289> bean<00:00:46.590> seeds

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
for safe picking up the three bean seeds

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.340 
for safe picking up the three bean seeds
or<00:00:47.129> sky<00:00:47.309> signal<00:00:47.610> okay

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
or sky signal okay

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.810 
or sky signal okay
so<00:00:49.350> we'll<00:00:49.530> take<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> feed<00:00:49.980> from<00:00:50.190> each<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so we'll take a feed from each one of

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.250 
so we'll take a feed from each one of
these<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.329> imagine<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.960> coming<00:00:52.199> from

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
these you can imagine can be coming from

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.400 
these you can imagine can be coming from
this<00:00:52.469> another<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.199> we<00:00:55.199> would

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this another one from this and we would

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
this another one from this and we would
connect<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:55.980> follows<00:00:56.780> if<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.260> see

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
connect them as follows if you can see

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.799 
connect them as follows if you can see
on<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.710> side<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> high<00:00:59.879> frequency

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
on one side we have a high frequency

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.119 
on one side we have a high frequency
range<00:01:01.320> from<00:01:02.030> 950<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.530> 2400<00:01:04.530> megahertz

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
range from 950 up to 2400 megahertz

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.850 
range from 950 up to 2400 megahertz
okay<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.150> satellite<00:01:06.659> input<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.320> then

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
okay that's the satellite input and then

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.800 
okay that's the satellite input and then
a<00:01:08.040> lower<00:01:08.280> range<00:01:08.580> over<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.240> ranging<00:01:09.630> from

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
a lower range over here or ranging from

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.760 
a lower range over here or ranging from
0<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.710> 860<00:01:11.670> megahertz<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.420> said<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.409> covered

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
0 to 860 megahertz that said we covered

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.190 
0 to 860 megahertz that said we covered
full<00:01:13.979> UHF<00:01:14.580> VHF<00:01:14.610> spectrum<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> TV<00:01:16.049> area

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
full UHF VHF spectrum for the TV area

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.230 
full UHF VHF spectrum for the TV area
now<00:01:16.860> an<00:01:16.979> interesting<00:01:17.250> point<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.820> note<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.030> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
now an interesting point to note is that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
now an interesting point to note is that
there's<00:01:18.509> power<00:01:18.720> path<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> satellite<00:01:20.009> side

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
there's power path on the satellite side

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.760 
there's power path on the satellite side
and<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.909> reason<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.630> need<00:01:21.750> power<00:01:22.110> passes<00:01:22.650> we

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and the reason we need power passes we

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.350 
and the reason we need power passes we
need<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.159> able<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> power<00:01:23.759> signal

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
need to be able to have a power signal

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
need to be able to have a power signal
coming<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> satellite<00:01:25.590> receiver

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
coming from the satellite receiver

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
coming from the satellite receiver
passing<00:01:26.700> directly<00:01:26.909> true<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> power<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
passing directly true here to power the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
passing directly true here to power the
LMB<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:28.710> pull<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> satellite<00:01:29.610> signal<00:01:30.000> ok

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
LMB they pull in the satellite signal ok

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.200 
LMB they pull in the satellite signal ok
so<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.409> feed<00:01:31.619> two<00:01:31.860> signals<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so we feed two signals in here and the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
so we feed two signals in here and the
output<00:01:33.720> signal<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.439> will<00:01:34.920> come<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.280> purely

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
output signal here will come out purely

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.679 
output signal here will come out purely
with<00:01:36.119> AM<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.340> single<00:01:38.340> cable<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:39.150> both<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
with AM a single cable with both the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
with AM a single cable with both the
satellite<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> TV<00:01:40.619> area<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.890> combined

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
satellite and the TV area of combined

energy ok now on fire end of this when

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280 
energy ok now on fire end of this when
we<00:01:44.009> run<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.340> cam<00:01:44.759> down<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:46.020> say<00:01:46.170> our

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
we run this cam down to would say our

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.960 
we run this cam down to would say our
living<00:01:46.590> room<00:01:46.740> things<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.790> can

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
living room things like this we can

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.840 
living room things like this we can
split<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> signal<00:01:48.780> back<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:49.979> ways<00:01:50.280> we

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
split the signal back out in two ways we

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.249 
split the signal back out in two ways we
can<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:51.119> something<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.600> faceplate

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
can use something like this faceplate

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.679 
can use something like this faceplate
here<00:01:52.530> which<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.490> also<00:01:53.640> stock<00:01:54.000> stuff<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.570> an

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
here which we also stock stuff as an

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.359 
here which we also stock stuff as an
Associated<00:01:55.140> product<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
Associated product this so we have a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.889 
Associated product this so we have a
single<00:01:56.579> cabling<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.509> break<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.719> out

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
single cabling and we can break it out

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.469 
single cabling and we can break it out
into<00:01:57.960> satellite<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.890> indeed<00:01:59.310> an<00:01:59.640> TV<00:02:00.149> erial

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
into satellite and indeed an TV erial

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.840 
into satellite and indeed an TV erial
and<00:02:00.659> also<00:02:01.020> AM<00:02:01.350> dab<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> an<00:02:02.100> area<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.670> mainly

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and also AM dab it an area but mainly

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.219 
and also AM dab it an area but mainly
it's<00:02:03.060> produced<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.509> hear<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> TV<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
it's produced to hear the TV and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.889 
it's produced to hear the TV and
satellite<00:02:04.409> would<00:02:04.740> use<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.329> alternatively<00:02:06.329> we

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
satellite would use it alternatively we

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.300 
satellite would use it alternatively we
can<00:02:07.049> actually<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.469> decision<00:02:07.920> -<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.069> use

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
can actually make a decision - we use

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.029 
can actually make a decision - we use
exactly<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.149> same<00:02:09.349> combiner<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:10.860> in

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
exactly the same combiner but now in

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.970 
exactly the same combiner but now in
Reverse<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.910> what<00:02:12.030> we'll<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.270> doing<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:12.690> is

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
Reverse so what we'll be doing here is

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.860 
Reverse so what we'll be doing here is
a<00:02:13.010> single<00:02:13.550> cable<00:02:13.760> out<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.239> then<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.480> split<00:02:14.720> the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
a single cable out and then we split the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.940 
a single cable out and then we split the
cable<00:02:15.050> back<00:02:15.319> out<00:02:15.500> into<00:02:15.680> now<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:18.590> order

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
cable back out into now and what order

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.800 
cable back out into now and what order
and<00:02:19.000> equipment<00:02:20.000> will<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.180> need<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.390> use<00:02:20.629> in

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
and equipment will you need to use in

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.030 
and equipment will you need to use in
conjunction<00:02:20.989> with<00:02:21.349> this<00:02:21.440> well<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.890> most

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
conjunction with this well the most

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.770 
conjunction with this well the most
obvious<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.819> connector<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.390> these<00:02:23.510> F

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
obvious one is the connector so these F

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.479 
obvious one is the connector so these F
connectors<00:02:24.260> here<00:02:24.409> so<00:02:24.830> if<00:02:24.920> you're<00:02:25.040> using<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
connectors here so if you're using a

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.050 
connectors here so if you're using a
pair<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.790> these<00:02:26.030> join<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.780> dense<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:28.129> D

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
pair of these join and dense and the D

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.140 
pair of these join and dense and the D
combine<00:02:29.390> or<00:02:29.599> split<00:02:29.840> out<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.110> signal<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.150> you

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
combine or split out the signal and you

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.839 
combine or split out the signal and you
would<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.540> use<00:02:32.930> an<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.560> total<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.069> six<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.580> F

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
would just use an a total of six and F

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.780 
would just use an a total of six and F
connectors<00:02:35.330> like<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.690> okay<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.670> can

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
connectors like this okay so and you can

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.550 
connectors like this okay so and you can
see<00:02:37.849> this<00:02:38.090> picker<00:02:38.360> ones<00:02:38.629> here<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.079> comes<00:02:39.349> with

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
see this picker ones here it comes with

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.610 
see this picker ones here it comes with
the<00:02:39.769> German<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.519> Marcos<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.599> it's<00:02:41.780> also<00:02:41.959> C<00:02:42.440> D
