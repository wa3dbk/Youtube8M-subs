00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.740

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.089
 Mr. and 2 plays against today 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 hatchback 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.830
 nieuwegein in the attack and playing in 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.050
 the orange 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.359
 level difference is large and yet knows 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.999
 a competition and some nervous beginnings 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.609
 with many missed opportunities such as this one 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.550
 the number 11 of vikas aalsmeer 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.730
 michael kampsteeg and she stays after it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.730
 more than three minutes still play 0 0 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.270
 well there he is, he was comforting 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.400
 sports the first goal of the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.030
 match three and all played for this 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.310
 and so it becomes a 0 last 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 match of the season in a good 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.230
 full flowers or here in Aalsmeer 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.240
 the smearers do charge one 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.240
 bit on the championship today 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.100
 goalkeeper Johan van Dijk four 2 and as 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.200
 moreover by no means 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.990
 promotion to the premier division 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.770
 because the first fiqas aalsmeer team 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.480
 is already playing in the premier league 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.840
 so the rules are nice goal 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.960
 inside pole of michael kampsteeg 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.680
 brings the score to 6 3 in the 11th minute 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.440
 the pace is already high from the first half 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 on the side of aalsmeer 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.979
 there is already a nice head start 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.550
 built up gardian van dijk and de 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.390
 goal 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.120
 he brings the score to 12 5 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.280
 caravan ooijman he misses and a break 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.549
 loves Nieuwegein and the goal 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.710
 comes in the name of lars by nature and it 5 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.130
 minutes that are predecessor of the dike 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.320
 but he doesn't understand it at all 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.960
 shot rue stays being stopped and then it is 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.159
 the cerexhe rink in the rebound that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.220
 still scores the score to 17 9 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.979
 with a few minutes for rest 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.189
 richie's a bad boss and then it is 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.789
 she would ring that runs away and menno 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:14.480
 van der grift who finishes very well 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.159
 he brings the score to 18 9 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.319
 another half hour song and this first 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.969
 half with a failed kite 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.500
 ruud has fouls 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.000
 nieuwegein 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.010
 and then the forest comforts the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.280
 rest on the scoreboard 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.349
 from 1910 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.349
 then the second half of Nieuwegein is already 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.480
 sure of relegation but surrenders and 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:40.090
 have not won this competition 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.090
 here with a goal from lars nature 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.189
 drink from neighborhood c house and then 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.200
 Violation of Nieuwegein 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:52.760
 so then people is taken by bass 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.359
 comfort and with this show penalty begins 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.730
 a series of failed attack attempts 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.829
 niels dekker on the crossbar second attempt then 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.829
 is not going well either 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.129
 lars van neighborhood ball is stopped 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.840
 gaza van dijk dan ball goes on the pole 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.930
 and so the score stays no less than six 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.959
 minutes unchanged above groin 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.909
 a rapid counterattack by nieuwegein 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.530
 and then the wilco sijbesma is with 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.199
 third goal of the match 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.199
 He ensures that Nieuweguin returns 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:26.349
 comes to 7 points with more than one 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:31.040
 15 minutes to play and the score is 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:33.290
 2516 a violation and a staff 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.750
 recorded by the keeper of nieuwegein 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.720
 and again a show penalty that misses 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.250
 Rick goes grunting under the bar 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.810
 nieuwegein 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.639
 the happy laugh is also possible 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.099
 actually nowhere at all about it 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.229
 is a strange game but the atmosphere 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.159
 is a good hand and festive mood 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:54.290
 here in the flower court in aalsmeer 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.349
 gerrit jan bos brings the lead again 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.079

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.419

 willems here already willems again 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:08.290

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.930
 from the lat pylon willems and the state 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.090

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.170
 then the tail of the match with 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.209
 menno van der grift 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.419
 but that show ball is also stopped 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.459
 and that's how the score stays 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.430
