pots and rock wall I've gotta I'm trying
out<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.790> hydroponic<00:00:15.480> system<00:00:15.900> i'm<00:00:16.109> actually

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
out a hydroponic system i'm actually

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.160 
out a hydroponic system i'm actually
going<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.940> use<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.150> during<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.630> winter<00:00:18.930> but

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
going to use this during the winter but

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
going to use this during the winter but
i<00:00:19.230> wanted<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.590> try<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.920> during<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.939> summertime

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
i wanted to try it during the summertime

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.439 
i wanted to try it during the summertime
the<00:00:21.949> reason<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> glass<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.850> top<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> there

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the reason that glass is on top of there

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.330 
the reason that glass is on top of there
is<00:00:24.720> because<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:27.330> i<00:00:28.019> don't<00:00:28.920> want<00:00:29.160> any

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
is because the i don't want any

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.460 
is because the i don't want any
additional<00:00:29.699> water<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.869> there<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
additional water to get in there it

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.290 
additional water to get in there it
deletes<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.510> fertilizer<00:00:33.510> water<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:36.270> i

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
deletes the fertilizer water and also i

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.139 
deletes the fertilizer water and also i
need<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.780> control<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.440> level<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.250> that's<00:00:38.969> why

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
need to control the level so that's why

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.260 
need to control the level so that's why
actually<00:00:40.140> i'd<00:00:40.230> love<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.590> rainwater<00:00:41.270> use

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
about controlling the level so i just

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.979 
about controlling the level so i just
put<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.250> together<00:00:47.610> today<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.690> something

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
new and also i put these stakes here to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.939 
new and also i put these stakes here to
make<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.670> easier<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:58.250> walk<00:00:59.250> underneath<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
make it easier to walk underneath the

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.009 
make it easier to walk underneath the
the<00:01:01.949> hops<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:03.180> eventually<00:01:03.329> be

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the hops which will eventually be

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:36.010 
the hops which will eventually be
growing

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.710 
winter I mean generally my goal is to
make<00:03:27.269> good<00:03:27.540> soil<00:03:28.190> by<00:03:29.190> mulching<00:03:29.850> and

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
make good soil by mulching and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
make good soil by mulching and
and<00:03:31.310> correct<00:03:32.310> gardening<00:03:33.230> this<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.470> really

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
and correct gardening this is really

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.990 
and correct gardening this is really
more<00:03:35.720> winter<00:03:36.920> greens<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.370> what<00:03:38.550> I'm<00:03:38.670> hoping<00:03:38.820> to

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
more winter greens is what I'm hoping to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.930 
more winter greens is what I'm hoping to
do<00:03:39.210> I've<00:03:39.930> got<00:03:40.230> kale<00:03:40.500> started<00:03:41.130> out<00:03:41.310> there<00:03:41.580> and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
do I've got kale started out there and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.480 
do I've got kale started out there and
if<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:43.050> works<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.620> think<00:03:43.830> that's<00:03:44.040> going<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.310> be

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
if that works I think that's going to be

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.080 
if that works I think that's going to be
my<00:03:44.700> main<00:03:44.940> focus<00:03:45.240> because<00:03:46.670> with<00:03:47.670> those<00:03:47.880> two

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
my main focus because with those two

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.700 
my main focus because with those two
trays<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.830> 8c<00:03:49.830> pots<00:03:50.130> each<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:53.160> should

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
trays of 8c pots each that that should

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.430 
trays of 8c pots each that that should
provide<00:03:55.710> quite<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.130> bit<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.750> green<00:03:57.750> leafy

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
provide quite a bit of green leafy

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.060 
provide quite a bit of green leafy
vegetable<00:03:59.010> for<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.460> winter<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.030> think<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
vegetable for the winter I think the the

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.720 
vegetable for the winter I think the the
harvest<00:04:02.730> time<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.209> 30<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.750> 40<00:04:04.080> days<00:04:04.610> after<00:04:05.610> you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
harvest time is 30 to 40 days after you

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.949 
harvest time is 30 to 40 days after you
plant<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:08.760> can<00:04:08.910> harvest<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.480> few

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
plant it and you can harvest a few

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.199 
plant it and you can harvest a few
leaves<00:04:10.230> at<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> time<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.820> harvest

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
leaves at a time and and so the harvest

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.380 
leaves at a time and and so the harvest
is<00:04:12.360> not<00:04:12.570> just<00:04:12.810> all<00:04:12.990> at<00:04:13.140> once<00:04:13.380> it's<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:14.790> goes

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
is not just all at once it's it goes

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.390 
is not just all at once it's it goes
over<00:04:15.690> time<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:17.420> that's<00:04:18.420> kind<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.080> my<00:04:19.859> plan<00:04:20.160> for

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
over time so that's kind of my plan for

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.480 
over time so that's kind of my plan for
the<00:04:20.519> winter<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:20.850> I'm<00:04:21.299> trying<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.720> out<00:04:21.870> outside

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
the winter and I'm trying it out outside

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.920 
the winter and I'm trying it out outside
using<00:04:23.490> something<00:04:23.910> called<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.360> crowd<00:04:24.660> ski

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
using something called the crowd ski

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.820 
using something called the crowd ski
method<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:26.610> is<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:27.830> hydroponic

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
method and that is a hydroponic

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.960 
method and that is a hydroponic
gardening<00:04:29.280> method<00:04:29.700> without<00:04:31.040> air<00:04:32.040> stones<00:04:32.430> and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
gardening method without air stones and

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.050 
gardening method without air stones and
without<00:04:33.150> an<00:04:33.419> air<00:04:33.570> pump<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:34.169> do<00:04:34.710> have<00:04:35.130> them<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.760> I'm

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
without an air pump I do have them I I'm

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.850 
without an air pump I do have them I I'm
probably<00:04:36.600> going<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.169> use<00:04:37.410> them<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:37.770> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
probably going to use them in the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.540 
probably going to use them in the
basement<00:04:38.010> but<00:04:39.410> outside<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.440> wanted<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.280> try<00:04:41.520> it

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
basement but outside I wanted to try it

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.140 
basement but outside I wanted to try it
without<00:04:41.850> any<00:04:42.440> electricity<00:04:43.440> at<00:04:44.340> all<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.940> see

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
without any electricity at all to see

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.810 
without any electricity at all to see
how<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.540> worked<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.169> what<00:04:47.010> that<00:04:47.190> is<00:04:47.220> is<00:04:47.430> you

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
how that worked and what that is is you

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.120 
how that worked and what that is is you
start<00:04:48.120> out<00:04:48.360> with<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.960> water<00:04:49.320> just<00:04:49.740> at<00:04:49.979> the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
start out with the water just at the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.830 
start out with the water just at the
bottom<00:04:50.430> of<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.700> seed<00:04:50.940> pot<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:53.300> if<00:04:54.300> wets<00:04:54.660> the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
bottom of the seed pot and if wets the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.500 
bottom of the seed pot and if wets the
rock<00:04:55.169> wall<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:56.100> seed<00:04:56.370> start<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.090> as<00:04:57.240> the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
rock wall the seed start and as the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.840 
rock wall the seed start and as the
water<00:04:57.840> evaporates<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.160> plants<00:04:59.580> take<00:04:59.790> up

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
water evaporates and the plants take up

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.440 
water evaporates and the plants take up
that<00:05:00.030> water<00:05:00.710> they<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:02.370> water<00:05:02.669> level<00:05:03.060> drops

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
that water they the water level drops

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.700 
that water they the water level drops
and<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.560> plants<00:05:05.280> haven't<00:05:05.750> wanted<00:05:06.750> one<00:05:07.500> inch

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
and the plants haven't wanted one inch

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.400 
and the plants haven't wanted one inch
to<00:05:07.979> two<00:05:08.160> inches<00:05:08.190> of<00:05:08.610> air<00:05:09.330> between<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.960> seed

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
to two inches of air between the seed

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.450 
to two inches of air between the seed
pod<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.130> water<00:05:12.290> where<00:05:13.290> their<00:05:13.770> roots<00:05:14.220> can

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
pod and the water where their roots can

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.010 
pod and the water where their roots can
actually<00:05:14.880> take<00:05:15.090> up<00:05:15.270> air<00:05:15.510> from<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.870> atmosphere

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
actually take up air from the atmosphere

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.080 
actually take up air from the atmosphere
and<00:05:17.510> that's<00:05:18.510> that's<00:05:19.380> how<00:05:20.010> it's<00:05:20.280> done<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:20.880> I've

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
and that's that's how it's done and I've

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.990 
and that's that's how it's done and I've
you<00:05:21.570> know<00:05:21.600> this<00:05:21.900> is<00:05:21.930> my<00:05:22.169> first<00:05:22.200> time<00:05:22.710> so<00:05:24.440> but

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
you know this is my first time so but

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.520 
you know this is my first time so but
that's<00:05:27.000> an<00:05:27.240> experiment<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:27.930> I'm<00:05:28.200> trying

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
that's an experiment that I'm trying

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.680 
that's an experiment that I'm trying
I've<00:05:28.919> got<00:05:29.190> enough<00:05:29.550> plant<00:05:29.880> food<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.270> mean<00:05:30.419> I<00:05:30.510> got

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
I've got enough plant food I mean I got

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.950 
I've got enough plant food I mean I got
five<00:05:30.960> pounds<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.470> plant<00:05:31.710> food<00:05:32.040> and<00:05:32.960> five

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
five pounds of plant food and five

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.640 
five pounds of plant food and five
teaspoons<00:05:35.479> should<00:05:36.479> be<00:05:36.630> enough<00:05:36.870> for<00:05:37.050> 30<00:05:37.320> days

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
teaspoons should be enough for 30 days

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.130 
teaspoons should be enough for 30 days
so<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.580> think<00:05:38.700> I've<00:05:39.060> got<00:05:39.090> enough<00:05:39.300> for<00:05:39.840> a<00:05:39.900> few

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
so I think I've got enough for a few

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.890 
so I think I've got enough for a few
years<00:05:40.200> here<00:05:41.010> too<00:05:41.190> at<00:05:41.970> least<00:05:42.210> for<00:05:42.479> those<00:05:42.599> two

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
years here too at least for those two

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.010 
years here too at least for those two
little

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
little

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.520 
little
those<00:05:45.009> two<00:05:45.220> little<00:05:45.370> trays<00:05:45.819> of<00:05:46.150> eight<00:05:46.530> plants

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
those two little trays of eight plants

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.650 
those two little trays of eight plants
each<00:05:48.750> so<00:05:49.750> that's<00:05:49.990> what<00:05:50.169> I'm<00:05:50.259> doing<00:05:50.289> today
