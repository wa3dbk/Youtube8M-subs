 and that's why the current national champion sings in the American event 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.890
 percent and then possibly this one to compete in these Pan-American 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.190
 Guadalajara 2011 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.190
 ep had the opportunity to participate in many countries 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.240
 percent 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.310
 roughly about 25 most talented countries in the world 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
 i fine are cantet 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.090
 in her she demonstrates it day by day in each training doing what I most 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.290
 like in rhythmic gymnastics is a sport that requires a lot of sacrifice 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.260
 a lot of effort 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.590
 responsibilities to stand at a-7 in the morning to go train and finish 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.530

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.550
 Mexico 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.610
 i for after presenting it proudly in other countries and that 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.609
 he that is at the top of bullfighting 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:17.680
 the national anthem with the flag ademys and with the highest I think 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.850
 which is something that 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.179
 that I would not change anything 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.179
 I commit myself to not asselin fight 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.970

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.540
 we ourselves have many qualities, maybe it touched me in 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.890
 rhythmic gymnastics 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.090
 another person in another sport at work and school 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:46.489
 I think that the share you want to achieve your objective always 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.369
 goals that is very important if you have a very high goal 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:55.430
 percent you are always going to have that goal there you are going to want to get there 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.479
 give him a lot of desire nothing is easy 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.949
 Believe me, I tell you from experience 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.749
 but if they really like it if they feed, they are passionate about fighting for those 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.309
 dreams 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.309
