felt for you

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.880 
felt for you
well<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.690> suspension<00:01:14.170> was<00:01:14.260> definitely<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.740> bit

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
well the suspension was definitely a bit

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.890 
well the suspension was definitely a bit
stiffer<00:01:15.130> but<00:01:15.550> I<00:01:15.670> think<00:01:15.970> getting<00:01:16.570> it<00:01:16.780> ready

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
stiffer but I think getting it ready

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.270 
stiffer but I think getting it ready
valve<00:01:17.200> handle<00:01:17.650> like<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.770> treat

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
valve handle like a treat

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.130 
valve handle like a treat
nice<00:01:18.700> now<00:01:19.120> let's<00:01:19.330> have<00:01:19.660> a<00:01:19.690> quick<00:01:19.870> little<00:01:20.020> chat

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
nice now let's have a quick little chat

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.620 
nice now let's have a quick little chat
about<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.890> engine<00:01:21.370> obviously<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:21.910> lot<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.240> snag

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
about the engine obviously a lot of snag

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.990 
about the engine obviously a lot of snag
a<00:01:22.750> lot<00:01:22.900> of<00:01:22.990> horsepower<00:01:23.370> super<00:01:24.370> smooth<00:01:24.730> this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
a lot of horsepower super smooth this

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.330 
a lot of horsepower super smooth this
thing<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.750> me<00:01:25.930> almost<00:01:26.590> feels<00:01:26.890> like<00:01:26.980> you<00:01:27.190> can

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
thing to me almost feels like you can

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.820 
thing to me almost feels like you can
ride<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.760> like<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.970> 250<00:01:28.600> or<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.810> 450<00:01:29.530> you've<00:01:29.650> got

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
ride it like a 250 or a 450 you've got

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.160 
ride it like a 250 or a 450 you've got
options<00:01:30.010> yeah<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.790> felt<00:01:31.060> very<00:01:31.150> smooth<00:01:31.690> but

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
options yeah it felt very smooth but

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.660 
options yeah it felt very smooth but
then<00:01:32.320> again<00:01:32.410> with<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.830> land<00:01:33.040> flow<00:01:33.250> goes<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.520> lot

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
then again with the land flow goes a lot

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.490 
then again with the land flow goes a lot
more<00:01:33.880> aggressive<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.990> just<00:01:35.170> handle<00:01:35.410> like

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
more aggressive and it just handle like

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.620 
more aggressive and it just handle like
any<00:01:35.680> other<00:01:35.800> 450<00:01:36.400> it's<00:01:36.850> great<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.330> have<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
any other 450 it's great to have the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.780 
any other 450 it's great to have the
option<00:01:38.080> of<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.590> leaner<00:01:38.800> fuel<00:01:39.190> coupling<00:01:39.670> or

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
option of the leaner fuel coupling or

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.580 
option of the leaner fuel coupling or
the<00:01:39.970> richer<00:01:40.270> one<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.720> can<00:01:40.870> tailor<00:01:41.140> make<00:01:41.290> it

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
the richer one so you can tailor make it

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.370 
the richer one so you can tailor make it
to<00:01:41.710> however<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.160> want<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.840> very<00:01:47.080> first

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
to however you want it the very first
