00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.299
 the appliance shop accounts for only 2% of the group's turnover 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.020
 factory floor gets more exciting but with china coming in taking up space 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 sending everything ready and even those who donate side will not be better know soon I 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.110
 I think I'm one of those who is 52 years old and works and I just started 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.390
 You're begging for a year together with a lot of desire to get punched on the point of a knife. 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.390
 hand 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.620
 but with firm hands at the helm the ideas are current lands 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 and in the list of projects will be creating the list of products for now 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 that part of the show split for now are missing 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.280
 will be part of the kitchen 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.400
 and by talking about competitors 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.830
 how will the experienced pike almost deal with them 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.340
 looks with references to the competition the days have passed very interesting 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.210
 if competition improves the best things in products 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.840
 and the worst in people have a 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.380
 facing competitor 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.060
 as someone who must be respected I try to follow 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.550
 the correct answers and theirs 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.370
 genoa truth 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.410
 and I try to believe the mistakes he made when you commit information 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.250
 of competition movements 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.600
 for we have antp national manufacturers association céline eu 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.070
 I am 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.110
 very 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.050
 and with him came winds 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.820
 the first made a victory with a relaunch 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.300
 a campaign from the beatles tobacco shop everyone here is another thing 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.460
 interesting 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.440
 what raises the price of them is born with we have ours any letter 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.650
 schedule 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.850
 our customer also from competitors 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.299
 so this is priceless you drink coffee with them 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.660
 he pulls the bag because his field 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.439
 It is at the counter that the customer appears 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.639
 but for him to reach out to those who need to advertise 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.409
 this is what made the brand his noun career in the minds of consumers 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.659
 second businessman 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.309
 who never said that he needed to buy a cigarette even if he was 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:22.749
 a debugger how poor they have been doing 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.620
 I think the propaganda 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.949
 there is no streak 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:30.799

 He arrived late very early but often in the afternoon. 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.339

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.059

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.760
 that meant canceling media and sms messages all the time 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.760
 all the time including and pain in the body with it was 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.069
 It really is an addiction more 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.369
 beneficial for work that give agility 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:27.189
