00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
how we tested this product in our cars

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.380 
how we tested this product in our cars
we<00:01:04.290> tested<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.979> Chris<00:01:05.549> Rainey's<00:01:05.909> Pro<00:01:06.180> Mod

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
we tested it in Chris Rainey's Pro Mod

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.920 
we tested it in Chris Rainey's Pro Mod
car<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> works<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.920> 10<00:01:08.280> seconds<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.240> 598

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
car so it works from 10 seconds to 598

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
car so it works from 10 seconds to 598
and<00:01:10.320> that's<00:01:10.799> where<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.189> came<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> to

and that's where we came up with it to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.600 
and that's where we came up with it to
put<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> market<00:01:13.040> fantastic<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.189> what

put it on the market fantastic now what

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.560 
put it on the market fantastic now what
are<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.909> these<00:01:14.970> other<00:01:15.090> things<00:01:15.240> here

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
are some of these other things here

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
are some of these other things here
again<00:01:16.259> another<00:01:16.560> guinea<00:01:17.280> pig<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.580> our<00:01:17.970> car

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
again another guinea pig for our car

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.960 
again another guinea pig for our car
this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> rear<00:01:19.650> Spragg<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> 904

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
this is a rear Spragg for a 904

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.420 
this is a rear Spragg for a 904
transmission<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.040> basically<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> weak

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
transmission and basically the weak

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.420 
transmission and basically the weak
links<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> 904<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.750> never<00:01:24.990> made<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.430> 3400

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
links in the 904 was never made for 3400

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
links in the 904 was never made for 3400
pounds<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:27.030> 600<00:01:27.540> plus<00:01:27.659> horsepower<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.710> you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
pounds in 600 plus horsepower so you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
pounds in 600 plus horsepower so you
start<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> fail<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> rear<00:01:29.700> Spragg<00:01:30.030> which<00:01:30.210> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
start to fail the rear Spragg which is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
start to fail the rear Spragg which is
integral<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> case<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.770> had<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> come

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
integral to the case so we had to come

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.580 
integral to the case so we had to come
up<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.659> Spragg<00:01:34.079> out<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
up with a way to get that Spragg out and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.440 
up with a way to get that Spragg out and
put<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> new<00:01:35.250> Spragg<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.060> would<00:01:36.180> hold<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
put a new Spragg in that would hold a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.109 
put a new Spragg in that would hold a
lot<00:01:36.600> more<00:01:36.630> power<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:38.159> dead<00:01:38.549> straight<00:01:38.909> in

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
lot more power and be dead straight in

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
lot more power and be dead straight in
the<00:01:39.240> case<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.590> an<00:01:40.710> important<00:01:41.100> part

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the case so that was an important part

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.800 
the case so that was an important part
for<00:01:41.340> us<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> come<00:01:41.790> up<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
for us to come up with and we have a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.420 
for us to come up with and we have a
Spragg<00:01:43.439> that'll<00:01:43.770> hold<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.979> thousand

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
Spragg that'll hold a thousand

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.340 
Spragg that'll hold a thousand
foot-pounds<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.659> transmission<00:01:45.990> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
foot-pounds in this transmission that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.660 
foot-pounds in this transmission that
was<00:01:46.470> never<00:01:46.710> meant<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> see<00:01:47.220> anything<00:01:47.460> like

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
was never meant to see anything like

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
working down back to the real high

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
working down back to the real high
horsepower<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.509> wanted<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.049> lightweight<00:01:55.470> gear

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
horsepower we wanted a lightweight gear

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.310 
horsepower we wanted a lightweight gear
set<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:56.850> give<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> couple<00:01:57.659> gears<00:01:58.110> with

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
set that would give a couple gears with

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440

weight<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.880> overall<00:02:14.690> weight<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.140> we<00:02:15.440> did

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
weight and overall weight and we did

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.100 
weight and overall weight and we did
that<00:02:15.800> by<00:02:16.040> making<00:02:16.340> an<00:02:16.610> all<00:02:16.819> aluminum<00:02:17.060> gear<00:02:17.870> set

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
that by making an all aluminum gear set

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.470 
that by making an all aluminum gear set
carrier<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:19.310> gun<00:02:19.550> drilled<00:02:19.790> output<00:02:20.209> shaft

carrier and a gun drilled output shaft

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.340 
carrier and a gun drilled output shaft
and<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:20.750> make<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.050> hundred<00:02:21.230> percent

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and we make it a hundred percent

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.740 
and we make it a hundred percent
in-house<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.550> like<00:02:22.760> all<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.180> our<00:02:23.300> products

and we've always been proud of that and
a<00:02:26.270> huge<00:02:26.540> thing<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.900> obviously<00:02:27.290> shaving<00:02:27.680> off

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
a huge thing is obviously shaving off

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
any of the weight is huge in racing it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.930 
any of the weight is huge in racing it
gets<00:02:30.530> expensive<00:02:31.040> when<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.430> into<00:02:31.640> exotic
