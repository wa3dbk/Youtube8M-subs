00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.080
 hey hey hey and it's even once again 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.320
 maneuver indication is a tip for you guys 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.940
 there because the street is so the galera the idea is 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.570
 ask and such 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.300
 the stock of the champion and we will talk 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.930
 no face and complicated decide to make a 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.750
 video 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.760
 so I'll pass on some tips so that 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.260
 It's really easy, we can do it. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.340
 so the first that what I 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.380
 I'll give 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.740
 I think it's very essential even this 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.350
 part of this tip is that when you 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.500
 entering is usually on handrail 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.840
 When you face the brother you go. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.370
 put this part here of the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.440
 central here 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.800
 he is well there too wear here 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.680
 O our part here with the installment plan is not 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.119
 here below and neither here nor in the middle of 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.930
 pected of the cinnamon of the foot of candle is the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.240
 aml is between the pedal and the cinnamon 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.740
 candle father where the railing and he 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.570
 fits in that part of the thing when you 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.950
 it's going to be bad for you 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.970
 he passes here between the cinnamon and the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.610
 pedal 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.810
 The first difference is trying to put 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.210
 this part on the railing because it's going 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.180
 leave it here 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.580
 the second tip is is that at the time of entering 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.560
 on the handrail that the first 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.460
 Are you going to do the part? 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.380
 maneuver is to get on the railing you 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.229
 You try to put the pet were you. 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.900
 plays with 180 having suffered with his brother 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.560
 you fall with the foot of the type pedal with the 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.090
 brother 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.909
 pizzano on there says when you 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.759
 stepping you will get that notion if you gave 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.350
 This guy is going to work. 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:08.950
 principle this is going to have a little brother 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:11.560
 also the tip is you do not serve no 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.410
 throw the 180 over here on the body 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.930
 no and you do not put your body forward 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.230
 and do not even put your body back you have 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:25.349
 that getting is a straight posture of the type 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.920
 You will and you will go here and now you will. 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.099
 be brave 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.950
 You play even with 70 she falls here. 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.840
 before that you step you give the hint the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.769
 silva camper did a little bit 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.300
 break will have a discount on the descent to 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.970
 part that you are fitting for is not 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.980
 That 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.920
 this part here 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.720
 it will stay between the pedal and the cinnamon 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.549
 Dodo can sell 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.879
 effect if it is to be done if it is not so 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.190
 Not even that 's how you're going to get it simple. 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:04.379
 will not stay at this you'll travel 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.379
 There you will try to control the bay. 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:06.870
 It was earned rare
