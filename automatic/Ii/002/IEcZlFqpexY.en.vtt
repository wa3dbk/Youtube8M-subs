that<00:02:37.290> well<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.640> kinda<00:02:38.909> creamy<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.420> as

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
that well but it's kinda creamy and as

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.839 
that well but it's kinda creamy and as
well<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.959> know<00:02:40.079> decent<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:41.519> bright

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849

that's<00:02:42.390> for<00:02:42.569> sure<00:02:42.689> i<00:02:42.720> think<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.170> i<00:02:43.260> were<00:02:43.409> a<00:02:43.439> lip

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
that's for sure i think if i were a lip

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.990 
that's for sure i think if i were a lip
liner<00:02:43.829> underneath<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.430> would<00:02:44.700> look<00:02:44.849> better

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
liner underneath it would look better

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.640 
liner underneath it would look better
but<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.390> don't<00:02:45.629> have<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> bright<00:02:46.200> orange<00:02:46.349> lip

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
and you can't really tell that it's got

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.970 
and you can't really tell that it's got
some<00:04:32.820> really<00:04:33.060> nice<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:33.930> read<00:04:34.620> read

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
some really nice just read read

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.870 
some really nice just read read
readiness<00:04:35.520> in<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.350> but<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:38.400> problem<00:04:38.760> with

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
readiness in it and but the problem with

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.910 
readiness in it and but the problem with
retro<00:04:39.150> features<00:04:39.510> is<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:40.620> going<00:04:40.800> to

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
retro features is that this is going to

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.500 
retro features is that this is going to
stay<00:04:41.220> in<00:04:41.250> my<00:04:41.430> hand<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:41.940> will<00:04:42.000> probably<00:04:42.270> have

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
stay in my hand and I will probably have

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.390 
stay in my hand and I will probably have
a<00:04:42.540> red<00:04:42.720> mark<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.050> my<00:04:43.230> hand<00:04:43.440> for<00:04:43.560> like<00:04:43.770> three<00:04:44.130> or

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
a red mark on my hand for like three or

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.110 
a red mark on my hand for like three or
four<00:04:44.460> days<00:04:45.050> um<00:04:46.220> it's<00:04:47.220> over<00:04:47.490> pigmented<00:04:47.970> or

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
four days um it's over pigmented or

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.220 
four days um it's over pigmented or
something<00:04:48.390> and<00:04:48.480> it<00:04:48.570> does<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.810> same<00:04:48.840> on<00:04:49.110> my

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
something and it does the same on my

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.190 
something and it does the same on my
lips<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:50.310> hate<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:51.390> I<00:04:51.420> put<00:04:51.930> on<00:04:53.000> retro

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
lips and I hate it so I put on retro

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.060 
lips and I hate it so I put on retro
futurist<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.790> you<00:04:57.090> know<00:04:57.270> it's<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.230> pretty<00:04:58.770> in

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
futurist and you know it's so pretty in

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.970 
futurist and you know it's so pretty in
pictures<00:04:59.400> and<00:05:00.140> here<00:05:01.140> i<00:05:01.380> think<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:01.770> really

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
pictures and here i think it really

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.650 
pictures and here i think it really
suits<00:05:02.430> me<00:05:02.610> because<00:05:03.060> i<00:05:03.090> like<00:05:03.420> that<00:05:03.660> red

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.270 

um

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
um

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.540 
um
but<00:05:10.240> like<00:05:10.420> I<00:05:10.600> said<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:11.020> stains<00:05:11.470> really<00:05:12.160> bad<00:05:12.340> and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
but like I said it stains really bad and

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.160 
but like I said it stains really bad and
actually<00:05:12.910> probably<00:05:13.630> shouldn't<00:05:13.960> have<00:05:14.050> put

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
actually probably shouldn't have put

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.740 
actually probably shouldn't have put
this<00:05:14.290> one<00:05:14.500> on<00:05:14.530> before<00:05:15.370> Cosmo<00:05:15.970> pop<00:05:16.180> because<00:05:16.450> i'm

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.840 
it off and hope that it will stop being
on<00:05:44.470> that

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.540 

so<00:05:47.850> here<00:05:48.300> is<00:05:48.420> cosmo<00:05:48.900> pop<00:05:49.170> if<00:05:49.470> there's<00:05:50.370> any

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
so here is cosmo pop if there's any

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.950 
so here is cosmo pop if there's any
right<00:05:50.820> around<00:05:51.030> it<00:05:51.240> it's<00:05:51.360> because<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.750> the

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
right around it it's because of the

00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:00.399 
right around it it's because of the
retro<00:05:52.260> futuristic<00:05:52.590> i<00:05:53.040> said<00:05:53.280> but

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.639 

I<00:06:00.529> think<00:06:01.129> it's<00:06:01.249> fucking<00:06:01.999> hideous<00:06:02.449> and<00:06:02.809> I<00:06:03.529> will
