00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
performance but it didn't do anything
negative<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.350> throw<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.619> in

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
negative so you can just throw it in

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.359 
negative so you can just throw it in
there<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.630> other<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.290> add<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:44.390> plus

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
there the other one you can add is plus

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.600 
there the other one you can add is plus

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the 30 frames per second cap so I didn't

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
the 30 frames per second cap so I didn't
need<00:01:58.049> own<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.850> add<00:02:00.570> those<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:02.520> click

need own so add those in and just click

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.359 
need own so add those in and just click
OK<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.540> should<00:02:03.719> save<00:02:03.930> them

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
OK and it should save them

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.119 
OK and it should save them
now<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.759> second<00:02:06.149> fix<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.899> helped<00:02:07.740> me<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
now for the second fix that helped me a

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.430 
now for the second fix that helped me a
lot<00:02:09.050> was<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.110> disable<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> Windows<00:02:11.400> error<00:02:11.879> log

why but according to rock star it makes

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.210 
why but according to rock star it makes
a<00:02:54.630> difference<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.170> as<00:02:55.470> far<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.830> know<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.070> has

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
a difference and as far as I know it has

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.000 
a difference and as far as I know it has
no<00:02:56.400> negative<00:02:56.610> effects<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:57.360> disabling<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.010> if

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
no negative effects for disabling it if

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.770 
no negative effects for disabling it if
it<00:02:59.160> does<00:02:59.870> whatever<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.910> now<00:03:03.210> for<00:03:03.270> people<00:03:03.690> who

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it does whatever so now for people who

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.470 
it does whatever so now for people who
are<00:03:03.870> running<00:03:03.960> crossfire<00:03:04.640> most<00:03:05.640> people<00:03:06.030> who

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
are running crossfire most people who

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.660 
are running crossfire most people who
set<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.380> their<00:03:07.530> own<00:03:07.560> systems<00:03:08.100> will<00:03:08.310> know<00:03:08.430> how

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
set up their own systems will know how

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.190 
set up their own systems will know how
to<00:03:08.730> disable<00:03:09.060> crossfire<00:03:09.570> but<00:03:09.780> those<00:03:09.960> who

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
to disable crossfire but those who

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680 
to disable crossfire but those who
bought<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> pre-built<00:03:11.340> system<00:03:11.910> or<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> laptop

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
that already had it set up for them

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.710 
that already had it set up for them
might<00:03:14.700> not<00:03:14.820> know<00:03:14.910> how<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.240> this<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.570> I'll

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
might not know how to do this so I'll

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.479 
might not know how to do this so I'll
quickly<00:03:15.840> go<00:03:16.050> over<00:03:16.350> just<00:03:16.560> how<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.950> disable<00:03:17.280> your

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
quickly go over just how to disable your

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.910 
quickly go over just how to disable your

I'm<00:03:32.670> not<00:03:32.940> going<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.120> do<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.270> though<00:03:33.420> because

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
I'm not going to do that though because

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.300 
I'm not going to do that though because
it'll<00:03:33.810> screw<00:03:34.050> up<00:03:34.110> my<00:03:34.230> recording<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.160> did

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
it'll screw up my recording and I did

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.340 
it'll screw up my recording and I did
that<00:03:35.459> last<00:03:35.580> time<00:03:35.700> accidentally<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.870> now<00:03:37.230> I'm

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
that last time accidentally and now I'm

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.040 
that last time accidentally and now I'm
redoing<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.770> video<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.510> leave<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.540> enabled

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
redoing the video so leave that enabled

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.540 
redoing the video so leave that enabled
for<00:03:40.230> me<00:03:40.350> but<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:41.040> reason<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.340> want<00:03:41.520> to

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
for me but the reason you want to

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.690 
for me but the reason you want to
disable<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.150> because<00:03:42.420> right<00:03:42.600> now

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
disable that is because right now

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.210 
disable that is because right now
crossfire<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.940> getting<00:03:45.560> negative<00:03:46.560> scaling

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
crossfire is getting negative scaling

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.000 
crossfire is getting negative scaling
with<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.760> crossfire<00:03:48.630> with<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.769> current

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
with the crossfire with the current

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.290 
with the crossfire with the current
drivers<00:03:50.370> I'm<00:03:50.700> using<00:03:50.910> 12.1<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:54.120> just

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
drivers I'm using 12.1 and that just

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.759 
drivers I'm using 12.1 and that just
basically<00:03:54.480> means<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.930> when<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.590> enable

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
basically means that when you enable

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:56.930 
basically means that when you enable
your<00:03:55.980> second<00:03:56.310> card<00:03:56.489> you're<00:03:56.610> going<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.790> get<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
your second card you're going to get a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.190 
your second card you're going to get a
little<00:03:57.030> less<00:03:57.180> performance<00:03:57.780> than<00:03:57.930> if<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.170> just

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
little less performance than if you just

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.550 
little less performance than if you just
used<00:03:58.830> one<00:03:59.070> card<00:03:59.370> for<00:03:59.820> running<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.690> game<00:04:00.840> so

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
used one card for running the game so

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.350 
used one card for running the game so
may<00:04:02.100> as<00:04:02.160> well<00:04:02.310> disable<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.820> for<00:04:02.970> now<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.239> wait

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
may as well disable it for now and wait

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.810 
may as well disable it for now and wait
for<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.600> driver<00:04:03.840> update<00:04:04.070> so<00:04:05.070> that's<00:04:05.640> what

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
for a driver update so that's what

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.270
