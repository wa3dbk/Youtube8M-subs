00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.720
 It happens again Louis US sends missiles this time 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.940
 Supplement them with UAVs 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.330
 To Iraq to help Iraq by al Qaeda 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.330
 CNN reported that after two years it will become home US troops from Iraq 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.289
 Obama administration to send fire rockets hell 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.449
 The unmanned drones survey the eagle to help the government forces fight the organization 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.910
 Affiliates of the base 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.830
 They believe the growth in the effect is according to the state 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.619
 Administration 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.219
 Statement by CNN officials 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.670
 As the first reported the New York Times rocket fire hell 75 but through Iraq 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.539
 Last week's plans call for 10 ScanEagle drones to be sent in advance 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.210
 2014 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.289
 Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Jennifer Sachi 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.420
 He said terrorists were seeking to gain control 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.930
 Terrorist arrives at land within 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.600
 The border rack of Louis was true that Iraq had seen an increase in 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 Your sectarian violence 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.740
 The New York State University community in the dominant Shia community 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.030
 Which is controlled by the government in the presence of sectarian tensions 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.590
 In sectarian tensions in Iraq for a really long time indeed 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.770
 I can not help but it does not feel like getting Lewis in the exact same circle again 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.659
 Let's remember 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.450
 This is not a new strategy in the region we supported 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 Ron's shooting against Iraq was dropped once in the fire 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 The Ayatollah came to power and we turned and supported Saddam 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.180
 Hussein during the Iraq war 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.229
 Against Iran it is this vicious circle where we then end up going to Iraq to 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.180
 Take down the leader of our hands 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.430
 Then we now said it is different because there is no Lewis 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.430
 We had a war in Iraq we installed 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.790
 The government believes that some people like the government chose them 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.829
 And now they're with us but we thought they were with us by the minute 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.930
 The same vicious circle can start again 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.110
 Yes I generally mean it is not just 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.680
 The location is precisely in this area that this kind of thing happens and that is it 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.390
 How to buy most of our worst right 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.770
 These proxy wars are where we only kinda then send a bunch of weapons 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.390
 Help someone and let them just to help them out in combat 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.900
 I am as something completely separate from the weather you will eventually need to use 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.879
 More than our weapons against those weapons we sold or gave them to 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.550
 They turn 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.510
 Against us so that they are no longer a strategic ally it is just this tired age 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.260
 Military industrial complex and short-sighted 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.580
 Foreign policy approach that lied together to fight us our own 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.840
 Weapons or at least 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.030
 Against individuals we supported at one time it's just incredible 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.400
 Yes I and you know when drone strikes aspiring goes bad 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.060
 Right that I could not assume that a civilian city that was killed 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.120
 Going to believe that this is well, perhaps it came from Iraqis now that they are 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.940
 Maybe just going to assume that there is another US-term attack 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.680
 I suddenly boom you've got hundreds of al-Qaeda recruit and yes 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.209
 Talk about the assumption that bombs drone attacks come from a certain place 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.480
 I got an interesting story for you a little later on 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.519
 Shell and teasing that story inadvertently he's so good at it 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.690
 Do not even have that I just come naturally to him
