learning drop D tuning in this lesson so

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.259 
learning drop D tuning in this lesson so
the<00:00:13.009> first<00:00:13.219> thing<00:00:13.309> we<00:00:13.490> need<00:00:13.580> to<00:00:13.639> do<00:00:13.849> is<00:00:14.059> tune

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
the first thing we need to do is tune

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.299 
the first thing we need to do is tune
our<00:00:14.450> guitars<00:00:14.809> down<00:00:15.259> to<00:00:15.440> drop<00:00:15.650> D<00:00:15.919> let<00:00:16.190> me

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
our guitars down to drop D let me

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.620 
our guitars down to drop D let me
explain<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:16.880> you<00:00:16.910> what<00:00:17.090> that<00:00:17.180> means<00:00:17.240> real

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
explain to you what that means real

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.439 
explain to you what that means real
quick<00:00:18.039> and<00:00:19.039> this<00:00:19.279> is<00:00:19.430> our<00:00:19.550> standard<00:00:19.849> bar<00:00:20.179> chord

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
quick and this is our standard bar chord

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.050 
quick and this is our standard bar chord
shape<00:00:20.720> like<00:00:20.990> an<00:00:21.109> a<00:00:21.230> right<00:00:21.529> here

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.210 

we're<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> make<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.050> easier<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.980> play

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
we're going to make that easier to play

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.760 
we're going to make that easier to play
by<00:00:26.550> tuning<00:00:26.939> our<00:00:27.119> e<00:00:27.480> string<00:00:27.869> our<00:00:28.109> low<00:00:28.560> E<00:00:28.590> string

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
by tuning our e string our low E string

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.659 
by tuning our e string our low E string
down<00:00:29.669> to<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> d<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.199> an<00:00:31.289> octave<00:00:31.800> below<00:00:32.189> our

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
down to a d so it's an octave below our

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.190 
down to a d so it's an octave below our
open<00:00:33.270> D<00:00:33.480> string<00:00:33.510> so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.670 

you

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.520 

that's<00:00:43.400> pretty<00:00:43.550> cool<00:00:43.930> so<00:00:44.930> that's<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.230> idea

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
that's pretty cool so that's the idea

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.290 
that's pretty cool so that's the idea
just<00:00:45.740> tune<00:00:45.950> your<00:00:46.100> e<00:00:46.220> string<00:00:46.550> to<00:00:46.700> an<00:00:46.820> octave

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
just tune your e string to an octave

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.500 
just tune your e string to an octave
below<00:00:47.450> our<00:00:47.870> open<00:00:48.680> D<00:00:48.860> string<00:00:49.150> now<00:00:50.150> if<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:50.420> have

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
below our open D string now if we have

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.150 
below our open D string now if we have
that<00:00:50.690> chord<00:00:51.200> shape<00:00:51.470> we<00:00:51.710> made<00:00:51.860> a<00:00:51.920> while<00:00:52.130> ago

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
that chord shape we made a while ago

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.030 
that chord shape we made a while ago
that<00:00:52.730> regular<00:00:53.210> a<00:00:53.420> power<00:00:53.750> chord<00:00:54.080> shape<00:00:54.350> it's

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
that regular a power chord shape it's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.100 
that regular a power chord shape it's
simplified<00:00:55.730> now<00:00:56.150> to<00:00:56.210> where<00:00:56.480> we<00:00:56.630> only<00:00:56.780> have<00:00:56.989> to

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
simplified now to where we only have to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.260 
simplified now to where we only have to
have<00:00:57.140> one<00:00:57.290> finger<00:00:57.920> two<00:00:58.100> to<00:00:58.580> make<00:00:58.730> that<00:00:58.940> chord

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
have one finger two to make that chord

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.270 
have one finger two to make that chord
with<00:00:59.450> instead<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.809> playing<00:01:00.020> like<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:00.440> you

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
with instead of playing like this you

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.799 
with instead of playing like this you
just<00:01:01.550> lay<00:01:01.700> your<00:01:01.820> index<00:01:02.150> finger<00:01:02.450> or<00:01:02.540> whatever

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
just lay your index finger or whatever

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.630 
just lay your index finger or whatever
thing<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.050> want<00:01:03.410> across<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.070> bottom<00:01:04.309> three

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
thing you want across the bottom three

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.790 
thing you want across the bottom three
strings

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.240 

play<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.760> three<00:01:08.910> at<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.030> same<00:01:09.120> time<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.320> it's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
play all three at the same time so it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.680 
play all three at the same time so it's
easier<00:01:11.670> instead<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> shifting<00:01:12.270> around<00:01:12.480> like

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
easier instead of shifting around like

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.660 
easier instead of shifting around like
this<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.320> fast<00:01:13.590> stuff<00:01:13.770> fast<00:01:14.430> chord

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this for really fast stuff fast chord

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.150 
this for really fast stuff fast chord
changes<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.300> just<00:01:15.510> play<00:01:15.690> a<00:01:18.860> lot<00:01:19.860> easier

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
changes you can just play a lot easier

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.310 
changes you can just play a lot easier
to<00:01:20.730> manage<00:01:20.970> fast<00:01:21.450> chord<00:01:21.720> changes<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.290> that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to manage fast chord changes like that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080 
to manage fast chord changes like that
so<00:01:23.010> we're<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> learn<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.550> little<00:01:23.850> riff
