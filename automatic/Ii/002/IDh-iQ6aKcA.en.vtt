it's<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> same<00:00:34.410> size<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:35.070> film<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:37.020> we

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
remember this that a full frame lens

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.010 
remember this that a full frame lens
that<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.920> designed<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.759> full-frame<00:02:00.420> FX

on<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.939> DX<00:02:05.939> camera<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.469> using<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
on a DX camera because you're using the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.570 
on a DX camera because you're using the
center<00:02:08.399> point<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.300> most<00:02:09.539> sharp<00:02:10.020> point<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
center point the most sharp point of a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.580 
center point the most sharp point of a
lens<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
lens the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.220

the<00:02:12.709> smaller<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.489> center<00:02:14.030> area<00:02:14.450> because<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
the smaller the center area because the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.800 
the smaller the center area because the
DX<00:02:15.620> sensor<00:02:16.220> or<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.610> crop<00:02:16.819> sensor<00:02:17.209> is<00:02:17.360> smaller

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
DX sensor or the crop sensor is smaller

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.440 
DX sensor or the crop sensor is smaller
it's<00:02:18.230> only<00:02:18.739> going<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.040> use<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.489> sweet<00:02:19.849> spot<00:02:20.209> of

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
it's only going to use the sweet spot of

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.839 
it's only going to use the sweet spot of
the<00:02:20.569> lens<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.050> sweet<00:02:21.739> spot<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.250> usually

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
the lens and the sweet spot is usually

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.449 
the lens and the sweet spot is usually
the<00:02:23.120> center<00:02:23.510> portion<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.860> that's<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.280> good

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
the center portion so that's a good

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.910 
the center portion so that's a good
thing<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.420> put<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> DX<00:02:27.290> lens<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.860> a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
thing can you put a DX lens on a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.120 
thing can you put a DX lens on a
full-frame<00:02:28.550> camera<00:02:29.180> yes<00:02:30.019> on<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.500> Nikon<00:02:30.950> end

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
full-frame camera yes on the Nikon end

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.420 
full-frame camera yes on the Nikon end
you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.380> will<00:02:33.620> then<00:02:33.860> drop<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
you can but it will then drop the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.130 
you can but it will then drop the
megapixels<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.120> just<00:02:35.390> use<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.750> smaller

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
megapixels and just use the smaller

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.440 
megapixels and just use the smaller
portion<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.920> sensor<00:02:37.370> not<00:02:37.910> something<00:02:38.360> you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
portion of the sensor not something you

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.660 
portion of the sensor not something you
really<00:02:38.480> want<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.200> do<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.069> brings<00:02:40.310> up<00:02:40.519> a

dilemma when you're buying lenses do you

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.000 
dilemma when you're buying lenses do you
want<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.760> invest<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.690> cropped<00:02:45.080> sensor<00:02:45.470> lens

want to invest in a cropped sensor lens

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.870 
want to invest in a cropped sensor lens
or<00:02:46.610> should<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.030> buy<00:02:48.250> full-frame<00:02:49.250> lenses<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
or should you buy full-frame lenses and

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.330 
or should you buy full-frame lenses and
use<00:02:50.030> them<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.480> crop<00:02:50.690> sensor<00:02:51.200> most<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.160> your

get into the zoom range you don't need

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
to worry about buying a DX only lens I

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.809 
to worry about buying a DX only lens I
would<00:03:36.140> invest<00:03:36.440> in<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.829> better<00:03:37.069> glass<00:03:37.400> at<00:03:37.640> that

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
would invest in the better glass at that

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.300 
would invest in the better glass at that
point<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.359> just<00:03:38.810> get<00:03:39.019> regular<00:03:39.470> lenses<00:03:40.069> that

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
point and just get regular lenses that

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.370 
point and just get regular lenses that
will<00:03:40.549> work<00:03:40.850> when<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.510> step<00:03:41.870> up<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.139> a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
will work when you step up to a

full-frame<00:03:42.889> camera<00:03:43.310> if<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:43.639> do<00:03:43.970> but<00:03:44.900> it's<00:03:45.709> one

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
full-frame camera if you do but it's one

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.920 
full-frame camera if you do but it's one
of<00:03:46.069> those<00:03:46.190> things<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.670> need<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.000> get<00:03:47.329> some<00:03:47.569> DX

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
of those things you need to get some DX

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.500 
of those things you need to get some DX
lenses<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.829> compensate<00:03:49.459> for<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.910> wide<00:03:50.150> angle

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
lenses to compensate for the wide angle

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.770 
lenses to compensate for the wide angle
remember<00:03:51.500> any<00:03:51.739> DX<00:03:52.549> lens<00:03:52.819> that<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:53.180> put<00:03:53.480> on

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
remember any DX lens that you put on

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.280 
remember any DX lens that you put on
like<00:03:54.709> an<00:03:54.859> 18<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.489> 50<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.389> multiply<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.049> by

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
like an 18 to 50 you multiply it by

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.870 
like an 18 to 50 you multiply it by
either<00:03:57.500> 1.5<00:03:58.489> or<00:03:59.049> 1.6<00:04:00.049> on<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.530> can<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.040> 1.5<00:04:01.639> on

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
either 1.5 or 1.6 on the can and 1.5 on

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.849 
either 1.5 or 1.6 on the can and 1.5 on
the<00:04:02.000> Nikon<00:04:02.480> that's<00:04:03.049> just<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.739> get

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
the Nikon that's just so that you get

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.470 
the Nikon that's just so that you get
the<00:04:04.010> 35<00:04:04.670> millimeter<00:04:05.230> equivalent<00:04:06.850> so<00:04:07.850> you're

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
the 35 millimeter equivalent so you're

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.199 
the 35 millimeter equivalent so you're
going<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.660> get<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:09.220> more<00:04:10.220> depth<00:04:10.489> of<00:04:10.609> field

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
going to get a more depth of field

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.840 
going to get a more depth of field
well<00:04:12.200> no<00:04:12.470> not<00:04:12.980> more<00:04:13.250> depth<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.579> field<00:04:13.790> but

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
well no not more depth of field but

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.479 
well no not more depth of field but
you're<00:04:14.000> going<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.150> get<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.299> nicer<00:04:15.139> image<00:04:15.560> this

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
you're going to get a nicer image this

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.690 
you're going to get a nicer image this
is<00:04:16.669> what<00:04:16.850> FX<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:17.479> better<00:04:17.690> at<00:04:17.930> high<00:04:18.380> ISO<00:04:18.769> s<00:04:19.190> there

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700
