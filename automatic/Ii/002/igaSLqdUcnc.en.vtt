00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
I would suggest finding one in traffic

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.819 
I would suggest finding one in traffic
that<00:00:58.420> doesn't<00:00:58.690> have<00:00:58.810> one

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
that doesn't have one

pros<00:01:15.920> for<00:01:16.130> this<00:01:16.250> vehicle<00:01:16.430> it's<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.360> fast

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
pros for this vehicle it's a fast

pros for this vehicle it's a fast
acceleration<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.649> can<00:01:18.830> take<00:01:19.070> off<00:01:19.280> pretty

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
acceleration so it can take off pretty

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.630 
acceleration so it can take off pretty
quick<00:01:19.759> but<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.060> doesn't<00:01:20.360> have<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.479> top<00:01:21.020> speed<00:01:21.640> it

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
quick but it doesn't have a top speed it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.399 
quick but it doesn't have a top speed it
can<00:01:22.789> take<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.030> good<00:01:23.360> deal<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.810> damage<00:01:24.020> before
