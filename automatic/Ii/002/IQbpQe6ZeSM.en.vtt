00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.180

 Yeah. You showed me a really nice look today. 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.910
 First of all, I overtook my team and got my first two winnings. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.410
 I've been sorry for a while. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.579

 Today is the first game I played . 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:46.649
 Did you have a bang that was difficult to nose during the game? 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:50.579
 Maybe at the boundaries of the original composition I Small slash-and-burn is fit to be a little easier 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:56.219
 I know that I build a gasy greedy 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.859
 I was a bit tough, but Joong-hwan made me debt to finish it too 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:04.350
 I think I got a chance. 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.930

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.830
 Kim Yu-jin Sunsan I think the control was really alive 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.740
 I'm really curious about the second game. 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.540
 What's going to happen to you other than a digger? 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:27.780
 I think you've got that much about the extent there's a Pro user 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:32.369
 I think it's a sense, and I'm broadcasting it, so I think it's showing up.
