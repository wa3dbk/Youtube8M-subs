00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello how about community all my name 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.360
 is Catalan 343 and I have a lot to cover 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.280
 so I will not give nice welcome the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.900
 today the first news and more 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.610
 relevant in my opinion is the first 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.830
 official art concept that we got 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.169
 hello xbox which has enough people 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.470
 he sent me that he will analyze by the way and not 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.470
 just kidding 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.589
 but I saw it before he sent it to me 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.270
 although they did not confirm directly 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.220
 that it was about the project is quite 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.050
 obvious that it was like this anyway here is the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.990
 photo that they wanted to what 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.730
 will analyze and everything but the truth that 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.770
 has was in the roll that is the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.200
 new halo but honestly tells us 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.120
 basically nothing and not for being neither 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.650
 lazy or pooper our 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.360
 confirmation is that at some point the 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.980
 game we will see to infinity and on a 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.930
 kind of city with architecture 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.180
 human being what captivated me most was that 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.370
 barrier that looks similar to a halo maybe 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.590
 a ring is positioned around the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.210
 planet cartographically what we know 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.200
 of the location of the Gauls yet 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.970
 existing 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.010
 yet we know that 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.030
 facilities can move so 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.100
 who knows 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.260
 another thing that I come to ruin them is that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.060
 it's not regulation if it tells you to let go 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.160
 tears of now you're all depressed 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.720
 pointing to your rich diet was 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.460
 crystallized to the point that the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.410
 hell it looked holiday in 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.030
 comparison and we also know that your 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.250
 recolonization was not right until 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.650
 mid 30 years after its fall 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.750
 certainly with the revelation of the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.460
 photo or concept of art they said that in 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.380
 a not too distant future could 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.950
 finally share information of the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.050
 game 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.330
 I imagine that during March dates 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.640
 as with halo 4 it will be nice to upload many 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.440
 videos as before another very short news 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.509
 What I want to share with you is that hygiene 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.009
 puntocom has confirmed that hello 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.690
 xbox one will go on sale during 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.150
 some date of this year 2014 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.340
 I do not remember where I had seen this 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.440
 thanks to jairo escalation we have the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.180
 possibility but not confirmation that 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.280
 maybe we see brutes fighting our 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.320
 side on the battlefield that is 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.480
 our team or by shooting at the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.310
 bad I think it is I understood too 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.130
 they showed us an appearance where is that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.110
 go better so also maybe the best 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.630
 let's see return for the next delivery 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.360
 it's weird because they've been extinct since 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.670
 the fall of rage I guess they got 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.000
 at a cost under the earth and they went out 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.250
 then I feel that something like that escapes me 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.290
 my youth and also that microsoft is 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.000
 looking for or was by a director for a 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.100
 episodic issue related to his 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.110
 next halo game is to say that 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.270
 they were looking for or looking for a guy who 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.970
 will help with an angel related series 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.070
 or xbox one we do not know anything about the series 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.110
 but they searched more specifically for 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.330
 something similar to game content 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.980
 think of Spartans and how it worked 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.690
 through episodes that were mediocre 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.190
 but nevertheless we expected as 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.130
 vicious each week is part 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.320
 all bad was a lot of fun 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.910
 first time although there were episodes that 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.930
 they left me bundled up with them during 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.850
 several plays 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.470
 Microsoft is looking to improve the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.390
 experience provided with spartans 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.270
 using the new powers with advantage 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.310
 celestial magic of the xbox one this 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.870
 look for something similar to hell of war brown 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.330
 total and last but not least 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.460
 important or maybe if they have disk 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.290
 3 x 3 industris left the company 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.950
 2 days ago to work in others 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.660
 Projects 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.130
 his wife also the trees for three 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.260
 industry did the same thing 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.580
 recently at least I guess it is 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.620
 a good love story who 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.060
 he worked as artistic director of 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.640
 three four of industries but it was 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.590
 replaced by esparto thank god 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.240
 for those who do not know is part was the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.460
 responsible for art concepts 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.930
 Halo 4 initials I'm putting now 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.940
 same on screen some of your 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.340
 art concepts of other projects and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.100
 I'm not sure and the truth is that they look 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.180
 period I have my expectations so high 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.790
 who are complaining about the 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.040
 pollution and almost without forgetting 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.080
 remember that filtered photo that upload my 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.320
 previous video as it turns out that they had 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.320
 plus 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.950
 short story all are false I should 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.230
 analyze them an elite that the four weapons 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.310
 of the umh etc even if they were real 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.230
 they do not tell us 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.540
 and I just covered basically two 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.849
 weeks of walking weak in my defense 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.500
 I can say that I was on vacation and 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.600
 you know if there is more news there is more 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.640
 videos and there's more news 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.200
 remember that I 've always loved that 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.880
 it's all for this video and if you liked it 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.290
 so my work here is done 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.980
 I say goodbye to you and we'll see each other 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.980
 until the next tasting a 3-4-3 out
