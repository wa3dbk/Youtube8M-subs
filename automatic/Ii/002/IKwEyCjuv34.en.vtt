00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello everyone today I bring you this look 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.420
 rocker that you start to see the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 hair sideways these frosted textures 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.490
 I hope you like it very much and that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.490
 enjoy 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.300
 for the look of today we will need as 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.619
 always wash the hair hydrate it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 put a foam base and let's 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.380
 work a hair diffuser against 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.570
 the more disheveled we are better then what 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.940
 we can texturize we will use a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 Wave flat iron does not make 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.900
 we have to do all the hair because 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.510
 it would be very very laborious let's work 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.449
 so some hair then we started then 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.860
 a little those that have stayed more 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.820
 smoothest hairs 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.820
 we will raise it 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.079
 it's another heavier wave type 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.120
 different I bring you this tool 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.990
 so you can see that it also offers 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.090
 many possibilities 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.520
 especially for those who have the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.600
 Finite hair looks great because it gives 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.600
 very much volume 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.090
 so a bit in the locks that we go 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.090
 not seeing all 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.400
 and how are we going to do something whole 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.980
 little bit this look that starts to see 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.690
 in some red shape and so we're going to 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.040
 go ironing in that direction to go 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.040
 Settling the hair a little 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.640
 let's say textured more locks 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.110
 and we have already been giving our hair 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.000
 side 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.940
 so that we have an effect like that, toupee 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.090
 as old the gesture of before 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.710
 was doing like that then come back we put a 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.710
 little bit of lacquer that does not fall out 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.239
 and volume of the mane we are separating 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.490
 the curls so we have volume and 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.010
 here we are going to make a detail 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.550
 as up we are going to place the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.370
 pin you can make braids in this 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.870
 case let's do a twisted and let's 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.280
 stretching the hair a lot as 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.280
 up and twisting it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.870
 and here we are going to put a hairpin 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.180
 from behind so that we are not seen 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.659
 once we have fixed the lateral 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.600
 there tight enough that it helps us to 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:21.160
 above we separated the curls a little 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.160
 so that we have more volume 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.970
 we put the toupee a little 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.020
 this is exaggerated as it dares 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.090
 and it would be our rocker look 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.840
 good girls up here the video today 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.520
