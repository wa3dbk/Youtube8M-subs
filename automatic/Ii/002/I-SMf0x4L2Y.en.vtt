00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
this piece and we spawn trapping them

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.539

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
going to take us around fifty percent

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.000 
going to take us around fifty percent
health<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.019> want<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.349> start<00:03:49.500> backing<00:03:49.769> away

health you want to start backing away

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.759 
health you want to start backing away
from<00:03:50.540> from<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.049> enemies<00:03:52.319> with<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.620> and

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
from from the the enemies with it and

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.339 
from from the the enemies with it and
you<00:03:52.859> can<00:03:53.010> use<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.760> sprint<00:03:54.329> I<00:03:54.569> don't<00:03:55.079> know<00:03:55.169> how

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
you can use the sprint I don't know how

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.740 
you can use the sprint I don't know how
many<00:03:55.380> times<00:03:55.799> I've<00:03:56.269> played<00:03:57.269> with<00:03:57.419> people

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
many times I've played with people

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.050 
many times I've played with people
randomly<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:59.280> had<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.669> tell<00:03:59.880> them<00:03:59.910> that

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
randomly and I had to tell them that

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.729 
randomly and I had to tell them that
there's<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.389> sprint<00:04:00.750> feature<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.319> tank<00:04:01.560> if

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
there's a sprint feature on the tank if

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.140 
there's a sprint feature on the tank if
you<00:04:01.889> hold<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.190> left<00:04:02.340> trigger<00:04:02.489> down<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:03.000> go

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
you hold the left trigger down you go

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.270 
you hold the left trigger down you go
faster<00:04:03.720> but<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.049> loses<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.530> mobility<00:04:05.069> of<00:04:05.130> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
faster but it loses the mobility of the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.039 
faster but it loses the mobility of the
tank<00:04:05.519> but<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.209> can<00:04:06.359> use<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.810> get<00:04:06.930> away

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
tank but you can use that to get away

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.640 
tank but you can use that to get away
from<00:04:07.230> certain<00:04:07.590> areas<00:04:07.829> like<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:10.470> that

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
from certain areas like like that

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.140 
from certain areas like like that
there's<00:04:10.859> rockets<00:04:11.220> for<00:04:11.340> example<00:04:11.790> like<00:04:11.910> if

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
there's rockets for example like if

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.970 
there's rockets for example like if
you're<00:04:12.299> fighting<00:04:12.630> another<00:04:12.810> tank<00:04:13.139> you<00:04:13.470> what<00:04:13.950> I
