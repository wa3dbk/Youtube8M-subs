00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.100 
that is check the version in force ok
it's<00:02:35.280> running<00:02:35.670> with<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.120> jellybean<00:02:36.660> hundred

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
it's running with the jellybean hundred

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.090 
it's running with the jellybean hundred
for<00:02:37.590> point-to-point<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.790> right<00:02:39.390> now<00:02:40.100> let's

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
for point-to-point to right now let's

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.710 
for point-to-point to right now let's
just<00:02:41.250> shake<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.580> brightness

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.750 

it's<00:02:45.290> probably<00:02:45.470> yeah<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.280> maximum

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
it's probably yeah it's in the maximum

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.510 
it's probably yeah it's in the maximum
brightness<00:02:46.940> right<00:02:47.450> now<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:48.020> will<00:02:48.680> put<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:48.980> and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
brightness right now I will put it and

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.680 
brightness right now I will put it and
decide<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:50.750> an<00:02:50.900> IPS<00:02:51.350> screen<00:02:52.690> this

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
decide this is an IPS screen this

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.530 
decide this is an IPS screen this
product<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.790> minimum

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
product so this is the minimum

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.960 
product so this is the minimum
brightness<00:02:56.750> right<00:02:57.410> now<00:02:57.620> which<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.280> think<00:02:58.580> a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
brightness right now which is I think a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.050 
brightness right now which is I think a
bit<00:02:59.150> high<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.610> maximum

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
bit high and this is the maximum

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.080 
bit high and this is the maximum
brightness<00:03:05.680> molestie<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.800> storage<00:03:07.310> in<00:03:07.820> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
brightness molestie the storage in the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.840 
brightness molestie the storage in the
inside<00:03:08.480> is<00:03:08.780> got<00:03:09.200> probably<00:03:09.680> an<00:03:09.890> eight<00:03:10.370> gigabyte

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
inside is got probably an eight gigabyte

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.610 
inside is got probably an eight gigabyte
version<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:11.690> got<00:03:11.840> make<00:03:12.050> your<00:03:12.260> light<00:03:12.410> version

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
version we got make your light version

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.380 
version we got make your light version
right<00:03:13.010> now<00:03:13.240> and<00:03:14.240> it<00:03:14.390> got<00:03:14.830> one<00:03:15.830> gigabytes

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
right now and it got one gigabytes

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.540 
right now and it got one gigabytes
gigabyte<00:03:17.390> RAM<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.620> inside<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.220> running

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
gigabyte RAM in the inside is running

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.760 
gigabyte RAM in the inside is running
with<00:03:19.700> quad-core<00:03:19.970> processor<00:03:20.810> probably<00:03:21.530> at<00:03:21.590> one

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
with quad-core processor probably at one

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.360 
with quad-core processor probably at one
point<00:03:22.040> three<00:03:22.220> gigahertz<00:03:23.080> quad-core

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
point three gigahertz quad-core

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.790 
point three gigahertz quad-core
processor<00:03:25.600> has<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:26.840> tried<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.170> camera<00:03:27.500> to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
processor has you tried the camera to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.090 
processor has you tried the camera to
the<00:03:28.220> 8<00:03:28.310> megapixel<00:03:28.490> and<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.950> 0.3<00:03:30.950> megapixel

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
the 8 megapixel and the 0.3 megapixel

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.210 
the 8 megapixel and the 0.3 megapixel
front<00:03:31.760> camera<00:03:31.820> so<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.040> 8<00:03:34.040> megapixel

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
front camera so this is the 8 megapixel

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.470 
front camera so this is the 8 megapixel
camera<00:03:35.030> working<00:03:35.300> right<00:03:35.690> now<00:03:35.860> which<00:03:36.860> is<00:03:36.890> a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
camera working right now which is a

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.050 
camera working right now which is a
vibrating<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.750> bit<00:03:39.190> it's<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.459> think<00:03:40.610> it's

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
vibrating a bit it's I think it's

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
vibrating a bit it's I think it's
it's<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.050> good<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.459> I'm<00:03:44.670> focusing<00:03:44.970> for<00:03:45.780> a

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
it's not so good and I'm focusing for a

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.970 
it's not so good and I'm focusing for a
less<00:03:46.680> bright<00:03:47.900> for<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> product<00:03:49.410> or<00:03:49.560> something

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
less bright for a product or something

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.190 
less bright for a product or something
or<00:03:50.160> someone<00:03:50.640> who<00:03:51.120> has<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.300> less<00:03:51.540> brightness

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
or someone who has a less brightness

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.100 
or someone who has a less brightness
there<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.770> make<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:52.980> picture

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
there and make a picture

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.530 
there and make a picture
yeah<00:03:55.740> where<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:55.980> made<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.460> so<00:03:57.030> let's<00:03:57.180> check<00:03:57.390> it

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
yeah where I made it so let's check it

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.860 
yeah where I made it so let's check it
how's<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.930> looks<00:03:58.140> like

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.440 

okay<00:04:01.620> its<00:04:01.769> focus<00:04:02.099> for<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.700> other<00:04:02.849> phone<00:04:03.209> near

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
okay its focus for the other phone near

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.670 
okay its focus for the other phone near
to<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:04.500> device<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:06.330> focus<00:04:06.599> is<00:04:06.989> not<00:04:07.349> bad<00:04:07.650> i

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
to this device the focus is not bad i

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.899 
to this device the focus is not bad i
think<00:04:08.159> it's<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.640> bit<00:04:08.849> noisy<00:04:09.390> but<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:09.959> okay

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
think it's a bit noisy but it's okay

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.860 
think it's a bit noisy but it's okay
let's<00:04:11.909> just<00:04:12.060> check<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.480> frogs<00:04:12.750> come<00:04:12.989> out<00:04:13.080> to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
let's just check the frogs come out to

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.439 
let's just check the frogs come out to
0.3<00:04:15.870> megapixel<00:04:16.019> as<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.370> see<00:04:17.639> it's<00:04:17.850> not

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
0.3 megapixel as you can see it's not

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.689 
0.3 megapixel as you can see it's not
really<00:04:18.840> cool<00:04:19.470> it's<00:04:19.709> not<00:04:19.829> looks<00:04:20.130> really<00:04:20.549> nice

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
really cool it's not looks really nice

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.370 
really cool it's not looks really nice
so<00:04:21.630> i<00:04:22.350> think<00:04:23.190> with<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.000> 0.3<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.810> cannot<00:04:25.110> use

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
so i think with this 0.3 you cannot use

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.460 
so i think with this 0.3 you cannot use
this<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:26.310> cannot<00:04:26.550> use<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.060> for<00:04:27.270> anything<00:04:27.479> if

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
this you cannot use it for anything if

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.159 
this you cannot use it for anything if
you<00:04:28.650> just<00:04:28.910> want<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:29.970> make<00:04:30.120> sure<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:31.020> don't

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
you just want to make sure you don't

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.620 
you just want to make sure you don't
want<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.440> make<00:04:31.560> picture<00:04:31.979> with<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.340> one<00:04:32.630> the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
want to make picture with this one the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.650 
want to make picture with this one the
video<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:34.889> can<00:04:34.919> see<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.550> options<00:04:35.970> near

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
video that you can see the options near

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.060 
video that you can see the options near
to<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.139> picture<00:04:37.650> there<00:04:38.160> are<00:04:38.340> for<00:04:39.150> example<00:04:39.180> 23

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
to the picture there are for example 23

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.189 
to the picture there are for example 23
the<00:04:41.070> skin<00:04:41.520> function<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.660> pretty<00:04:42.930> face

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
the skin function the pretty face

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.640 
the skin function the pretty face
function<00:04:43.770> probably<00:04:44.490> with<00:04:44.639> this<00:04:44.820> one<00:04:45.590> yeah<00:04:46.590> you

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
function probably with this one yeah you

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.520 
function probably with this one yeah you
can<00:04:46.919> use<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.100> for<00:04:47.460> nice<00:04:48.449> spray<00:04:48.930> stand<00:04:49.350> there

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
can use it for nice spray stand there

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.170 
can use it for nice spray stand there
where<00:04:49.710> there<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.250> HDR<00:04:51.120> function<00:04:51.479> which<00:04:52.289> is<00:04:52.320> a

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
where there is a HDR function which is a

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.960 
where there is a HDR function which is a
better<00:04:54.180> for<00:04:54.660> example<00:04:55.289> a<00:04:55.320> colorful<00:04:56.310> picture<00:04:56.729> to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
better for example a colorful picture to

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.850 
better for example a colorful picture to
make<00:04:57.800> all<00:04:58.800> right<00:04:59.090> we<00:05:00.090> can<00:05:00.240> see<00:05:00.680> basic<00:05:01.680> Google
