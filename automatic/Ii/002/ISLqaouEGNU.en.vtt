I<00:03:16.280> don't<00:03:16.430> know<00:03:16.549> if<00:03:16.640> that's<00:03:16.790> going<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.970> be

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
I don't know if that's going to be

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.370 
I don't know if that's going to be
successful<00:03:17.329> as<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.810> see<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:17.959> gateway

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
successful as you can see that gateway

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.590 
successful as you can see that gateway
down<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.920> front<00:03:19.549> of<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.760> cannon<00:03:20.180> link<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.480> not

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
down in front of that cannon link is not

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.410 
down in front of that cannon link is not
going<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.780> be<00:03:20.870> effective<00:03:21.230> against<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.620> front

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
going to be effective against that front

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.840 
going to be effective against that front
really<00:03:23.420> there<00:03:24.049> has<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.410> be<00:03:24.440> some<00:03:24.739> key<00:03:25.010> inside

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
really there has to be some key inside

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.819 
really there has to be some key inside
kind<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.359> muta<00:03:26.690> list<00:03:26.840> push<00:03:27.109> or<00:03:27.560> maybe

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
kind of that muta list push or maybe

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:28.990 
kind of that muta list push or maybe
we'll<00:03:28.010> see<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.250> Savior<00:03:28.549> came<00:03:28.730> up<00:03:28.850> with

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
we'll see if Savior came up with

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.250 
we'll see if Savior came up with
something<00:03:29.150> new<00:03:29.390> if<00:03:29.540> he's<00:03:29.690> going<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.870> go<00:03:30.019> kind

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
something new if he's going to go kind

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.690 
something new if he's going to go kind
of<00:03:30.319> a<00:03:30.440> lurker<00:03:30.890> build<00:03:31.160> or<00:03:31.310> something<00:03:31.549> like<00:03:31.640> that

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
of a lurker build or something like that

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.000 
of a lurker build or something like that
but<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:32.660> really<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.200> do<00:03:33.290> think<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.650> keys<00:03:33.859> in

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
but but really I do think the keys in

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.559 
but but really I do think the keys in
the<00:03:34.100> middle<00:03:34.370> skin<00:03:34.549> and<00:03:34.760> he's<00:03:35.060> going<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.239> go<00:03:35.390> and

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
the middle skin and he's going to go and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.920 
the middle skin and he's going to go and
build<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.959> proxy<00:03:36.470> hatchery<00:03:36.980> hey<00:03:37.609> Wow<00:03:38.299> we'll<00:03:38.780> see

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
build a proxy hatchery hey Wow we'll see

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.289 
build a proxy hatchery hey Wow we'll see
if<00:03:38.959> be<00:03:39.170> soo<00:03:39.380> Scouts<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:39.920> out<00:03:40.130> he's<00:03:40.910> bringing

a pro he he does have probe out in the
field<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.250> don't<00:03:43.430> know<00:03:43.489> if<00:03:43.579> he<00:03:43.670> saw<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:44.000> drone

go that direction a couple Ling's
blocking<00:03:47.420> there<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.810> we'll<00:03:48.350> see<00:03:48.470> if<00:03:48.500> PC<00:03:48.739> was

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
blocking there and we'll see if PC was

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.170 
blocking there and we'll see if PC was

to kind of do this kind of proxy bill

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.080 
to kind of do this kind of proxy bill
that<00:04:06.980> looks<00:04:07.130> like<00:04:07.220> he<00:04:07.370> isn't<00:04:07.549> fat<00:04:07.819> going

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
that looks like he isn't fat going

that looks like he isn't fat going

hydralisk he is not going for a excuse
me<00:04:12.560> for<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:12.859> spire<00:04:13.760> muta<00:04:14.600> lyst<00:04:14.750> buildings

me for a spire muta lyst buildings
instead<00:04:15.380> going<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.709> go<00:04:15.799> hydralisk<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.459> that's

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
instead going to go hydralisk and that's

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.449 
instead going to go hydralisk and that's
good<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:17.000> could<00:04:17.120> be<00:04:17.150> extremely<00:04:17.510> effective

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
good that could be extremely effective

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.649 
good that could be extremely effective
basically<00:04:19.459> if<00:04:19.549> he<00:04:19.609> produces<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.060> lot<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.329> hydras

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
basically if he produces a lot of hydras

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.930 
basically if he produces a lot of hydras
get<00:04:20.840> some<00:04:20.989> speed<00:04:21.200> upgraded<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.550> with<00:04:22.789> that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
get some speed upgraded and with that

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.730 
get some speed upgraded and with that
proxy<00:04:23.390> hatchery<00:04:23.870> right<00:04:24.080> there<00:04:24.260> gets<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.530> large

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
proxy hatchery right there gets a large

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.960 
proxy hatchery right there gets a large
crew

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
crew

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.550 
crew
hydrol<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.420> basically<00:04:25.780> pushing<00:04:26.080> down<00:04:26.200> on<00:04:26.410> the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
hydrol is basically pushing down on the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.500 
hydrol is basically pushing down on the
front<00:04:26.800> we<00:04:27.460> might<00:04:27.640> see<00:04:27.820> if<00:04:27.880> he<00:04:27.970> decides<00:04:28.240> instead

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
front we might see if he decides instead

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.210 
front we might see if he decides instead
to<00:04:28.780> kind<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:28.960> opt<00:04:29.170> for<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> lurker<00:04:29.740> title<00:04:30.040> but

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
to kind of opt for a lurker title but

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.860 
to kind of opt for a lurker title but
really<00:04:30.460> what<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.210> looks<00:04:31.420> like<00:04:31.480> is<00:04:31.690> he<00:04:31.780> is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
really what this looks like is he is

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.480 
really what this looks like is he is
just<00:04:32.080> going<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.230> go<00:04:32.410> hydrolyses<00:04:33.010> just<00:04:33.370> going

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
just going to go hydrolyses just going

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.800 
just going to go hydrolyses just going
to<00:04:33.550> try<00:04:33.670> to<00:04:33.700> push<00:04:33.940> it<00:04:34.090> against<00:04:34.300> those<00:04:34.390> cannons
