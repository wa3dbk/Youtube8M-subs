hi guys this is my gold max power I've
had<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.920> for<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.549> long<00:00:05.759> while<00:00:05.910> now<00:00:05.970> we're<00:00:06.359> in

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
2013 and this was one of the first gold

2013 and this was one of the first gold
max<00:00:09.960> powers<00:00:10.380> into<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> country<00:00:11.219> had

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
max powers into the country had

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.999 
max powers into the country had
previously<00:00:12.690> used<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.080> gold<00:00:13.259> max<00:00:13.500> Mart<00:00:13.799> one

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
previously used the gold max Mart one

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.300 
previously used the gold max Mart one
before<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.500> obviously<00:00:16.650> came<00:00:17.070> with

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
before that this one obviously came with

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.880 
before that this one obviously came with
the<00:00:17.400> added<00:00:17.640> benefit<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:19.260> auto<00:00:19.439> function

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the added benefit of the auto function

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.220 
the added benefit of the auto function
which<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.520> basically<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> coke<00:00:21.359> switch<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
which is basically a coke switch to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
which is basically a coke switch to
knock<00:00:22.380> out<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.859> coke<00:00:25.490> I've<00:00:26.490> been<00:00:26.820> having

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
multiple arguments over the years I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.420 
multiple arguments over the years I
always<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.420> machine<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:31.309> flicks<00:00:32.309> out

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
always use this machine just flicks out

always use this machine just flicks out
of<00:00:32.669> water<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:33.120> how<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.809> use<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.380> I

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
be going even with this minimum

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.670 
be going even with this minimum
discrimination<00:00:44.300> but<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.570> still<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.260> debates

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
with my friends over this they they all

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.580 
with my friends over this they they all
swear<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:50.670> Auto<00:00:51.210> which<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.230> where<00:00:52.410> they

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
swear that in Auto which is where they

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
swear that in Auto which is where they
prefer<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> use<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> machine<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.510> get

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
prefer to use the machine that they get

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360 
prefer to use the machine that they get
everything<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.949> they're<00:00:56.100> finding

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
everything they because they're finding

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.520 
everything they because they're finding
hammered<00:00:56.969> they're<00:00:57.600> finding<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
hammered they're finding all the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.270 
hammered they're finding all the
hammered<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.980> they<00:00:59.129> go<00:00:59.340> over<00:00:59.730> etc<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:01.280> dispute

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
hammered that they go over etc I dispute

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280 
hammered that they go over etc I dispute
this<00:01:02.550> because<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.210> theory<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> miss

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this because my theory is if you miss

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530 
this because my theory is if you miss
something<00:01:04.640> how<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.090> you've<00:01:06.270> missed

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
something how do you know you've missed

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.100 
something how do you know you've missed
it<00:01:07.280> let's<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:08.970> tests<00:01:09.420> though<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it let's just do some tests though just

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.810 
it let's just do some tests though just
to<00:01:10.229> show<00:01:10.409> why<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:11.159> think<00:01:11.220> autos<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.360> good

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
to show why they think autos so good

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.039 
to show why they think autos so good
obviously<00:01:14.820> I've<00:01:15.119> got<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> bit<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> coke<00:01:15.720> on

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
check I'm just flick it back into auto I

flick it out of auto a second just to
prove<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.119> then<00:01:39.119> picks<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:41.090> that's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
prove that it then picks it up that's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.910 
prove that it then picks it up that's
what<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.450> sounds<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.780> well<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> know

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
wants to dig this stuff so we'll put a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.450 
wants to dig this stuff so we'll put a
bit<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:56.600> well<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> denarii<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> side<00:01:59.310> of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
bit of well the denarii to the side of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.230 
bit of well the denarii to the side of
this<00:02:00.350> cope<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.710> run<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.950> over<00:02:02.100> alright<00:02:02.759> pull

this cope and run it over alright pull
it<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.630> pulling<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> nicely<00:02:04.649> next<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
it and it's pulling that nicely next to

my<00:02:06.450> friends<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.840> thinking<00:02:07.110> our<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.439> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
my friends are thinking our this is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.339 
my friends are thinking our this is
fantastic<00:02:08.009> recovery<00:02:08.640> speed<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.170> even

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
fantastic recovery speed you can even

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.090 
fantastic recovery speed you can even
put<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:11.670> denarii<00:02:12.090> I'll<00:02:12.750> put

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
put this denarii I'll put

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.610 
put this denarii I'll put
on<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.310> table<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.850> see<00:02:14.290> behind<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
on the table so you can see behind the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.870 
on the table so you can see behind the
coke<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.840> machine<00:02:18.230> should<00:02:18.670> hope<00:02:19.670> this

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
coke and this machine should hope this

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.120 
coke and this machine should hope this
works<00:02:20.030> now<00:02:20.300> should<00:02:20.960> see<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.770> denarii

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
works now should see this denarii

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.930 
works now should see this denarii
through<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.610> coke<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.890> see<00:02:25.070> seen<00:02:25.520> straight

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
through the coke you see seen straight

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.140 
through the coke you see seen straight
through<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.300> coke<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:26.600> not<00:02:26.780> using<00:02:28.150> great

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
through the coke it's not using great

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.500 
through the coke it's not using great
recovery<00:02:29.720> speed<00:02:30.140> dealer<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.760> not<00:02:32.030> that's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
recovery speed dealer it's not that's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.450 
recovery speed dealer it's not that's
not<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.930> reason<00:02:33.230> it's<00:02:33.380> picking<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.130> denarii

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
not the reason it's picking the denarii

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.130 
not the reason it's picking the denarii
up

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
up

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.720 
up
it's<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.470> seen<00:02:36.680> straight<00:02:37.070> through<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> coke

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.540 

problem<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.790> when<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.330> switch<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.960> auto

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
problem is when you switch the auto

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.090 
problem is when you switch the auto
function<00:02:43.550> on<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.330> coke<00:02:44.540> switch<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.620> do<00:02:45.860> get

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
function on the coke switch you do get

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.150 
function on the coke switch you do get
vastly<00:02:46.670> reduced<00:02:47.680> recovery<00:02:48.680> speed

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
vastly reduced recovery speed

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.050 
vastly reduced recovery speed
I've<00:02:49.220> got<00:02:49.880> down<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.140> floor<00:02:51.170> here<00:02:51.650> I've<00:02:52.060> got

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
I've got down on the floor here I've got

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.900 
I've got down on the floor here I've got
a<00:02:55.210> nice<00:02:56.210> George<00:02:56.720> 2/3<00:02:57.410> sixpence<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.190> nice<00:02:58.400> big

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
chunky bit silver let's put it on the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:09.460 
chunky bit silver let's put it on the
floor<00:03:03.790> let's<00:03:05.560> flick<00:03:06.560> out<00:03:06.710> of<00:03:06.920> auto<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:08.470> I'll

even use quite a bit of a bit of discrim

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.540 
even use quite a bit of a bit of discrim
there<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:17.360> machine<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.930> now<00:03:18.350> not<00:03:19.100> running

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
there so this machine is now not running

anywhere near as fast as it can because
I'm<00:03:22.550> using<00:03:22.820> discrim<00:03:24.250> will<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.400> pull<00:03:25.640> this<00:03:25.820> coin

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
I'm using discrim will it pull this coin

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.800 
I'm using discrim will it pull this coin
there<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:29.480> beautiful<00:03:31.450> we'll<00:03:32.450> just<00:03:32.690> move

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
there it is beautiful we'll just move

there it is beautiful we'll just move
the<00:03:33.020> coin<00:03:33.170> out<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> way<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.210> prove<00:03:35.510> that

the coin out the way just to prove that

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.150 
the coin out the way just to prove that
is<00:03:36.320> not<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.220> positive<00:03:37.610> signal<00:03:37.790> there<00:03:38.060> anyway

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
is not a positive signal there anyway

it
well<00:03:43.730> on<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.480> going<00:03:44.780> back<00:03:48.190> even<00:03:49.190> at<00:03:49.400> depth

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
well on the going back even at depth

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:28.129 
you're thinking that sign or coke now

you're thinking that sign or coke now
I've<00:04:28.310> only<00:04:28.520> found<00:04:28.909> this<00:04:29.060> out<00:04:29.330> because<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.409> check

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
I've only found this out because I check

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.760 
I've only found this out because I check
signals<00:04:31.189> against<00:04:31.639> an<00:04:31.789> e<00:04:31.909> track<00:04:32.529> pretty<00:04:33.529> much

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
signals against an e track pretty much

gets a signal occasionally I'll call me

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.850 
gets a signal occasionally I'll call me
over<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.150> say<00:04:41.240> are<00:04:41.419> bit<00:04:42.139> of<00:04:42.199> a<00:04:42.259> strange<00:04:42.560> meter

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
over and say are bit of a strange meter

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.339 
over and say are bit of a strange meter
reading<00:04:43.370> what<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.669> think<00:04:43.879> of<00:04:43.999> this<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:44.569> I

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
reading what you think of this and I

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.890 
reading what you think of this and I
always<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:46.159> habit<00:04:46.639> check<00:04:47.389> it<00:04:47.569> obviously

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
always that habit check it obviously

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.899 
always that habit check it obviously
here<00:04:48.020> with<00:04:48.169> my<00:04:48.349> setup<00:04:48.680> which<00:04:49.219> is<00:04:49.430> basically

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
here with my setup which is basically

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:55.420 
here with my setup which is basically
just<00:04:50.270> flicked<00:04:50.509> out<00:04:50.659> of<00:04:50.900> auto<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:53.139> then<00:04:54.139> I<00:04:54.430> also

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
just flicked out of auto and then I also

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.029 
just flicked out of auto and then I also
want<00:04:55.879> to<00:04:55.909> check<00:04:56.090> in<00:04:56.240> Auto<00:04:56.680> just<00:04:57.680> because<00:04:57.919> I'm

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
want to check in Auto just because I'm

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.230 
want to check in Auto just because I'm
nosey<00:04:58.430> really<00:04:58.699> I<00:04:58.729> want<00:04:58.909> to<00:04:58.969> know<00:04:59.060> the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
nosey really I want to know the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.580 
nosey really I want to know the
followings<00:04:59.599> and<00:04:59.659> outs<00:04:59.840> this<00:05:00.020> detector<00:05:00.469> I've

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
followings and outs this detector I've

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.610 
followings and outs this detector I've
been<00:05:00.800> using<00:05:01.069> it<00:05:01.250> for<00:05:01.279> all<00:05:01.669> these<00:05:01.849> years<00:05:02.620> but

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
been using it for all these years but

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.230 
been using it for all these years but
every<00:05:03.800> day<00:05:04.099> is<00:05:04.159> the<00:05:04.279> school<00:05:04.520> day<00:05:04.699> isn't<00:05:04.939> it<00:05:05.060> at

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
every day is the school day isn't it at

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.309 
every day is the school day isn't it at
the<00:05:05.330> end<00:05:05.449> of<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:05.599> day<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:07.960> mat<00:05:08.960> times

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
the end of the day and and mat times

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.219 
the end of the day and and mat times
I've<00:05:09.620> said<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.039> him<00:05:10.159> I<00:05:10.430> think<00:05:11.360> that's<00:05:11.569> I<00:05:11.840> think

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
I've said to him I think that's I think

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.510 
I've said to him I think that's I think
that's<00:05:12.349> rubbish<00:05:12.800> you<00:05:13.129> know<00:05:13.159> I<00:05:13.250> mean<00:05:13.370> I'm

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
that's rubbish you know I mean I'm

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.749 
that's rubbish you know I mean I'm
flicking<00:05:13.699> in<00:05:13.939> Auto<00:05:14.089> now<00:05:15.099> if<00:05:16.099> I<00:05:16.279> was<00:05:16.430> trusting

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
flicking in Auto now if I was trusting

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.149 
flicking in Auto now if I was trusting
this<00:05:16.909> or<00:05:17.089> so<00:05:17.330> dad<00:05:17.569> I'd<00:05:18.080> say<00:05:18.349> that's<00:05:18.589> rubbish<00:05:18.979> or

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
this or so dad I'd say that's rubbish or

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.519 
this or so dad I'd say that's rubbish or
coke<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.699> obviously<00:05:20.689> it<00:05:20.779> can't<00:05:20.960> possibly<00:05:21.199> be

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
coke and obviously it can't possibly be

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.939 
coke and obviously it can't possibly be
coke<00:05:21.860> because<00:05:22.659> my<00:05:23.659> labs<00:05:23.900> don't<00:05:24.139> get<00:05:24.409> coke<00:05:24.680> and

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
coke because my labs don't get coke and

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.589 
coke because my labs don't get coke and
that<00:05:25.789> really<00:05:26.089> dig<00:05:26.240> I<00:05:26.360> in<00:05:26.569> either<00:05:28.360> thing<00:05:29.360> is<00:05:29.479> I

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
that really dig I in either thing is I

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.300 
that really dig I in either thing is I
never<00:05:29.659> check<00:05:30.139> my<00:05:30.289> own<00:05:30.439> signals<00:05:30.919> with<00:05:31.099> the<00:05:31.159> auto

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
never check my own signals with the auto

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.159 
never check my own signals with the auto
switch<00:05:31.759> so<00:05:32.029> I'm<00:05:32.180> not<00:05:32.330> missing<00:05:32.779> you're<00:05:33.050> not<00:05:33.139> I

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
switch so I'm not missing you're not I

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.439 
switch so I'm not missing you're not I
mean<00:05:33.319> when<00:05:33.500> I'm<00:05:33.620> digging<00:05:34.039> my<00:05:34.189> own<00:05:34.219> signals<00:05:34.759> but

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
mean when I'm digging my own signals but

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.510 
mean when I'm digging my own signals but
some<00:05:36.439> of<00:05:36.529> those<00:05:36.620> signals<00:05:37.039> have<00:05:37.159> actually

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
some of those signals have actually

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.679 
some of those signals have actually
turned<00:05:37.729> out<00:05:37.849> to<00:05:37.909> be<00:05:38.089> hammered<00:05:38.419> coins

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:38.689 
turned out to be hammered coins

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.119 
turned out to be hammered coins
especially<00:05:39.439> the<00:05:40.189> small<00:05:40.430> ones<00:05:40.699> in<00:05:41.080> just<00:05:42.129> even

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129 
especially the small ones in just even

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.159 
especially the small ones in just even
one<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.339> the<00:05:43.460> male<00:05:43.610> soil<00:05:44.060> it's<00:05:44.300> not<00:05:44.509> I<00:05:44.750> can't

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
one of the male soil it's not I can't

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.749 
one of the male soil it's not I can't
even<00:05:45.319> say<00:05:45.560> it's<00:05:45.710> great<00:05:46.069> massively

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
even say it's great massively

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.749 
even say it's great massively
mineralized<00:05:47.479> soil<00:05:47.810> I<00:05:48.310> mean<00:05:49.310> we<00:05:49.460> did<00:05:49.610> that

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
mineralized soil I mean we did that

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.369 
mineralized soil I mean we did that
demonstration<00:05:50.300> down<00:05:50.629> there<00:05:50.839> with<00:05:50.990> quite<00:05:51.349> a

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
demonstration down there with quite a

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.070 
demonstration down there with quite a
large<00:05:51.830> chunky<00:05:52.520> coin<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:53.449> you<00:05:53.569> could<00:05:53.719> say<00:05:53.899> I

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
large chunky coin and you could say I

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.779 
large chunky coin and you could say I
mean<00:05:54.229> you'd<00:05:54.529> really<00:05:54.740> expect<00:05:55.250> this<00:05:55.339> at<00:05:55.520> machine

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
mean you'd really expect this at machine

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.119 
mean you'd really expect this at machine
of<00:05:55.969> this<00:05:56.089> caliber<00:05:56.569> to<00:05:56.719> pull<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.199> and<00:05:57.830> it<00:05:57.919> does

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
of this caliber to pull that and it does

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.149 
of this caliber to pull that and it does
but<00:05:59.120> by<00:05:59.270> using<00:05:59.449> the<00:05:59.689> auto<00:05:59.810> switch<00:06:00.289> yeah<00:06:00.589> yeah

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
but by using the auto switch yeah yeah

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.159 
but by using the auto switch yeah yeah
you're<00:06:01.729> limiting<00:06:02.270> what<00:06:02.419> the<00:06:02.509> machine<00:06:02.810> can<00:06:02.990> do

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
you're limiting what the machine can do

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.649 
you're limiting what the machine can do
it's<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:04.189> can't<00:06:04.460> perform<00:06:04.610> miracles<00:06:05.210> it<00:06:05.509> can

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
it's it can't perform miracles it can

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.899 
it's it can't perform miracles it can
perform<00:06:05.930> minor<00:06:06.169> ones<00:06:06.439> but<00:06:06.770> believe<00:06:07.399> me<00:06:07.430> some

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
perform minor ones but believe me some

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.129 
perform minor ones but believe me some
of<00:06:08.029> the<00:06:08.089> some<00:06:08.330> of<00:06:08.360> the<00:06:08.479> stuff<00:06:08.689> it's<00:06:08.810> found<00:06:09.020> me

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
of the some of the stuff it's found me

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.999 
of the some of the stuff it's found me
over<00:06:09.349> the<00:06:09.439> years<00:06:10.089> but<00:06:11.199> anyone<00:06:12.199> is<00:06:12.349> using<00:06:12.740> Auto

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
over the years but anyone is using Auto

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.899 
over the years but anyone is using Auto
as<00:06:13.610> their<00:06:14.479> default<00:06:14.779> setting<00:06:15.589> you're<00:06:16.370> really

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
as their default setting you're really

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.399 
as their default setting you're really
running<00:06:17.029> the<00:06:17.270> risk<00:06:17.449> of<00:06:17.659> missing<00:06:17.930> something

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
running the risk of missing something

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:23.709 
running the risk of missing something
half<00:06:18.620> decent<00:06:19.419> and<00:06:20.419> as<00:06:20.990> I<00:06:21.589> say<00:06:22.419> people<00:06:23.419> have

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
half decent and as I say people have

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.029 
half decent and as I say people have
said<00:06:23.960> people<00:06:24.139> said<00:06:24.379> to<00:06:24.409> me<00:06:24.500> well<00:06:24.740> look<00:06:24.919> up

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
said people said to me well look up

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.439 
said people said to me well look up
might<00:06:25.250> look<00:06:25.370> at<00:06:25.520> all<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.729> hammered<00:06:26.029> I<00:06:26.120> find

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
might look at all the hammered I find

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.379 
might look at all the hammered I find
and<00:06:27.050> my<00:06:27.229> answer<00:06:27.259> term<00:06:27.710> is<00:06:27.919> always<00:06:28.099> now<00:06:28.520> how<00:06:29.330> do

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
and my answer term is always now how do

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.790 
and my answer term is always now how do
you<00:06:29.599> know<00:06:29.659> what<00:06:30.019> you're<00:06:30.169> missing<00:06:30.560> because

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
you know what you're missing because

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.339 
you know what you're missing because
wouldn't<00:06:31.129> you've<00:06:31.339> missed<00:06:31.610> it<00:06:31.849> there's<00:06:32.779> no<00:06:33.139> way

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
wouldn't you've missed it there's no way

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.409 
wouldn't you've missed it there's no way
of<00:06:33.469> you<00:06:33.560> ever<00:06:33.740> knowing<00:06:33.979> is<00:06:34.250> there<00:06:34.459> so<00:06:35.149> I<00:06:35.180> mean

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
of you ever knowing is there so I mean

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.389 
of you ever knowing is there so I mean
I'd<00:06:35.690> recommend<00:06:36.110> that<00:06:36.199> everyone<00:06:36.949> does<00:06:37.250> this

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.399 
I'd recommend that everyone does this

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.009 
I'd recommend that everyone does this
sort<00:06:37.669> test<00:06:37.909> to<00:06:38.060> prove<00:06:38.240> it<00:06:38.449> to<00:06:38.539> themselves

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:39.019 
sort test to prove it to themselves

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:41.949 
sort test to prove it to themselves
because<00:06:39.379> I<00:06:39.909> can<00:06:40.909> see<00:06:41.029> why<00:06:41.300> people<00:06:41.330> want<00:06:41.810> to<00:06:41.870> use

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
because I can see why people want to use

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.899 
because I can see why people want to use

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
a little bit I realize it's not a

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.550 
a little bit I realize it's not a
foolproof<00:07:19.459> test<00:07:20.060> but<00:07:20.750> it<00:07:20.870> does<00:07:21.110> give<00:07:21.379> you<00:07:21.469> an

indication of what the auto switch does

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:26.920 
indication of what the auto switch does
and<00:07:25.009> how<00:07:25.699> it<00:07:25.729> can<00:07:26.029> potentially<00:07:26.089> limit<00:07:26.810> your

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
and how it can potentially limit your

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.580 
and how it can potentially limit your
fines<00:07:27.199> rate<00:07:27.469> okay<00:07:28.069> good<00:07:28.339> luck<00:07:28.430> guys
