00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.349
 hello my name has become bedtime I 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.849
 am the goaltending coach 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.009
 huskies of rouyn noranda in the 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.599
 Quebec Major Junior Hockey League 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.750
 and then physical education teacher 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.130
 since young people I recommend the x 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.870
 glide because many of my guards 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:27.410
 mobile use in the beginning I was 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:29.300
 skeptical for said martin I thought 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.620
 that hollywood balances her night by 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.090
 against what I noticed because 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.730
 a little longer at each end 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.989
 on the contrary a better stability 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.309
 so today we notice that 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.230
 goalkeepers have a basic position 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.030
 milking and respite the wider legs of 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.350
 this way there players are able 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.600
 know it I'm keeping a bubble going 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.820
 go down why because the agent 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.129
 air and ground a quickly on the 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.539
 ice so that since then 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.100
 too long and soul neither 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.379
 people have dismissed me so no choice 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.649
 you open the top of the net with the x 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.589
 glide a bit more biting over 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.810
 grip so with his is able to follow 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.750
 the local player choice either to follow in 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.620
 parallel displacement or 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.620
 December butterfly 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.510
 no other technique is improved by 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.980
 the lame explain is the technique of 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.590
 picket or power pocket 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.930
 this lover technique that you do a 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.690
 stop on a rebound that is the opposite 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.970
 how are you going to do it with 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.070
 a regular vc holy blade will sting 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.080
 my skate in the ice transfer the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.700
 weight then pushed to come and stick 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.670
 people together with a crane of a virgin 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.070
 who can happen it's tapas bliss as 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.620
 this you make a breakdown so a 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.660
 leg injury and more soon 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.390
 not stop the puck you wanted 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.450
 stop with the x glide which is a lot 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.670
 longer of 20 and higher also 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.010
 so that's where you allow it to have 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.110
 no more biting in the ice this 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.200
 way there you have to be more effective more 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.850
 so fast the stÃ´ xv to have the idea of there 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.500
 to go you already see they pay for the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.170
 do and besides that on a more sea 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.030
 in addition to adherents three outbreaks and in 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.090
 is still quickly behind the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.890
 washer so if we are no longer 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.900
 Information on technical and 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.060
 the expert blade tell us about payment 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.239
 not showing the big under the site 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.659
 internet of the people had explained this 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.659
 point 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.650
 2 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.650
 Oh
