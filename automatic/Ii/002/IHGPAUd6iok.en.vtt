00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349 
and this would be the portion that I I

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.689 
and this would be the portion that I I
would<00:06:23.680> serve<00:06:23.919> out<00:06:24.070> of<00:06:24.190> that<00:06:24.310> you<00:06:24.460> would<00:06:24.580> think

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
would serve out of that you would think

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:32.010 
would serve out of that you would think
that<00:06:24.789> about<00:06:25.330> right<00:06:30.150> there<00:06:31.150> you<00:06:31.270> go<00:06:31.479> excess<00:06:31.990> is

that about right there you go excess is

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.990 
that about right there you go excess is
bad<00:06:32.229> for<00:06:32.410> example<00:06:32.860> if<00:06:33.340> you're<00:06:33.669> doing<00:06:33.820> two

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
bad for example if you're doing two

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.830 
bad for example if you're doing two
three<00:06:34.599> plates<00:06:35.229> of<00:06:35.470> this<00:06:35.680> much<00:06:36.539> get<00:06:37.539> the<00:06:37.659> one

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
three plates of this much get the one

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.810 
three plates of this much get the one
place<00:06:38.020> you<00:06:38.139> feel<00:06:38.380> it<00:06:38.530> within<00:06:39.039> the<00:06:39.310> the<00:06:39.580> means

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
place you feel it within the the means

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.700 
place you feel it within the the means
of<00:06:40.000> that<00:06:40.180> the<00:06:40.389> inside<00:06:40.750> of<00:06:40.780> that<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:41.289> it's

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
of that the inside of that and it's

of that the inside of that and it's
enough
