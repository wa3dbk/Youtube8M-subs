the chance to reorder the order the
rendering<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> good<00:02:02.820> thing<00:02:02.880> about<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
rendering now the good thing about the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.969 
rendering now the good thing about the
render<00:02:03.390> queue<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.960> will<00:02:04.049> save<00:02:04.380> all

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
render queue is that it will save all

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.609 
render queue is that it will save all
the<00:02:05.939> jobs<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.390> you've<00:02:06.479> queued<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.469> can

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the jobs that you've queued so you can

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.960 
the jobs that you've queued so you can
uncheck<00:02:07.950> something<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> want<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
uncheck something now and if you want to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.900 
uncheck something now and if you want to
render<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.239> say<00:02:09.599> tomorrow<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.259> reopen<00:02:10.410> in

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
render it say tomorrow you can reopen in

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.650 
render it say tomorrow you can reopen in

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
files around to be able to just check it
