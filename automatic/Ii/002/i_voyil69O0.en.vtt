00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.890 
section immediately gone over our crest
I<00:00:52.410> felt<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.680> big<00:00:52.830> a<00:00:53.130> big<00:00:54.059> noise<00:00:54.270> from<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> front

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
I felt a big a big noise from the front

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.979 
I felt a big a big noise from the front
like<00:00:55.590> something<00:00:55.890> broken<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:57.300> immediately<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
like something broken and immediately I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.690 
like something broken and immediately I
felt<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> car<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.950> really<00:00:59.280> loose<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.610> the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
felt the car we really loose at the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.400 
felt the car we really loose at the
front<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> very<00:01:00.150> little<00:01:00.450> traction<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
front and very little traction so I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.380 
front and very little traction so I
started<00:01:01.830> to<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> driveshaft<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.850> didn't

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
started to think a driveshaft I didn't

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.109 
started to think a driveshaft I didn't
know<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.470> could<00:01:04.710> still<00:01:04.890> carry<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.910> good

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
know but I could still carry it's good

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.180 
know but I could still carry it's good
speed<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:06.690> of<00:01:06.720> junctions<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.380> not<00:01:07.619> it's

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
speed but out of junctions it's not it's

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.010 
speed but out of junctions it's not it's
not<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.490> good<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.850> was<00:01:08.970> before<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.540> we're

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
not as good as it was before so we're

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.930 
not as good as it was before so we're
still<00:01:10.229> able<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> drive<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> good<00:01:11.460> speed<00:01:11.700> maybe

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
still able to drive a good speed maybe

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:21.370 
still able to drive a good speed maybe
90<00:01:12.330> 99<00:01:13.170> or<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:13.890> 88%<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:16.040> it's<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.220> perfect

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.160

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.600 
enjoyed the stage it's just a fantastic
stage<00:01:35.479> I<00:01:35.780> don't<00:01:35.990> know<00:01:36.259> how<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:36.680> describe<00:01:37.430> it

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
stage I don't know how to describe it

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.899 
stage I don't know how to describe it

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
but at least the first 25 kilometer is

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.800 
but at least the first 25 kilometer is
just<00:01:41.299> pure<00:01:41.840> racing<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:42.770> wide<00:01:43.729> fast<00:01:44.180> road

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
just pure racing it's wide fast road

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
with so many jumps today I chose to go

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.690 
with so many jumps today I chose to go
flatten<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.259> more<00:01:48.470> fun<00:01:48.680> like<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:48.920> but<00:01:49.340> also

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
