00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.720
 the one that happens kids how is that here 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.029
 jump and gamers again and it's to bring 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.189
 the solution to a knee that you make me 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.790
 raising some about the game of 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.239
 54 and it's like I wear the current ones 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.610
 of been the high and the good color 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.670
 so I can investigate these 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.970
 outfits go brooklyn and according to what I've 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.440
 could I already tell you to investigate you have to 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.440
 have completed in the previous 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.950
 campaigns of the previous deliveries 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.149
 worth the redundancy of assassins creed 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.629
 this means that you have to 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.820
 have passed do not specify what but 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.160
 I believe that minimum aces enrolled and 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.320
 it makes you feel 3 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.990
 I would even say that the brotherhood or the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.560
 revelations do not specify how I say no 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.170
 specific but these outfits are like 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.119
 reward of having passed you or of having 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.060
 finished the assassins campaigns 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.060
 believe that you do not give him many 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.770
 turns around without having played the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.090
 others you can already know what 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.219
 that the problem is there and how much 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.829
 finish is the campaign of everyone like you 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.390
 I say nothing else start the game of 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.590
 assassins creed pictures will come out 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.569
 defect you will see a brief green look 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.399
 box in which he will say that you have that 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.390
 reward for having completed the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.909
 campaigns and nothing else that you can equipped 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.719
 the in the cabin of your ship or 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.829
 just go to a grocery store and equip it 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.259
 that was all I hope I have solved 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.810
 some doubts and nothing else if you have 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.349
