00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.120
 automatic 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.470
 this machine is ideal for creating its 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:20.539
 own words in my box you 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:27.710
 find first by opening the

 take the instructions and the machine has 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.899
 said this machine is very compact is 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.730
 so ideal even if you do not have the 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.500
 packing box 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.359
 she does not take a place is really 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.379
 very practical we see if the machine to 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.500
 automatic tickets 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.370
 we're going to open it clips and here 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.789
 on the side and in new you have 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.579
 first find the coil first 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:00.410
 we will have to wind up the bias that we 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.719
 have cut beforehand here you 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.630
 go find the guide we are going 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.730
 install like this will allow us to 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.160
 what the bias is going on properly 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:17.180
 without moving here we have the tip or 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.720
 the tip for making the bias here 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.170
 we have the hotplate 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.680
 here the off button the setting knob 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.360
 temperature 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.250
 here it's a little green light a 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.160
 Once it is switched on we can say 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.900
 that it's ok for starting the ticket 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.660
 the temperature is correct here this is the 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:49.220
 button to start making the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:51.680
 ticket is here to reset and 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.020
 to eat diet you to come back

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.610
 food 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.310

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.730

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.320

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.569

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.360
 I advise you to buy the 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.010
 little tool here it will be a lot more 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.990
