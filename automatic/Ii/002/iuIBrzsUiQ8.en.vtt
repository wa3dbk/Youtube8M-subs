00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.140
 it's going to be a bit hard but good 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.300
 pretty good use in these things well 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.029
 that is not going to be difficult either 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.669
 sure good if I can say because I 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.669
 knows well is not clear 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.850
 nigeria be in our group that can 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.720
 say nigeria that you lend it to 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.610
 to have world sub 20 in holland 2005 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.590
 if they made me a channel I say 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.480
 I always read thanks to me, we won 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.390
 because it was mission misery the mission did not 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.339
 It was a boy for me it was all new 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.230
 and many things and I had the possibility 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.650
 play some games and just in the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.129
 final was with insect you came back to win 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.460
 the U-20 World Cup in 2007 if I go to 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.290
 18 years old I go to the tribe madrid and had a 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.040
 year that is the first year that it was not 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.220
 good for me 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.320
 hugo tocalli the technician the exercise and 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.050
 you just have to beat the strike nothing and 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.210
 so if I meditate for that calls you need to 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.490
 to win it, a lot of people told me not to 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.350
 you go because it was like going down 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.330
 I was when in the senior team 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.790
 a couple of games but I did not play it and 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.560
 I said I had all the confidence that I can 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.770
 go well and it also helped me 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.140
 for later and the athletic madrid with 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.210
 other desire and it was that year that when 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.950
 finished the world where is with the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.880
 athletic madrid that went pretty well 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.759
 and you won the gold boot and the ball and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.100
 do you think the World Cup in Brazil it 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.340
 you can get if you can win 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.780
 that sure can be mounted things that 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.800
 can tie the world but you have to win 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.500
 the following what is your first memory 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.340
 of a world 28 better or is in the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.009
 neighborhood 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.829
 we had passed part of the end and you 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.740
 won to england you know how it was 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.810
 jumping up the table but after 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.860
 already in 2006 and I thought a nice 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.080
 would be there is not something like that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.989
 did you ever see a player who 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.650
 liked some a dribble be something that 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.650
 you want to copy it 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.120
 I did not always want to copy what is the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.560
 bicycle but when I was in 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.390
 training 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 I wanted to do it and I just fell down and said nothing 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.040
 better I keep doing the same 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.180
 good if you have to mark yourself 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:43.140
 as it would mark you difficult we can 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.640
 tell is because if we count then 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.120
 we warn the defense where as is 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.890
 our style 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.890
 better not to say anything
