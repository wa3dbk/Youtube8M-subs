in<00:00:49.609> any<00:00:49.760> room<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.350> idea<00:00:51.710> came<00:00:51.769> up<00:00:52.070> to

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
in any room so the idea came up to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.279 
in any room so the idea came up to
actually<00:00:52.670> be<00:00:52.820> able<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.120> let<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.539> screen<00:00:53.899> rest

viewing position once you turn it on but
then<00:01:02.539> how<00:01:02.929> do<00:01:02.989> you<00:01:03.140> lift<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:03.590> when<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:03.920> don't

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
then how do you lift it when you don't

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.940 
then how do you lift it when you don't

movement technology two actuators were
put<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:19.250> each<00:01:19.369> side<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.909> stand<00:01:20.210> frame<00:01:20.540> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
put on each side of the stand frame and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.810 
put on each side of the stand frame and
they<00:01:21.290> move<00:01:21.500> in<00:01:21.710> parallel<00:01:21.979> up<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.640> down

they move in parallel up and down

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.330 
they move in parallel up and down
because<00:01:23.600> of<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.020> weight<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.470> TV<00:01:24.860> the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
because of the weight of the TV the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.399 
because of the weight of the TV the
engineers<00:01:25.939> added<00:01:26.329> two<00:01:26.509> gas<00:01:26.780> Springs<00:01:27.140> which

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
engineers added two gas Springs which

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.960 
engineers added two gas Springs which
are<00:01:27.530> used<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.920> take<00:01:28.130> some<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.610> weight<00:01:28.729> off

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
are used to take some of the weight off

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.910 
are used to take some of the weight off
the<00:01:29.270> lifting<00:01:29.570> system<00:01:29.780> much<00:01:30.619> like<00:01:30.649> the

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
the lifting system much like the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.590 
the lifting system much like the
principle<00:01:31.549> we<00:01:31.670> know<00:01:31.820> from<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.180> hatch<00:01:32.329> of<00:01:32.360> a

accelerate to full speed before slowing

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.719
