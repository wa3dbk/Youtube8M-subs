00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.599 
no one can catch this it's actually a
warm-up<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:58.850> just<00:00:59.510> stretched<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.929> roll<00:01:00.109> out

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.309 
warm-up I just stretched the roll out
instead<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.729> playing<00:01:01.909> I<00:01:02.120> believe<00:01:02.149> 11<00:01:03.109> stroke

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
instead of playing I believe 11 stroke

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:08.980 
instead of playing I believe 11 stroke
roll<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.649> run<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:04.100> play<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.519> out<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> 15<00:01:07.990> so

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
roll you run you play it out to a 15 so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.999 
roll you run you play it out to a 15 so
a<00:01:09.320> lot<00:01:09.710> of<00:01:09.829> people<00:01:10.100> can't<00:01:10.700> play<00:01:10.939> that<00:01:11.240> fast<00:01:11.450> and

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
a lot of people can't play that fast and

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.859 
a lot of people can't play that fast and
keep<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.189> groove<00:01:13.460> at<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.210> same<00:01:14.420> time<00:01:14.630> at<00:01:14.810> the
