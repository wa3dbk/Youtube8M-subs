00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.190
 Hi everyone, it's a girl who 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.810
 I hope you are well in any case 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.150
 me it's great because today we get 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.490
 found for the mercato minute so I 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.000
 go out single episode two days after the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.530
 previous 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.820
 why because there are a lot of 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.320
 transfers right now so I 'm going 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.240
 still you get out pretty well in 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.710
 the week there are a lot of clubs that 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.449
 are in the process of recruiting we finally 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.160
 July so that's normal we come close 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.150
 from early August the beginning of the season so 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.470
 that's why there's a lot of 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.510
 new recruitments 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.369
 so the last episode we had reached 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.260
 the 50 I like no problem so we go 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.120
 retry this for this episode 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.010
 why not even do the 55 likes 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.559
 because there we are already 62 in the previous 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.879
 episode and we will talk about two Belgians 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.199
 so I think it takes a seal I 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.610
 want to present two beautiful ones in the same 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.629
 episode so I hope he will you 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 please and we start directly 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.040
 we start this issue with an info 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.000
 official that of christian benteke 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.340
 liverpool fc 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 he left aston villa for 46 million 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 8 is a record sum for a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 Belgian player because the previous record 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.990
 it was that of henna nazar with 40 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.890
 million euros which you see when 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.420
 even the big difference 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.400
 plus 7 million euros so that's 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.110
 huge frankly for a mostly a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.490
 player who still does not have it 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.750
 still a world class player 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.040
 so that's still not bad 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 it's a big sum it's a very 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.430
 nice sale for aston villa 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.080
 they still sold their players 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.520
 costs of 50 million euros so his 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.560
 surroundings is their records I think 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.170
 after Benteke has done an excellent 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.940
 end of season he scored around 11 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.350
 goals in 9 games so at the end of the season 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.920
 he was voted best player of the month 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.570
 April 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.040
 so that's why they saw that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.410
 their liverpool side because it was 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.670
 really fit lately after he 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.720
 was injured early in the season it's 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.070
 for that maybe he did not really 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.600
 huge stats at this level 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.640
 season I believe that his 13 goals in 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.420
 championship for 29 matches so that's 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.700
 rather not bad anyway 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.950
 but after that it's not sure for sure 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.360
 he's not the best scorer of the land 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.860
 complete 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.780
 otherwise we filled nothingness of objects placed 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.820
 of course loan 58 million disbursed 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.320
 for a player who is good but good who 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.300
 did not prove that they could 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.619
 worth this price after it's true that no 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.090
 many players can then a 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.880
 price of 50 million euros 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.709
 but hey, if not, then we change 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.540
 will surely have a small regret of 1 or 2 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.310
 points and a card at 80 he will have 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.920
 surely 82 general next year 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.330
 playing liverpool and more 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.010
 always the same show full so there is no 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.959
 really change in loan in 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.610
 the utility of a bitch but apartheid the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.090
 little grain that could really be 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.090
 interesting 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.900
 marie junior was taking 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.900
 and now we will have the same 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.879
 very big rumor that the kevin 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.069
 brunettes in manchester city so manchester 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.050
 city ​​are on paul pogba and on 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.269
 brunettes either who has ben we go a little 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.040
 more about these alone kevin brown 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.580
 so he could leave for 71 million 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.170
 euros 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.910
 we were talking about a record and christian 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.730
 benteke down there we will still beat 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.680
 record I think it's a rumor so 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.330
 nothing is safe but good kevin de bruyne 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.590
 what is this perfect season so 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.650
 frankly he finished better passer 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.090
 of the season 26 assists I 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.650
 believe all competitions 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.140
 it's downright huge 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.849
 he also scored 16 goals so 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.870
 he's a good scorer so he can 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.280
 better offensively it's really not 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.130
 wrong to have a player who was also 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.900
 marked is the present and the future so 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.910
 I will explain the present 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.019
 is very good job now he is 24 years old 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.610
 so that's still the future I mean 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.290
 he's good now but he's still going 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.760
 last for many years so he goes 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.930
 to be super good so I understand 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.819
 why do they want to invest a big 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.290
 sum like that for a player like 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.430
 brown 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.110
 so it would still be a big one 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.760
 sum for city ​​what they spent I 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.470
 believe about 73 million to 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.510
 sterling whose pro expenses and the same 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.590
 sum almost for kevin brunettes I 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.910
 think it's still better for kevin 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.609
 of bruyne because frankly it was a 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.049
 really perfect player if not the 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.489
 disadvantages that's the huge loss for 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.560
 wolfsburg ok are going to touch a lot 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.599
 money but father kevin de bruyne 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.280
 so still hurt them because 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.320
 they did a season they finished 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.060
 second of the season in Bundesliga 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.580
 karzai kevin de bruyne it is he who 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.020
 postponed really number 2 because the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.729
 rest of the team is not bad but good 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.990
 it can not even that player and 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.700
 for football I really think he will have 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.889
 a big regret so an inversion 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.870
 in the 86 2 general so that will be a 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.770
 very very nice card I think because he has 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.000
 must not forget that they were 5 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.139
 bad foot star so have a 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.580
 offensive midfielder like that that risk 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.770
 really shut up next year 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.080
 otherwise it's also kevin's return from 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.639
 bruyne in bpl so that's really risky 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.330
 also to be pretty good to see her in the 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.770
 English championship 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.060
 this number is coming to an end so 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.440
 I hope you have enjoyed it anyway 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.919
 if so do not hesitate to leave 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.510
 a gem 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.889

 nickname youtube or also left a

 comment on this video to tell me 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.419

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.710
 transfers and we find ourselves very 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.460
