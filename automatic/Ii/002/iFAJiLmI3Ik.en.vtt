flag I really don't know I'm just gonna
go<00:01:30.520> ahead<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.789> get<00:01:30.880> some<00:01:31.119> masking<00:01:31.539> tape<00:01:31.569> start

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
putting it on the inside after I clean

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.520 
putting it on the inside after I clean
this<00:01:34.090> out<00:01:34.270> with<00:01:34.450> some<00:01:34.630> soap<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.289> warm<00:01:35.440> water

this out with some soap and warm water

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.940 
this out with some soap and warm water
and<00:01:36.250> we'll<00:01:36.729> see<00:01:36.940> where<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.179> goes

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and we'll see where it goes

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.249

took<00:01:38.950> me<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> long<00:01:39.520> time<00:01:39.580> but<00:01:40.239> I<00:01:40.300> figured<00:01:40.929> out<00:01:41.110> a

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
took me a long time but I figured out a

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.100 
took me a long time but I figured out a
decent<00:01:42.039> design<00:01:42.160> for<00:01:42.729> gesture<00:01:43.209> now<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:43.899> can

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
decent design for gesture now you can

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.080 
decent design for gesture now you can
see<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.679> lines<00:01:44.950> aren't<00:01:45.399> too<00:01:45.670> straight

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
see that the lines aren't too straight

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.430 
see that the lines aren't too straight
and<00:01:46.119> it<00:01:46.539> doesn't<00:01:46.840> look<00:01:46.959> too<00:01:47.140> good

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
and it doesn't look too good

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440 
and it doesn't look too good
but<00:01:47.679> inside<00:01:48.069> I<00:01:48.099> really<00:01:48.610> did<00:01:48.789> cut<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.209> much

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
but inside I really did cut it much

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.749 
but inside I really did cut it much
sharper<00:01:49.810> than<00:01:49.989> it<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.619> outside<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:51.280> just

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
sharper than it is on the outside I just

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.490 
sharper than it is on the outside I just
used<00:01:51.940> permanent<00:01:52.149> marker<00:01:52.390> as<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> guide<00:01:53.140> and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
used permanent marker as a guide and

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.770 
used permanent marker as a guide and
don't<00:01:54.429> worry<00:01:54.610> about<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:55.000> because<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.479> on<00:01:55.599> top

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
don't worry about it because it's on top

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.690 
don't worry about it because it's on top
of<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:55.989> plastic<00:01:56.229> peel<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.310> I'm<00:01:57.429> gonna<00:01:57.520> be

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
of the plastic peel that I'm gonna be

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.449 
of the plastic peel that I'm gonna be

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
mentioned one side is gonna be white the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.290 
mentioned one side is gonna be white the
other<00:02:02.140> side<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.770> gonna<00:02:02.890> be<00:02:03.009> black<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:04.060> follow

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
other side is gonna be black to follow

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.080 
other side is gonna be black to follow
his<00:02:04.569> theme<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:06.099> design<00:02:06.459> is<00:02:06.610> gonna<00:02:06.789> be<00:02:06.970> the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
his theme and the design is gonna be the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.540 
his theme and the design is gonna be the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
opposite color to stick out so I think

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.760 
opposite color to stick out so I think
I'm<00:02:09.789> just<00:02:09.819> gonna<00:02:10.060> go<00:02:10.270> ahead<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.509> do<00:02:10.690> white<00:02:10.989> or

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
I'm just gonna go ahead and do white or

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.220 
I'm just gonna go ahead and do white or
black<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:12.489> not<00:02:12.700> really<00:02:12.849> sure<00:02:13.090> yet<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.480> then

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
all right body is done so I just had to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.869 
all right body is done so I just had to
take<00:02:46.290> off<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.650> masking<00:02:47.069> for<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.310> window<00:02:47.609> and

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
take off the masking for the window and

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.569 
take off the masking for the window and
peel<00:02:48.720> off<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.260> protective<00:02:49.859> plastic<00:02:50.099> layer

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
peel off this protective plastic layer

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.420 
peel off this protective plastic layer
and<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.480> decals<00:02:52.049> are<00:02:52.319> on<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.189> went<00:02:53.370> ahead

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
and the decals are on and I went ahead

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.309 
and the decals are on and I went ahead
and<00:02:53.700> put<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.909> nice<00:02:54.180> little<00:02:54.420> screen<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.079> there

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
and put a nice little screen on there

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.009 
and put a nice little screen on there
for<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.620> vent<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.939> I<00:02:56.970> guess<00:02:57.420> all<00:02:57.750> that's<00:02:57.900> left

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
for the vent so I guess all that's left

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.379 
for the vent so I guess all that's left
is<00:02:58.379> putting<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.099> on<00:02:59.250> gesture<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.939> seeing<00:03:00.209> how

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
is putting it on gesture and seeing how

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:00.890 
is putting it on gesture and seeing how
it<00:03:00.480> looks

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.710 
it looks
and<00:03:01.049> there's<00:03:01.799> gesture<00:03:02.519> with<00:03:02.790> his<00:03:03.030> new<00:03:03.329> body

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
and there's gesture with his new body

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.599
