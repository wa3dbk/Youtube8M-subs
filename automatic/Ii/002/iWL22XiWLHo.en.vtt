00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.450
 and warm contact as you today from 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.639
 live from the tennis court with the theme mass 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.469
 effect or why can roger federer 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.230
 and rafael nadal such a hard bat 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.690
 play of the many training and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.490
 Apart from congenial style of play, it is 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.770
 actually only a question of the perfect 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.109
 mastering the magnus effect during 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.359
 of the blow itself so we look 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.699
 now what's the magnus really 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 Effect is generally and we at tennis 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.080
 can be used to date now 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.040
 we have a tennis fell and we 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.550
 we are 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.040
 we're playing the tennis ball now 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.440
 net and want that has in this field 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.649
 So he can land up to maximum 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 to a distance of 11.9 and 80 meters 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.559
 return 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.780
 This would be the reason for a blow 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.239
 how fast is it possible? 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.610
 a reason reject hit without spin 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.219
 No matter how fast a tennis ball plays 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 is played vertically fall all 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.500
 objects quickly to ground 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.660
 namely with the time factor of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.180
 proportional to the gravitational constant 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.580
 on our earth for this time factor 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.159
 the connection with the free deep 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.720
 So general net height and the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.729
 gravitational constant on our earth 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.689
 we can average one 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.970
 variety of 43 seconds to calculate 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.950
 while exceeding the edge of the net 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 Do not get behind your hands 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.840
 There was a maximum of 43 seconds driving time 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.790
 Away from 11.9 and 80 meters 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.220
 have traveled around a container 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.270
 to comply and this law is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.259
 known to each of us 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.159
 27 07 meters per second is now ours 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.189
 maximum speed in the process 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.009
 can achieve without 3 of these it would be 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.159
 of course only theoretically because without three 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.860
 a choice about 100 km h 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.979
 accelerate is unrealistic 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.219
 In general, we can say at 100 km / h 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.530
 is the maximum speed why 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.799
 is it then that in lace play 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.790
 Values ​​up to 180 km / h from the stool 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.800
 be measured 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.840
 can and to this question on the ground 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.060
 We decide to go back live 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.890
 the tennis court 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.190
 most people know about the video 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.530
 use a beat anyway 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.850
 that means nothing else besides that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.810
 couple in the direction of movement a schnick 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.430
 to watch a video 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.890
 Let's take a look at the same thing now 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 with the same settings with her spinning 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.209
 catapult the bat in one 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.930
 Flight over the ball and hit 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.160
 him in this field area thus 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.330
 catapults it into one soon 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.270
 transaction movement straight straight 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.150
 plus a rotary motion transaction 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.870
 plus rotation of course this case in 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.170
 this direction 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.270
 and through this in open up your physics 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.790
 a huge new topic namely 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.459
 the area of ​​aerodynamics 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.350
 Dynamic occurs the dynamic 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.540
 buoyancy of the bath comes only by it 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.360
 that we have transaction and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.510
 unite rotation and that gives us that 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.600
 big theme chosen aerodynamics what says 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.730
 This is now our new trial of 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.750
 if we now the ball 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.640
 to force a transaction back into 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.269
 direction of the network and in the direction of 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.980
 be catapulted simultaneously 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.630
 But we use the ball with our bat 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.739
 and impose on us in a rotationally spin 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.959
 I draw that nice again here 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.720
 Reputations accumulates through this 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.570
 rotation proportion can now the 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.840
 Air molecules very close to the ball 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.140
 in a vortex movement in one 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.569
 Rotational movement itself around the times with 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.409
 Caries 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.170
 A circular flow is called 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.959
 the circular flow around this ball 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.790
 this circular stream is now complete 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.189
 decisive now if we look 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.769
 Aerodynamics are happening to the aerodynamics 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.750
 itself now analyzes the overlay 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.720
 the flow shares 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.410
 yes me the linear flow plus the 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.840
 Circular flow in the opposite direction 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.539
 gives this complex flow picture 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.530
 let follow the city out of the thick 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:32.830
 flows over the ball are added 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.570
 they are true and everywhere 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.270
 The current, of course, as clear 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.930
 is visible slower and built- 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.240
 she accelerates very crooked and me 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.560
 I miss a video about the 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.130
 settlement and inventory effect made 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.990
 is it there now, therefore 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:56.650
 linked there is explained that one 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.630
 slower flow over an object one 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.580
 pressure produced and a 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.320
 faster flow a lower and 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.680
 had to be the first through this lower 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.330
 pressure due to the pressure difference 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.240
 above and below the ball becomes 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.389
 while down 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.370
 a force component gets down 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.860
 Produce this component we call 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.479
 fm or magnus fight through the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.349
 Man power comes as an effect 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.020
 at all 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.820
 how can we get this opinion 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.460
 now calculate formally 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.620
 your speed is above and below 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.409
 a speed under the ball of 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.520
 speed away was just over was 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.570
 Today it will be out of the group 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.630
 speed - the 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.780
 rotation speed itself same 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.330
 for below the ball rainer 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.270
 difference is that the 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.740
 rotation speed art is thus 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.080
 we can only compare conditionally 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.539
 it sets itself up by the 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.750
 settlement impression difference 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:59.680
 gp of course this is equal to the pressure 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.840
 over the ball - the pressure below the 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.580
 balls through inserts with these two 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.159
 components in this equation and 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.689
 simplify and reshape results 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:11.349
 on 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:14.409
 pressure difference of 2 marco from omega r 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:20.110
 v what is power in the first place 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:25.509
 pressure per unit area nothing else 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:27.759
 except this time, this results in a 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.639
 a formal expression for our market needs 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.159
 power that causes the lack of effect 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.839
 and that's exactly the formula 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:39.009
 Roger Federer and Nadal 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:43.539
 So what have learned in general today 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:46.089
 learned that without one at maximum 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:49.419
 100 km / h can be occupied either way 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:53.069
 even in the tennis coincides itself with 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:55.269
 playful aspects of markus force 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:57.759
 larger km h possible 

00:06:55.269 --> 00:07:00.239
 We have said from the stool were up 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.669
 measured at 180 km / h 

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:06.069
 of course a huge advantage and therefore 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:07.539
 is the biggest weapon of a profit 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.659
 be the player 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:12.489
 topspin hit if you liked it 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.439
 the video or when interest in 

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:16.329
 other physics and sports 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:19.149
 that's why the playlist physics found 

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:21.309
 white sports communicate several 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.869
 take the to do with physics and sports 

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:24.189
 if you have bills 

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:27.039
 mathematical and derivations 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:29.469
 interested ones looked at the coal themselves 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.089
 also in spring and there is a new one 

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:33.269
 category of the zt 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:35.709
 there are different machines 

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:38.979
 Technical procedures the application of 

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:40.899
 theoretical physics presents thanks 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.279
 if further interested in me 

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:44.939
 Do not forget to subscribe 

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.939
