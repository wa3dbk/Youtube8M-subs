on<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:30.330> bike<00:04:30.540> too<00:04:30.720> this<00:04:30.900> is<00:04:30.990> what's<00:04:31.139> called<00:04:31.320> a

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
on this bike too this is what's called a

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.640 
on this bike too this is what's called a
leading<00:04:31.800> link<00:04:32.130> suspension<00:04:32.960> normally<00:04:33.960> the

leading link suspension normally the
axle<00:04:35.220> here<00:04:36.060> would<00:04:36.720> be<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.020> bottom<00:04:37.199> point<00:04:37.650> for

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
axle here would be the bottom point for

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.219 
axle here would be the bottom point for
the<00:04:37.979> front<00:04:38.220> forks<00:04:38.610> but<00:04:38.850> in<00:04:39.449> this<00:04:39.570> case<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:40.110> has

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
the front forks but in this case it has

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.140 
the front forks but in this case it has
what's<00:04:40.470> called<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.800> leading<00:04:41.130> link<00:04:41.430> suspension

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
what's called a leading link suspension

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.689 
what's called a leading link suspension
where<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.840> leading<00:04:43.050> link<00:04:43.680> here<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.430> what

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
where the leading link here is what

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.689 
where the leading link here is what
rises<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.539> falls<00:04:45.750> when<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.770> bike<00:04:47.220> goes<00:04:47.430> over

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
rises and falls when the bike goes over

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.640 
rises and falls when the bike goes over
bumps<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.300> as<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.840> see<00:04:49.020> later<00:04:49.050> when<00:04:49.440> we<00:04:49.470> go

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
bumps and as you see later when we go
