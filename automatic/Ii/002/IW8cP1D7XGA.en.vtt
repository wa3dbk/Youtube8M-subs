00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
 the orchids are the most 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.130
 valued on the market and 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.099
 true passions but to cultivate 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.960
 stefanello takes patience and some 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.380
 care that I got to know with the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.380
 producer 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.910
 we are in the colony figueiredo county 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.590
 country house in the region of curitiba 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.420
 orchid is located within the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.420
 green river environmental protection 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.900
 of the six thousand square meters of greenhouses 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.900
 we find a true watercolor 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.739
 are more than 500 species of orchids 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.309
 the most well-known and commercialized 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.530
 cymbidium phalaenopsis dendrobium 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.350
 also called the doll's eye but 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.080
 even though the flower resembles a 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.960
 cattleya with its lush colors and 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.500
 1 sid one with rain of gold in nature 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.310
 there are approximately 30 thousand species 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.960
 different from orchids we to whom 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.369
 orchids has been crossing the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.800
 species and then make new varieties 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.960
 crossing is done right here in this 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.539
 laboratory based on parent plants 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.850
 the pollen of a flower is placed in another 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.920
 and from there arises the seed 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.270
 after approximately one year of 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.550
 flower fertilization 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.160
 we collect the cement segment 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.039
 while the laboratory is doing a 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.970
 cleaning process on it we'll do 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.340
 or Singapore 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.149
 this process takes about 12 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.100
 months 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.649
 for her to bloom for the first time 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.349
 four more years and most are 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.259
 once a year and for the 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:49.970
 Orchid looks beautiful so clear it 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.340
 needs care 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.420
 the environment must be adequate for each 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.640
 species 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.099
 so video for example and the eye of 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.069
 doll are away from home in one place 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.119
 ventilated and do not take directly to 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.849
 sunlight 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.190
 I've said nope should be grown in a 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.950
 indoor environment with natural light 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.230
 even when it is without flowers beyond 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.180
 the plant needs every 15 days. 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.540
 a specific fertilizer for orchids 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.180
 soluble in water and certain irrigation as 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.060
 We are entering the spring summer. 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.430
 we need to get at least one 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.770
 twice a week 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.560
 How do you do at home, will you? 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.010
 open a little key and hold the whole 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.920
 plant any substratum never irrigating the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.060
 flowers and after she's on you 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.060
 let it drain 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.200
 This water from the pot only later when 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:50.480
 it's dry put the dish underneath 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.480
 And a clear dose of attention and affection. 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.610
 The flowers are beautiful, but really 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.610
 needs a lot of dedication
