all<00:00:00.719> right<00:00:00.960> another<00:00:01.230> project<00:00:01.770> here<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.040> 1992

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
all right another project here in 1992

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.170 
all right another project here in 1992
Camry<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:04.400> putting<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.460> starter<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.029> it

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
Camry and putting the starter on it

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.509 
Camry and putting the starter on it
thought<00:00:06.660> I'd<00:00:06.810> show<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.560> what<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.040> teeth<00:00:08.250> look

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
thought I'd show you what the teeth look

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.100 
thought I'd show you what the teeth look
like<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.059> old<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:09.630> were<00:00:09.780> having<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
like on the old one we were having a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.860 
like on the old one we were having a
problem<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.920> grinding<00:00:11.759> against<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
problem with that grinding against the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.970 
problem with that grinding against the
flywheel<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.219> not<00:00:14.519> engaging<00:00:14.910> properly<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
flywheel and not engaging properly so I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.670 
flywheel and not engaging properly so I
went<00:00:17.279> ahead<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.779> ordered<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:19.080> starter<00:00:19.500> off<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
went ahead and ordered a starter off a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.929 
went ahead and ordered a starter off a
rock<00:00:19.949> Auto<00:00:20.570> $92<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.189> this<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.369> by<00:00:23.670> far<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
rock Auto $92 and this was by far the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.170 
rock Auto $92 and this was by far the
easiest<00:00:24.269> starter<00:00:25.019> I've<00:00:25.619> ever<00:00:25.949> taken<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.910> I

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
easiest starter I've ever taken out I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.820 
easiest starter I've ever taken out I
mean<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> literally<00:00:27.779> took<00:00:28.109> me<00:00:28.289> two<00:00:28.470> minutes

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
mean it literally took me two minutes

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.600 
mean it literally took me two minutes
ten<00:00:29.670> millimeter<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.420> disconnect<00:00:30.869> battery<00:00:31.610> in

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
ten millimeter to disconnect battery in

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.250 
ten millimeter to disconnect battery in
theory<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.390> want<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> disconnect<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
theory you want to disconnect the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.740 
theory you want to disconnect the
negative<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:35.010> positive<00:00:35.420> was<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> took

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
negative but positive was what I took

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.850 
negative but positive was what I took
off<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.260> case<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.680> well<00:00:39.410> 12<00:00:40.410> millimeter

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
off in this case so well 12 millimeter

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.569 
off in this case so well 12 millimeter
to<00:00:41.370> disconnect<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.950> positive<00:00:43.950> cable<00:00:44.160> going

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to disconnect the positive cable going

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.970 
to disconnect the positive cable going
to<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> starter<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.420> two<00:00:46.020> 14<00:00:46.500> millimeter

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
to the starter and two 14 millimeter

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
to the starter and two 14 millimeter
bolts<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:48.329> there<00:00:48.600> I'll<00:00:48.930> hold<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> starter

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
bolts right there I'll hold the starter

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
bolts right there I'll hold the starter
place<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.980> slides<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.520> piece<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
place and it slides right out piece of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.569 
place and it slides right out piece of
cake<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> over<00:00:52.890> here<00:00:54.920> if<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.039> take<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> look<00:00:56.489> at

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
cake so over here if you take a look at

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.319 
cake so over here if you take a look at
the<00:00:56.640> teeth<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> old<00:00:57.390> starter<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:59.329> you

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the teeth on the old starter there you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.260 
the teeth on the old starter there you
can<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.629> how<00:01:00.719> they're<00:01:00.899> worn<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.000> here's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
can see how they're worn and then here's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:17.920 
can see how they're worn and then here's
the<00:01:03.329> new<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.200> difference

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.480 

so<00:01:18.440> let's<00:01:18.620> go<00:01:18.770> ahead<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.040> put<00:01:19.160> this<00:01:19.280> new

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
so let's go ahead and put this new

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.330 
so let's go ahead and put this new
starter<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.560> see<00:01:21.560> what<00:01:21.680> happens

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
starter in see what happens

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.030 
starter in see what happens

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
I think it'll take care of our problem

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.830 
I think it'll take care of our problem
all<00:01:25.040> right<00:01:25.100> new<00:01:25.520> starter<00:01:25.970> is<00:01:26.060> installed<00:01:26.540> let's
