00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 documents i am mark i know it is and 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.130
 drops two weeks ago that I have perfection 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.690
 upload 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.210
 self money for mission mark it also takes 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.800
 too long i can make it all go 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.780
 explain that where that takes far too long 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.750
 so summarized 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.640
 he is dressed and I can do that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.990
 whole enough of explaining but that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.840
 doesn't interest you but my pocket 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.730
 bpl team against this team he wants it was 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 an interesting ymte really play i have 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 never use anything on cm3 i use 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
 understand after this competition why 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.590
 were some nice cat for him and by 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.630
 way such this pass on the log 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 boss I tell you troopa 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.710
 is something special least so it can 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
 I must say in bells 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.610
 by he is good strong real good pass 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.960
 and I'm gonna ever shot I mean 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.760
 honesty pretty much what you want in it 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.559
 the striker but may need co2 that maria 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 is just fine nor did he have gone 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.590
 than for 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.690
 and this is logical guys who must 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.789
 you just grab those that don't buy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.289
 it was that bad that couple but you 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.969
 must eat look at them mine 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.649
 corn bowl l310 cuadrado 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.600
 but the really very nice right gate 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.739
 but he has we as the weak point 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.359
 such as in force 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.830
 that is the most important thing but always 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.570
 heaven and shoot the idea because if 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.760
 light almost killed two in one 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.159
 drogba can of course get it out for 4 2 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.659
 so this is what he is talking about 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.040
 so apparently a penalty what you 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.290
 naturally want about chemical in and so 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.450
 does that really happen to a man? 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.250
 man man did he score wonderfully with 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.810
 that panenka but of course we can 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.560
 the arrow that are that really hit completely 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.900
 nowhere 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 come five or three then because yes that 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.479
 up to itself that was good 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.890
 first super handy to have 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.270
 I was a little frustrated then do 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.280
 i also the church uh there is now i do 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.079
 don't like being alone in certain situations 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.270
 but here would be easter tree bit 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.040
 inconsolable can easily be real 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.689
 one of the best strikers is football 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.950
 I usually try to play 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.570
 I also eventually score the six 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.369
 trilogies had a major loss with 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.290
 drogba is the six 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.939
 because at 6 3 so gets on lt ipad 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.829
 catering with your police 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.420
 I scored arrow type cm3 pulled her 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.970
 have powers rick and so we want the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.200
 70th three goals from drogba 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.520
 just really one of the more than that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.049
 find in the series so far and the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.670
 open golden ball packs to people again 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.110
 can see winters i have 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.380
 scored seven times and a hat trick 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.479
 and 3 on their difference so that is 9 packs 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.540
 so I 'm going to open 915 copics from now on 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.530
 chicken goes in phases even faster 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.080
 what i know some don't like 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.610
 just find this 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.709
 it takes a little and otherwise and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.000
 slowly job videos long and there 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.270
 nobody really looks out 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.340
 very bad but i do parsi there i load 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.959
 I don't like to use the seri tations 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.580
 you are rim with roughly 2 and I have there 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.069
 no forex yet and what as feedback 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.050
 shoulders the third career sherif can 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.410
 to be tested for stretching 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.640
 ps nothing special on it 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.860
 I think that is this bit of me 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.180
 have not used page players and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.910
 this is say the series dyke optics us 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.319
 camp used as roads as is casares 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.360
 a very welcome games like breaking 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.160
 will enter knows probably 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.959
 wrong that he did with you there 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.780
 back could also have to say though 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.489
 no typical cda but that was 4 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.769
 the burden is so close all day so 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.430
 but by then this is a 5 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.540
 ok that is anne yes ok public what 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.630
 no it's coming naturally 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.690
 but if we are the six 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.540
 from now on tell ns on such a good one 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.130
 city ​​of sorani but she had his mind 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.480
 lied about something 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.010
 if so say because that's just 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.980
 honest how it is without complete need 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.980
 because it was six and seven come on 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.570
 hi it in use but more to say that 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.739
 This is the yes in the Swedish competition 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.260
 a russian team I ate him quite able 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.790
 use on or if you didn't know I have 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.739
 ever one so a marketing mission 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.410
 uses pretty good budget player 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.859
 ok that was often 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.880
 well 813 if china and the bie statue are sitting 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.010
 also can really use one 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.420
 typical as it is always one so far 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.660
 not so according to the chief office or 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.989
 no less than 9 donnell 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.019
 okay come on what are it please 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:01.430
 uw d seems to be good must be julia and 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.010
 then yes for the rest not really natural 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.620
 order cheap feel unsafe for rest 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.480
 because its the place and then camping 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.340
 out of the child 2 with my pva team i 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.720
 now show your tokens so that 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.459
 you know what are but how the team 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.380
 look any before the game I'm going 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.030
 must tip that you give me full silver 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.100
 pi-po that with among others am here 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.160
 well see bola 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.330
 cleverly had livermore williamson too 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.410
 Korea had 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
 is on teams and players actually 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.310
 silver bpl space are still pretty good 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.050
 vegetables currently in terms of card set are good 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.550
 legs how they play against me they play 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.900
 good that he comes one or confused by good 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.470
 action with danny but I have more than 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.060
 the ball 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.919
 that he is not trying to get through strongly 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.850
 deal with our country that fails 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.010
 but although it can come in 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.260
 leaving 300 just one then come 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.760
 I shoot you through a microscope but they 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.800
 keeper know the say and that sounds 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.479
 I was also surprised but he lays 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.830
 that smart already past the one he knows 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.330
 in the situation just does not score 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.310
 CSP with those driver 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.660
 lay the inlet smart as core 2 months 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.010
 with a red triangle around it 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.720
 by a dos santos 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.430
 in this situation just don't miss out on that 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.510
 is two but within 60 minutes 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.070
 becomes 3 how you get the ball here 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.450
 Attributed the puts him in a number 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.100
 for crows that hits the post 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.790
 then back to how the us light and 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.440
 minuses 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.940
 best as is the one I have ever eaten 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.620
 probably yes but i get here 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.539
 red because my second yellow toad museum 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.039
 in macho that is clearly not a problem 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.020
 because i don't put them on defense i play 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.360
 just by i scored 4 92nd minute 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.830
 did a great match was very entertaining 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.470
 I have to say to Bibian Silver's 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.669
 maybe just maybe I will someday 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.080
 something probably not because of me 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.490
 but here what i want and i am going packs 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.229

 all waterfront are just in it 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.410
 so not the case he seems to be good 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.310
 I just don't know if they should be basic 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.170
