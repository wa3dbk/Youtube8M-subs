oh holy grab the choke of all things are
probably<00:00:25.199> better<00:00:25.500> than<00:00:25.650> none<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.160> all<00:00:26.250> things

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
probably better than none of all things

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.570 
probably better than none of all things
and<00:00:27.500> letting<00:00:28.500> them<00:00:28.710> attack<00:00:29.160> me<00:00:29.340> while<00:00:29.460> I'm

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
switching is a good idea when I only

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.269 
switching is a good idea when I only
have<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.019> life<00:00:31.199> left<00:00:31.410> right<00:00:31.650> well<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> grab<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
have one life left right well I grab the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.790 
have one life left right well I grab the
choke<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.579> pretty<00:00:32.790> strong<00:00:33.559> okay<00:00:34.559> let's<00:00:34.739> try

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
choke is pretty strong okay let's try

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.220 
choke is pretty strong okay let's try
this<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.630> that<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.809> very<00:00:36.899> nice

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
this out that is very nice

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.180 
this out that is very nice
okay<00:00:40.230> Pokemon<00:00:40.559> games<00:00:40.739> are<00:00:40.860> more<00:00:40.980> fun<00:00:41.129> than

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
okay Pokemon games are more fun than

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.709 
okay Pokemon games are more fun than
Aronnax<00:00:41.430> or<00:00:41.820> they're<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.090> necessarily<00:00:42.510> more

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
Aronnax or they're not necessarily more

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.740 
Aronnax or they're not necessarily more
fun<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.610> it's<00:00:44.610> more<00:00:44.820> fun<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.390> play<00:00:45.570> them

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
fun but it's more fun to just play them

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
fun but it's more fun to just play them
as<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> game<00:00:46.620> instead<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> way<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.760> life

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
as a game instead of like a way of life

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.779 
as a game instead of like a way of life
like<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.329> play<00:00:48.510> most<00:00:48.750> Pokemon<00:00:49.230> games<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.860> don't

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
like I play most Pokemon games I don't

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.069 
like I play most Pokemon games I don't
have<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.059> worry<00:00:51.210> about<00:00:51.270> leveling<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
have to worry about leveling up and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
have to worry about leveling up and
having<00:00:52.320> balanced<00:00:52.860> teams<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.370> stuff<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.789> I'm

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
having balanced teams and stuff so I'm

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
having balanced teams and stuff so I'm
really<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.129> Pokemon

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
really like this it's a Pokemon

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.849 
really like this it's a Pokemon
experience<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.699> being<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.059> bogged<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.629> with

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
experience not being so bogged down with

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
experience not being so bogged down with
slow<00:00:58.859> loading<00:00:59.520> screens<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> whatnot<00:01:03.379> I'm

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
slow loading screens and whatnot I'm

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.690 
slow loading screens and whatnot I'm
probably<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> spend<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.100> entire<00:01:05.220> game

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
probably going to spend this entire game

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.810 
probably going to spend this entire game
just<00:01:05.970> saying<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> game

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.380 

say<00:01:12.360> I'm<00:01:12.510> super<00:01:13.020> effective<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:14.060> gravel<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.150> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
say I'm super effective on gravel or I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.490 
say I'm super effective on gravel or I
believe<00:01:18.020> another<00:01:19.020> match<00:01:19.230> ugh<00:01:19.380> that's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
believe another match ugh that's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.280 
believe another match ugh that's
actually<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> pretty<00:01:19.920> strong<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.370> choke<00:01:21.290> we're

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
actually a pretty strong the choke we're

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.900 
actually a pretty strong the choke we're
stronger<00:01:22.680> than<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.340> wonder<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.760> it's

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
stronger than this one I wonder if it's

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.140 
stronger than this one I wonder if it's
yeah<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.630> might<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.080> Pokemon<00:01:25.470> based<00:01:26.150> yeah

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
yeah it might not be Pokemon based yeah

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.050 
yeah it might not be Pokemon based yeah
that<00:01:27.240> one's<00:01:27.360> slightly<00:01:27.540> stronger<00:01:27.900> actually<00:01:29.060> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that one's slightly stronger actually it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.900 
that one's slightly stronger actually it
has<00:01:30.210> low<00:01:30.480> kick<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.050> this<00:01:31.230> one<00:01:31.410> had

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
has low kick is that what this one had

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.300 
has low kick is that what this one had
maybe<00:01:32.910> oh<00:01:33.500> hey<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.680> an<00:01:34.800> Onix<00:01:35.190> or<00:01:35.370> maybe<00:01:35.520> arbok

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
maybe oh hey it's an Onix or maybe arbok

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.830 
maybe oh hey it's an Onix or maybe arbok
okay<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.580> hard<00:01:38.760> luck<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.210> Onix<00:01:39.690> would

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
okay it's a hard luck I think Onix would

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.330 
okay it's a hard luck I think Onix would
have<00:01:39.930> sort<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.260> made<00:01:40.380> more<00:01:40.620> sense<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.310> think

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
have sort of made more sense and I think

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
have sort of made more sense and I think
arbok<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:41.940> abuzz<00:01:42.150> about<00:01:42.180> grass<00:01:42.570> level<00:01:42.960> too

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
arbok was abuzz about grass level too

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.950 
arbok was abuzz about grass level too
but<00:01:46.940> not<00:01:47.940> really<00:01:48.150> sure<00:01:48.390> what<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:48.540> make<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> any

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
but not really sure what to make of any

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.890 
but not really sure what to make of any
of<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:50.000> cannot<00:01:51.000> remember<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.450> poison

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
of that but I cannot remember if poison

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.969 
of that but I cannot remember if poison
and<00:01:52.020> fighting<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.470> any<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and fighting have any kind of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.640 
and fighting have any kind of
interaction<00:01:53.400> at<00:01:53.640> all<00:01:54.170> might<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.470> very

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
interaction at all might be not very

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.770 
interaction at all might be not very
effective<00:01:56.130> might<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.550> neutral<00:01:57.120> might<00:01:57.330> not<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
effective might be neutral might not I

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.780 
effective might be neutral might not I
don't<00:01:57.960> use<00:01:58.260> poison<00:01:58.950> or<00:01:59.040> fighting<00:01:59.340> most<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
don't use poison or fighting most of the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.730

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.240 
jump on that that was oh well there's
mostly<00:02:49.870> normal<00:02:50.260> types<00:02:50.470> anyway<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:50.769> mean<00:02:51.010> flying

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
mostly normal types anyway I mean flying

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.059 
mostly normal types anyway I mean flying
types<00:02:51.549> might<00:02:51.760> be<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.910> problem<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:53.069> I'll

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
types might be a problem but I'll

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.920 
types might be a problem but I'll
probably<00:02:54.340> get<00:02:54.910> something<00:02:55.209> or<00:02:55.540> something

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
probably get something or something

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.699 
probably get something or something
right<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:57.989> think<00:02:58.989> that's<00:02:59.260> pretty<00:02:59.380> good<00:02:59.590> music

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
right I think that's pretty good music

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.400 
right I think that's pretty good music
yeah<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.069> I<00:03:03.099> guess<00:03:03.450> actually<00:03:04.450> since<00:03:04.810> there<00:03:05.080> are

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
yeah so I guess actually since there are

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.880 
yeah so I guess actually since there are
absolutely<00:03:05.950> no<00:03:06.160> purely<00:03:06.519> flying
