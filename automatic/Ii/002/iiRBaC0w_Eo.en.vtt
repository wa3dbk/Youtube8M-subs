00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
hopes of getting some mosquito larvae

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.049 
hopes of getting some mosquito larvae
and<00:00:40.909> it<00:00:40.969> was<00:00:41.059> actually<00:00:41.329> quite<00:00:41.569> a<00:00:41.600> few<00:00:41.809> minute

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
and it was actually quite a few minute

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.950 
and it was actually quite a few minute
after<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.089> collects<00:00:44.449> them<00:00:44.629> out<00:00:44.719> of<00:00:44.809> here<00:00:44.870> I'm

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
after I collects them out of here I'm

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.509 
after I collects them out of here I'm
going<00:00:45.049> to<00:00:45.139> dump<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.379> out<00:00:45.530> I'm<00:00:46.280> going<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:46.429> go

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
going to dump it out I'm going to go

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.250 
going to dump it out I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:46.729> fill<00:00:46.850> this<00:00:47.089> up<00:00:47.149> since<00:00:47.960> it's<00:00:48.170> a

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
ahead and fill this up since it's a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.129 
ahead and fill this up since it's a
little<00:00:48.589> easier<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.449> collect<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:50.719> control<00:00:51.049> the

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:51.139 
little easier to collect and control the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:54.129 
little easier to collect and control the
mosquito<00:00:51.499> larvae<00:00:51.829> if<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:52.729> just<00:00:52.909> left<00:00:53.120> this<00:00:53.299> up

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
mosquito larvae if you just left this up

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:56.079 
mosquito larvae if you just left this up
and<00:00:54.319> running<00:00:54.440> you'd<00:00:54.920> eventually<00:00:55.129> get<00:00:55.459> adult

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
and running you'd eventually get adult

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.149 
and running you'd eventually get adult
mosquitoes<00:00:56.679> flying<00:00:57.679> around<00:00:57.829> your<00:00:57.979> house<00:00:58.129> and

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
mosquitoes flying around your house and

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.219 
mosquitoes flying around your house and
that<00:00:58.519> would<00:00:58.639> not<00:00:58.699> be<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.879> good<00:00:59.030> thing<00:00:59.089> but<00:01:00.049> you

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
that would not be a good thing but you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.279 
that would not be a good thing but you
just<00:01:00.409> take<00:01:00.530> your<00:01:00.739> aquarium<00:01:01.579> net<00:01:01.879> here<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:03.199> go

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
just take your aquarium net here and go

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.479 
just take your aquarium net here and go
ahead<00:01:03.440> and<00:01:03.589> search<00:01:03.769> for<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.040> little<00:01:04.220> buggers

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489
