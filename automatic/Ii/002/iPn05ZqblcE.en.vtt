their chipping

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.900 
their chipping
it<00:01:20.810> has<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.050> new<00:01:21.500> for<00:01:21.680> this<00:01:21.740> year<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:22.280> has<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.490> tip

it has a new for this year it has a tip

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.970 
it has a new for this year it has a tip
and<00:01:23.030> tail<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:23.330> has<00:01:23.450> this<00:01:23.570> automatic<00:01:24.320> which<00:01:24.860> is

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
and tail it has this automatic which is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.190 
and tail it has this automatic which is
basically<00:01:25.460> like<00:01:25.550> a<00:01:25.670> dampening<00:01:26.240> system<00:01:26.480> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
basically like a dampening system and

basically like a dampening system and
you<00:01:28.070> know<00:01:28.160> it's<00:01:28.310> Mitch<00:01:28.550> they're<00:01:28.820> typically<00:01:29.660> a

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
you know it's Mitch they're typically a

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.970 
you know it's Mitch they're typically a
little<00:01:29.900> bit<00:01:30.020> stronger<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.500> like<00:01:30.650> for<00:01:30.920> example

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
little bit stronger so like for example
