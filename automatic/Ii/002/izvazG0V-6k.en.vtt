certain<00:00:56.140> specifications<00:00:57.140> one<00:00:57.859> of<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.010> funny

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
certain specifications one of the funny

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.189 
certain specifications one of the funny
parts<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.820> watch<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.359> fact<00:00:59.570> that<00:00:59.690> it's

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
parts of the watch is the fact that it's

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.500 
parts of the watch is the fact that it's
called<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.530> Deep<00:01:00.739> Diver<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:01.820> goes<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.089> 200

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
called the Deep Diver and it goes to 200

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.990 
called the Deep Diver and it goes to 200
meters<00:01:02.749> and<00:01:03.220> Victorians<00:01:04.220> other<00:01:04.370> watch<00:01:04.610> called

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
meters and Victorians other watch called

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.140 
meters and Victorians other watch called
the<00:01:05.089> 80<00:01:05.470> goes<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.650> 500<00:01:07.220> meters<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.000> watch

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
the 80 goes to 500 meters so the watch

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.359 
the 80 goes to 500 meters so the watch
called<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.570> Deep<00:01:08.780> Diver<00:01:08.960> doesn't<00:01:09.950> go<00:01:10.040> as<00:01:10.159> deep

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
called the Deep Diver doesn't go as deep

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.450 
called the Deep Diver doesn't go as deep
as<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.850> 80<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:12.590> think<00:01:12.799> I<00:01:12.890> think<00:01:13.130> that<00:01:13.280> water

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
as the 80 and I think I think that water

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.870 
as the 80 and I think I think that water
resistance<00:01:14.030> has<00:01:14.420> a<00:01:14.450> lot<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.900> do<00:01:15.020> with<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.530> case

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
resistance has a lot to do with the case

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.359 
resistance has a lot to do with the case
gives<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.119> more<00:01:17.299> unorthodox<00:01:17.600> design<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.619> I

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
gives it's a more unorthodox design I I

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.830 
gives it's a more unorthodox design I I
like<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.119> think<00:01:20.299> is<00:01:20.420> really<00:01:20.720> really

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
like this one I think is really really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.639 
like this one I think is really really
cool<00:01:21.140> cases<00:01:21.649> big<00:01:22.009> 47<00:01:22.640> millimeters<00:01:22.850> wide<00:01:23.649> lugs

are very wide apart so you're going to

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.600 
are very wide apart so you're going to
have<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.720> have<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.869> pretty<00:01:27.200> big<00:01:27.409> wrist<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:28.430> wear

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
special about rubber that was made in

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.240 
special about rubber that was made in
Switzerland<00:01:51.110> but<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.619> quality<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.159> really

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
Switzerland but the quality is really

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.279 
Switzerland but the quality is really
really<00:01:52.789> good<00:01:53.110> sometimes<00:01:54.110> they're

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
but they're known to do that so you can
