through<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.860> Baskervilles<00:01:15.490> but<00:01:15.730> also<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.540> was

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
through the Baskervilles but also I was

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.550 
through the Baskervilles but also I was
it<00:01:17.440> was<00:01:17.590> hard<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.950> put<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.310> follow-up<00:01:18.760> shots

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it was hard to put the follow-up shots

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.590 
it was hard to put the follow-up shots
yes<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.370> gun<00:01:21.580> jump<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:23.370> kick<00:01:24.370> like<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:25.330> want

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
yes the gun jump but kick like you want

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.620 
yes the gun jump but kick like you want
me<00:01:25.840> no<00:01:26.440> I<00:01:26.740> think<00:01:26.980> because<00:01:27.760> of<00:01:27.790> that<00:01:27.940> stock<00:01:28.420> that

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
me no I think because of that stock that

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.930 
me no I think because of that stock that
stock<00:01:28.900> is<00:01:29.080> absorbing<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.620> reco<00:01:30.070> really

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
stock is absorbing the reco really

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.180 
stock is absorbing the reco really
nicely<00:01:31.180> so<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:32.080> didn't<00:01:32.350> kick<00:01:32.560> at<00:01:32.740> all<00:01:32.890> but

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
nicely so it didn't kick at all but

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.020 
nicely so it didn't kick at all but
there<00:01:33.370> was<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.730> was<00:01:33.880> jumping<00:01:34.480> and<00:01:35.440> I<00:01:36.040> could<00:01:36.729> see

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
there was it was jumping and I could see

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.140 
there was it was jumping and I could see
even<00:01:37.960> when<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.380> normal<00:01:38.710> shooting<00:01:39.340> without

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
even when the normal shooting without

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.810 
even when the normal shooting without
the<00:01:40.479> play<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:41.200> rifle<00:01:41.650> taesik<00:01:42.070> jump<00:01:42.400> out<00:01:42.640> to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
the play the rifle taesik jump out to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.950 
the play the rifle taesik jump out to
film<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.180> shooting<00:01:43.510> sir

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
film the shooting sir

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.500 
film the shooting sir
so<00:01:44.500> this<00:01:45.130> just<00:01:45.280> tells<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.760> there<00:01:45.970> is<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.090> shear

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
so this just tells you there is a shear

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.980 
so this just tells you there is a shear
force<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:47.770> through<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.940> barrel<00:01:49.390> when<00:01:49.810> you

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
force going through that barrel when you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.710 
force going through that barrel when you
do<00:01:50.140> not<00:01:50.320> have<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.490> brake<00:01:51.729> muzzle<00:01:52.180> brake<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.570> it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
do not have the brake muzzle brake on it

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.770 
do not have the brake muzzle brake on it
so<00:01:53.350> here<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:53.740> here<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.100> is<00:01:54.250> guys<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:55.570> the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
so here you here it is guys with the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.960 
so here you here it is guys with the
brake<00:01:55.990> without<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.770> peg<00:01:57.010> and<00:01:57.610> see<00:01:57.850> the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
brake without the peg and see the

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.620 
brake without the peg and see the
difference<00:01:58.650> so<00:01:59.650> that's<00:02:00.040> why<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.580> think<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.510> it's

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
difference so that's why I think so it's

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.630 
difference so that's why I think so it's
really<00:02:02.080> worth<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.070> brake<00:02:03.280> on<00:02:03.430> it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
really worth it to have the brake on it

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.580 
really worth it to have the brake on it
I<00:02:03.790> mean<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.210> don't<00:02:04.330> have<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.720> exactly<00:02:05.409> you

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
I mean you don't have to exactly you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.410 
I mean you don't have to exactly you
don't<00:02:05.799> have<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.100> use<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.460> same<00:02:06.670> bag<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.240> can

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
don't have to use the same bag you can

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.010 
don't have to use the same bag you can
use<00:02:07.450> some<00:02:08.080> other<00:02:08.200> brakes<00:02:08.590> without<00:02:09.009> great
