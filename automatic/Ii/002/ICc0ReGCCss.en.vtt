00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.650
 we make more parts of mine 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 row for colorful children's plates and have 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.890
 we have already joined many youtubers and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.109
 Of course you can continue yours 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.269
 For example, give photos underwear 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.390
 Of course yummy or and hashtag colorful 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.349

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.250

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.260
 continue the Facebook wall yes and 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.420
 today we make milk and rice 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.809
 this is so just rice pudding with 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 fruit on top of it and that's just it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.920
 story dlc also can on top fruit 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.170
 because you can, for example, from the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.059
 pomegranate these red rubies simply 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.280
 mountains with your children or together 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.930
 against man big then would be yellow topaz 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.190
 So what he just finds one 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.010
 history , for example, makes one 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.030
 small treasure hunt for the food around it 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.859
 the food around in it 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.719
 yes and if he wants to see me 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.230
 that too ready then just stay 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.480
 tuned 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.360
 So there was milk rice in the one 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.640
 cup of milk rice and yes quite normal 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.340
 rice would cook so massively at least 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.720
 and a little 230 grams of milk rice around 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.450
 all the crumbs lying around here and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 We'll put it in pot right away 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.950
 but have three before have the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.750
 liquid before and they heat up first 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.439
 once on the rice before that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.080
 I say now 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.860
 Now we go like a flood 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.500
 from make up and then we give coco for 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.000
 me to normal coconut milk and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 of it go about once again 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.290
 150 milliliters with it all the sooner 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.869
 I go on me he once said 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.610
 that starts to cuddle and 1 against 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.180
 reister in and then has the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.740
 about 20 25 minutes maximum 30 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.049
 Simmer minutes until the rice has already 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.670
 which like milk dairy I know 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.500
 I now have a dose one half 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.439
 Can you see it here with the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.140
 white stuff what he always gets and 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.659
 I press on a fork and that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.460
 rest here show you a good trick 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.680
 what you can do if we as 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.730
 small presses he just goes 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.380
 to you as if 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:18.010
 and just fred everything that is 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:21.590
 best option cocos fit 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.480
 coconut milk consume and then 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.930
 I could always as a portion of these 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.400
 then press milk and then go 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.260
 to the cocktail or something else 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.520
 connect 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.540
 next time I have one here 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.900
 zimtstange are 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.000
 an orange once without once not bio 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.170
 always bio that has washed times and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.080
 Extract something and if you are in 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:50.210
 accurately and theft we give equal to 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.340
 where I make the rice the same 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.860
 even with the orange here only we pull 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.210
 first test us here and that 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:04.190
 I take two test and a fixed or 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.840
 also two boxes of lemon and that 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.600
 we give in about ten minutes 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.880
 cooking time just like that is now 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.010
 my milk rice maria already by heavy 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.960
 does that know you are that and yes 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.970
 of course, a wonderful scent of 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.060
 cocos no question and why go 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.370
 now for the first time more flavors 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.960
 and they really fit that and that 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.210
 here is my homemade man in 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:32.660
 syrup without alcohol or sugar and always 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:37.370
 if I give myself everywhere now 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.350
 here's a whole it's once referring 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.959
 like here how many vanilla points here 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.310
 are in it and I can only recommend 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.470
 I once put the video down in 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.720
 the infobox does not cost much 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.010
 cheaper than to buy 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.380
 my god how could i get the sugar 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.300
 I forgot , too 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.390
 homemade man the ca i show 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.630
 that once since I've been a 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.800
 video made believe i fled plan little 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.150
 is still and which I go one 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.810
 tablespoon rainer i do not quite like it 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.050
 so sweet dear the nice euro now but 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.630
 still temporarily a mango snowing older 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.479
 and delicious pomegranate and the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.799
 pomegranate you first divide once 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.599
 and 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.159
 knock the little one out or break up 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.650
 under water best in the bowl 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.810
 I'll show you what I mean 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.460
 against accept as the pomegranate me 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.020
 just stood by many 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.069
 possibilities to cut it open 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.460
 what am I going to do in the water right now? 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.949
 then go there and you can now 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.139
 just break up 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.909
 You see that all the cores come out 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.759
 we do not need all the cores at all 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.449
 no case but first you can just 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.150
 eat like that 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.099
 I like to give into the glass and it then him 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.400
 just so now that just everything 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.879
 drain and then drain the kernels 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.560
 to let 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:03.759
 that's going to steal the bomber once and 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.050
 then the mango part and a 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.580
 cut small cubes 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.150
 So we go to pruning 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.639
 Just go back down the rest here 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:20.050
 of course, obliquely cut off nothing 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:21.940
 wasting very important have now 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.039
 We are almost finished the milk rice 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.770
 two more minutes and now 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.779
 we deal thing, the increases 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.569
 held a bit and although closely 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:34.060
 we take some cream the fruits are 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.740
 only to alibi about 50 grams the 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.270
 Let's get in here now and let that go 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.319
 now you've come to an end you see 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.960
 a little bit grimminger here now 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:44.279
 again smelling liquid in it like that 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:49.180
 then we go now in peace the plate 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:51.400
 and give it to me but I know well 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.610
 we're gonna watch that when we go 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.400
 then the tick removed so long ago 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:04.779
 goes there of course a few times 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:09.340
 shake and then he goes in to take 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:11.889
 Some of you like to be on top of it 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:17.529
 and finally as topping there is still 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:20.259
 then some almonds on top 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.419
 Now comes the photo and I'm done 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.770
