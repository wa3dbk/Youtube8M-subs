steel frame a trellis type frame this

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.960 
steel frame a trellis type frame this
frame<00:01:07.380> does<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:08.070> come<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.760> around

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
frame does not come all the way around

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.570 
frame does not come all the way around
underneath<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> motor<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.549> on

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
underneath the motor it is just here on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
underneath the motor it is just here on
the<00:01:12.180> top<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.930> wraps<00:01:13.170> around<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the top and kind of wraps around that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.130 
the top and kind of wraps around that
way<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> motor<00:01:15.240> becomes<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.810> stressed

how<00:02:07.770> long<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.130> foot<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.240> can<00:02:09.420> move<00:02:09.630> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
how long your foot is you can move that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.980 
how long your foot is you can move that
front<00:02:10.259> or<00:02:10.530> back<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.130> bit<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:12.660> exhaust

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
front or back a little bit the exhaust

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.350 
front or back a little bit the exhaust
is<00:02:13.290> underbody<00:02:14.070> mounted<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.090> brings

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
is underbody mounted that really brings

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.620 
is underbody mounted that really brings
the<00:02:15.570> center<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.110> gravity<00:02:16.560> down<00:02:16.740> nice<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.070> low

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
the center of gravity down nice and low

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.020 
the center of gravity down nice and low
alright<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:18.990> exhaust<00:02:19.920> underbody<00:02:20.459> exhaust

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
alright so exhaust underbody exhaust

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.080 
alright so exhaust underbody exhaust
there<00:02:21.920> look<00:02:22.920> at<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.130> motor<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.700> see<00:02:23.880> your

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
there look at the motor you can see your

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.949 
there look at the motor you can see your

has a this is a heat exchanger I called

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.070 
has a this is a heat exchanger I called
it<00:02:32.940> an<00:02:33.000> oil<00:02:33.180> cooler<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.750> think<00:02:33.959> it's

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
it an oil cooler but I think it's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.620 
it an oil cooler but I think it's
technically<00:02:34.440> called<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.800> exchanger<00:02:35.630> coolant
