00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
really good pretty surprising for a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.009 
really good pretty surprising for a
guitar<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.340> age<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:24.420> here's<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> guitar

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
guitar of this age so here's the guitar

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.990 
guitar of this age so here's the guitar
and<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.580> through<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.760> little

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
and it's just going through a little

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:54.260 
and it's just going through a little
mountain<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> amp<00:00:27.810> over<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:53.030> just<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.180> no

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
mountain the amp over here just for no

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.819 
mountain the amp over here just for no
good<00:00:54.420> reason<00:00:54.480> I'll<00:00:55.170> start<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.590> what's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
good reason I'll start with what's

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.459 
good reason I'll start with what's
probably<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.489> least<00:00:56.940> effective<00:00:57.629> effect<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
probably the least effective effect and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
probably the least effective effect and
that's<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.890> repeater<00:00:59.340> which<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> tremolo

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that's the repeater which is a tremolo

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:15.140 
that's the repeater which is a tremolo
and<00:01:00.449> that's<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.410> last<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:01.980> down<00:01:02.520> here

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:28.230 

and<00:01:15.600> there

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.270 

I<00:01:29.240> don't<00:01:29.900> know<00:01:30.050> if<00:01:30.140> just<00:01:30.380> cleaning<00:01:30.860> up<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:30.980> pot

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
I don't know if just cleaning up the pot

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.340 
I don't know if just cleaning up the pot
and<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.490> switch<00:01:31.730> might<00:01:31.970> fix<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.510> but<00:01:33.170> then

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
and the switch might fix that but then

00:01:33.350 --> 00:02:15.559 
and the switch might fix that but then
the<00:01:33.530> next<00:01:33.770> one<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.490> distortion<00:01:34.940> which

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:38.440 

here's<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.470> treble<00:02:17.190> bass<00:02:17.700> boost<00:02:18.390> which

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.880 

just<00:02:39.450> find<00:02:39.689> that<00:02:39.870> plugs<00:02:40.109> not<00:02:40.319> dirty<00:02:40.620> or
