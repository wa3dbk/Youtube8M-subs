00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.800
 to technically express the player 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.449
 football must be in full swing 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.640
 possession of his physical means and 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.620
 athletic 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.600
 the footballers are runners the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.780
 vast majority of energy expended 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.480
 certainly to run the energy expenditure 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.040
 related to technical actions is low in 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.809
 comparison of those needed for 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.120
 race 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.620
 the energy cost of the race is 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:11.740
 increased by the many changes 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:12.759
 direction and speed at the level of 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.590
 training 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.119
 the aerobic sector represent the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.130
 work intensity ranges from 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.800
 development of endurance qualities 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.530
 it reflects the ability of the body to 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.920
 extract carry and used 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.619
 oxygen to transform energy 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.940
 before talking about the aerobic industry 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.520
 allow us a little chapter on the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.140
 energy transformation 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.619
 three channels make it possible to transform 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.619
 energy the aerobic industry uses 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.009
 the oxygen of the atmosphere the die 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.489
 Anaerobic lactic not used 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.190
 of oxygen and does not produce acidity the 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:53.099
 anaerobic lactic acid sector products from 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.539
 acidity in the body 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.780
 these three paths transforms energy 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.819
 it does not produce a body 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.039
 is crossed by the energy it is 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.259
 unable to produce it 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.720
 the common goal of this trio is to regenerate 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.810
 the only molecule of usable energy 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.010
 by our muscles atp adenosine 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.050
 triphosphate we are talking about vo2max 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.940
 threshold capacity pma endurance 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.239
 but what is behind these 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.239
 barbaric words
