00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
three braids don't need to be equal and

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.210 
three braids don't need to be equal and
you<00:02:08.899> don't<00:02:09.080> need<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.319> be<00:02:09.410> really<00:02:09.709> neat<00:02:09.950> because

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
you don't need to be really neat because

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.339 
you don't need to be really neat because
this<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.610> meant<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.239> be<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.450> nice<00:02:11.720> messy

hairstyle

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.150 
hairstyle
I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.870> when<00:02:15.050> all<00:02:15.380> three<00:02:15.650> breeds<00:02:15.890> are<00:02:16.040> not

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
I think when all three breeds are not
