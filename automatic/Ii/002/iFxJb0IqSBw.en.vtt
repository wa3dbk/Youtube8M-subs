00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.640
 pending historical issues we have the 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.900
 obligation to solve 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.200
 bolivia in the year 1825 born with output 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200
 to the sea 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.290
 Regrettably 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.439
 the series to the sea has been lost 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.930
 unfairly 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.290
 taxes in addition to that and the treaty 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.680
 unfulfilled 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.500
 I say taxes because we lost went to 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:45.010
 sea ​​by force to force and with 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.010
 external help the year 1879 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.160
 I say unfair 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 sisters and brothers, put on a minute 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.170
 of that child who knows by history that his 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.030
 homeland your bolivia are nation born with 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.940
 antofagasta calama blanc tocopilla 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.480
 tallest mussels therefore in the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.340
 coastal the department 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.340
 a department of bolivia 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.100
 when you think 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.750
 if bolivia had this city of these 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.450
 regions 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.830
 and now he does not have it 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.870
 he feels he suffers 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.180
 that grandmother or is grandfather 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.030
 I knew that Bolivia was born with an exit 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.800
 to the sea another science where is my 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.040
 mussels where is my blanket where 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.390
 this bed where is tocopilla another 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.780
 city ​​of intermedias that had 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.150
 after 50 years 54 years of the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.150
 foundation of the republic is lost 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.119
 a right of the Bolivian people 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.119
 but because an unfulfilled treaty 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.130
 sisters and brothers 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.710
 briefly explain 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.050
 about breach of that treaty 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.200
 by state political constitution 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.200
 plurinational 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.630
 I want to tell you that finally a law 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.510
 cosmic of our ancestors 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.050
 recognized the ama sua loves llulla ama 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.010
 ckella 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.769
 Do not steal, do not lie or reflux 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.970
 is the best standard that we have 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.600
 indigenous peoples 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.830
 and that's why I do not want to disrespect the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.180
 true 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.180
 but waking up 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.060
 to our Latin American authorities 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.460
 and the Caribbean 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.670
 I have an obligation to clarify about 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.670
 the breach of the treaty of 1904 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.490
 chile violated and violates permanently but 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.370
 there's something where I want you not to 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.490
 wrong the moral president the issues 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.680
 of sovereignty 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.140
 it is not negotiated it is true by interests 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.820
 economic issues of sovereignty over 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.180
 a theme for chile and for the immense 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.110
 most of the world something very sensitive and 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.610
 you speak of blanket antofagasta you 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.590
 I mean what I said during the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.110
 campaign when I was a candidate and what I've 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.040
 said that so many times Chilean is 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.500
 willing to cut or divide your 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.960
 territory and I think that no country in the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.550
 world you can ask for a situation of 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.950
 that nature 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.170
 if we are willing and we have always 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.330
 been willing through dialogue 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.910
 Goodwill and collaboration to 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.680
 find facilities and in fact many 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.350
 of the points you mentioned and here 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.150
 I have a long list of documents you 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.180
 we have asked us to resort to 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.250
 the bodies and the committees and 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.670
 specialized working groups in each 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.700
 one of the free traffic matters 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.140
 railway and bolivia ports 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.760
 systematically did not want to attend 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.930
 to those invitations from chile- to that 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.849
 dialogue 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.790
 but let's not get caught up in the 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.489
 past I do not invite this president 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.090
 morals here 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.880
 let's look in the working groups that 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.130
 better solutions are established and 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.060
 we can find it before any 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.250
 type of problem that you want to put 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.080
 up the table and I assure you it's going 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.419
 to find with the best will of 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.910
 our country to facilitate transit 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.710
 of Bolivian commerce and I want to say 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.120
 something else and you know it if we exclude the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.050
 land trade with countries 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.050
 bordering that is by land more than 70% 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.050
 of Bolivian commerce goes out or enters 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.120
 Chilean ports and that 's the best 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.470
 proof that the conditions that 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.599
 offer the Chilean ports are 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.520
 favorable conditions because bolivia 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.789
 have other alternatives that you 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.979
 many times is responsible for reminding us 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.580
 and therefore true here I would like 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.639
 finish these words telling you that 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.259
 exists on behalf of the government's chile 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.050
 Chilean and you also know it and it has 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:22.069
 I was able to experience many times the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.199
 better will for through the 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.960
 paths of dialogue to give faithful 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.520
 compliance always even spend more 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.370
 beyond what is established in the treaty of 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.500
 1904 beyond what is established by 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.750
 international conventions on 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.060
 of treatment to Mediterranean countries because 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.689
 we understand very well that chile wants 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.270
 have the best relationship with bolivia and what 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:48.190
 we want firmly but I also want 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.640
 that you know that this president 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.450
 will defend the sovereignty of our 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.580
 country because not only is my right 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.919
 It is my obligation 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.879
 and consequently if you want 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:05.830
 find solutions with respect 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.169
 to international treaties that 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.210
 two countries we have signed and within the 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.550
 context of international law is going 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.849
 to always find the best 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.129
 will and disposition of our country 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:22.030
 if you want to look for solutions outside 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:24.849
 of respect for the treaty of 1904 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.620
 naturally that Chile as a country that 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.110
 signed that treaty that meets its 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.940
 treated will take the measures 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.190
 necessary within the law 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.830
 international for that treaty to be 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.389
 comply and in that way president 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.830
 morals we can end up with this 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.780
 dialogue of the deaf that sometimes 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.699
 establishes between both countries and wait 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.610
 that this summit is what allows us 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:48.099
 find paths of the future within 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.199
 solidarity friendship and brotherhood 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:52.770
 that you should always demand is from two countries 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:56.270
 neighbors and brothers like bolivia and chile 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.850
 and also naturally 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.250
 also naturally within the respect 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.080
 to what are the treaties and the right 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.080
 international that is the position of 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.910
 Chile in a clear position is a 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.280
 open position is a position 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.960
 constructive but it's also a 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.960
 firm position thank you very much
