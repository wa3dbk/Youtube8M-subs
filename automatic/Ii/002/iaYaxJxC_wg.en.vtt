major warlock chemin ready to guess

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.269 
major warlock chemin ready to guess
being<00:00:18.020> in<00:00:18.080> this<00:00:18.169> game<00:00:18.410> here<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.919> world<00:00:19.189> lock

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
being in this game here the world lock

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.980 
being in this game here the world lock
puts<00:00:19.520> a<00:00:19.640> crisp<00:00:19.910> exhaustion<00:00:20.300> on<00:00:20.570> all<00:00:20.779> of<00:00:20.930> us

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
puts a crisp exhaustion on all of us

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.179 
puts a crisp exhaustion on all of us
which<00:00:21.169> is<00:00:21.290> I<00:00:21.380> think<00:00:21.410> it's<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.649> big<00:00:21.800> waste<00:00:21.980> of

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
which is I think it's a big waste of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.319 
which is I think it's a big waste of
time<00:00:22.399> because<00:00:22.700> you<00:00:22.849> could<00:00:22.970> have<00:00:23.060> just<00:00:23.119> meant

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
time because you could have just meant

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.940 
time because you could have just meant
that<00:00:23.390> time<00:00:23.720> getting<00:00:23.960> its<00:00:24.050> first<00:00:24.200> unstable

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
that time getting its first unstable

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.569 
that time getting its first unstable
affliction<00:00:25.009> off<00:00:26.410> and<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.739> mage<00:00:27.890> does<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.460> old

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
affliction off and the mage does the old

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.880 
affliction off and the mage does the old
ring<00:00:29.029> of<00:00:29.119> frost<00:00:29.210> after<00:00:30.169> a<00:00:30.200> deep<00:00:30.439> freeze<00:00:30.649> which

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
ring of frost after a deep freeze which

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.340 
ring of frost after a deep freeze which
is<00:00:31.070> pretty<00:00:31.250> much<00:00:31.369> unavoidable<00:00:32.210> unless<00:00:33.140> you

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
is pretty much unavoidable unless you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.220 
is pretty much unavoidable unless you
sound<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:34.130> me<00:00:34.160> jazzy<00:00:34.700> guess<00:00:34.989> deep<00:00:35.989> freeze

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
sound to me jazzy guess deep freeze

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.630
