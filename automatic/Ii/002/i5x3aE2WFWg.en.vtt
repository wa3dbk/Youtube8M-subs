hello<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.669> Herschel<00:00:03.030> Pangborn<00:00:03.419> here<00:00:03.750> to

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hello a Herschel Pangborn here to

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.559 
hello a Herschel Pangborn here to
demonstrate<00:00:04.290> version<00:00:05.009> 2.0<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.330> home

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
demonstrate version 2.0 of the home

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.620 
demonstrate version 2.0 of the home
irrigation<00:00:07.230> system<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:07.770> watering<00:00:08.400> plants

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
irrigation system for watering plants

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.700 
irrigation system for watering plants
there<00:00:09.630> are<00:00:09.750> two<00:00:09.929> new<00:00:10.080> things<00:00:10.380> with<00:00:10.620> this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
there are two new things with this

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.230 
there are two new things with this
version<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.519> first<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.150> runs

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
version the first is that it runs

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.120 
version the first is that it runs
exclusively<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.019> battery<00:00:13.380> power<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.950> can

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
exclusively on battery power so you can

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.400 
exclusively on battery power so you can
see<00:00:14.519> back<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.990> 9-volt

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
see back here we have just a 9-volt

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.950 
see back here we have just a 9-volt
battery<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.949> runs<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.369> whole<00:00:17.520> deal<00:00:17.840> and<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
battery that runs the whole deal and the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.779 
battery that runs the whole deal and the
other<00:00:19.080> difference<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.680> right<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> LCD

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
other difference is right here the LCD

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.460 
other difference is right here the LCD
screen<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.420> allows<00:00:21.689> us<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.020> get<00:00:22.199> some

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
screen so this allows us to get some

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
screen so this allows us to get some
feedback<00:00:23.160> from<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> system<00:00:23.850> without<00:00:24.150> having

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
feedback from the system without having

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.529 
feedback from the system without having
to<00:00:24.539> plug<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.960> computer<00:00:26.029> alright<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.240> right

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
to plug into a computer alright so right

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.050 
to plug into a computer alright so right
now<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:28.109> see<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.439> red<00:00:28.769> LED<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
now you can see the red LED here that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.150 
now you can see the red LED here that
indicates<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.109> system<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:32.009> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
indicates that the system is out of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.549 
indicates that the system is out of
water<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.180> over<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.750> our<00:00:34.110> pump<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
water so over here we have our pump and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.549 
water so over here we have our pump and
a<00:00:34.590> water<00:00:34.770> tank<00:00:35.160> obviously<00:00:36.170> in<00:00:37.170> real<00:00:37.410> life

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
a water tank obviously in real life

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.900 
a water tank obviously in real life
you'd<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> hose<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> your

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
you'd have a hose here going to your

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.299 
you'd have a hose here going to your
plant<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.170> demo<00:00:40.320> purposes<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.920> put<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.190> on

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
plant but for demo purposes I put it on

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.130 
plant but for demo purposes I put it on
the<00:00:41.399> Shelf<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> make<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> little<00:00:42.960> bit

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the Shelf just to make it a little bit

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.380 
the Shelf just to make it a little bit
easier<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.440> show<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.770> guys<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.239> also

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
easier to show you guys and then we also

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.799 
easier to show you guys and then we also
have<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.920> our<00:00:47.640> moisture<00:00:48.270> sensor<00:00:48.600> which

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
have in here our moisture sensor which

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.740 
have in here our moisture sensor which
is<00:00:48.840> basically<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.649> power<00:00:50.070> plug<00:00:50.750> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
is basically just a power plug it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
is basically just a power plug it's
covered<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.230> dirt<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:52.980> been

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
covered in dirt here because it's been

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
covered in dirt here because it's been
buried<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.550> yeah<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.090> power<00:00:54.750> plug

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
buried but yeah it's just a power plug

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.959 
buried but yeah it's just a power plug
like<00:00:55.110> you'd<00:00:55.260> see<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> while<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.730> stick

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
like you'd see for a while and you stick

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.010 
like you'd see for a while and you stick
it<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> soil<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:58.579> alright<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.020> once

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it in the soil there alright so once

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.479 
it in the soil there alright so once
again<00:01:01.140> our<00:01:01.260> system<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.739> telling<00:01:02.039> us<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.340> out

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
again our system is telling us it's out

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.969 
again our system is telling us it's out
of<00:01:02.520> water<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.290> refill<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
of water so what we do is we refill the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.859 
of water so what we do is we refill the
water<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.850> come<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.600> press

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
water and then come over and we press

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
water and then come over and we press
our<00:01:07.170> button<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.920> I'm<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> press<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
our button here I'm going to press the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.240 
our button here I'm going to press the
button<00:01:08.990> it'll<00:01:09.990> start<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> water<00:01:10.710> again<00:01:10.890> this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
button it'll start to water again this

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.210 
button it'll start to water again this
green<00:01:11.549> light<00:01:11.790> indicates<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.630> systems<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.290> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
green light indicates all systems go so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.999 
green light indicates all systems go so
it<00:01:14.820> won't<00:01:15.000> actually<00:01:15.150> water<00:01:15.479> until<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.170> turn<00:01:16.710> on

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it won't actually water until I turn on

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.910 
it won't actually water until I turn on
the<00:01:17.850> power<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.420> pump<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.960> I'll<00:01:19.409> flip<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the power to the pump so I'll flip that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.990 
the power to the pump so I'll flip that
and<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:20.880> goes<00:01:21.140> watering<00:01:22.640> all<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.759> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and there goes watering all right so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.460 
and there goes watering all right so
it'll<00:01:24.119> water<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.479> about<00:01:24.570> five<00:01:24.840> seconds<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it'll water for about five seconds and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.960 
it'll water for about five seconds and
LCD<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.070> actually<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> cycle<00:01:26.700> between

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
LCD is actually going to cycle between

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
LCD is actually going to cycle between
three<00:01:27.360> different<00:01:27.390> stages<00:01:28.049> hopefully<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> can

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
three different stages hopefully you can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.840 
three different stages hopefully you can
see<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.329> one<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.979> show<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.250> voltages

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
see them one it will show the voltages

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.670 
see them one it will show the voltages
so<00:01:33.180> it'll<00:01:33.390> compare<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> voltage<00:01:34.290> being

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so it'll compare the voltage being

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280 
so it'll compare the voltage being
measured<00:01:34.829> at<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> plant<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> voltage<00:01:36.390> as

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
measured at the plant to the voltage as

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
measured at the plant to the voltage as
set<00:01:37.770> by<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> potentiometer<00:01:38.790> adjustment<00:01:39.299> knob

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
set by the potentiometer adjustment knob

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.440 
set by the potentiometer adjustment knob
alright<00:01:40.380> screen<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.490> they'll<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.270> show

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
alright screen to they'll actually show

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149 
alright screen to they'll actually show
you<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.200> watering<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> plant<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you that it's watering the plant and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
you that it's watering the plant and
screen<00:01:44.880> three<00:01:45.180> it'll<00:01:45.479> tell<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> how<00:01:45.869> much

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
screen three it'll tell you how much

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
screen three it'll tell you how much
time<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.040> left<00:01:47.070> time<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.790> watering<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.329> left<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
time is left time of watering is left in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.469 
time is left time of watering is left in
the<00:01:48.869> tank<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.250> now<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.549> want<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> maybe

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the tank so right now if I want to maybe

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.569 
the tank so right now if I want to maybe
heat<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> soil<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> little<00:01:52.259> dryer<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.009> can

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
heat the soil a little dryer I can

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.090 
heat the soil a little dryer I can
rotate<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.390> potentiometer<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.530> next<00:01:55.950> cycle

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
rotate the potentiometer and next cycle

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.940 
rotate the potentiometer and next cycle
it<00:01:56.310> around<00:01:56.869> it'll<00:01:57.869> choose<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> lot<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it around it'll choose not a lot of the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
it around it'll choose not a lot of the
plant<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.840> voltage<00:02:00.840> coming<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.320> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
plant because the voltage coming out of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.069 
plant because the voltage coming out of
the<00:02:01.969> moisture<00:02:02.969> sensor<00:02:03.119> up<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.869> high

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the moisture sensor up here is not high

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.029 
the moisture sensor up here is not high
enough<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:06.649> no<00:02:07.649> longer

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
enough so as you can see no longer

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.360 
enough so as you can see no longer
watering<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.520> plant<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.149> stopped<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.370> when

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
watering the plant it stopped and when

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.250 
watering the plant it stopped and when
you<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.879> comparison<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.080> two

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you see the comparison of the two

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
you see the comparison of the two
voltages

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
voltages

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.500 
voltages
hopefully<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.300> screen

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
hopefully you can see that on the screen

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.040 
hopefully you can see that on the screen
you<00:02:16.470> would<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.580> not<00:02:17.790> high<00:02:18.000> enough

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
you would see that it's not high enough

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.280 
you would see that it's not high enough
and<00:02:19.050> then<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.440> turn<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.920> knob<00:02:20.460> back<00:02:20.700> up

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
and then if I turn this knob back up

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.110 
and then if I turn this knob back up
momentarily<00:02:22.290> it'll<00:02:22.620> start<00:02:22.890> wandering<00:02:23.310> again

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.880 

let's<00:02:27.120> see<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.810> there's<00:02:27.990> our<00:02:28.140> pump<00:02:28.500> once<00:02:28.710> again

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
let's see so there's our pump once again

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.410 
let's see so there's our pump once again
the<00:02:31.890> pump<00:02:32.100> right<00:02:32.250> now<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.330> know

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
the pump right now is just you know

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.320 
the pump right now is just you know
plugged<00:02:33.690> into<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.340> 120<00:02:35.340> volt<00:02:35.820> from<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.120> wall

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
plugged into the 120 volt from the wall

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.450 
plugged into the 120 volt from the wall
you<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.500> real<00:02:37.650> system<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.160> probably

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
you know in a real system you probably

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.670 
you know in a real system you probably
want<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.730> get<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.940> lower<00:02:39.300> voltage<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.380> lower

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
want to get a lower voltage a lower

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.199 
want to get a lower voltage a lower
current<00:02:41.040> pump<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.520> then<00:02:41.610> that's<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.970> kind<00:02:42.090> of

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
current pump and then that's the kind of

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.050 
current pump and then that's the kind of
thing<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.600> could<00:02:42.750> plug<00:02:43.020> right<00:02:43.680> into<00:02:44.060> a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
thing that you could plug right into a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.970 
thing that you could plug right into a
solar<00:02:45.570> panel<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.080> wanted<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.860> can

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
solar panel if you wanted to you can

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.260 
solar panel if you wanted to you can
also<00:02:47.100> run<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.459> Arduino<00:02:47.790> with<00:02:47.910> solar<00:02:48.120> power

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
also run the Arduino with solar power

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.380 
also run the Arduino with solar power
pretty<00:02:48.570> easy<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:50.160> next<00:02:50.490> steps<00:02:50.700> or<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.030> system

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
pretty easy so next steps or this system

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880 
pretty easy so next steps or this system
obviously<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.110> first<00:02:52.350> thing<00:02:52.530> you'd<00:02:52.650> want<00:02:52.830> to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
obviously the first thing you'd want to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.360 
obviously the first thing you'd want to
do<00:02:53.070> would<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.910> up<00:02:54.150> there<00:02:54.180> go<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.600> pump<00:02:54.810> again

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
do would be up there go to pump again

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.210 
do would be up there go to pump again
alright<00:02:57.380> anyway<00:02:58.380> next<00:02:58.709> steps<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.070> first

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
alright anyway next steps the first

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.920 
alright anyway next steps the first
thing<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.489> want<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.670> do<00:02:59.820> would<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.239> enclose

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
thing you want to do would be to enclose

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.960 
thing you want to do would be to enclose
it<00:03:01.220> waterproof<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.610> everything's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
it waterproof it's that everything's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.640 
it waterproof it's that everything's
really<00:03:03.180> safe<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.750> could<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.020> put<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.620> your

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
really safe you could just put in your

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.140 
really safe you could just put in your
guard<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.070> leave<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.400> not<00:03:05.550> worry<00:03:05.730> about<00:03:05.880> rain

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
guard and leave it not worry about rain

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.820 
guard and leave it not worry about rain
and<00:03:06.450> not<00:03:06.540> worry<00:03:06.690> about<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.410> pump<00:03:07.650> getting

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
and not worry about the the pump getting

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.800 
and not worry about the the pump getting
anything<00:03:08.160> wet<00:03:08.340> another<00:03:09.270> thing<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.540> could<00:03:09.660> do

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
anything wet another thing you could do

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.630 
anything wet another thing you could do
is<00:03:10.020> put<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> little<00:03:10.290> Wi-Fi<00:03:10.800> board<00:03:11.070> on<00:03:11.220> there

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
is put a little Wi-Fi board on there

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.479 
is put a little Wi-Fi board on there
