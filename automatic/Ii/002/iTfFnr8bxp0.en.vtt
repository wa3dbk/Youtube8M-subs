00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone with you wiki and games and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.189
 Today we will plunge into the past 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.059
 our cloudless childhood and so top 10 16 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.710
 bit games 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:19.320
 let's go today our top opens one 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.920
 of the best bitmap in the 90s golden 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.840
 x3 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 why exactly the third part you ask 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 just in my humble opinion this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.080
 the part was the most polished as in 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.070
 in terms of gameplay solitary and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.949
 multiplayer 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.870
 bitmap medieval with this where the tenth 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.180
 martial climbs ranked higher 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.239
 the toads along with the brothers beat and jimmy 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.219
 from the double dragon series in general on 16 bit 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.120
 the console was a lot of fans of the genre 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.370
 bitmap 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 however, what is remarkable was not there 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.930
 such a terrible copy what 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.449
 happens in our years every game had 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.090
 unique gameplay unique boivka 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.440
 battle was interesting at the same time 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.690
 challenging and funny 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.280
 but I'm talking about those moments when you play 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.470
 multiplayer your friend falls and you 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.570
 run up beats them will help a giant foot 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.640
 you are not one to whom 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.560
 memory this toy sat down or rather 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.509
 beatmap guys oh how I love this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.729
 a game called street afraid in 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.040
 features the third part is a little taut 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.500
 graphics with new characters to the election and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.390
 superudar s play it alone was 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.850
 just gorgeous and many opponents 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.979
 improvised weapon combined techniques 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.950
 interesting bosses and catchy 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.950
 characters street of reach eighth 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.920

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.229
 customization excellent music chic 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.060
 gameplay and bosses are not alone gonochki not 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.009
 there can be comparisons with this project 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 silicon &amp; synapse 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.540
 which later became famous 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.360
 under the name blizzard that's where the roots come from 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.240
 craftsmen grow races on dragon roll 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.240
 seventh place 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.860

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.420
 kozyavok in goal 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.610
 boogerman boogerman was funny and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.569
 interesting yes and the plot there was quite 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.180
 nothing 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.590
 a little addict of course but had 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.590
 place to be in all this toilet 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.970
 Bacchanalia boogerman throwing kozyavki 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.310
 sega in sixth place 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.200
 well, at least my head is the words sega 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.480
 immediately associated with this 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.090
 character speed hedgehog by name 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.370
 Sonic so you zadrachivali this platform 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.390
 absolutely everything and if you haven't played 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.700
 sonic the hedgehog 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.620
 turn off the top 10 go to the taiga 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.230

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.690
 society we just don't need you for all 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.019
 the rest let's look nostalgic 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.480
 on this masterpiece 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.049
 but everything is enough is enough and so super 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.299
 speedy hedgehog sonic fifth place 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.250
 fourth place probably got the most 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.590
 original game that ever 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.870
 saw this arcade action freak 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.510
 beaten mothers who possessed truly 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.959
 original cool complex beautiful 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.820
 the plot and the exact same boomey i'm not 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.250
 it is beyond words to convey those feelings 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.739
 emotions that caused me this game 14 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.840
 years ago I remember what it was like to use 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.730
 cool combos and super blows let out 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.980
 his helper rat so she found 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.500
 you some items and how it was 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.350
 sad when her enemies killed ah 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.660
 what grafon was there and the music was voice acting 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.290
 it's just a pleasure in the flesh 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.600
 comic he deservedly fourth place well 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.269
 are you ready the top three finalists already 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.090
 here now and opens it like this 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.790
 strange strategy i'm not a fan at all 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.799
 this genre but in dune 2 i played starving 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.260
 and without departing from yourself to elder brother 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.880
 didn't take my place but as nostalgia already 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.010
 he began to drill the most inappropriate 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.200
 for this places from alone 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.270
 names you want to get yourself a closet and 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.610
 run the dune 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.300
 you just listen to these words from 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.750
 raid with 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.820
 ardis their lasso sonic tank devastator 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.340
 but to reach for the gamepad 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.470
 I think and without further ado it is clear that this 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.640
 the progenitor of the genre is worthy to open three 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.890
 finalists dune 2 3 places as decided 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.870
 all the controversy in his youth no we did not climb 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.420
 on wikipedia we didn't ask for advice on 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.920
 two we walked and beat each other snouts in 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.470
 mortal kombat 3 ultimate 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.080
 a huge number of fighters gorgeous 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.640
 mechanics cruelty complexity in general 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.680
 describe all the awesomeness of the fighting game 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.140
 hard enough in words for this 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.850
 just had to play though even if 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.580
 you try now you are unlikely to be 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:57.940
 disappointed al teammate mortal kombat 3 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:59.630
 second place then our first place 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.390
 16-bit top 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.620
 This game combined adventure q 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.990
 action and platform 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.760
 probably one of the funniest games of that 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.540
 time and what really to confess and 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.810
 now too 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.550
 worm jim a bunch of weapons inexpressible 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.560
 the protagonist's charm is the most 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.910
 ridiculous bosses that you can imagine 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.910
 present the best sound 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.010
 accompaniment and complexity of course i 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.350
 I think that the worm is a super suit by right 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.290
 sits on the iron throne of our top 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.060
 well, that's all with you was batman all 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.310
