00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
controls how much fuel the engine gets

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.510 
controls how much fuel the engine gets
and<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:17.290> goes<00:01:17.500> into<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:18.240> fuel<00:01:19.240> venturi<00:01:19.630> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and this goes into a fuel venturi and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.279 
and this goes into a fuel venturi and
this<00:01:21.520> venturi<00:01:21.970> unscrews<00:01:22.780> from<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.110> valve

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
this venturi unscrews from the valve

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.440 
this venturi unscrews from the valve
head<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:25.380> Dynojet<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.500> just<00:01:26.710> has<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.880> fuel

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
head and Dynojet it just has to fuel

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.010 
head and Dynojet it just has to fuel
host<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:30.360> fuel<00:01:31.360> gets<00:01:31.539> sucked<00:01:31.810> out<00:01:31.960> of

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
host that the fuel gets sucked out of

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.649 
host that the fuel gets sucked out of
and<00:01:32.979> turns<00:01:33.700> into<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.119> fine

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
and turns into the fine

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.630 
and turns into the fine
spray<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:38.080> also<00:01:38.229> has<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.530> starting<00:01:39.490> air

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
spray and it also has a starting air

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.630 
spray and it also has a starting air
tube<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.630> do<00:01:40.899> you<00:01:40.990> blow<00:01:41.409> compressed<00:01:41.799> air<00:01:42.130> into

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
tube and do you blow compressed air into

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.289 
tube and do you blow compressed air into
that<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.899> flows<00:01:44.200> out<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:45.270> blows<00:01:46.270> it

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
that and that flows out and blows it

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.809 
that and that flows out and blows it
directly<00:01:46.780> over<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.110> holes<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.009> get<00:01:48.190> the

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
directly over the holes so you get the

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.880 
directly over the holes so you get the
perfect<00:01:49.179> amount<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.569> fuel<00:01:50.140> for<00:01:50.380> starting<00:01:50.799> it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
perfect amount of fuel for starting it

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.580 
perfect amount of fuel for starting it
now<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:52.209> valve<00:01:52.479> head<00:01:52.720> has<00:01:53.610> got<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:55.590> tapered

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
now the valve head has got this tapered

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.960 
now the valve head has got this tapered
intake<00:01:57.549> here<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.869> leads<00:01:59.140> into<00:01:59.970> a-10

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
intake here and that leads into a-10

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.300 
intake here and that leads into a-10
openings<00:02:01.450> for<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.810> valves<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.439> each<00:02:02.860> opening

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
openings for the valves and each opening

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.510 
openings for the valves and each opening
is<00:02:03.429> covered<00:02:03.759> by<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:03.970> valve<00:02:04.270> title<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:05.520> what

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
is covered by a valve title and what

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.550 
is covered by a valve title and what
happens<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:07.030> when<00:02:07.209> air<00:02:07.420> flows<00:02:08.110> into<00:02:08.349> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
happens is when air flows into the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.199 
happens is when air flows into the
intake<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:10.660> acts<00:02:10.899> as<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> venturi<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.730> pulls

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
intake it acts as a venturi and it pulls

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.229 
intake it acts as a venturi and it pulls
the<00:02:13.480> fuel<00:02:13.780> up<00:02:13.989> from<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.859> fuel<00:02:15.100> tank<00:02:15.239> through

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
the fuel up from the fuel tank through

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.970 
the fuel up from the fuel tank through
the<00:02:16.420> fuel<00:02:16.959> venturi<00:02:17.320> itself

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the fuel venturi itself

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.160 
the fuel venturi itself
I<00:02:18.750> usually<00:02:19.750> call<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.109> flow<00:02:20.799> chapter<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
I usually call this a flow chapter and

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.370 
I usually call this a flow chapter and
when<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:23.980> happens<00:02:24.400> around<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.720> middle<00:02:26.290> of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
when this happens around the middle of

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.830 
when this happens around the middle of
the<00:02:26.500> intake<00:02:26.799> it<00:02:26.980> bursts<00:02:27.670> into<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:28.000> fine<00:02:28.480> spray

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
the intake it bursts into a fine spray

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.289 
the intake it bursts into a fine spray
of<00:02:28.989> fuel<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.500> then<00:02:30.160> travels<00:02:30.700> through<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.090> 10

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
of fuel and then travels through the 10

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.280 
of fuel and then travels through the 10
holes<00:02:32.790> pass<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.030> valves<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.780> into<00:02:35.170> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
holes pass the valves and into the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.750 
holes pass the valves and into the
combustion<00:02:35.650> chamber<00:02:35.829> and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.380> burns<00:02:38.760> now

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
combustion chamber and then it burns now

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.580 
combustion chamber and then it burns now
I'm<00:02:39.819> just<00:02:40.000> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.239> unscrew<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.930> here<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
I'm just going to unscrew this here and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.059 
I'm just going to unscrew this here and
now<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:46.140> Dynojet<00:02:47.140> valve<00:02:47.530> has<00:02:47.819> screwed<00:02:48.819> place

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
now the Dynojet valve has screwed place

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.220 
now the Dynojet valve has screwed place
has<00:02:51.069> shredding<00:02:51.910> on<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.359> also<00:02:52.630> has<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.900> lock

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
has shredding on it and also has a lock

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.890 
has shredding on it and also has a lock
ring<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:54.209> threading<00:02:55.209> on<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.420> inside<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
ring and threading on the inside of the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.390 
ring and threading on the inside of the
combustion<00:02:56.380> chamber<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:58.920> when<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.010> screw<00:03:00.310> it

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
combustion chamber and when you screw it

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.949 
combustion chamber and when you screw it
in<00:03:00.459> place<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.940> have<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.120> tighten<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.900> down

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
in place you have to tighten it down

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.849 
in place you have to tighten it down
real<00:03:02.290> good<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:03.120> use<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.329> lock<00:03:04.480> ring<00:03:04.780> too<00:03:05.079> to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
real good and use the lock ring too to

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.349 
real good and use the lock ring too to
keep<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.160> from<00:03:06.310> unscrewing<00:03:06.819> from<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
keep it from unscrewing from the

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.550 
keep it from unscrewing from the
pressure<00:03:08.290> inside

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
pressure inside

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.280 
pressure inside
well<00:03:10.490> that<00:03:10.730> itself<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:12.490> has<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.810> valve<00:03:14.810> retainer

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
well that itself is has a valve retainer

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.949 
well that itself is has a valve retainer
plate<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.860> this<00:03:16.700> retainer<00:03:17.150> plate<00:03:17.270> just<00:03:17.690> keeps

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
plate and this retainer plate just keeps

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.050 
plate and this retainer plate just keeps
the<00:03:18.140> valves<00:03:18.470> from<00:03:18.530> opening<00:03:18.850> too<00:03:19.850> far<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:22.060> also

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
the valves from opening too far and also

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.270 
the valves from opening too far and also
protects<00:03:23.510> about<00:03:23.780> solder<00:03:24.230> from<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.620> heat<00:03:25.250> of

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
protects about solder from the heat of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.270 
protects about solder from the heat of
the<00:03:25.370> combustion<00:03:25.790> chamber

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
the combustion chamber

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.830 
the combustion chamber
this<00:03:28.280> also<00:03:28.489> unscrews<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.800> Demma

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
this also unscrews and Demma

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.870 
this also unscrews and Demma
you<00:03:32.840> can<00:03:33.050> take<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.620> off<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:34.010> replace<00:03:34.700> the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
you can take it off and replace the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:45.420 
you can take it off and replace the
valves<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:36.230> just<00:03:37.100> going<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.310> do<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.580> right

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.780 

the<00:03:46.430> valve<00:03:46.670> itself<00:03:46.850> is<00:03:47.300> just<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:48.489> very<00:03:49.489> thin

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
the valve itself is just a very thin

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.259 
the valve itself is just a very thin
piece<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.680> 6000<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.890> an<00:03:52.220> inch<00:03:52.400> thick<00:03:52.640> spring

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
piece of 6000 of an inch thick spring

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.199 
piece of 6000 of an inch thick spring
steel<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:54.190> it's<00:03:55.190> important<00:03:55.580> that<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:55.730> spring

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
steel and it's important that you spring

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.699 
steel and it's important that you spring
steel<00:03:56.480> because<00:03:56.930> it's<00:03:57.110> pretty<00:03:57.319> much<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.680> only

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
steel because it's pretty much the only

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.180 
steel because it's pretty much the only
metal<00:03:58.130> that<00:03:58.160> will<00:03:58.400> work<00:03:59.680> it's<00:04:00.680> got<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.860> spring

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
metal that will work it's got a spring

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.320 
metal that will work it's got a spring
temper<00:04:01.580> so<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:04.310> can<00:04:04.489> take<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.700> lot<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.910> beating

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
temper so it can take a lot of beating

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.430 
temper so it can take a lot of beating
and<00:04:06.550> lasts<00:04:07.550> a<00:04:08.000> lot<00:04:08.660> longer<00:04:08.720> than<00:04:09.080> any<00:04:09.410> other

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
and lasts a lot longer than any other

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.350 
and lasts a lot longer than any other
metal<00:04:09.970> here<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.090> can<00:04:11.239> see<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.620> valve<00:04:12.620> plate

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
metal here you can see the valve plate

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.469 
metal here you can see the valve plate
and<00:04:14.410> attend<00:04:15.410> holes<00:04:16.060> going<00:04:17.060> into<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:19.479> develop

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
and attend holes going into the develop

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.240 
and attend holes going into the develop
it

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.779 

now<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.310> fins<00:04:27.639> on<00:04:27.819> the<00:04:27.940> Dynojet<00:04:28.270> are

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
now the fins on the Dynojet are

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.809 
now the fins on the Dynojet are
basically<00:04:30.789> to<00:04:31.770> reduce<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.949> weight<00:04:33.129> you<00:04:33.699> have

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
basically to reduce the weight you have

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.860 
basically to reduce the weight you have
these<00:04:34.259> customs<00:04:35.259> of<00:04:35.409> the<00:04:35.530> intake<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.870> that

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
these customs of the intake and that

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.749 
these customs of the intake and that
reduces<00:04:38.169> weight<00:04:38.530> well<00:04:38.860> still<00:04:39.280> keeping<00:04:39.639> the

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
reduces weight well still keeping the

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.540 
reduces weight well still keeping the
same<00:04:40.030> aerodynamic<00:04:41.020> profile<00:04:41.470> as<00:04:42.129> air<00:04:42.370> will

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
same aerodynamic profile as air will

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.360 
same aerodynamic profile as air will
still<00:04:42.849> want<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.169> flow<00:04:44.169> over<00:04:44.349> it<00:04:44.650> pretty<00:04:45.159> much

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
still want to flow over it pretty much

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.550 
still want to flow over it pretty much
like<00:04:45.610> it's<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.940> solid<00:04:46.569> object<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:49.560> that

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
like it's a solid object and that

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.980 
like it's a solid object and that
reduces<00:04:50.949> the<00:04:51.009> weight<00:04:51.310> down<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.150> about<00:04:52.479> six

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
reduces the weight down to about six

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.379 
reduces the weight down to about six
thousand<00:04:53.319> psa's<00:04:56.310> no<00:04:57.310> tailpipe<00:04:57.849> itself<00:04:58.240> is

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
thousand psa's no tailpipe itself is

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.059 
thousand psa's no tailpipe itself is
made<00:04:58.599> from<00:04:58.840> two<00:04:59.440> pieces<00:04:59.650> of<00:05:00.810> formed<00:05:02.069> stainless

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
made from two pieces of formed stainless

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.600 
made from two pieces of formed stainless
steel<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:04.319> basically<00:05:05.319> the<00:05:05.590> foremen<00:05:06.159> impress

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
steel and basically the foremen impress

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.480 
steel and basically the foremen impress
and<00:05:06.819> weld<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.180> together<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.949> it's<00:05:08.949> important

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
and weld it together and it's important

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.020 
and weld it together and it's important
that<00:05:10.259> you<00:05:11.259> don't<00:05:11.379> run<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.740> engine<00:05:12.069> for<00:05:12.340> longer

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
that you don't run the engine for longer

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.649 
that you don't run the engine for longer
than<00:05:13.210> about<00:05:13.330> 30<00:05:13.780> seconds<00:05:14.289> statically<00:05:14.860> because

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
than about 30 seconds statically because

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.390 
than about 30 seconds statically because
you<00:05:16.659> have<00:05:16.810> these<00:05:17.020> weld<00:05:17.590> seams<00:05:17.949> going<00:05:18.250> down

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
you have these weld seams going down

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.360 
you have these weld seams going down
both<00:05:18.639> sides<00:05:18.969> of<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.360> engine<00:05:19.509> and<00:05:20.069> if<00:05:21.069> you<00:05:21.219> get

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
both sides of the engine and if you get

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.559 
both sides of the engine and if you get
the<00:05:21.460> engine<00:05:21.580> too<00:05:21.879> hot<00:05:22.060> that<00:05:22.090> can<00:05:22.389> actually

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
the engine too hot that can actually

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.019 
the engine too hot that can actually
split<00:05:23.259> apart<00:05:25.440> once<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.680> engine<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.639> moving

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
split apart once the engine is moving

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:29.700 
split apart once the engine is moving
through<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.300> air<00:05:28.419> like<00:05:28.659> on<00:05:28.810> a<00:05:28.840> remote-control

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
through the air like on a remote-control

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.850 
through the air like on a remote-control
plainer<00:05:30.180> vehicle<00:05:31.289> it<00:05:32.289> will<00:05:32.409> get<00:05:32.529> a<00:05:32.560> lot<00:05:32.770> of

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
plainer vehicle it will get a lot of

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.939 
plainer vehicle it will get a lot of
cooling<00:05:33.069> air<00:05:33.900> also<00:05:34.900> if<00:05:35.289> you're<00:05:35.440> running<00:05:35.710> an

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
cooling air also if you're running an

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.370 
cooling air also if you're running an
engine<00:05:36.130> statically<00:05:36.789> like<00:05:37.029> this<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:38.199> should

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
engine statically like this you should

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.159 
engine statically like this you should
run<00:05:38.590> it<00:05:38.740> on<00:05:38.860> methanol<00:05:39.759> because<00:05:39.990> methanol<00:05:40.990> is

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
run it on methanol because methanol is

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.219 
run it on methanol because methanol is
burns<00:05:44.169> at<00:05:44.919> a<00:05:44.979> lower<00:05:45.219> temperature<00:05:45.490> than

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
burns at a lower temperature than

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.219 
burns at a lower temperature than
gasoline<00:05:47.229> and<00:05:47.740> other<00:05:48.180> oil-based<00:05:49.180> fuels<00:05:49.449> but

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
gasoline and other oil-based fuels but

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.550 
gasoline and other oil-based fuels but
it<00:05:50.380> also<00:05:51.569> actually<00:05:52.569> cools<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.080> air<00:05:53.849> when<00:05:54.849> it

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
it also actually cools the air when it

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.950 
it also actually cools the air when it
vaporizes<00:05:56.699> so<00:05:57.699> you<00:05:58.150> can<00:05:58.300> actually<00:05:58.629> get<00:05:58.750> the

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
vaporizes so you can actually get the

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.159 
vaporizes so you can actually get the
valve<00:05:59.620> head<00:05:59.830> to<00:06:00.009> form<00:06:00.279> ice<00:06:00.490> on<00:06:00.759> it<00:06:01.050> when<00:06:02.050> you're

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
valve head to form ice on it when you're

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.519 
valve head to form ice on it when you're
running<00:06:02.349> methanol<00:06:03.719> when<00:06:04.719> you<00:06:04.779> run<00:06:04.960> gasoline

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
running methanol when you run gasoline

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.260 
running methanol when you run gasoline
the<00:06:05.680> valve<00:06:05.860> head<00:06:06.039> can<00:06:06.250> actually<00:06:06.610> get<00:06:06.729> so<00:06:07.090> hot

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
the valve head can actually get so hot

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.110 
the valve head can actually get so hot
that<00:06:07.300> you<00:06:08.250> burn<00:06:09.250> your<00:06:09.370> fingerprints<00:06:09.969> right

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
that you burn your fingerprints right

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.230 
that you burn your fingerprints right
off<00:06:10.300> if<00:06:10.479> you<00:06:10.569> try<00:06:10.779> to<00:06:10.840> touch<00:06:11.050> it

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
off if you try to touch it

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.809 
off if you try to touch it
okay<00:06:13.240> so<00:06:13.300> right<00:06:13.599> now<00:06:13.750> I'm<00:06:13.870> just<00:06:13.990> going<00:06:14.169> to<00:06:14.819> go

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
okay so right now I'm just going to go

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.450 
okay so right now I'm just going to go
in<00:06:16.029> to<00:06:16.529> get<00:06:17.529> an<00:06:17.620> Allen<00:06:17.919> wrench

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
in to get an Allen wrench

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.490 
in to get an Allen wrench
okay<00:06:19.210> so<00:06:19.690> have<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:20.080> valve<00:06:22.169> onto<00:06:23.169> the<00:06:23.319> valve

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
okay so have the valve onto the valve

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.820 
okay so have the valve onto the valve
plate<00:06:23.969> the<00:06:24.969> retainer<00:06:25.330> tightened<00:06:25.810> down<00:06:25.870> and

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
plate the retainer tightened down and

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.619 
plate the retainer tightened down and
it's<00:06:27.520> important<00:06:27.909> that<00:06:28.029> you<00:06:28.090> don't<00:06:28.240> over

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:28.629 
it's important that you don't over

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.450 
it's important that you don't over
tighten<00:06:28.779> the<00:06:29.020> retainer

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
tighten the retainer

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.880 
tighten the retainer
you<00:06:31.150> want<00:06:31.330> it<00:06:31.390> to<00:06:31.480> be<00:06:32.340> in<00:06:33.340> tight<00:06:33.640> but<00:06:34.000> not<00:06:34.930> so

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
you want it to be in tight but not so

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.870 
you want it to be in tight but not so
tight<00:06:36.130> that<00:06:36.540> it<00:06:37.540> starts<00:06:38.530> to<00:06:38.760> strip<00:06:39.760> the

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
tight that it starts to strip the

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.010 
tight that it starts to strip the
threading<00:06:40.300> of<00:06:40.420> course<00:06:42.060> okay<00:06:43.090> abandon<00:06:43.960> all

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
threading of course okay abandon all

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.940 
threading of course okay abandon all
back<00:06:44.230> together

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
back together

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.050 
back together
spark<00:06:45.850> plug<00:06:46.060> wires<00:06:46.270> connected<00:06:47.730> one<00:06:48.730> way<00:06:48.760> that

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
spark plug wires connected one way that

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.850 
spark plug wires connected one way that
you<00:06:49.150> can<00:06:49.270> test<00:06:49.510> to<00:06:49.840> make<00:06:50.260> sure<00:06:50.320> you<00:06:50.530> have<00:06:50.740> the

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
you can test to make sure you have the

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.360 
you can test to make sure you have the
valves<00:06:51.570> tighten<00:06:52.570> down<00:06:52.600> properly<00:06:53.230> it<00:06:53.770> is<00:06:53.920> if

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
valves tighten down properly it is if

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.330 
valves tighten down properly it is if
you<00:06:54.490> blow<00:06:54.730> in<00:06:54.880> the<00:06:55.000> end<00:06:55.150> of<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:55.360> tailpipe<00:06:56.340> the

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
you blow in the end of the tailpipe the

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.400 
you blow in the end of the tailpipe the
valves<00:06:57.730> should<00:06:58.000> make<00:06:58.210> like<00:06:58.420> a<00:06:58.450> squeaking

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
valves should make like a squeaking

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.150 
valves should make like a squeaking
buzzing<00:06:59.680> noise<00:07:01.080> if<00:07:02.080> you<00:07:02.200> have<00:07:02.290> it<00:07:02.470> too<00:07:02.890> tight

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
buzzing noise if you have it too tight

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.750 
buzzing noise if you have it too tight
or<00:07:03.310> too<00:07:03.340> loose

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
or too loose

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.980 
or too loose
they<00:07:04.060> won't<00:07:04.920> do<00:07:05.920> this<00:07:06.130> so<00:07:06.700> that's<00:07:07.510> one<00:07:07.810> way

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
they won't do this so that's one way

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.220 
they won't do this so that's one way
that<00:07:08.140> you<00:07:08.230> can<00:07:08.350> tell<00:07:09.330> okay<00:07:10.330> so<00:07:10.690> I<00:07:10.750> decided<00:07:11.140> to

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230 
that you can tell okay so I decided to

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.870 
that you can tell okay so I decided to
run<00:07:11.410> around<00:07:11.680> some<00:07:11.830> gasoline<00:07:12.220> because<00:07:12.640> it's

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
run around some gasoline because it's

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.390 
run around some gasoline because it's
too<00:07:13.060> humid<00:07:13.420> out<00:07:13.630> and<00:07:14.010> methanol<00:07:15.010> isn't

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
too humid out and methanol isn't

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.170 
too humid out and methanol isn't
igniting<00:07:15.820> properly<00:07:17.580> I'm<00:07:18.580> going<00:07:18.820> to<00:07:18.940> do<00:07:19.030> is

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
igniting properly I'm going to do is

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.980 
igniting properly I'm going to do is
just<00:07:19.690> to<00:07:19.900> start<00:07:20.470> it<00:07:20.560> up<00:07:20.710> now<00:07:20.910> and<00:07:21.910> run<00:07:22.660> it<00:07:22.780> for<00:07:22.960> a

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
just to start it up now and run it for a

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.560 
just to start it up now and run it for a
few<00:07:23.140> seconds
