 hi guys and girls from youtube and less 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.610

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.190
 I'm hello everyone 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.260

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.330
 draw and you'll say unter here in a 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.340
 lottery without having to draw lots 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.170
 yes, the truth is that it was already time 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.349
 time to celebrate with all of you that 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.689
 we passed the whopping figure of the 100,000 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.970
 subscribers you remember I have a 4 here 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.740
 hung that in short and well let's 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.410
 leave it and well it really is not for the 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.660
 100,000 is for those 130 and a thousand thousand that 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.060
 we are already in the channel and thank you 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.680
 then to all of you really the other 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.840
 day I went shopping and I bought myself a 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.480
 little detail for me he gave us I'm like that 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.110
 of cool then good says here 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.630
 for home 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.360
 Niger 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.890
 I'm not able to manage it, because 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.870
 I feel like avoiding it with all of you 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 listen is a lot of catch is normal 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.590
 it and I also have here having 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.440
 defeated that is putting me very 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.770
 nervous the little bank then good of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.290
 for everyone who follows the channel and 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.340
 follow me on twitter you'll already be 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.030
 really that I was going to carry this out 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.800
 a couple of weeks ago if you remember 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.560
 remove everything that were the series of 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.229
 survival of channel mods because I wanted 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.150
 set the channel and set schedules create 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.880
 a channel a little more stable where 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.140
 well, everything was much more fluid and the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.150
 truth is that you have thanked me for a 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.170
 I also see a lot more and more 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.900
 committed to people much more 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.369
 committed to you with the channel and 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.850
 especially with twitter every time 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.259
 twitter we have much more volume of 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.360
 interactions and well it's out there 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.670
 where I'm going to make the draw 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.140
 really the bases you are going to have in 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.850
 the description of the video but 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.070
 basically you just have to do two 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.020
 things one is 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.640
 on the twitter page you give a follow 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.890
 you follow me and that's it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.170
 and the other one is to comment with the hashtag that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.390
 I put you up here is worth commenting for 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.800
 what do you want the gift and good of what 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.530
 what is this gift about? 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.660
 Well , it's a network guide 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.149
 I loved this, you write the 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.780
 I bought and I loved the truth is that it is 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.280
 a detail superchulo that you are going to be able 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.260
 find in any bookstore the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.300
 truth is that I have seen him in a lot 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.160
 of sites and has called me a lot the 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.650
 attention because there are things from the most 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.310
 basic to things a little complicated 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.140
 it is more I have stayed as saying and the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.459
 truth is that there are very, very things that 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.230
 cool the truth and well I want I want 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.209
 I want to give it to you 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.750
 through this guide the truth is that it is 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.030
 a significant price what it costs 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.980
 later, I guess we have to draw in 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.590
 things that cost more, but 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.019
 it really is a way that like you 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.480
 you know preston's guides to me or the 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.160
 pressure in particular I love not for 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.930
 all the tutorials and all those things 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.940
 and upload a mouse guide 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.630
 we could have 'no 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.790
 and good wit then I've been 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.740
 investigating a little bit because the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.040
 doing the lottery was going to limit me to 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.630
 do it with people from Spain and did not want to 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.430
 logically that I want to do it for everything 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.530
 the world is something quite logical not 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.750
 I want to send it to anyone 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.910
 who wants to participate in the draw but 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.340
 shipments are very very expensive from 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.770
 Spain and I was going to be very difficult 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.940
 that we can send this guide or these 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.890
 gifts that from now on there will be 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.110
 these raffles to any part of the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.090
 world then good here at the bases 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.270
 of the raffle you are going to have all the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.250
 information but basically I summarize 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.650
 how will it really be for the people of 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.300
 I 'm going to send you this guide here 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.940
 is that I have right now in my hand 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.640
 and logically, I will sign it to you 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.430
 I will dedicate to that person who are worth 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.170
 I will dedicate vale and I will write you some 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.960
 cosilla more than but I'm going to leave that 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.080
 between secret of mine and the other person 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.080
 the one that wins the 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.300
 there are really a couple of little things that I'm going 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.520
 to write down inside that I guess you'll look 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.220
 and it is basically good because it does not 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.110
 so good really for the other 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.150
 part of the puddle like I'm going to do 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.160
 be it for right or left you are of 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.380
 where you are good then really what 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.690
 I will send a guide by mail 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.459
 but buying the one page for the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.560
 team or amazon or type of whatever 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.150
 ok then I buy it and buy it 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.460
 I sold you at the door of our house 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.110
 to the tax is you receive it logically 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.030
 you will say jaber a record i wanted that 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.890
 personalization that dedication of yours 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.720
 well, no problem, I can send it to you 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.180
 by email but I'm a word uncle 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.340
 and I will send it certified but 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.290
 an ordinary mail letter that 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.390
 it costs a couple of glitters 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.940
 send it to us and not to the barbarities that 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.310
 they ask me to send this little book 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.720
 ok that's how he pours his price is that 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.610
 I do not understand yet I do not fit in the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.470
 head how can it be so expensive to send 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.880
 things from Spain but that he 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.860
 ask other youtubers I asked 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.440
 a lot of people and the truth is that all the 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.270
 the world tells me to buy it and send it to 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.969
 your house because that's why there are services 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.649
 what 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.319
 due to the number of shipments they make 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:03.719
 well they advance not to say good so what 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.159
 we will do so then to the whole world the 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.929
 draw is for everyone and I want 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.669
 leave it pretty clear then good 

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:10.619
 we really go back to the same thing 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.389
 follow me on twitter comment with 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:14.759
 hashtag and tell them a hashtag thing 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.739
 as much as you comment and more times 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.019
 repeated that you put the comment not 

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:21.089
 is going to count is not going to count with a 

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:23.489
 Comment enough can you fill me out twitter 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:26.610
 if you want with that with that hashtag but 

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:28.379
 you really count one if you want 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.469
 logically write comments 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.749
 coherent that make sense and put 23 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:36.149
 comments I do it before the draw 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:38.099
 I will choose the comment that I like the most 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.569
 it's worth so that then you can re-draw lots 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.519
 see what was the comment that more 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.469
 I liked it and with which you have 

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:45.329
 participated but tell you that simply 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.009
 putting a point is not going to serve 

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:49.019
 logically there has to be a 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.599
 coherence in the comment and in that 

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:52.919
 hashtag word write it well worth 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.169
 write it well because if not 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.909
 you will enter the draw then publish in 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.689
 the photos of the draw that is a video 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.339
 where it has gone 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.379
 the winner of the contest but good 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:05.649
 I probably found some pictures and 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:08.110
 is and well to thank you back 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:10.360
 thank everyone that you continue here in 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.919
 the channel who you give your support that the 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.569
 truth is that it is very significant for 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.279
 me and the truth is that it helps everyone 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.689
