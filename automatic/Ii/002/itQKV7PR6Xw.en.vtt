00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
well it's time for painting the hall of

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.010 
well it's time for painting the hall of
the<00:00:14.880> Flying<00:00:15.179> Cloud<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> basic<00:00:18.690> color<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the Flying Cloud the basic color is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.050 
the Flying Cloud the basic color is
gonna<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.320> flat<00:00:19.590> black<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.430> I'll<00:00:20.550> explain<00:00:20.939> in

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
gonna be flat black and I'll explain in

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.210 
gonna be flat black and I'll explain in
a<00:00:21.119> minute<00:00:21.240> how<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> come<00:00:21.900> across<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.500> really

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
a minute how I come across a really

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670 
a minute how I come across a really
excellent<00:00:23.750> quality<00:00:24.750> flat<00:00:25.019> black<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.590> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
excellent quality flat black for you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220 
excellent quality flat black for you
some<00:00:25.949> models<00:00:26.670> such<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.240> let's<00:00:28.080> take<00:00:28.199> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
some models such as this let's take a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.950 
some models such as this let's take a
quick<00:00:28.500> look<00:00:28.680> around<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.039> ship<00:00:29.250> before<00:00:29.460> I

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
quick look around the ship before I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.340 
quick look around the ship before I
obscure<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.289> woodwork<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.800> painting<00:00:32.250> I

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
obscure all the woodwork my painting I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
obscure all the woodwork my painting I
thought<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.469> might<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.710> interesting<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
thought this might be interesting to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.130 
thought this might be interesting to
take<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.730> glass<00:00:36.059> look<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> woodwork

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
take one glass look at all the woodwork

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.650 
take one glass look at all the woodwork
on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> Flying<00:00:37.649> Cloud<00:00:37.969> before<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.120> obscured

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
on the Flying Cloud before it's obscured

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.080 
on the Flying Cloud before it's obscured
by<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.840> hull<00:00:40.260> paint<00:00:40.559> there's<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.790> black

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
by the hull paint there's gonna be black

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.139 
by the hull paint there's gonna be black
colored<00:00:42.540> hull<00:00:42.750> paint<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.730> then<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> copper

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
colored hull paint and then the copper

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.369 
colored hull paint and then the copper
plates<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.600> lower<00:00:45.780> part<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> hull

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
plates in the lower part of the hull

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.380 
plates in the lower part of the hull
both<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.640> obscure<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
both of which will obscure all of the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.630 
both of which will obscure all of the
wood<00:00:48.570> work<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:48.989> been<00:00:49.140> done<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.520> gonna

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
wood work that's been done so I'm gonna

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.130 
wood work that's been done so I'm gonna
put<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.149> close<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.809> let's<00:00:51.930> take<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
put this on close up and let's take a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
put this on close up and let's take a
close<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> look<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.039> some<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> various

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
close and look at some of the various

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.850 
close and look at some of the various
different<00:00:54.629> kinds<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.960> wood<00:00:55.170> strakes<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> are

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
different kinds of wood strakes that are

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
different kinds of wood strakes that are
used<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.730> complete<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> hull<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> Flying

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
used to complete the hull of the Flying

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.130 
used to complete the hull of the Flying
Cloud<00:01:01.699> now<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.969> close-up<00:01:03.420> mode<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.930> see

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
Cloud now in close-up mode we can see

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.590 
Cloud now in close-up mode we can see
not<00:01:04.799> only<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.159> regular<00:01:05.430> wood<00:01:05.850> planks<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.450> is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
not only the regular wood planks this is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
not only the regular wood planks this is
a<00:01:06.630> outer<00:01:06.990> layer<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.380> second<00:01:07.860> layer<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.189> wood

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
a outer layer the second layer of wood

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.960 
a outer layer the second layer of wood
planking<00:01:08.760> that's<00:01:09.630> been<00:01:09.869> incomplete<00:01:10.640> but<00:01:11.640> also

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
planking that's been incomplete but also

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.330 
planking that's been incomplete but also
there<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> few<00:01:12.560> almost<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.979> third

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
there are a few almost it's like a third

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
there are a few almost it's like a third
layer<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.640> planking<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.750> put<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.229> some

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
layer of planking that's put on in some

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.679 
layer of planking that's put on in some
places<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.610> case<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.210> reinforce

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
places in this case it's to reinforce

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.230 
places in this case it's to reinforce
the<00:01:18.840> chain<00:01:19.080> plates<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> be

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
the chain plates that are going to be

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.730 
the chain plates that are going to be
nailed<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> hull<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.380> there's<00:01:22.560> these

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
nailed to the hull so there's these

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
nailed to the hull so there's these
three<00:01:23.100> extra<00:01:23.430> strips<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.630> three

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
three extra strips right here three

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990 
three extra strips right here three
extra<00:01:25.170> strakes<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.799> wood<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:26.759> there's<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
extra strakes of wood and then there's a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
extra strakes of wood and then there's a
larger<00:01:27.360> there's<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.780> larger<00:01:28.140> ones<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.439> are

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
larger there's two larger ones that are

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.660 
larger there's two larger ones that are
bumpers<00:01:30.470> actually<00:01:31.470> support<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> side<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
bumpers actually support the side of the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.330 
bumpers actually support the side of the
hull<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.590> anything<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:34.680> nailed<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
hull and anything that's nailed to it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.649 
hull and anything that's nailed to it
such<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> chain<00:01:36.299> plates<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:39.450> can

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
such as the chain plates so we can

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.240 
such as the chain plates so we can
clearly<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.229> those<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.650> place<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.070> well

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
clearly see those in place as well

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.410 
clearly see those in place as well
here's<00:01:44.250> where<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> bowsprit<00:01:44.939> will<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.149> coming

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
here's where the bowsprit will be coming

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
here's where the bowsprit will be coming
out<00:01:47.689> see<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> hawser<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.439> hawser<00:01:49.619> folds

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
out see the hawser is the hawser folds

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.670 
out see the hawser is the hawser folds
for<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> anchor<00:01:50.640> chain<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.350> also<00:01:55.500> see

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
for the anchor chain and we can also see

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.889 
for the anchor chain and we can also see
the<00:01:55.799> channels<00:01:56.250> are<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.490> place<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> chain

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the channels are in place for the chain

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.620 
the channels are in place for the chain
plates<00:01:58.170> very<00:02:01.670> important<00:02:02.670> though<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
plates very important though is not to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.999 
plates very important though is not to
paint<00:02:03.810> too<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.590> don't<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
paint too much because I don't want to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.499 
paint too much because I don't want to
obscure<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> wood<00:02:05.939> grain<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
obscure all of the wood grain and the

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.850 
obscure all of the wood grain and the
spaces<00:02:09.509> between<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.020> wood<00:02:10.200> planks<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.739> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
spaces between the wood planks as you

years<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.370> refine<00:03:11.879> the<00:03:12.510> perfect<00:03:13.080> flat<00:03:13.319> black

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650

paint<00:03:13.920> for<00:03:14.190> ship<00:03:14.400> models<00:03:14.760> but<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.209> think<00:03:15.450> I

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
paint for ship models but I think I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.720 
paint for ship models but I think I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
finally found the formula here's what I

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.259 
finally found the formula here's what I
do<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.090> I've<00:03:18.209> got<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.650> pint<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.849> latex<00:03:20.849> flat

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
black and then to that I added simple

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.180 
black and then to that I added simple
chalk<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.659> actually<00:03:24.959> took<00:03:25.319> some<00:03:25.379> white<00:03:25.799> chalk
