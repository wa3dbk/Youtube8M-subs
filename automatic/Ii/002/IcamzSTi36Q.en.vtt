00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
out this will look like flip it over and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.150 
out this will look like flip it over and
there's<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> tip<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.829> push

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
there's like the tip of it if you push

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.119 
there's like the tip of it if you push
it<00:00:50.539> this<00:00:51.539> way<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.110> pull<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:55.980> way

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it this way you can pull it all the way

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.709 
it this way you can pull it all the way
out<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> comes<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:02.039> well<00:01:02.789> at

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
out and then it comes up really well at

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
out and then it comes up really well at
the<00:01:03.899> end<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> tutorial<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:05.430> part<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the end of the tutorial this part is the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
the end of the tutorial this part is the
part<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.049> cut<00:01:07.290> into<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> blade

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
part that you will cut into the blade

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.880 
part that you will cut into the blade
you<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.939> somehow<00:01:09.840> flatten<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> then

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
you will somehow flatten it out and then

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.000 
you will somehow flatten it out and then
you'll<00:01:10.979> cut<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.270> whole<00:01:12.630> thing<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.290> into

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you'll cut this whole thing or here into

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
you'll cut this whole thing or here into
a<00:01:14.040> point<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.549> use<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> blade<00:01:15.180> well<00:01:15.810> my<00:01:16.200> idea

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
a point to use as the blade well my idea

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
a point to use as the blade well my idea
is<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.270> make<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.659> happen<00:01:18.799> by<00:01:20.180> then<00:01:21.180> make

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
is is to make that happen by then make

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.210 
is is to make that happen by then make
this<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.689> sanskrit<00:01:22.110> thing<00:01:22.350> by<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.799> making

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
this a sanskrit thing by just making

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.429 
this a sanskrit thing by just making
some<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.880> mechanism<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.659> where<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.290> can

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
some kind of mechanism to where you can

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.749 
some kind of mechanism to where you can
pull<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.799> without<00:01:26.100> having<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> put<00:01:26.670> your

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pull this without having to put your

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.789 
pull this without having to put your
hand<00:01:26.970> all<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> way<00:01:27.299> over<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.930> push

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
hand all the way over there and push

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980 
hand all the way over there and push
that<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.159> thing<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.570> push

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that little thing or you can just push

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.899 
that little thing or you can just push
that<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.369> it'll<00:01:32.610> also

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
that the way it is and then it'll also

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.700 
that the way it is and then it'll also
go<00:01:33.299> straight<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.140> you've<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> push

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
go straight back in you've got to push

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.249 
go straight back in you've got to push
it<00:01:34.860> back<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.320> it'll<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:37.650> back<00:01:40.430> then

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
it back in and it'll go right back then

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.249 
it back in and it'll go right back then
it<00:01:43.259> stays<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.299> also<00:01:45.299> another<00:01:45.540> idea<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> do

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
it stays in and also another idea to do

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.109 
it stays in and also another idea to do
for<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:46.860> also<00:01:47.159> make<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.640> hooked

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
for it you can also make it all hooked

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
for it you can also make it all hooked
blade<00:01:48.299> easy<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.770> just

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
blade easy all you got to do is just

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.240 
blade easy all you got to do is just
leave<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.450> tip<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.740> there's<00:01:53.130> a
