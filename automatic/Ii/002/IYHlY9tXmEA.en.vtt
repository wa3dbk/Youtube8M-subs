00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
show a shoot to pose so beginning of the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.520 
show a shoot to pose so beginning of the
process<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> end<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.940> process<00:00:33.530> well

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
process to the end of the process well

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.590 
process to the end of the process well
that<00:00:34.829> takes<00:00:35.040> an<00:00:35.300> extraordinary<00:00:36.300> amount<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that takes an extraordinary amount of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180 
that takes an extraordinary amount of
time<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.410> sort<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.710> thing<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.160> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
time to do that sort of thing so I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.130 
time to do that sort of thing so I
thought<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:38.760> I'll<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.600> instead<00:00:39.989> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
thought what I'll do is instead of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290 
thought what I'll do is instead of
showing<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.250> video<00:00:41.520> camera<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.969> me<00:00:42.090> standing

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
showing a video camera of me standing

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
showing a video camera of me standing
there<00:00:42.600> leveling<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> tripod<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.460> ball

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
there leveling out a tripod and ball

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580 
there leveling out a tripod and ball
head<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.239> all<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.480> nice<00:00:45.719> stuff<00:00:45.750> I'll<00:00:46.469> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
head and all that nice stuff I'll just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
head and all that nice stuff I'll just
show<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> shot<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:48.390> know<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.570> I'll

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719

take<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> from<00:00:49.079> here

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
take it from here

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.029 
take it from here
so<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> normally<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.989> I'll<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
so what I normally do is I'll do the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
so what I normally do is I'll do the
exposure<00:00:53.399> fusion<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:55.050> depending

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
exposure fusion and it depending

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.869 
exposure fusion and it depending
exposure<00:00:56.340> fusion<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:57.140> super<00:00:58.140> light<00:00:58.620> HDR<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.850> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
exposure fusion or super light HDR not a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.170 
exposure fusion or super light HDR not a
surreal<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:01.850> basically<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.969> merge

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
surreal kind of look basically to merge

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.679 
surreal kind of look basically to merge
those<00:01:03.420> exposures<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.680> I'll<00:01:05.119> do<00:01:06.119> PT<00:01:06.479> lens

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
those exposures and then I'll do PT lens

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.719 
those exposures and then I'll do PT lens
edit<00:01:07.049> PT<00:01:07.439> lens<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:07.890> takes<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.430> removes

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
edit PT lens which takes and removes

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
edit PT lens which takes and removes
that<00:01:08.909> distortion<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.080> then

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that distortion that I have and then

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.590 
that distortion that I have and then
I'll<00:01:10.590> edit<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.790> case<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.299> not

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I'll edit it and for this case I'm not

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740 
I'll edit it and for this case I'm not
gonna<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> PT<00:01:13.350> lens<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.970> reason<00:01:15.570> why

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
gonna do the PT lens and the reason why

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.200 
gonna do the PT lens and the reason why
is<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:17.040> will<00:01:17.369> you'll<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.970> type<00:01:18.180> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
is you will you'll see the type of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
is you will you'll see the type of
distortion<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.470> gonna<00:01:19.680> be

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
distortion I have here is not gonna be

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.490 
distortion I have here is not gonna be
removed<00:01:20.220> very<00:01:20.369> easily<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.600> yes<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.170> shooting

removed very easily and yes I'm shooting
with<00:01:22.619> an<00:01:22.710> inferior<00:01:23.130> lens<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> I've<00:01:23.700> talked

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.340 
with an inferior lens and I've talked
about<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.240> before<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.689> making<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.170> switch

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
about that before but making the switch

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.999

and<00:02:06.509> by<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.079> remember<00:02:07.740> how<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> said<00:02:08.129> I'm

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and by the way remember how I said I'm

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.109 
and by the way remember how I said I'm
not<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> show<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> how<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
not going to show you how to do the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.119 
not going to show you how to do the
distortion<00:02:09.629> thing<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:10.470> I'm<00:02:10.649> not<00:02:11.009> gonna

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
distortion thing but now I'm not gonna

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.900 
distortion thing but now I'm not gonna
walk<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.459> through<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
walk you through it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.360 
walk you through it
look<00:02:12.390> over<00:02:12.510> here

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
look over here

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.270 
look over here
if<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.209> bowing<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:15.560> these<00:02:15.709> cabinets

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
if you see this bowing in these cabinets

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.890 
if you see this bowing in these cabinets
and<00:02:16.520> it's<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.700> little<00:02:17.120> bit<00:02:17.270> on<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.450> right<00:02:17.630> side

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
and it's a little bit on the right side

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.050 
and it's a little bit on the right side
-<00:02:18.140> that's<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.099> reason<00:02:19.280> why<00:02:19.580> that's<00:02:19.819> gonna

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
- that's the reason why that's gonna

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.420 
- that's the reason why that's gonna
take<00:02:20.300> me<00:02:20.330> some<00:02:20.630> time<00:02:20.660> in<00:02:21.140> Photoshop<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.130> warp

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
take me some time in Photoshop to warp

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.910 
take me some time in Photoshop to warp
that<00:02:22.730> out<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.270> should<00:02:23.360> say<00:02:23.599> -<00:02:23.660> unwarped<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.620> out

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
that out I should say - unwarped it out

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.740 
that out I should say - unwarped it out
and<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.099> just<00:02:25.220> takes<00:02:25.400> time<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:26.390> I'm<00:02:26.720> not

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
and it just takes time and then I'm not

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.240 
and it just takes time and then I'm not
going<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.080> waste<00:02:27.200> anybody's<00:02:27.500> time<00:02:27.650> doing<00:02:28.010> them

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
going to waste anybody's time doing them

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.110 
going to waste anybody's time doing them
so<00:02:29.200> anyway<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.069> here's<00:02:31.250> what<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.489> would<00:02:31.610> do<00:02:31.940> and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
exposure fusion is a great place to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.850 
exposure fusion is a great place to
start<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.690> not<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> great<00:02:39.110> place<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.410> finish

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.590 
but here we go
let's<00:03:41.989> go<00:03:42.170> ahead<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.650> we're<00:03:43.190> going<00:03:43.400> to

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
let's go ahead and we're going to

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.229 
let's go ahead and we're going to
intensify<00:03:44.600> contrast<00:03:45.440> which<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.739> overlay

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
intensify contrast which is overlay

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.309 
intensify contrast which is overlay
we're<00:03:47.239> going<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.450> decrease<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.870> size<00:03:48.109> of<00:03:48.170> this

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
we're going to decrease the size of this

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.340 
we're going to decrease the size of this
brush<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.680> little<00:03:48.769> bit<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.840> detect<00:03:50.840> edges<00:03:51.049> is

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
brush a little bit and detect edges is

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.890 
brush a little bit and detect edges is
on<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.880> let's<00:03:52.880> turn<00:03:53.030> that<00:03:53.120> off<00:03:53.299> for<00:03:53.329> a<00:03:53.569> second

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
on and let's turn that off for a second

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.400 
on and let's turn that off for a second
and<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.769> will<00:03:54.829> go<00:03:55.060> very<00:03:56.060> quickly<00:03:56.359> by<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.139> way<00:03:57.380> I

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
and I will go very quickly by the way I

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.129 
and I will go very quickly by the way I
will<00:03:58.069> make<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:58.880> quick<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.660> it'll<00:03:59.959> be<00:04:00.109> a

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
will make this quick and and it'll be a

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.590 
will make this quick and and it'll be a
little<00:04:00.410> rough<00:04:00.620> but<00:04:00.889> that'll<00:04:01.250> be<00:04:01.370> alright<00:04:01.600> so

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
little rough but that'll be alright so

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.080 
little rough but that'll be alright so
I'm<00:04:03.410> just<00:04:03.650> intensifying<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.340> contrast<00:04:04.850> and

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
I'm just intensifying the contrast and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.590 
I'm just intensifying the contrast and
doing<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:06.049> little<00:04:06.230> bit<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.880> hardwood

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
doing a little bit to the hardwood

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.479 
doing a little bit to the hardwood
because<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.170> needs<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.650> be<00:04:09.829> it<00:04:10.100> needs<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.400> be<00:04:10.459> a

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
because it needs to be it needs to be a

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.250 
because it needs to be it needs to be a
little<00:04:10.670> bit<00:04:10.819> darker<00:04:11.209> but<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.870> don't<00:04:12.079> want<00:04:12.200> to

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
little bit darker but I don't want to

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.900 
little bit darker but I don't want to
make<00:04:12.350> everything<00:04:12.620> darker<00:04:13.100> since<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:13.549> this

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
make everything darker since this this

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.870 
make everything darker since this this
room<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.739> white<00:04:15.739> it's<00:04:16.100> very<00:04:16.280> high<00:04:16.400> key<00:04:16.609> so

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
room is white it's very high key so

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.659 
room is white it's very high key so
we're<00:04:17.720> gonna<00:04:17.810> take<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.470> intensity<00:04:18.919> down<00:04:19.160> see

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
we're gonna take the intensity down see

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.820 
we're gonna take the intensity down see
well<00:04:19.880> there's<00:04:20.150> nothing<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.830> there's

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
well there's nothing and there's

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.580 
well there's nothing and there's
something<00:04:22.640> that's<00:04:22.789> a<00:04:22.849> little<00:04:23.060> too<00:04:23.210> much

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
something that's a little too much

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.960 
something that's a little too much
obviously<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:24.680> should<00:04:24.979> have<00:04:25.130> detect<00:04:25.490> edges<00:04:25.669> on

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
obviously I should have detect edges on

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.160 
obviously I should have detect edges on
to<00:04:26.390> get<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.960> know

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
to get to know

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.500 
to get to know
let<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.440> spill<00:04:27.650> over<00:04:27.680> but<00:04:28.160> we're<00:04:28.700> just<00:04:28.730> gonna

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
let it spill over but we're just gonna

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.270 
let it spill over but we're just gonna
oops<00:04:29.900> we're<00:04:30.440> gonna<00:04:30.560> ignore<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:30.920> for<00:04:31.190> right

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
oops we're gonna ignore that for right

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.280 
oops we're gonna ignore that for right
now<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:32.240> other<00:04:32.390> thing<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.630> want<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.930> do<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.200> I

now the other thing I want to do is I
want<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.500> polarize<00:04:33.920> I<00:04:34.070> want<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:34.340> multiply<00:04:34.480> for

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
want to polarize I want to multiply for

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.160 
want to polarize I want to multiply for
this<00:04:35.600> I<00:04:35.750> cannot<00:04:36.230> use<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.650> tech<00:04:36.830> Tejas<00:04:37.280> as

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
this I cannot use the tech Tejas as

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.560 
this I cannot use the tech Tejas as
there<00:04:39.170> are<00:04:39.380> it's<00:04:39.680> gonna<00:04:40.060> accidentally<00:04:41.060> detect

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
there are it's gonna accidentally detect

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.020 
there are it's gonna accidentally detect
too<00:04:41.870> many<00:04:42.050> edges<00:04:42.410> in<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.830> granite<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.730> I'm

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
too many edges in the granite so I'm

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.390 
too many edges in the granite so I'm
gonna<00:04:45.940> darken<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.450> countertops<00:04:48.020> but<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:49.160> and

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
gonna darken the countertops but and and

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.300 
gonna darken the countertops but and and
once<00:04:49.910> again<00:04:50.080> just<00:04:51.080> like<00:04:51.260> in<00:04:51.440> Lightroom<00:04:51.830> don't

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
once again just like in Lightroom don't

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.210 
once again just like in Lightroom don't
worry<00:04:52.550> too<00:04:52.910> much<00:04:52.940> about<00:04:53.680> how<00:04:54.680> dark<00:04:55.040> it<00:04:55.190> looks

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
worry too much about how dark it looks

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.710 
worry too much about how dark it looks
at<00:04:55.580> first<00:04:55.790> because<00:04:56.030> you're<00:04:56.270> gonna<00:04:56.420> back<00:04:56.600> and

a<00:04:59.920> lot<00:05:00.920> of<00:05:00.950> spill<00:05:03.400> bear<00:05:04.400> with<00:05:04.610> me<00:05:04.760> here<00:05:07.180> pretty

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
a lot of spill bear with me here pretty

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.060 
a lot of spill bear with me here pretty
ugly<00:05:09.040> but<00:05:11.200> we'll<00:05:12.200> get<00:05:12.350> rid<00:05:12.560> of<00:05:12.590> that<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:14.920> can<00:05:15.920> see

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
ugly but we'll get rid of that I can see

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.380 
ugly but we'll get rid of that I can see
somebody<00:05:16.250> fast-forwarding<00:05:17.120> right<00:05:17.240> now

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
somebody fast-forwarding right now

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.730 
somebody fast-forwarding right now
saying<00:05:17.720> this<00:05:17.900> is<00:05:18.080> boring

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
saying this is boring

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.840 
saying this is boring
I<00:05:19.120> understand<00:05:20.120> but<00:05:20.480> just<00:05:21.020> hear<00:05:21.710> me<00:05:21.890> out<00:05:21.920> okay

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.000 

so<00:05:26.360> now<00:05:26.540> we<00:05:26.600> have<00:05:26.810> that<00:05:26.930> intensified<00:05:27.380> contrast

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
so now we have that intensified contrast

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.810 
so now we have that intensified contrast
but<00:05:28.600> you<00:05:29.600> can<00:05:29.750> bring<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:29.990> down<00:05:30.170> and<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:31.580> gets<00:05:31.670> a

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
but you can bring it down and it gets a

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.190 
but you can bring it down and it gets a
lot<00:05:32.030> darker<00:05:32.300> but<00:05:32.600> you<00:05:32.690> don't<00:05:32.840> want<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.050> too

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
lot darker but you don't want it too

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.770 
lot darker but you don't want it too
dark<00:05:33.380> see<00:05:33.680> now<00:05:33.890> this<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.180> know<00:05:35.300> you're

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
dark see now this and you know you're

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.870 
dark see now this and you know you're
creating<00:05:36.080> too<00:05:36.230> much<00:05:36.410> contrast<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.640> last

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
creating too much contrast and the last

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.120 
creating too much contrast and the last
thing<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.210> would<00:05:38.270> do<00:05:38.540> now<00:05:38.840> that<00:05:39.020> I<00:05:39.050> have<00:05:39.350> and<00:05:39.680> by

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
thing I would do now that I have and by

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.500 
thing I would do now that I have and by
the<00:05:40.190> way<00:05:40.370> bolused<00:05:40.610> do<00:05:40.700> that<00:05:40.820> quick<00:05:41.030> before<00:05:41.390> and

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
the way bolused do that quick before and

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.730 
the way bolused do that quick before and
after<00:05:41.870> there's<00:05:42.320> before<00:05:43.150> before<00:05:44.150> after<00:05:44.840> and

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
after there's before before after and

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.720 
after there's before before after and
after<00:05:47.020> we're<00:05:48.020> done<00:05:48.200> with<00:05:48.380> that<00:05:48.490> now<00:05:49.490> what<00:05:49.700> I

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
after we're done with that now what I

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.650 
after we're done with that now what I
also<00:05:50.030> think<00:05:50.240> would<00:05:50.600> be<00:05:50.720> pretty<00:05:51.440> neat<00:05:51.680> are

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
also think would be pretty neat are

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.790 
also think would be pretty neat are
these<00:05:53.660> presets<00:05:54.290> where<00:05:56.020> this<00:05:57.020> color<00:05:57.350> one<00:05:57.590> where

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
these presets where this color one where

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.340 
these presets where this color one where
it's<00:05:57.920> toy<00:05:58.130> camera<00:05:58.610> now<00:05:58.880> this<00:05:59.120> seems<00:05:59.600> silly<00:06:00.110> and

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
it's toy camera now this seems silly and

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.720 
it's toy camera now this seems silly and
it<00:06:00.470> does<00:06:00.620> seem<00:06:00.830> over-the-top<00:06:01.280> and<00:06:01.490> it<00:06:01.610> is

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
it does seem over-the-top and it is

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.810 
it does seem over-the-top and it is
especially<00:06:02.510> this<00:06:02.960> vignette<00:06:03.440> I<00:06:03.680> would<00:06:04.490> get<00:06:04.670> rid

of that vignette it's way too powerful

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.650 
of that vignette it's way too powerful
