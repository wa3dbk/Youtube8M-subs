and where the the shop is can't really

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.990 
and where the the shop is can't really
explain<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.680> because<00:03:16.860> there's<00:03:17.130> no<00:03:17.220> flags<00:03:17.610> here

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.680 
kills over here this is one of the best
place<00:03:23.430> together<00:03:23.670> Matt<00:03:24.090> because<00:03:24.390> they<00:03:24.510> keep

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
place together Matt because they keep

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.330 
place together Matt because they keep
spawning<00:03:24.959> in<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.230> building<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.220> can

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
spawning in the building and you can

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.590 
spawning in the building and you can
just<00:03:26.430> keep<00:03:26.580> running<00:03:26.820> around<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.420> keep

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
just keep running around and keep

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.120 
just keep running around and keep
getting<00:03:27.930> them<00:03:28.020> as<00:03:28.200> they<00:03:28.380> spawn<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:28.920> very

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
getting them as they spawn it's very

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.770 
getting them as they spawn it's very
hard<00:03:29.340> for<00:03:29.400> them<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.640> give<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.970> out<00:03:30.120> especially
