00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 then we look at the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.690
 packaging 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.920

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.920

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.210

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.410
 let's get out for the hr 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.580
 the film is on the front and back 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.030
 Back then, here is the slot for the card 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.830
 good here and before the bankruptcy of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.760
 home button and the new lightning 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.860

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.869
 Speakers total four inches retina 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.420

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.790
 Facetime camera in the middle at 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.780
 black exactly the same again 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.290
 nicely packed but again and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.130
 the same we look again in the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.270
 packaging pure so here we have 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.270
 designed by Apple in California 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.420
 hello hello iphone info restricts the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.450
 Warranty and of course apple sticker 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.670
 then we have here 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.350
 the impetus for the outlet 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.759
 Here are the new airports directly from Apple 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.000

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:18.159
 announces already wound up 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:21.450
 and here we have it ultrathin 80 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:23.590
 smaller than the predecessor 30 pin 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.560
 if we then back since about 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.389
 hiking we see the iphone 5 always has 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.959
 still the same 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:33.939
 although it is 20 percent thinner then 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.879
 we have a new design here at the back 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.519

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.189
 Here aluminum is the same as the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.499
 macbook does not look so bad 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.780

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:50.500

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.569
 eight ball contacts when we have the iphones 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.459

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.010

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.019

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:12.250
 inch thick is the new iphone 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:14.799
 damn thin even 20 percent thinner 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.049
 as the 4s of the 3g s is right here 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.599
 fat in comparison here we still have 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:24.099

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.919

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.750
