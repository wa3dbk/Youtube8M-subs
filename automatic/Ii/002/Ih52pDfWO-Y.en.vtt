you<00:00:03.500> know<00:00:03.650> people<00:00:04.580> get<00:00:04.670> a<00:00:04.730> bit<00:00:04.910> confused<00:00:05.450> about

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:06.519 
you know people get a bit confused about

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.730 
you know people get a bit confused about
alkaline<00:00:07.519> water<00:00:07.760> and<00:00:08.210> I'd<00:00:08.930> like<00:00:09.110> to<00:00:09.170> dispel

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
alkaline water and I'd like to dispel

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.470 
alkaline water and I'd like to dispel
the<00:00:09.890> myth<00:00:10.040> this<00:00:10.190> morning<00:00:10.550> about<00:00:10.820> what<00:00:11.360> it

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
the myth this morning about what it

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.630 
the myth this morning about what it
really<00:00:11.630> means<00:00:11.810> alkaline<00:00:12.710> water<00:00:12.890> because<00:00:13.370> we

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:13.640 
really means alkaline water because we

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.000 
really means alkaline water because we
really<00:00:13.940> do<00:00:14.090> have<00:00:14.330> two<00:00:14.990> sorts<00:00:15.470> of<00:00:15.590> alkaline

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
really do have two sorts of alkaline

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.040 
really do have two sorts of alkaline
water<00:00:16.219> that<00:00:16.490> you<00:00:16.580> see<00:00:16.789> in<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.029> market<00:00:17.420> there

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
water that you see in the market there

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.930 
water that you see in the market there
are<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.320> filters<00:00:18.860> that<00:00:18.890> are<00:00:19.130> trying<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.820> be

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
are the filters that are trying to be

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.180 
are the filters that are trying to be
ionisers<00:00:20.690> and<00:00:20.930> there<00:00:21.080> are<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.350> ionisers<00:00:22.039> now

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
ionisers and there are the ionisers now

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.350 
ionisers and there are the ionisers now
the<00:00:22.250> filters<00:00:22.700> that<00:00:22.730> are<00:00:22.910> trying<00:00:23.180> to<00:00:23.240> be

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
the filters that are trying to be

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.260 
the filters that are trying to be
ionized<00:00:23.720> is<00:00:24.010> saying<00:00:25.010> will<00:00:25.520> we<00:00:25.640> add<00:00:25.820> alkaline

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
ionized is saying will we add alkaline

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.120 
ionized is saying will we add alkaline
minerals<00:00:26.630> to<00:00:26.750> our<00:00:26.840> water<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:27.440> that's<00:00:27.710> okay

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
minerals to our water and that's okay

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.060 
minerals to our water and that's okay
and<00:00:29.060> then<00:00:29.270> there<00:00:29.810> are<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.050> ionisers<00:00:30.650> like

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
and then there are the ionisers like

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.160 
and then there are the ionisers like
ours<00:00:31.310> which<00:00:31.910> take<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.390> acid<00:00:32.719> out<00:00:32.870> of<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
ours which take the acid out of the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.370 
ours which take the acid out of the
water<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:33.730> ionized<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:35.149> therefore<00:00:35.840> alkalis

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
water and ionized and therefore alkalis

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.340 
water and ionized and therefore alkalis
the<00:00:36.560> water<00:00:36.739> now<00:00:37.100> I'm<00:00:37.399> not<00:00:37.640> going<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.030> time

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
the water now I'm not going to time

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.330 
the water now I'm not going to time
confuse<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:39.500> here<00:00:39.680> but<00:00:39.890> probably<00:00:40.220> the

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
confuse you here but probably the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.479 
confuse you here but probably the
easiest<00:00:40.700> example<00:00:40.910> is<00:00:41.300> this<00:00:41.510> scruffy-looking

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
easiest example is this scruffy-looking

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.600 
easiest example is this scruffy-looking
parsley<00:00:43.489> plant<00:00:43.790> now<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:45.559> all<00:00:45.739> know<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:46.399> when

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
parsley plant now we all know that when

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.030 
parsley plant now we all know that when
we're<00:00:46.790> growing<00:00:47.239> things<00:00:47.570> you're<00:00:48.559> going<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:48.920> get

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
we're growing things you're going to get

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.650 
we're growing things you're going to get
the<00:00:49.160> best<00:00:49.370> out<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:49.579> your<00:00:49.760> plant<00:00:50.059> if<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.360> add

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
the best out of your plant if you add

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.900 
the best out of your plant if you add
the<00:00:50.899> right<00:00:51.079> minerals<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:52.430> similar<00:00:52.760> to

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
the right minerals and it's similar to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.410 
the right minerals and it's similar to
the<00:00:53.120> body<00:00:53.329> however<00:00:54.219> what<00:00:55.219> would<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:55.550> do<00:00:55.760> if

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
the body however what would you do if

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.900 
the body however what would you do if
you<00:00:57.140> added<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:57.980> certain<00:00:58.160> number<00:00:58.399> of<00:00:58.550> minerals

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
you added a certain number of minerals

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.459 
you added a certain number of minerals
and<00:00:59.149> didn't<00:00:59.450> work<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.840> then<00:00:59.930> you<00:01:00.020> added<00:01:00.289> some

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
and didn't work and then you added some

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.619 
and didn't work and then you added some
more<00:01:00.620> minerals<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.489> make<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.789> work<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.210> then

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
more minerals to make it work and then

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.060 
more minerals to make it work and then
that<00:01:02.840> didn't<00:01:03.110> work<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:03.469> you<00:01:03.530> added<00:01:03.800> some<00:01:03.950> more

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
that didn't work so you added some more

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.640 
that didn't work so you added some more
minerals<00:01:04.460> you'd<00:01:05.059> have<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.269> mineral<00:01:05.750> overloaded

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
minerals you'd have a mineral overloaded

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.899 
minerals you'd have a mineral overloaded
plant<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.159> would<00:01:07.280> probably<00:01:07.490> die<00:01:07.760> of

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
plant that would probably die of

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.070 
plant that would probably die of
toxicity<00:01:08.680> similar<00:01:09.680> thing<00:01:09.860> with<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.100> body<00:01:10.310> and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
toxicity similar thing with the body and

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.660 
toxicity similar thing with the body and

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.109 
that calcium supplements don't work now
this<00:01:58.700> gave<00:01:59.030> her<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.570> tremendous<00:02:00.229> shock<00:02:00.909> but<00:02:01.909> she

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
this gave her a tremendous shock but she

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.460 
this gave her a tremendous shock but she
could<00:02:02.299> she<00:02:02.509> went<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.780> bit<00:02:02.869> further<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:03.350> she

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
could she went a bit further and she

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.170 
could she went a bit further and she
looked<00:02:03.619> for<00:02:03.770> answers<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.640> what<00:02:04.790> she<00:02:04.939> found

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
looked for answers and what she found

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.630 
looked for answers and what she found
was<00:02:05.329> that<00:02:06.140> what<00:02:06.409> we<00:02:06.560> are<00:02:06.710> doing<00:02:06.950> rather<00:02:07.340> like

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
was that what we are doing rather like

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.010 
was that what we are doing rather like
the<00:02:07.820> plant<00:02:08.090> here<00:02:08.420> is

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
the plant here is

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.140 
the plant here is
overloading<00:02:09.530> ourselves<00:02:09.980> with<00:02:10.100> acid<00:02:10.460> and<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
overloading ourselves with acid and the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.940 
overloading ourselves with acid and the
way<00:02:11.330> we<00:02:11.510> overload<00:02:11.900> ourselves<00:02:12.380> with<00:02:12.530> acid<00:02:12.830> and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
way we overload ourselves with acid and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.640 
way we overload ourselves with acid and
here's<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> beauty<00:02:14.600> she<00:02:14.810> did<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:15.050> graph<00:02:15.380> of

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
here's the beauty she did a graph of

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.890 
here's the beauty she did a graph of
where<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:17.570> hip<00:02:17.990> fractures<00:02:18.440> etc<00:02:18.890> occur

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
where the hip fractures etc occur

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.090 
where the hip fractures etc occur
geographically<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.110> it's<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.650> countries

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
geographically and it's the countries

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.580 
geographically and it's the countries
like<00:02:22.280> ours<00:02:22.520> where<00:02:23.330> we<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.660> great<00:02:24.080> access<00:02:24.560> to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
like ours where we have great access to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.380 
like ours where we have great access to
high-quality<00:02:25.160> meat<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:27.440> dairy<00:02:27.920> products

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
high-quality meat and dairy products

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.030 
high-quality meat and dairy products
where<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.660> hip<00:02:29.960> fractures<00:02:30.410> are<00:02:30.530> occurring

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
where the hip fractures are occurring

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.010 
where the hip fractures are occurring
now<00:02:31.460> why<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.820> that<00:02:32.030> doesn't<00:02:32.510> make<00:02:32.660> sense

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
now why is that doesn't make sense

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.950 
now why is that doesn't make sense
dairy<00:02:33.290> products<00:02:33.680> good<00:02:33.830> for<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.190> okay<00:02:34.660> if<00:02:35.660> you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
goes oh my god I need calcium really

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.950 
goes oh my god I need calcium really
quickly

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
quickly

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.330 
quickly
unfortunately<00:02:50.960> because<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.920> seed

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
unfortunately because it's a seed

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.000 
unfortunately because it's a seed
situation<00:02:53.330> it<00:02:53.720> pulls<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.380> calcium<00:02:54.860> out<00:02:54.950> of

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
situation it pulls the calcium out of

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.750 
situation it pulls the calcium out of
your<00:02:55.130> bones<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.450> why<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:57.760> Australia

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
your bones and this is why in Australia

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.640 
your bones and this is why in Australia
we<00:02:58.880> have<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.270> veritable<00:02:59.870> plague<00:03:00.320> of

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
we have a veritable plague of

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.080 
we have a veritable plague of
osteoporosis<00:03:01.870> now<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:04.130> see<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.700> would<00:03:04.880> say

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
osteoporosis now you see you would say

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.850 
osteoporosis now you see you would say
therefore<00:03:05.390> I've<00:03:05.780> got<00:03:05.960> to<00:03:06.080> add<00:03:06.170> calcium<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.770> it

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
therefore I've got to add calcium to it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.790 
therefore I've got to add calcium to it
no<00:03:07.520> in<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.510> countries<00:03:09.050> where<00:03:09.230> they<00:03:09.440> had

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
no in the countries where they had

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.160 
no in the countries where they had
access<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.520> council<00:03:11.150> calcium<00:03:11.540> supplements

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
access to council calcium supplements

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.020 
access to council calcium supplements
they<00:03:12.320> found<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.770> worst<00:03:13.040> hip<00:03:13.370> fractures<00:03:13.850> now

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
they found the worst hip fractures now

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.350 
they found the worst hip fractures now
how<00:03:14.180> can<00:03:14.240> that<00:03:14.390> be<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.250> problem<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:17.209> you

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
how can that be the problem is that you

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.880 
how can that be the problem is that you
pull<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:17.810> much<00:03:17.930> calcium<00:03:18.410> out<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.560> your<00:03:18.650> bones

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
pull so much calcium out of your bones

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.250 
pull so much calcium out of your bones
you<00:03:19.550> can't<00:03:19.850> use<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.300> you<00:03:20.420> end<00:03:20.540> up<00:03:20.690> paying<00:03:20.959> half

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
you can't use it you end up paying half

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.320 
you can't use it you end up paying half
it<00:03:21.440> out<00:03:21.590> along<00:03:21.920> with<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.130> amino<00:03:22.550> acids<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
it out along with the amino acids and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.210 
it out along with the amino acids and
we've<00:03:23.870> seen<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.380> with<00:03:24.590> people<00:03:24.770> who've<00:03:25.070> done

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
we've seen this with people who've done

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.120 
we've seen this with people who've done
their<00:03:25.400> pH<00:03:25.730> test<00:03:26.090> Nestle<00:03:26.450> well<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:27.380> know<00:03:27.560> it

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
their pH test Nestle well you know it

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.520 
their pH test Nestle well you know it
looks<00:03:28.340> okay<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:28.940> feel<00:03:28.970> terrible<00:03:29.180> my<00:03:29.900> pH<00:03:30.260> is

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
looks okay but I feel terrible my pH is

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.830 
looks okay but I feel terrible my pH is
is<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.190> good<00:03:31.490> reading<00:03:31.760> yes<00:03:32.420> it's<00:03:32.690> because

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
is that a good reading yes it's because

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.780 
is that a good reading yes it's because
you've<00:03:33.140> got<00:03:33.290> calcium<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.010> urine<00:03:34.040> and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
you've got calcium in the urine and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.810 
you've got calcium in the urine and
you've<00:03:35.209> got<00:03:35.510> acids<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.320> your<00:03:36.350> on<00:03:36.820> neutralizing

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
you've got acids in your on neutralizing

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.720 
you've got acids in your on neutralizing
out<00:03:37.970> similar<00:03:38.930> thing<00:03:39.110> with<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.350> body<00:03:39.560> if<00:03:40.430> you

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
out similar thing with the body if you

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.420 
out similar thing with the body if you
have<00:03:40.910> an<00:03:41.090> excess<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.570> something<00:03:42.050> our<00:03:42.590> idea<00:03:43.130> is

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
have an excess of something our idea is

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.910 
have an excess of something our idea is
that<00:03:43.580> we'll<00:03:43.760> just<00:03:43.790> add<00:03:44.150> more<00:03:44.600> rather<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:45.770> the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
that we'll just add more rather like the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.350 
that we'll just add more rather like the
plant<00:03:46.220> we'll<00:03:46.430> add<00:03:46.550> more<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.880> more<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.209> more

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
plant we'll add more and more and more

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.910 
plant we'll add more and more and more
and<00:03:47.480> more<00:03:47.630> until<00:03:48.170> we<00:03:48.200> get<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.530> balance<00:03:48.709> right

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
and more until we get the balance right

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.150 
and more until we get the balance right
well<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:50.990> rather<00:03:51.170> like<00:03:51.470> alkaline<00:03:51.890> water

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
well this is rather like alkaline water

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.100 
well this is rather like alkaline water
and<00:03:52.610> alkaline<00:03:53.060> ionized<00:03:53.510> water<00:03:53.750> because

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
and alkaline ionized water because

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.960 
and alkaline ionized water because
alkaline<00:03:54.440> water<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:54.980> your<00:03:55.220> ordinary<00:03:55.550> what<00:03:55.820> if

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
alkaline water is your ordinary what if

not for the calcium itself that we have
it<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.510> blood<00:04:41.990> can<00:04:42.530> maintain<00:04:42.890> the

the amount of calcium okay so we are
