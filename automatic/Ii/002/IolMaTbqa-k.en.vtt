so<00:01:24.789> we<00:01:25.090> call<00:01:25.360> lava<00:01:25.659> bombs<00:01:26.050> bomb<00:01:26.530> bubble<00:01:26.950> can

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.569 

I'm<00:02:55.610> standing<00:02:56.239> actually<00:02:56.420> inside<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.739> string

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
I'm standing actually inside the string

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:33.980 
I'm standing actually inside the string
of<00:02:58.670> creators<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.480> this<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.349> crater<00:03:00.650> rim

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:51.060 

we're<00:03:34.990> heading<00:03:35.290> into<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.530> lava<00:03:35.770> tube<00:03:50.070> outside

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
we're heading into the lava tube outside

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.840 
we're heading into the lava tube outside
by<00:03:51.480> chemistry<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:53.230> this<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:56.850> smallest

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
by chemistry so this is the smallest

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.660 
by chemistry so this is the smallest
part<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.900> caves<00:03:59.200> so<00:03:59.410> follow<00:04:00.280> we<00:04:00.459> were

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
part of the caves so follow we were

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.640 
part of the caves so follow we were
walking<00:04:01.030> on<00:04:01.420> this<00:04:01.600> case<00:04:01.959> uh-huh

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
walking on this case uh-huh

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.130 
walking on this case uh-huh
you<00:04:03.370> can<00:04:03.610> see<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.910> it's<00:04:04.090> like<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.360> tunnel<00:04:04.750> like

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
you can see that it's like a tunnel like

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.290 
you can see that it's like a tunnel like
a<00:04:05.170> tube<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:05.890> lava<00:04:06.250> flowing<00:04:06.640> in<00:04:07.060> this

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
a tube so the lava flowing in this

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.500 
a tube so the lava flowing in this
direction<00:04:07.830> probably<00:04:08.830> this<00:04:09.370> is<00:04:09.430> natural<00:04:09.970> we

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
direction probably this is natural we

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.590 
direction probably this is natural we
call<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.989> way<00:04:11.769> it's<00:04:11.980> like<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.340> window<00:04:13.090> natural

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
call this way it's like a window natural

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.259 
call this way it's like a window natural
window<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.650> then<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.160> people<00:04:15.370> doing<00:04:16.030> their

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
window and then the people doing their

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.319 
window and then the people doing their
80<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:17.139> 17th<00:04:17.799> century<00:04:18.040> they<00:04:18.549> transformed

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
80 the 17th century they transformed

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:52.940 
80 the 17th century they transformed
this<00:04:19.600> into<00:04:20.190> artificial<00:04:49.500> entity<00:04:50.500> comedy<00:04:51.690> okay

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
this into artificial entity comedy okay

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.810 
this into artificial entity comedy okay
and<00:04:53.950> this<00:04:54.789> isn't<00:04:55.030> like<00:04:55.990> solid<00:04:56.740> types<00:04:57.039> that

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
and this isn't like solid types that

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.480 
and this isn't like solid types that
because<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.780> waters<00:04:59.229> changed<00:04:59.979> just<00:05:00.280> the

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
because the waters changed just the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.790 
because the waters changed just the
shape<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.419> this<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.800> process<00:05:03.510> is<00:05:04.510> called<00:05:05.440> the

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
shape of this the process is called the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.120 
shape of this the process is called the
remelting<00:05:06.550> process<00:05:07.240> generally<00:05:07.930> a<00:05:08.229> venal

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
string they come here they come here

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.779 
string they come here they come here
with<00:05:13.470> just<00:05:14.470> to<00:05:14.740> become<00:05:15.610> with<00:05:16.000> no<00:05:16.240> they

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
with just to become with no they

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.420 
with just to become with no they
Kamath's<00:05:18.789> now<00:05:19.150> from<00:05:19.690> here<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:20.950> second

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
Kamath's now from here to the second

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.279 
Kamath's now from here to the second
room<00:05:21.669> to<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.090> ice<00:05:22.210> room<00:05:22.539> they've<00:05:22.780> transformed

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
room to the ice room they've transformed

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.950 
room to the ice room they've transformed
is<00:05:23.590> no<00:05:23.770> into<00:05:24.280> ice<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.940> then<00:05:25.210> they<00:05:26.190> carried<00:05:27.190> by

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
is no into ice and then they carried by

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.390 
is no into ice and then they carried by
chariot<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.169> donkey<00:05:29.650> to

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
chariot and donkey to

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.379 
chariot and donkey to
you<00:05:30.490> know<00:05:30.699> to<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.919> villages<00:05:32.919> all<00:05:33.460> around<00:05:33.490> they

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
you know to the villages all around they

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.790 
you know to the villages all around they
stay<00:05:34.780> here<00:05:35.350> during<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.430> winter<00:05:37.350> so<00:05:38.350> probably

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
stay here during the winter so probably

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.140 
stay here during the winter so probably
they<00:05:39.160> use<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.789> yeah<00:05:41.220> probably<00:05:42.220> they<00:05:42.400> use<00:05:42.669> here

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
they use a yeah probably they use here

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.960 
they use a yeah probably they use here
just<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.720> have<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:43.930> fire<00:05:44.199> with<00:05:44.949> fire<00:05:45.370> walk<00:05:45.639> oh

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
just to have a fire with fire walk oh

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.719 
just to have a fire with fire walk oh
yeah<00:05:46.509> all<00:05:46.930> during<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.560> summer<00:05:47.889> when<00:05:48.280> it's<00:05:48.490> too

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
yeah all during the summer when it's too

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.879 
yeah all during the summer when it's too
hot<00:05:49.000> they<00:05:49.360> stay<00:05:49.660> inside<00:05:49.870> they<00:05:50.380> spend<00:05:50.740> the

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
hot they stay inside they spend the

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.659 
hot they stay inside they spend the
night<00:05:51.100> here<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.600> they<00:05:52.840> tell<00:05:53.199> us<00:05:53.410> yeah<00:05:54.220> yeah

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
night here so they tell us yeah yeah

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.650 
night here so they tell us yeah yeah
yeah<00:05:55.180> you<00:05:55.870> can<00:05:56.050> do<00:05:56.259> it<00:05:56.789> you<00:05:57.789> can<00:05:57.820> see<00:05:58.180> they<00:05:58.330> can

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
yeah you can do it you can see they can

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.550 
yeah you can do it you can see they can
a<00:05:58.930> chance

a chance
no<00:06:00.039> it's<00:06:00.910> little<00:06:01.330> Eagle<00:06:01.630> it's<00:06:02.139> a<00:06:02.289> it<00:06:03.070> should<00:06:03.100> be

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
no it's little Eagle it's a it should be

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.830 
no it's little Eagle it's a it should be
illegal<00:06:03.880> but<00:06:04.300> they<00:06:04.570> they<00:06:05.139> have<00:06:05.380> a<00:06:05.410> good<00:06:06.840> they
