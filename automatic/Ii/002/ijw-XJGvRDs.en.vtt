00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
can actually finish without having to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.929 
can actually finish without having to
learn<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> basis<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.159> their<00:01:08.280> mechanics<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
learn the basis of their mechanics and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.850 
learn the basis of their mechanics and
games<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.900> loads<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> phone<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.710> you'll

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
games like loads of the phone so you'll

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.950 
games like loads of the phone so you'll
