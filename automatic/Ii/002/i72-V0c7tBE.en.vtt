I<00:01:33.530> am<00:01:34.530> using<00:01:35.010> Chinese<00:01:35.610> eggplant<00:01:35.970> which<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.200> the

I am using Chinese eggplant which is the
most<00:01:37.680> common<00:01:38.370> one<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.120> use<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.630> this

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
most common one that we use in this

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.950 
most common one that we use in this
recipe<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.220> advantage<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.210> using<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
recipe the advantage of using the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.620 
recipe the advantage of using the
Chinese<00:01:43.470> variety<00:01:44.160> is<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:45.120> when<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> is

sliced the skin encloses the flesh and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.770 
sliced the skin encloses the flesh and
prevents<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.160> disintegrating<00:01:50.700> into<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
prevents it from disintegrating into the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.100 
prevents it from disintegrating into the
soup<00:01:52.160> but<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.430> may<00:01:53.580> use<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.090> larger<00:01:54.570> eggplant
