00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 the house of the bible presents the new 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.570
 interlinear testament word by 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.990
 word if you have never studied 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.810
 Greek does not matter the present 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 interlinear has been drawn up in such 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.840
 way that you can perceive the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.260
 characteristics of the Greek without having 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.970
 studied called me sat mamÃ©s 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.879
 I am a consultant for companies 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.320
 united biblical and we have a grateful 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.000
 surprise because a book has just come out 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.000
 that I have prepared together with another 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.900
 colleague doctor in linguistics is about 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.530
 of the new Greek interlinear testament 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.470
 Spanish is a work that has been prepared 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.079
 with enough dedication more than four 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.540
 years the doctor and she 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.000
 is a linguist and is also a biblical 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.299
 anthropologist I am a specialist in new 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.720
 testament and also linguist the 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.509
 doctor irene foxx who is known in 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.670
 america latin for their knowledge of 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.920
 Greek the grammar that you have prepared 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 she was the reviewer advises 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.310
 external of this project 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.810
 and how they have been prepared the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.110
 work is very interesting what we want 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.330
 is that not only use it in people 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.400
 who know Greek or the people who have 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.400
 studied Greek or who are studying 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.580
 we have prepared in a way that 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.940
 also people who do not know Greek 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.250
 they can also use it in their 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.619
 sermons in their biblical studies in their 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.960
 investigations I will explain the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.850
 way we prepare it consists of 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.850
 three texts one 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.100
 the translation that we have made after 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.250
 every Greek word below we put on it is 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.540
 exactly quite literally the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.860
 Spanish we have also included in the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.590
 contemporary valera queen version that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.620
 many of you already know her now and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.170
 the version 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.170
 bible of jerusalem because we want 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.940
 encompass all the public we have in 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.030
 the syntax that is sometimes quite 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.560
 different from Spanish than a person who 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.230
 knows the Greek would not be difficult 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.500
 a lot but then we what 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.500
 we have done is enumerate for example if 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.989
 there is confusion to understand everything in a way 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.790
 quite literally we have listed for 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.879
 go first where the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.750
 number one in square brackets after 2 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:02.090
 to 3 to 4 depending on the number of 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.060
 words that we have listed of that 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.239
 form can be read perfectly in the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.740
 order according to the syntax of the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.440
 Spanish 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.780
 other 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.050
 another characteristic is that we have put 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.420
 footnotes we want this to be a 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.770
 book that is also used by 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.470
 translators and indigenous people that they 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.680
 translate normally from the Spanish language 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.750
 because they do not know Greek then we have 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.500
 prepared so that they too what 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.460
 use and we have notes for example the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.830
 widow deposit says a reader that is 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.140
 reader we have to put everything 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.090
 because the Hebrew and select then 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.940
 we put a note that means a 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.240
 copper coin and so on etc. 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.110
 we have 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.390
 footnote of different type verbs 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.920
 irregular irregular names that is 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.850
 grammar cultural weights measures or 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.850
 customs 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.409
 At first sight one does not understand it 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.299
 there we clarify and the manuscripts 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.509
 Byzantines or the so-called received text 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.509
 receiver texts there we clarify the 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:23.190
 text makes the interlinear is the text 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.190
 of the united biblical societies 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.090
 what is that text that the 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.880
 manuscripts 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.340
 where biblical science is applied with 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.040
 the oldest manuscripts and with greater 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.550
 authority but as we have the queen 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.479
 Valera and Jerusalem indicate the foot 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.210
 of note in which part I know in which part 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.120
 some manuscripts omit or add or 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.030
 they include a variant then the text 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.820
 base is the text where the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.770
 biblical science 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:01.650
 which is the fourth edition to 27 of 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.740
 the united biblical societies are going to 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.990
 find another very important detail 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.580
 for people who do not know Greek no 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:15.000
 are familiar is that in addition to 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.029
 stop the syntactic order according to 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.580
 one more reading 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:25.330
 Castilla listing the words in 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.699
 Spanish we have a third line because 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.839
 we want that under each word well 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.939
 Greek is exactly as it says 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:38.340
 Greek we try to be pretty 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:41.110
 literal but sometimes it 's literal 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.230
 confuses you do not understand or we 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.690
 we use another verb may be used 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.410
 the subjunctive in Greek but in Spanish 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:53.620
 we use an indicative then we add 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.510
 a third line or in the participle by 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.150
 example the Greek are the ones who know know 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.600
 which has many participles then 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.360
 says for example the beginning was there and 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.289
 we left the eating but down 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:13.229
 we put the one who eats 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:15.389
 so that it is understood better so we believe 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.499
 that is going to be a very good tool 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:21.629
 for people who are passionate about 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:24.149
 the bible and also I think it's 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.099
 we already have enough versions 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:29.039
 in Spanish then I think that 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:31.020
 we need this tool so that 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.089
 when we see that this version translates 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.729
 in this way this other version of this 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:38.639
 another way this other way let's go to 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:41.099
 Greek and let's realize why because 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.009
 surely there is a problem that demands 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:46.589
 It will not solve the problems 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:51.059
 exegetics rather well let's see 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:53.669
 where is the problem because it is a 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:56.369
 line spacing is not a book of exegesis 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.979
 but it helps you locate the problem and be 

00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:00.689
 ethical so that with that word you 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.419
 go to the comments to the 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:06.270
 dictionaries and so I can study and 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:09.210
 find the reasons why 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:14.750
 sometimes translates in a way sometimes 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:17.750
 from another the house of the bible now more 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.750
 decadent
