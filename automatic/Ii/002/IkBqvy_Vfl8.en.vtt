00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
and it took some time but she did

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.550

would almost certainly break her arm and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120 
would almost certainly break her arm and
lose<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.420> as<00:02:57.540> well<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.680> imagine<00:02:58.830> what
