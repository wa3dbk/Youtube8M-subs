larger<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.210> first<00:00:44.420> thing<00:00:44.600> you're<00:00:44.720> going

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
larger so the first thing you're going

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.420 
larger so the first thing you're going
to<00:00:44.930> do<00:00:45.140> is<00:00:45.410> you're<00:00:45.590> going<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.829> fold<00:00:46.190> your

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
to do is you're going to fold your

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.590 
to do is you're going to fold your
square<00:00:46.790> sheet<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.149> paper<00:00:47.360> in<00:00:47.720> half<00:00:48.380> like<00:00:48.649> this

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.720 

increase<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:53.809> in<00:00:54.309> next<00:00:55.309> you're<00:00:55.520> going<00:00:55.640> to

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
increase it in next you're going to

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.520 
increase it in next you're going to
unfold<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.420> fold<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:56.840> just<00:00:57.110> made<00:00:57.320> and

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
unfold the fold that you just made and

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.950 
unfold the fold that you just made and
then<00:00:58.250> you're<00:00:58.399> going<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:58.640> align<00:00:59.090> this<00:00:59.480> bottom

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
then you're going to align this bottom

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.319 
then you're going to align this bottom
side<00:01:00.230> over<00:01:00.559> here<00:01:00.590> with<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.850> horizontal

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
side over here with this horizontal

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.179 
side over here with this horizontal
Center<00:01:03.140> crease<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:03.710> just<00:01:03.920> made

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.330 

increase<00:01:10.189> it<00:01:10.369> in<00:01:11.799> after<00:01:12.799> that<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.070> want<00:01:13.250> to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
increase it in after that you want to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.490 
increase it in after that you want to
rotate<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.909> unit<00:01:13.939> so<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:14.630> it's<00:01:14.929> facing<00:01:15.229> in

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
rotate the unit so that it's facing in

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.560 
rotate the unit so that it's facing in
this<00:01:15.710> direction<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.520> you're<00:01:17.119> just<00:01:17.270> going<00:01:17.509> to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
this direction and you're just going to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.260 
this direction and you're just going to
repeat<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.049> same<00:01:18.079> thing<00:01:18.590> at<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:19.100> send<00:01:19.369> so

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
repeat the same thing at the send so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.830 
repeat the same thing at the send so
we're<00:01:20.390> going<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:20.570> fold<00:01:20.689> it<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.079> center<00:01:22.840> and

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
we're going to fold it to the center and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.120 
we're going to fold it to the center and
crease<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.409> in

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.370 

okay<00:01:30.700> then<00:01:31.510> we're<00:01:31.630> going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.869> flip<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.200> unit

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
okay then we're going to flip the unit

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.700 
okay then we're going to flip the unit
over<00:01:32.530> like<00:01:33.040> this<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.720> that<00:01:34.750> this<00:01:35.170> side<00:01:35.409> is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
over like this so that this side is

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.810 
over like this so that this side is
completely<00:01:36.280> plain<00:01:38.009> versus<00:01:39.009> this<00:01:39.250> side<00:01:39.460> has

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
completely plain versus this side has

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.899 
completely plain versus this side has
two<00:01:40.060> openings<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.920> we<00:01:42.040> want<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.310> opening<00:01:42.759> to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
two openings so we want the opening to

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.380 
two openings so we want the opening to
be<00:01:43.030> facing<00:01:43.240> down<00:01:44.790> then<00:01:45.790> we're<00:01:45.939> going<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.149> fold

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
be facing down then we're going to fold

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.510 
be facing down then we're going to fold
the<00:01:46.750> entire<00:01:47.200> sheet<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.470> paper<00:01:47.740> in<00:01:48.070> half<00:01:48.220> like

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
the entire sheet of paper in half like

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.679 
the entire sheet of paper in half like
this

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.389 

precedent

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.609 

and<00:02:00.549> then<00:02:01.539> unfold<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:05.049> you're<00:02:05.229> going<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.439> take

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
and then unfold now you're going to take

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.430 
and then unfold now you're going to take
this<00:02:05.829> right<00:02:06.130> side<00:02:06.460> over<00:02:06.789> here<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.270> align<00:02:08.229> it

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
this right side over here and align it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.080 
this right side over here and align it
with<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.769> vertical<00:02:08.890> center<00:02:09.670> crease<00:02:09.910> that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
with this vertical center crease that

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.509 
with this vertical center crease that
you<00:02:10.209> just<00:02:10.420> made<00:02:11.040> so<00:02:12.040> we're<00:02:12.190> just<00:02:12.220> going<00:02:12.430> to

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
you just made so we're just going to

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:24.430 
you just made so we're just going to
bring<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.730> over<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:17.370> Flynn

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.930 

then<00:02:25.010> we're<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:25.190> going<00:02:25.460> to<00:02:25.490> repeat<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> same

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
then we're just going to repeat the same

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:40.470 
then we're just going to repeat the same
thing<00:02:26.420> on<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> left<00:02:26.930> side

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.660 

and<00:02:41.020> now<00:02:41.620> your<00:02:41.770> unit<00:02:42.069> should<00:02:42.250> look<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.459> this

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
and now your unit should look like this

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.890 
and now your unit should look like this
next<00:02:45.670> what<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.819> want<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.150> do<00:02:46.269> is<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.629> want<00:02:46.810> to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.170 
open this top flap over here so see how
there's<00:02:49.599> four<00:02:49.870> quadrants<00:02:50.379> one<00:02:50.739> two<00:02:51.370> three

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
there's four quadrants one two three

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.540 
there's four quadrants one two three
four<00:02:52.629> you're<00:02:53.230> going<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.500> take<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.860> top<00:02:54.160> left

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
four you're going to take this top left

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970 
four you're going to take this top left
quadrant<00:02:55.090> over<00:02:55.239> here<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.840> what<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.739> want<00:02:56.920> to

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
quadrant over here and what you want to

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.500 
quadrant over here and what you want to
do<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.430> want<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.610> stick<00:02:57.849> your<00:02:57.940> finger<00:02:58.150> into

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
do is you want to stick your finger into

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.910 
do is you want to stick your finger into
this<00:02:58.840> hole<00:02:59.640> see<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.819> stick<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.930> like<00:03:02.709> that

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
this hole see that stick it in like that

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.680 
this hole see that stick it in like that
and<00:03:04.530> then<00:03:05.530> with<00:03:05.709> your<00:03:05.830> other<00:03:06.010> hand<00:03:06.690> you're

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
and then with your other hand you're

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.180 
and then with your other hand you're
going<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.930> push<00:03:08.110> down<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.860> this<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.799> once

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
going to push down like this and once

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.910 
going to push down like this and once
you<00:03:12.310> put<00:03:12.519> push<00:03:12.970> down<00:03:13.319> you'll<00:03:14.319> notice<00:03:14.680> a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
you put push down you'll notice a

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.910 
you put push down you'll notice a
triangle<00:03:15.730> shape<00:03:16.000> starting<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.630> form<00:03:16.959> at<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
triangle shape starting to form at the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.360 
triangle shape starting to form at the
top<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:19.860> then<00:03:20.860> you're<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.190> going<00:03:21.340> to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
top and then you're just going to

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.920 
top and then you're just going to
flatten<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:22.049> like<00:03:23.049> this

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.899 

and<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:27.620> now<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:27.829> should<00:03:28.069> have<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.280> triangle

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
and so now you should have a triangle

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.100 
and so now you should have a triangle
over<00:03:29.030> here<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:30.200> square<00:03:30.590> at<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.220> bottom<00:03:32.110> so

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
over here and a square at the bottom so

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.809 
over here and a square at the bottom so
let's<00:03:33.290> do<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:33.590> again<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.099> right<00:03:34.489> side

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
let's do this again on the right side

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.580 
let's do this again on the right side
you're<00:03:35.390> going<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.569> stick<00:03:35.750> your<00:03:35.840> hand<00:03:36.140> at<00:03:36.349> the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you're going to stick your hand at the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.550 
you're going to stick your hand at the
top<00:03:36.860> right<00:03:37.370> quadrant<00:03:37.989> just<00:03:38.989> like<00:03:39.140> that

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
top right quadrant just like that

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.130 
top right quadrant just like that
stick<00:03:40.400> your<00:03:40.430> finger<00:03:40.549> in<00:03:40.970> there<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.810> get<00:03:41.989> it

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
stick your finger in there to get it

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.190 
stick your finger in there to get it
open<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.390> then<00:03:44.390> you're<00:03:44.540> going<00:03:44.629> to<00:03:44.720> push<00:03:44.870> down

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
open and then you're going to push down

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.520 
open and then you're going to push down
with<00:03:45.260> your<00:03:46.030> hand<00:03:47.030> like<00:03:47.239> this

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.440 

and<00:03:53.620> as<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.520> did<00:03:54.700> before<00:03:54.819> when<00:03:55.300> you're

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
and as you did before when you're

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.080 
and as you did before when you're
pushing<00:03:55.630> down<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:56.490> triangle<00:03:57.490> shape<00:03:57.730> should

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
pushing down a triangle shape should

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.850 
pushing down a triangle shape should
start<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.840> form<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:01.030> flatten<00:04:01.390> that<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.860> after

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
start to form so flatten that and after

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.230 
start to form so flatten that and after
you're<00:04:05.980> done<00:04:06.100> with<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.459> you're<00:04:07.030> going<00:04:07.180> to

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
you're done with that you're going to

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.300 
you're done with that you're going to
flip<00:04:07.390> your<00:04:07.450> unit<00:04:07.870> around<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:09.130> are

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
flip your unit around and you are

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.370 
flip your unit around and you are
completely<00:04:09.670> done<00:04:10.120> with<00:04:10.480> your<00:04:10.660> origami<00:04:11.050> house

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
completely done with your origami house

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.320 
completely done with your origami house
now<00:04:12.160> you<00:04:12.220> can<00:04:12.430> even<00:04:12.580> take<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.060> step<00:04:13.270> further

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
now you can even take it a step further

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.170 
now you can even take it a step further
and<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:14.290> can<00:04:14.560> draw<00:04:15.100> some<00:04:15.310> decorations<00:04:15.940> on<00:04:16.150> it

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
and you can draw some decorations on it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.920 
and you can draw some decorations on it
