and a piece of paper and the first thing
we're<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.449> draw<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
we're going to do is to draw a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.509 
we're going to do is to draw a
medium-sized<00:00:23.930> circle<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
medium-sized circle just like that and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.349 
medium-sized circle just like that and
then<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> draw<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.859> circle<00:00:29.429> next

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
then we're going to draw a circle next

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.080 
then we're going to draw a circle next
to<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:32.660> now<00:00:33.660> we're<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.710> draw<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.370> bigger

to it now we're going to draw a bigger

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.979 
to it now we're going to draw a bigger
circle<00:00:36.649> that<00:00:37.649> goes<00:00:37.760> underneath<00:00:38.760> these<00:00:39.570> two

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
circle that goes underneath these two

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.060 
circle that goes underneath these two
circles<00:00:41.660> there<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.870> go<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> guess<00:00:43.860> what

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
circles there we go can you guess what

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.779 
circles there we go can you guess what
that<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:45.020> now<00:00:46.020> we're<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> draw<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.370> big

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that is now we're going to draw a big

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.330 
that is now we're going to draw a big
line<00:00:48.210> coming<00:00:48.719> off<00:00:48.930> our<00:00:49.140> circle<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.449> a<00:00:51.449> big<00:00:51.960> old

semicircle<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.610> joins<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
semicircle that joins up like that and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.660 
semicircle that joins up like that and
that<00:00:55.949> will<00:00:56.219> be<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> body<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.449> our<00:00:57.629> bumblebee

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
coming off the body and these are the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.060 
coming off the body and these are the
wings<00:01:08.420> we're<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.720> add<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.439> detail

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
