you are willing to change the wrong so

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.979 
you are willing to change the wrong so
anyway<00:00:41.399> let's<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.730> started<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.360> where<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
anyway let's get started so where is

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.569 
anyway let's get started so where is
this<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> machi<00:00:43.559> demand<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.190> straight

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
this is the machi demand to be straight

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.100 
this is the machi demand to be straight
it<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.239> similar<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> CyanogenMod

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it is very similar to the CyanogenMod

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.380 
it is very similar to the CyanogenMod
but<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> difference<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.210> has<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
but the difference is that it has a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.139 
but the difference is that it has a
little<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.840> additional<00:00:49.350> customizations<00:00:50.160> so

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
little more additional customizations so

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
little more additional customizations so
I<00:00:51.180> already<00:00:51.750> made<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> review<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.739> Santa<00:00:53.070> John

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I already made a review for Santa John

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.729 
I already made a review for Santa John
mod<00:00:53.399> 11<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.969> redmi<00:00:54.480> 2<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.559> one

particular problem with that that is the
video<00:00:58.050> rendering<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.190> accurate<00:00:59.550> but

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
video rendering was not accurate but

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
video rendering was not accurate but

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
video the YouTube video was playing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.200 
video the YouTube video was playing
without<00:01:37.770> any<00:01:37.920> problem<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.880> audio<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
without any problem and the audio is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.889 
without any problem and the audio is
also<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.780> good<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:42.240> some<00:01:42.450> reason<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.869> am

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
also very good so for some reason I am

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.399 
also very good so for some reason I am
not<00:01:43.110> able<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.439> open<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.340> taste<00:01:44.759> oh<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.409> don't

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
not able to open up taste oh I don't

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.200 
not able to open up taste oh I don't
think<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.340> big<00:01:47.670> problem

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
think it's really a very big problem

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690 
think it's really a very big problem
let's<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> cache<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.549> might

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
let's just be at the cache and it might
