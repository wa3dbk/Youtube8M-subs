00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 hello to all new application video 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.790
 of semi-permanent time the nail 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.340
 this brand here this brand here 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.990
 moreover, she has nail and long ago 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.269
 really sent so many products in 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.940
 how much is it not just nails but 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.710
 also treats makeup then slowly 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.300
 now I will begin to make videos on the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.609
 make up of begin to try together 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 then we see a little what they are for now 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.570
 I actually had already tried another 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.219
 of the law in the real the solvents 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.230
 this is even the second one 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.350
 package that I finish with solvent I had 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.059
 lemon yellow Colelli so is this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.969
 here then to the vanilla I have finished 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.760
 I really enjoyed these both 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.950
 solvents here really a lot of solvents 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.930
 for unique then for enamel for it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.969
 traditional enamel now precisely 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.840
 permanent production for now I can 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.629
 say that you have led lamp polymerize 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.879
 and the pre finish here is nice not 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.220
 I call others finish and it would be the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.420
 transparent then base and top 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.310
 very quiet in this case I have 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.659
 chose this tiffany color but it has 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.610
 so the micro glitter is not 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.610
 completely the case are two passes 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 number 280 this I have specifically 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.430
 found a little bit dense show you succeed 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.979
 however to spread thin so it is not 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.189
 that there are permanent seeds 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.250
 they create their own of toys 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.100
 crazy they stretch really double and 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.680
 difficult to spread them thin and homogeneous 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.820
 so at this point however this is here 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.130
 a little bit of the south 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.780
 I think because of the micro glitter because 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.260
 another colors 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.369
 the 3 24 which is this beautiful 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.979
 very beautiful purple and for example it seems to me 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:57.740
 less dense than the one there for example already 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:01.280
 I said it for example then at 2 61 that is 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.350
 a red and are these here are lacquered 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.180
 I think it's the fault of those micro glitter 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.800
 sini who obviously knead it a 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:14.239
 little and the 29 2 that has a news a 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.190
 flyzone field little more scudetto however 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.380
 I will also try the Lazio I will do 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.390
 to know if it was a feature of its own 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.069
 of this here was to have one 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.569
 feature coated semipermanent in 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.880
 general for now for the application not 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.709
 I found problems so we'll stay at 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.200
 see how it behaves I leave you at 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.819
 video a kiss my nails are already 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.410
 walk because I removed the seeds 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.019
 permanent that I had before with the file 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.610
 now I show you a method to remove 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.440
 the cuticles different than that 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.600
 of the previous video game used a 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.310
 product to dissolve them here instead I go 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.720
 to push it back with a gq spin 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.380
 trigone in steel which is therefore a lot 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.049
 very effective and I take then I reject 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.340
 well back strongly without exaggerating 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.290
 obviously and for a soul to go 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.320
 to remove both the cuticle and go 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.150
 to dull that part of nail if 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.820
 your file as in my case is new 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.299
 you can file it with another file 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.160
 edges to make it less sharp for 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.030
 dear initial months ago in short can 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.709
 can be a little annoying here 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.570
 anyway my precise all around 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.090
 cuticles I recommend the whole tour of 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.850
 cole because we know the cuticles 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.750
 they are the first cause of upheavals 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.620
 in the semi permanent reconstruction e 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.600
 company singer in short I trust to do 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.220
 this operation dusted carefully 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.010
 all my nails take gods 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.200
 among many and I apply it over the entire nail 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.620
 on all nails and this dries 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.620
 air 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.450
 I then take the principal would be the base and the top 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.480
 rising the calls it prefers 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.910
 I 'm going to apply transparent precisely 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.470
 as a base, as usual, pulling it a 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:08.180
 little to enamel they feel touch to not 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.920
 touch for the cuticles and repeat 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.540
 to the operation then on all nails 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.130
 obviously I try to get closer to the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.170
 cuticle as much as possible 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.340
 otherwise the regrowth will be seen already on 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.889
 day later small trick I take a 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.710
 dry pad and I'm going to remove some 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.600
 dispersion so this will cause the 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.419
 color wine withdraws once in 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.830
 lamp takes its 80 which is precisely 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.210
 a tiffany color with microphones 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.030
 sterile 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.229
 even here he keeps it a little to enamel and 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.139
 I'm going to apply as before 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:43.270
 trying to putting your own product 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.270
 trying not to touch cuticle skin 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.900
 how do I lay a first pass? 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.210
 on a nail moment five seconds in 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.640
 led lamp pick out outside begins with the 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.890
 second nail the m 5 seconds lamp 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.120
 led and pick out outside this way 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.460
 enamel we started after them 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.479
 then realize and lock a little bit 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.490
 it's not his business 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.110
 finished the first pass on all the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.970
 nails arrived with the second pass 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.400
 I recommend this very important 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.140
 also color the edge of the well 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.130
 free margin without putting too much 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.900
 obviously produced even here I put 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.210
 a pass the ball and a pass one 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.150
 led ball finish with the second pass 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.020
 stingy with again in three finish in 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.340
 this case as top and also here I do 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.080
 they are a pass I recommend 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.000
 then seal well sealing 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.860
 remember to also seal the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.600
 border of the free margin 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.180
 then continue on all the nails for 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.700
 degrease the use of this solvent 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.710
 villa levi in ​​the strawberry which says that 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.240
 it can also be used not only with 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.400
 statins the enamel but also to remove 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.250
 the dispersion and perfume really 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.340
 very much I like a lot and therefore 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.110
 nothing is enough to apply a little oil 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.420
 and massage a little on the whole 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.080
 frost cuticles and 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.080
 the game is done
