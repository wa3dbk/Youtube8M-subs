00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
egotistical but at this point we were

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.360 
egotistical but at this point we were
all<00:04:24.510> getting<00:04:24.810> very<00:04:24.900> competitive<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:26.070> was<00:04:26.220> just

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.260 
eventually we made it and the force and
spirits<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.669> mountains<00:04:50.700> were
