00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.190
 what about film friends oscar yes how 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.380
 Yesterday announced today today 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 I with the bch sun or pcs 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.949
 bing.com is a very good site 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.170
 an international relations 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 I have American side once 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.920
 ordered had problems with the customs 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.599
 That's why I never ordered there again 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.279
 But in general, the products are 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.050
 very good and especially if i am 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.480
 This company also very good optimum 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.730
 nutrition 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.050
 The quality is because we are at the protein 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.829
 similar but of course not nearly 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.360
 so cheap and opened up I will 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.850
 Now just start with it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.250
 every morning five capsules are at five 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.800
 gram 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.809
 why five chapels I have 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.090
 just another after the forest 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.359
 bodybuilders oriented take all 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.330
 five grams of my body data are like that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.330
 I'll be like that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.470
 take on 5 km and let's see if I 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.470
 to find a difference 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.610
 23 45 clock I have a difference 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.430
 determine 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.880
 yes but I can not imagine it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.460
 that you already noticed something right there 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.890
 from muscle building or palling I am in 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.400
 the defi or regeneration but me 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.400
 Let me surprise you 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:50.100
 the apartment is always shit this 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:53.000
 shit was therefor buy it 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.000
 some powder form 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.540
 that sounds like some buy in 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.980
 powder form but I can not recommend 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.780
 because my colleague took that I have 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.580
 the broken and had to go from 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.600
 Alone the odor almost puke 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.810
 So it is extremely disgusting taste 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.750
 The capsules were finally here 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.190
 but swallowing came but always 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.890
 In any case, money making tastes good 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.590
 taste of it me are 400 capsules 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.920
 we can see here that means I will 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.280
 that's why they're testing almost three for 80 days 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.650
 months about as long as mine 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.240
 I still go and you look what I am 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.110
 bring this is my first attempt 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.060
 pcs and I'm curious 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.330
 but then again briefly what pcs 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.770
 are at all and what they should do 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.510
 because I forgot to mention that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.080
 you may also be interested 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.630
 So pcs consist of the three 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.870
 essential amino acids that is 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.040
 ring in 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.560
 elisa people and albania and these 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.690
 Essential amino acids are outstanding 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.670
 because the body does not 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.500
 that means we have to be able to produce 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.240
 Take them over the food 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.970
 and of course they are also in normal 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.550
 food containing protein 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.510
 but in a very small measure and 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.709
 so that we can eat it abundantly 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:30.600
 is the wrong here with half supplement 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.380
 and what the roots are at all 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.930
 the whole 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.980
 one promises oneself thereby here 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.880
 most important times briefly 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.280
 They help you to endurance training 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.810
 during training and at the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.700
 Regeneration of the muscle and together 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.880
 With protein-containing food you can 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.910
 to accelerate the muscles regeneration 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.140
 and the synthesis of proteins andrÃ© is here 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:05.319
 on it and there at the moment I am on one 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.060
 2000 kilocalories I'm taking 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.720
 pretty little food to me 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.150
 That's why my regeneration is natural 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.860
 not nearly as good as we are 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.989
 would not eat much more then then 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.829
 my body would become the nutrients 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.500
 get out that you need and have 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.270
 enough for the regeneration and he has 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.000
 maybe not that what he is 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.990
 needs to grab the field 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.120
 should 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.560
 That's why I'm taking that , too 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.370
 the meaning of the matter but I want 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.840
 generate slower and with which he 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.930
 I hope a faster one with me 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.550
 regeneration what also here on it 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.150
 stands and faster 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.669
 protein synthesis that would mean 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.790
 means would mean a faster 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.940
 I do not expect it to build muscle 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:58.060
 but I expect that the muscle loss 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:00.729
 will not exist and how if I will 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.770
 Feel this and how I feel it 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.140
 Of course, I'll keep you up to date 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.140
 the next weeks
