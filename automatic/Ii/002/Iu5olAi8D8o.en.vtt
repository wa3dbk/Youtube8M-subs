 photographs them the video ones we will watch a video 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.180

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.980
 see from there wi-fi and bluetooth and other options 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.910
 and of course internet 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.570
 the screen you can put it both vertically and horizontally what you 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.930
 facilitates much more navigation on the internet 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.869
 You can also use only

 Ripple to eat through the pages in the most pure style 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:05.350
 report 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.479
 going back to the main screen 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.229

 the screen is kobe gea of ​​the 4 inches 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.909
 smaller than the one in the report 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.989
 In return, it allows you to reduce the size of ESERP more manageable against 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.029
 graphics and photographs look smaller and more complicated 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:44.989

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.129
 watch that playground wi-fi and bluetooth band 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.539

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.139
 down here the connection then alberto 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.009
 they are hidden there

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.419
 someone knows that's why it's going to come out 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.719
 we have also done 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.000
 glove tests 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.350
