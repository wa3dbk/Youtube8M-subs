now it's off like I just pressed forward
once<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.640> walk<00:02:37.910> what<00:02:38.209> if<00:02:38.299> I<00:02:38.590> turn<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.250> all

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
once and I walk what if I turn it on all

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.250 
once and I walk what if I turn it on all
i<00:02:40.790> gotta<00:02:41.060> do<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.209> press<00:02:41.480> forward<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.019> i<00:02:42.110> can

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
i gotta do is press forward and i can

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.500 
i gotta do is press forward and i can
sprint<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.549> I<00:02:43.579> don't<00:02:43.700> got<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.090> keep<00:02:44.209> double

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
sprint so I don't got to keep double

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.539 
sprint so I don't got to keep double
tapping<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.200> probably<00:02:45.530> will<00:02:45.739> use<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.160> so

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
tapping and I probably will use this so

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.970 
tapping and I probably will use this so
it's<00:02:46.880> like<00:02:47.030> better<00:02:47.269> sprint<00:02:47.660> because<00:02:48.410> all<00:02:48.739> that

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
it's like better sprint because all that

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.430 
it's like better sprint because all that
so<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.160> can<00:02:49.310> have<00:02:49.430> my<00:02:49.519> optifine<00:02:49.970> too<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.260> that's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
so I can have my optifine too so that's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.880 
so I can have my optifine too so that's
