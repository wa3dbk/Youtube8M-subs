00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950

happily<00:01:27.799> both<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.040> iphone<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> storm

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
happily both the iphone and the storm

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.330 
happily both the iphone and the storm
have<00:01:30.659> capacitive<00:01:31.500> touchscreens<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.159> them

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
have capacitive touchscreens on them

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.160 
have capacitive touchscreens on them
which<00:01:32.729> makes<00:01:32.939> them<00:01:33.060> very<00:01:33.240> reactive<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:34.020> when

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
which makes them very reactive to when

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.270 
which makes them very reactive to when
you're<00:01:34.290> touching<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.590> screen<00:01:34.860> which<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you're touching the screen which is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.950 
you're touching the screen which is
really<00:01:35.579> nice<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.360> difference<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
really nice the difference with the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.780 
really nice the difference with the
storm<00:01:37.229> over<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.650> iphone<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
storm over the iphone is that this

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.789 
storm over the iphone is that this
actually<00:01:39.000> clicks<00:01:39.570> when<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:40.320> touching<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
actually clicks when you're touching it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.719 
actually clicks when you're touching it
so<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.009> might<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.400> able<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.579> hear

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so you might actually be able to hear

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.300 
so you might actually be able to hear
that<00:01:41.939> even<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.360> slight<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> difference

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that even very slight but the difference

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.370 
that even very slight but the difference
really<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.390> hover<00:01:45.689> over<00:01:46.140> things

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
really is that you can hover over things

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
really is that you can hover over things
on<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.950> storm<00:01:47.250> whereas<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.939> iphone<00:01:48.329> as

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
on the storm whereas on the iphone as

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.569 
on the storm whereas on the iphone as
you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.259> only<00:01:49.290> tap<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.340> if

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you know you can only tap on them so if

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.200 
you know you can only tap on them so if
we<00:01:51.000> take<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> look<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> screen<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:51.990> example

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
we take a look on the screen for example

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.709 
we take a look on the screen for example
let's<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.240> back<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> home<00:01:54.869> screen<00:01:54.899> i<00:01:56.719> can

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
let's go back to the home screen i can

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.050 
let's go back to the home screen i can
actually<00:01:57.930> hover<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:59.159> selects<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.820> item

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
actually hover and that selects an item

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.539 
actually hover and that selects an item
before<00:02:00.270> i<00:02:00.509> click<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.649> go<00:02:01.799> into<00:02:02.070> for

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
before i click to actually go into for

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.880 
before i click to actually go into for
example<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> browser<00:02:03.409> that's<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.770> nice

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
example the browser that's really nice

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.590 
example the browser that's really nice
in<00:02:05.100> some<00:02:05.280> places<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.790> great<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.420> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
in some places it's great to have that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
in some places it's great to have that
extra<00:02:06.869> level<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.560> interaction<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
extra level of interaction with the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210 
extra level of interaction with the
device<00:02:09.349> unfortunately<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.379> typing<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
device unfortunately for typing it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.220 
device unfortunately for typing it
actually<00:02:11.819> makes<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.150> quite<00:02:12.330> slow

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
actually makes it quite slow

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.720 
actually makes it quite slow
you<00:02:13.409> have<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.650> click<00:02:13.890> every<00:02:14.250> time<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.550> want<00:02:14.700> to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
you have to click every time you want to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.670 
you have to click every time you want to
press<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:14.970> letter<00:02:15.269> there's<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.959> bit<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.230> reaction

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
press a letter there's a bit of reaction

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.589 
press a letter there's a bit of reaction
time<00:02:16.860> as<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.159> mechanism<00:02:17.640> pops<00:02:17.879> back<00:02:18.120> out<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
time as the mechanism pops back out and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.180 
time as the mechanism pops back out and
that<00:02:18.959> slows<00:02:19.200> down<00:02:19.440> typing<00:02:19.799> on<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> device

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
that slows down typing on the device

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.430 
that slows down typing on the device
quite<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.549> lot<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.000> also<00:02:21.569> found<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.049> because

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
quite a lot I also found that because

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.110 
quite a lot I also found that because
you<00:02:22.650> can't<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> letter<00:02:23.519> underneath<00:02:23.970> your

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you can't see the letter underneath your

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.300 
you can't see the letter underneath your
finger<00:02:24.420> even<00:02:25.019> though<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.440> does<00:02:25.650> actually<00:02:25.860> glow

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
finger even though it does actually glow

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.949 
finger even though it does actually glow
before<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:26.819> press<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.540> actually<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
before you press it it's actually a

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.420 
before you press it it's actually a
little<00:02:28.080> bit<00:02:28.260> more<00:02:28.379> difficult<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.950> press<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
little bit more difficult to press the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.770 
little bit more difficult to press the
right<00:02:29.549> letter<00:02:29.819> than<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.239> on<00:02:30.269> an<00:02:30.450> iPhone

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
right letter than it is on an iPhone

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.180 
right letter than it is on an iPhone
where<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.049> letter<00:02:31.200> pops<00:02:31.470> up<00:02:31.650> above<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.129> you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
where the letter pops up above so you

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.580 
where the letter pops up above so you
can<00:02:32.370> see<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.640> around<00:02:32.849> your<00:02:33.030> hand<00:02:33.590> overall

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
can see it around your hand overall

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.110 
can see it around your hand overall
impressions<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.129> device<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.760> really

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
impressions of the device it's really

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640 
impressions of the device it's really
pretty<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.599> look<00:02:36.750> at<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.230> running<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
pretty to look at it's running the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.080 
pretty to look at it's running the
latest<00:02:37.769> BlackBerry<00:02:38.280> OS<00:02:38.340> same<00:02:38.760> thing<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.000> you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
latest BlackBerry OS same thing that you

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.270 
latest BlackBerry OS same thing that you
find<00:02:39.299> on<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.989> bold<00:02:40.200> or<00:02:40.379> on<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.010> new

find on this on the bold or on the new
javelin<00:02:41.730> which<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.569> really<00:02:42.780> nice<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.170> look<00:02:43.349> at

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
javelin which is really nice to look at

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.339 
javelin which is really nice to look at
but<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.400> storm<00:02:44.790> needs<00:02:45.480> more<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.930> an<00:02:46.019> interface

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
but the storm needs more of an interface

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.630 
but the storm needs more of an interface
that's<00:02:46.590> built<00:02:46.829> around<00:02:46.950> touch<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
that's built around touch and the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.640 
that's built around touch and the
BlackBerry<00:02:48.390> OS<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.840> really<00:02:49.170> optimized<00:02:49.590> for

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
BlackBerry OS is really optimized for

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.960 
BlackBerry OS is really optimized for
people<00:02:49.920> who<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.099> using<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.459> keyboard<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
people who are using a keyboard on the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
people who are using a keyboard on the
blackberry<00:02:51.299> menu<00:02:51.629> or<00:02:51.750> trackball<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.980> think

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
blackberry menu or trackball so I think

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.710 
blackberry menu or trackball so I think
what<00:02:53.459> we'll<00:02:53.609> hopefully<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.269> in<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> next

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
what we'll hopefully see in the next

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.860 
what we'll hopefully see in the next
revision<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.349> lot<00:02:55.620> more<00:02:55.829> touch<00:02:56.329> touch<00:02:57.329> aware

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
revision is a lot more touch touch aware

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.020 
revision is a lot more touch touch aware
interface<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.890> OS<00:02:59.129> right<00:02:59.730> now<00:02:59.849> it's

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
