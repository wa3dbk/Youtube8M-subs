what<00:00:00.780> I'm<00:00:00.930> finding<00:00:01.260> in<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.879> lateral<00:00:03.300> surface

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
what I'm finding in the lateral surface

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.600 
what I'm finding in the lateral surface
of<00:00:05.270> the<00:00:06.270> gastrocnemius<00:00:07.069> muscle<00:00:08.069> over<00:00:08.220> here

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
of the gastrocnemius muscle over here

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.650 
of the gastrocnemius muscle over here
which<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.030> large<00:00:09.750> muscle<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.559> calf<00:00:10.769> is

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
which is the large muscle of the calf is

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.919 
which is the large muscle of the calf is
a<00:00:12.660> taut<00:00:13.290> band<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.920> muscle<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.400> fact<00:00:14.750> you<00:00:15.750> can

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
a taut band of muscle in fact you can

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.550 
a taut band of muscle in fact you can
almost<00:00:16.199> see<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.490> muscle<00:00:18.029> spring<00:00:18.960> away<00:00:19.230> from

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
almost see that muscle spring away from

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.820 
almost see that muscle spring away from
my<00:00:19.740> hand<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:23.449> I'm<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:26.150> seek<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.830> trigger

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
my hand and I'm going to seek a trigger

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.609 
my hand and I'm going to seek a trigger
point<00:00:29.300> sometimes<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:31.080> might<00:00:31.289> hit<00:00:31.560> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
initially and it's very sharp and to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.549 
initially and it's very sharp and to
reposition<00:00:35.850> your<00:00:36.149> hand<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.780> you're<00:00:37.020> very

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
reposition your hand so you're very

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
reposition your hand so you're very
secure<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.640> spot<00:00:38.969> you'll<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> come

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
secure on the spot you'll have to come

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.290 
secure on the spot you'll have to come
back<00:00:39.809> around<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.469> find<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.640> again<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
back around and find it again and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.029 
back around and find it again and
sometimes<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.440> sharp<00:00:44.180> now

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
sometimes it's not as sharp now

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.880 
sometimes it's not as sharp now
frequently<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.579> won't<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.590> strong<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
frequently you won't get as strong a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.880 
frequently you won't get as strong a
response<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:51.350> that<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.879> ok

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
response as that but if you do it's ok

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.729 
response as that but if you do it's ok
reassure<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.160> client<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.449> you're<00:00:58.109> doing

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
hand find the spot and apply the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.149 
hand find the spot and apply the
pressure<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:07.640> we're<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> hold<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:10.159> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
pressure and we're going to hold it you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.789 
pressure and we're going to hold it you
can<00:01:11.369> ask<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.810> level<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> discomfort

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
can ask them what level of discomfort

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.080 
can ask them what level of discomfort
using<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.760> scale<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.210> 1<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> 10<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> client<00:01:17.700> what

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
using a scale of 1 to 10 so client what

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.670 
using a scale of 1 to 10 so client what
are<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.420> experiencing<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:23.479> okay<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:25.049> right

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
are we experiencing here okay all right

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.210 
are we experiencing here okay all right
so<00:01:26.369> sometimes<00:01:27.299> trigger<00:01:27.630> points<00:01:28.140> are<00:01:28.320> mildly

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.890 

sensitive<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> sometimes<00:01:33.060> they're<00:01:33.390> very

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
sensitive and sometimes they're very

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.580 
sensitive and sometimes they're very
sensitive

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
sensitive

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.469 
sensitive
once<00:01:34.860> again<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.579> might<00:01:36.119> repeat<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:38.210> two<00:01:39.210> or

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
once again I might repeat that two or

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.899 
once again I might repeat that two or
three<00:01:39.509> times<00:01:42.680> I'm<00:01:43.680> applying<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.729> more

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
three times I'm applying a little more

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.880 
three times I'm applying a little more
pressure<00:01:46.189> what<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.430> does<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.899> releases

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
pressure what this does is it releases

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.450 
pressure what this does is it releases
the<00:01:50.880> fibers<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.530> there<00:01:52.560> under

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the fibers that are right there under

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.100 
the fibers that are right there under
your<00:01:53.490> thumb<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:56.009> puts<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.060> muscle<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
your thumb it puts the muscle into a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.190 
your thumb it puts the muscle into a
stretch<00:01:58.740> and<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:01.259> communicates<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
stretch and it communicates to the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.610 
stretch and it communicates to the
muscle<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.219> relax
