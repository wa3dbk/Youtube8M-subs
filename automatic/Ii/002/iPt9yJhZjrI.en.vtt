side the left side and the reason for

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.030 
side the left side and the reason for
this<00:02:09.540> I<00:02:09.780> believe<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:10.560> they<00:02:10.709> were<00:02:10.770> made

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
this I believe is that they were made

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.830 
this I believe is that they were made
that<00:02:11.190> way<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> make<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.820> easier<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.600> right

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that way to make it easier for the right

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.660 
that way to make it easier for the right
hand<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.230> mates<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.709> dress<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.280> women<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
hand and mates to dress the women of the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.640 
hand and mates to dress the women of the
household<00:02:15.060> men<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.140> other<00:02:16.170> hand<00:02:16.470> were

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
household men on the other hand were

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.410 
household men on the other hand were
expected<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.190> dress<00:02:17.340> themselves<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.000> since

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
expected to dress themselves and since

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.210 
expected to dress themselves and since
most<00:02:18.600> men<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:19.020> right-handed<00:02:19.590> we<00:02:19.830> ended<00:02:20.130> up

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
most men are right-handed we ended up

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.070 
most men are right-handed we ended up
with<00:02:20.430> shirts<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:21.209> buttons<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> right

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
with shirts with buttons on the right

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.780 
with shirts with buttons on the right
side<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.620> when<00:02:22.950> placing<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> shirt<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
side so when placing the shirt on the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.550 
side so when placing the shirt on the
ironing<00:02:24.060> board<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.360> important<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.200> side

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
ironing board is important that the side

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.560 
ironing board is important that the side
seam<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.100> shirt<00:02:26.190> Alliance<00:02:27.060> against<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
tension as this can be quite hard to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.800 
tension as this can be quite hard to
iron<00:02:37.590> flat<00:02:37.920> also<00:02:38.550> we<00:02:38.880> make<00:02:39.030> sure<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.209> iron<00:02:39.540> in

side we shift to shirt over once again

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.610 
side we shift to shirt over once again

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
here on the back and chances are that

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.350 
here on the back and chances are that
your<00:03:26.140> shirt<00:03:26.440> might<00:03:26.830> as<00:03:26.980> well<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.000> best<00:03:28.150> way

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
your shirt might as well so the best way

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.030 
your shirt might as well so the best way
I've<00:03:28.540> found<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.930> tackle<00:03:29.320> these<00:03:29.470> pleats<00:03:29.770> are

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
I've found to tackle these pleats are

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.490 
I've found to tackle these pleats are
actually<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.520> iron<00:03:30.670> into<00:03:31.120> them<00:03:31.270> while<00:03:31.870> slowly

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
actually to iron into them while slowly

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.860 
actually to iron into them while slowly
and<00:03:32.950> gently<00:03:33.160> wiggling<00:03:33.640> your<00:03:34.000> spine<00:03:34.480> from<00:03:34.810> side

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
and gently wiggling your spine from side

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.080 
and gently wiggling your spine from side
to<00:03:35.170> side<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:36.100> when<00:03:36.340> we're<00:03:36.490> done<00:03:36.700> with<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.940> back

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
to side so when we're done with the back

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.910 
to side so when we're done with the back
we<00:03:37.330> shift<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.600> shirt<00:03:37.810> over<00:03:38.110> again<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.530> we

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
we shift to shirt over again and we

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:49.670 
we shift to shirt over again and we
focus<00:03:39.280> on<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.550> left<00:03:39.730> front<00:03:40.000> side

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.110 

so<00:03:50.680> once<00:03:50.890> we're<00:03:51.069> done<00:03:51.220> Arni<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.700> left<00:03:51.909> front

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
so once we're done Arni the left front

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.729 
so once we're done Arni the left front
side<00:03:52.299> we<00:03:52.569> seem<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.780> grab<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.170> top<00:03:53.379> and<00:03:53.620> bottom

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
of the front placket and place it

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.920

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.960 

so<00:07:17.830> the<00:07:17.950> reason<00:07:18.220> why<00:07:18.340> a<00:07:18.370> button<00:07:18.760> of<00:07:18.820> these

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
so the reason why a button of these

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.850 
so the reason why a button of these
buttons<00:07:19.390> is<00:07:19.630> because<00:07:20.020> it<00:07:20.140> helps<00:07:20.290> keep<00:07:20.680> the

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
buttons is because it helps keep the

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.220 
buttons is because it helps keep the
shape<00:07:21.070> of<00:07:21.550> the<00:07:21.700> color<00:07:21.940> as<00:07:22.480> well<00:07:22.540> as<00:07:22.930> it<00:07:23.050> helps

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.230 
shape of the color as well as it helps

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.350 
shape of the color as well as it helps
prevent<00:07:23.740> the<00:07:24.070> shirt<00:07:24.430> from<00:07:24.610> getting<00:07:24.970> wrinkly
