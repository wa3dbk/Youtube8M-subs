00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
the two times i watch it there i just i

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.709 
the two times i watch it there i just i
think<00:02:03.070> i<00:02:03.520> was<00:02:03.700> thinking<00:02:03.999> of<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:04.329> many<00:02:04.479> things

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
think i was thinking of so many things

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.989 
think i was thinking of so many things
that<00:02:04.810> could<00:02:05.289> have<00:02:05.439> done<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.729> i<00:02:06.759> should

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
that could have done and that i should

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.399 
that could have done and that i should
have<00:02:07.090> done<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.390> i'm<00:02:07.570> not<00:02:07.749> using<00:02:07.929> any<00:02:08.140> kill

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
have done so i'm not using any kill

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.809 
have done so i'm not using any kill
streaks<00:02:08.679> here<00:02:08.800> by<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.009> way<00:02:09.190> if<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.519> seen<00:02:09.670> that

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
streaks here by the way if you seen that

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.670 
streaks here by the way if you seen that
come<00:02:10.000> up<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.360> just<00:02:10.750> have<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:10.929> simply<00:02:11.440> for<00:02:11.620> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
come up and just have it simply for the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.660 
come up and just have it simply for the
fact<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:12.040> if<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.400> do<00:02:12.459> die<00:02:12.849> then<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.150> just<00:02:13.360> go

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
fact that if I do die then I just go

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.070 
fact that if I do die then I just go
use<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:14.000> because<00:02:14.090> there's<00:02:14.300> no<00:02:14.450> point<00:02:14.720> anyway

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
use it because there's no point anyway

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.630 
use it because there's no point anyway
anymore<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.650> might<00:02:15.980> as<00:02:16.040> well<00:02:16.069> still<00:02:16.310> get<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.490> good

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
anymore I might as well still get a good

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.000 
anymore I might as well still get a good
game<00:02:16.819> out<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.840> that's<00:02:18.200> reason<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
game out of it so that's reason for the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.210 
game out of it so that's reason for the
killstreaks<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:20.540> um<00:02:21.050> basically<00:02:21.440> at<00:02:22.010> this

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
killstreaks but um basically at this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.150
