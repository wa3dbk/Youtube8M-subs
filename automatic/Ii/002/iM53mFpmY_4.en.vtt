00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
force to insert your nav card so

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.310 
force to insert your nav card so
basically<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.360> pick<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:15.929> radio

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
source which is the last piece which

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.749 
source which is the last piece which
would<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:39.960> nav<00:01:40.170> card<00:01:40.560> reader<00:01:41.189> table

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
would get your nav card reader table

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.999 
would get your nav card reader table
going<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:43.020> tip<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.590> jump<00:01:43.829> off

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
going and a little tip you can jump off

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.560 
going and a little tip you can jump off
of<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.460> instead<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> way
