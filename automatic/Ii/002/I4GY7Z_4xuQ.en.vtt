tea and in today's video we're working

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.970 
tea and in today's video we're working
on<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> speedboat<00:00:14.280> system<00:00:15.059> BAM<00:00:15.560> alright<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.800> I'm

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
on a speedboat system BAM alright so I'm

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.529 
on a speedboat system BAM alright so I'm
yes<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.730> know<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.029> everybody<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.390> complaining

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
yes you know so everybody is complaining

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.929 
yes you know so everybody is complaining
about<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.260> minecarts<00:00:19.890> being<00:00:20.189> slow<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
about the minecarts being slow and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.620 
about the minecarts being slow and
whatnot<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.660> someone<00:00:22.410> Sunday<00:00:23.250> night<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.730> try

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
whatnot and someone Sunday night I try

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.210 
whatnot and someone Sunday night I try
to<00:00:24.660> come<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.140> way<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.320> travel<00:00:25.650> faster

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to come up with a way to travel faster

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.089 
to come up with a way to travel faster
than<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> mine<00:00:26.939> cards<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> did<00:00:28.349> at

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
than the mine cards and so I did at

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.179 
than the mine cards and so I did at
least<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.400> think<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.670> did<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.060> then<00:00:30.779> um<00:00:31.109> then<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
least I think I did and then um then I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.389 
least I think I did and then um then I
wake<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:32.399> Monday<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.620> yeah<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.890> Jay<00:00:35.070> gave<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
wake up Monday and yeah for Jay gave it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.490 
wake up Monday and yeah for Jay gave it
to<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> outcry<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.480> they're<00:00:36.660> gonna<00:00:36.750> speed<00:00:37.260> V

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
to the outcry and they're gonna speed V

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.799 
to the outcry and they're gonna speed V
boats<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:38.040> by<00:00:38.550> two<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:40.050> regardless<00:00:41.010> i<00:00:41.280> already

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
boats up by two so regardless i already

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
boats up by two so regardless i already
did<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.469> doing<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> video<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
did this so I'm just doing a video on it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
did this so I'm just doing a video on it
anyways<00:00:44.910> who<00:00:45.090> cares<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.989> basically<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.530> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
anyways who cares so basically this is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.270 
anyways who cares so basically this is
all<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:48.680> basically<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.770> water<00:00:50.010> flow

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
all of this it is basically a water flow

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
all of this it is basically a water flow
with<00:00:50.460> pressure<00:00:50.730> plates<00:00:51.059> for<00:00:51.480> apart<00:00:51.899> from<00:00:51.960> each

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
with pressure plates for apart from each

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.520 
with pressure plates for apart from each
other<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.940> then<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.840> up<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.230> boat<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
other and then you up in your boat and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.340 
other and then you up in your boat and
then<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.730> goes<00:00:56.879> fast<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.570> crap<00:00:57.750> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
then you go and it goes fast as crap you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
then you go and it goes fast as crap you
see<00:00:58.530> this<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.320> probably<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> break<00:01:02.239> no

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
see this and it's probably a break no

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.670 
see this and it's probably a break no
there<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.539> go<00:01:03.629> we're<00:01:03.780> good<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.559> yeah

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
there we go we're good but yeah

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.530 
there we go we're good but yeah
basically<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> system<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.420> was

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
basically this is the system as I was

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
basically this is the system as I was
looking<00:01:06.960> at<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.380> don't<00:01:07.560> know<00:01:07.619> I'm<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.280> big

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
looking at it I don't know I'm not big

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
looking at it I don't know I'm not big
on<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:09.740> m/s<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.830> actually<00:01:11.340> trying<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.270> race

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
on like m/s and actually trying to race

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.480 
on like m/s and actually trying to race
it<00:01:13.350> against<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.880> card<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.090> its<00:01:15.240> current<00:01:15.509> state

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
it against the card in its current state

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
it against the card in its current state
but<00:01:17.490> regardless<00:01:18.060> i<00:01:18.299> believe<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.869> faster

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
but regardless i believe this is faster

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
but regardless i believe this is faster
than<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> current<00:01:19.830> card<00:01:20.159> speed<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.790> don't

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
than the current card speed and I don't

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.160 
than the current card speed and I don't
know<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.119> it'll<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.330> faster<00:01:21.810> than<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> other

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
know if it'll be faster than the other

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
know if it'll be faster than the other
card<00:01:22.470> speeds<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.540> we're

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
card speeds but this is what we're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.679 
card speeds but this is what we're
building<00:01:24.750> today<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.320> extremely<00:01:25.979> simple

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
building today it's extremely simple

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
building today it's extremely simple
only<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.020> basically<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.470> four<00:01:29.100> wide<00:01:29.460> lane

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
only this is basically a four wide lane

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.219 
only this is basically a four wide lane
I<00:01:30.270> tried<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.869> two<00:01:31.140> maybe<00:01:31.530> three<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.040> work

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
I tried like two maybe three will work

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.310 
I tried like two maybe three will work
but<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.619> breaking<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.040> boats<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.610> too<00:01:36.320> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
but it was breaking the boats on too so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.480 
but it was breaking the boats on too so
you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.920> said<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.310> we're

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you know I just said you know we're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.030 
you know I just said you know we're
doing<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.590> doing<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:40.979> just

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
doing for and then all I'm doing is just

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.179 
doing for and then all I'm doing is just
putting<00:01:41.579> pressure<00:01:41.880> plates<00:01:42.270> down<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:43.189> spaced

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
putting pressure plates down in spaced

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.620 
putting pressure plates down in spaced
far<00:01:44.670> apart<00:01:44.790> now<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.720> tried<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> spacing<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.329> two<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
far apart now I tried a spacing of two I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.770 
far apart now I tried a spacing of two I
think<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.600> just

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
think or was it one and then I just

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.960 
think or was it one and then I just
defaulted<00:01:52.320> before<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.280> honestly<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.700> didn't

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
defaulted before so honestly I didn't

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
defaulted before so honestly I didn't
like<00:01:54.090> completely<00:01:54.630> try<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.110> find<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.500> what's

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
like completely try to find out what's

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.980 
like completely try to find out what's
the<00:01:55.890> fastest<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> separation<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.509> three

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the fastest like a separation of three

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.340 
the fastest like a separation of three
or<00:01:58.320> two<00:01:59.219> or<00:01:59.549> whatever<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> guess<00:02:00.930> maybe<00:02:01.170> you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
or two or whatever so I guess maybe you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
or two or whatever so I guess maybe you
guys<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.590> play<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:03.119> beyond<00:02:03.360> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
guys can play with that but beyond that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
guys can play with that but beyond that
it's<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> bunch<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.200> source<00:02:04.409> blocks<00:02:04.740> here

risk of actually hitting the wall and

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.379 
risk of actually hitting the wall and
you're<00:02:26.069> breaking<00:02:26.670> your<00:02:26.700> boat<00:02:26.969> then<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.239> can

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
you're breaking your boat then you can

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.929 
you're breaking your boat then you can
just<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.689> the<00:02:27.810> whole<00:02:27.989> thing<00:02:28.019> like<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:29.700> this

just do the whole thing like like this
would<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.269> pressure<00:02:30.599> plates<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.170> then

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
would just pressure plates and then

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.140 
would just pressure plates and then
you'll<00:02:31.799> your<00:02:32.129> your<00:02:32.310> boat<00:02:32.549> will<00:02:32.760> pretty<00:02:33.060> much

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
you'll your your boat will pretty much

you'll your your boat will pretty much
be<00:02:33.299> safe<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.200> entire<00:02:34.500> time<00:02:35.629> but<00:02:36.629> yeah<00:02:36.750> let's

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
be safe the entire time but yeah let's

be safe the entire time but yeah let's
see<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.329> then<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.629> same<00:02:39.840> thing<00:02:40.019> here<00:02:40.200> just

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
see and then the same thing here just

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:46.069 
see and then the same thing here just
source<00:02:40.650> blocks<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:45.079> and

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
source blocks like that like that and

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.199 
source blocks like that like that and
they<00:02:46.919> are<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.310> repeating<00:02:47.639> the<00:02:48.000> process

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
they are just repeating the process
