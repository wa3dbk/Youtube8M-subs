ropes and salary welcome to my workshop
I<00:00:17.410> had<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.439> saddle<00:00:18.770> come<00:00:19.070> in<00:00:19.220> recently<00:00:19.640> that<00:00:20.000> has

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
I had a saddle come in recently that has

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.749 
I had a saddle come in recently that has
a<00:00:20.270> broken<00:00:20.930> tree<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:22.160> tree<00:00:22.310> needs<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:22.640> be

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
a broken tree and the tree needs to be

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.650 
a broken tree and the tree needs to be
replaced<00:00:23.090> I<00:00:23.509> just<00:00:24.230> got<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.500> new<00:00:24.650> tree<00:00:24.919> in<00:00:25.130> and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
replaced I just got the new tree in and

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.240 
replaced I just got the new tree in and
as<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:26.810> was<00:00:26.930> starting<00:00:27.320> to<00:00:27.349> put<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.710> webbings<00:00:28.070> in

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
as I was starting to put the webbings in

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.589 
as I was starting to put the webbings in
I<00:00:28.279> thought<00:00:28.579> hey<00:00:28.820> maybe<00:00:29.029> it<00:00:29.119> would<00:00:29.210> be<00:00:29.329> a<00:00:29.360> good

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
I thought hey maybe it would be a good

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.190 
I thought hey maybe it would be a good
opportunity<00:00:30.590> to<00:00:31.009> show<00:00:31.509> some<00:00:32.509> of<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.809> little

bit<00:00:33.320> about<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:34.280> beginning<00:00:35.000> stages<00:00:35.270> of<00:00:35.480> a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
bit about the beginning stages of a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.319 
bit about the beginning stages of a
saddle<00:00:36.050> construction<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:36.860> how<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.969> weddings

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
saddle construction and how the weddings

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.350 
saddle construction and how the weddings
are<00:00:38.450> put<00:00:38.630> in<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.730> we'll<00:00:40.730> go<00:00:40.850> from<00:00:40.969> there<00:00:41.180> and

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
are put in and we'll go from there and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.240 
are put in and we'll go from there and
maybe<00:00:41.480> do<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.899> few<00:00:42.079> more<00:00:42.170> videos<00:00:42.589> as<00:00:42.920> I<00:00:43.070> go

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
maybe do a few more videos as I go

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.639 
maybe do a few more videos as I go
through<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:43.579> project<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:44.809> show<00:00:45.019> you<00:00:45.079> some<00:00:45.530> of

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
through this project to show you some of

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.270 
through this project to show you some of
the<00:00:45.710> ways<00:00:46.179> or<00:00:47.179> some<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.719> partner<00:00:48.410> process

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
the ways or some of the partner process

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.630 
the ways or some of the partner process
of<00:00:49.429> saddle<00:00:49.789> construction<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.249> let's<00:00:52.249> get<00:00:52.460> the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
of saddle construction so let's get the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.489 
of saddle construction so let's get the
camera<00:00:53.179> over<00:00:53.480> close<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:53.960> workbench<00:00:54.260> here

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
camera over close to the workbench here

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:03.810 
camera over close to the workbench here
and<00:00:54.649> I'll<00:00:54.710> show<00:00:54.859> you<00:00:54.890> some<00:00:55.219> of<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.399> new<00:00:55.550> trees

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.320 

there's<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.570> nutria<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:05.260> saddle<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.090> we'll

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
there's the nutria the saddle and we'll

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.940 
there's the nutria the saddle and we'll
zoom<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.690> a<00:01:07.720> little<00:01:07.840> bit<00:01:07.990> closer<00:01:08.290> here<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.830> get

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
zoom in a little bit closer here and get

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.820 
zoom in a little bit closer here and get
a<00:01:08.980> little<00:01:09.130> bit<00:01:09.250> closer<00:01:09.520> look<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:11.620> can

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
a little bit closer look and as you can

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.430 
a little bit closer look and as you can
see<00:01:11.890> there's<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.000> stirrup<00:01:13.360> bar<00:01:13.570> and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
see there's the stirrup bar and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.010 
see there's the stirrup bar and
everything<00:01:15.070> else<00:01:15.370> basically<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.750> tree

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
everything else basically of the tree

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.660 
everything else basically of the tree
that<00:01:17.050> you<00:01:17.320> never<00:01:17.740> see<00:01:18.070> this<00:01:18.370> is<00:01:18.520> all

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
that you never see this is all

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.270 
that you never see this is all
underneath<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.650> seat<00:01:20.650> of<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.860> saddle

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
underneath the the seat of the saddle

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.790 
underneath the the seat of the saddle
and<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.450> bottom<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.140> it's<00:01:23.320> covered<00:01:23.590> with<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
and the bottom and it's covered with the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.560 
and the bottom and it's covered with the
panel<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.280> saddle<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:25.120> never<00:01:25.270> get<00:01:25.420> to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
panel of the saddle so you never get to

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.210 
panel of the saddle so you never get to
really<00:01:25.690> see<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:28.150> close<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.720> personal

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.950 

this<00:01:33.220> saddle<00:01:33.700> tree<00:01:33.940> is<00:01:34.000> for<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.300> jump<00:01:34.720> large

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
this saddle tree is for a jump large

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.190 
this saddle tree is for a jump large
jumping<00:01:35.470> saddle<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:37.600> going<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.780> take<00:01:37.990> you

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
jumping saddle and I'm going to take you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.570 
jumping saddle and I'm going to take you
in<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.320> little<00:01:38.380> bit<00:01:38.560> closer<00:01:38.800> still<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.430> show

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
in a little bit closer still and show

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.370 
in a little bit closer still and show
you<00:01:39.640> some<00:01:39.910> of<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.090> details<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.930> tree<00:01:41.140> here

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
you some of the details of the tree here

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.310 
you some of the details of the tree here
as<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.830> get<00:01:42.280> into<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.950> way<00:01:45.100> it's<00:01:45.250> made<00:01:46.320> you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
as we get into the the way it's made you

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.390 
as we get into the the way it's made you
can<00:01:47.500> see<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.009> steel<00:01:49.000> plate<00:01:49.360> running<00:01:50.050> through

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
can see the steel plate running through

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.680 
can see the steel plate running through
the<00:01:51.400> front<00:01:51.640> of<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.820> saddle<00:01:52.060> it's<00:01:52.390> called<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
the front of the saddle it's called the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.450 
the front of the saddle it's called the
gullet<00:01:52.990> plate<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.740> that's<00:01:53.830> what<00:01:53.979> gives<00:01:54.220> the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
gullet plate and that's what gives the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.600 
gullet plate and that's what gives the
shape<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.540> strength<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.550> front<00:01:57.550> of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
shape and the strength to the front of

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.040 
shape and the strength to the front of
the<00:01:57.700> saddle<00:01:57.910> that<00:01:58.090> goes<00:01:58.330> up<00:01:58.479> over<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.720> withers

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
the saddle that goes up over the withers

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.790 
the saddle that goes up over the withers
of<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.290> horse<00:01:59.500> and<00:02:00.840> behind<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:01.930> little<00:02:02.560> tiny

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
of the horse and behind that little tiny

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.410 
of the horse and behind that little tiny
skinny<00:02:03.100> plate<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.700> can<00:02:03.850> see<00:02:04.060> that's<00:02:04.240> a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
skinny plate you can see that's a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.450 
skinny plate you can see that's a
secondary<00:02:04.899> reinforcement<00:02:05.680> that's<00:02:06.070> added

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
secondary reinforcement that's added

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.040 
secondary reinforcement that's added
just<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.700> give<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.910> little<00:02:07.090> extra<00:02:07.420> strength<00:02:07.780> to

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
just to give a little extra strength to

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.900 
just to give a little extra strength to
the<00:02:08.170> front<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.560> saddle<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:09.550> hopefully

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
the front of the saddle to hopefully

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.570 
the front of the saddle to hopefully
help<00:02:10.060> prevent<00:02:10.479> any<00:02:10.570> any<00:02:11.260> chance<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.400> tree

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
help prevent any any chance of the tree

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.850 
help prevent any any chance of the tree
breaking<00:02:12.940> through<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.269> through<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.230> pummel

can come out and a new plate be riveted

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.630 
can come out and a new plate be riveted
and<00:02:29.049> in<00:02:29.110> place<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.769> it's<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.100> little<00:02:30.250> bit<00:02:30.459> of<00:02:30.580> a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
and in place and it's a little bit of a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.370 
and in place and it's a little bit of a
project<00:02:31.150> kind<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.570> kind<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.140> muscle

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
project kind of a kind of a muscle

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.620 
project kind of a kind of a muscle
project<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.100> takes<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.430> lot<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.910> lot<00:02:34.600> of

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
project it takes a lot of a lot of

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.289 
project it takes a lot of a lot of
strength<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:35.140> get<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.470> done<00:02:35.709> but<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:37.120> is

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
strength to get it done but it is

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.970 
strength to get it done but it is
something<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:37.720> can<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:38.049> done<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.410> hopefully

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
something that can be done and hopefully

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.860 
something that can be done and hopefully
to<00:02:39.130> prevent<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.060> from<00:02:40.090> having<00:02:40.299> to<00:02:40.630> have<00:02:40.750> an

to prevent you from having to have an

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.740 
to prevent you from having to have an

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
entirely new tree put in the saddle this

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.470 
entirely new tree put in the saddle this
case<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.709> saddle<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.160> I've<00:02:45.280> got<00:02:45.519> now<00:02:45.730> it's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
case the saddle that I've got now it's

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.600 
case the saddle that I've got now it's
broken<00:02:46.720> right<00:02:46.959> here<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.530> seat<00:02:47.799> and<00:02:48.010> that's

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
broken right here in the seat and that's

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.910 
broken right here in the seat and that's
a<00:02:48.730> very<00:02:48.940> difficult<00:02:49.120> thing<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.600> repair<00:02:50.500> so

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
a very difficult thing to repair so

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.680 
a very difficult thing to repair so
that's<00:02:51.190> where<00:02:51.610> we're<00:02:51.790> going<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:52.090> replace<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
that's where we're going to replace the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.930 
that's where we're going to replace the
tree<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.860> can<00:02:54.010> see<00:02:54.190> as<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.430> bring<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.670> tree

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
tree you can see as I bring the tree

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.539 
tree you can see as I bring the tree
around<00:02:55.209> here<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:56.400> construction<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.910> the

side those are the springs that's where
you<00:03:11.049> hear<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.410> term<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.889> spring<00:03:12.190> tree

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
you hear the term of the spring tree

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.699 
you hear the term of the spring tree
when<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.359> flex<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.810> tree<00:03:14.200> from<00:03:14.380> front<00:03:14.680> to

back<00:03:14.799> those<00:03:15.639> little<00:03:16.030> Springs<00:03:16.329> are<00:03:16.510> going<00:03:16.660> to

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
back those little Springs are going to

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.640 
back those little Springs are going to
give<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:16.989> little<00:03:17.200> bit

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
give a little bit

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.229 
give a little bit
give<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.890> saddle<00:03:18.250> some<00:03:18.430> springiness<00:03:18.909> or

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
give the saddle some springiness or

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.210 
give the saddle some springiness or
flexibility<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:23.620> look<00:03:23.769> at<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:23.980> top<00:03:24.189> of

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
flexibility if you look at the top of

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.470 
flexibility if you look at the top of
the<00:03:24.459> tree<00:03:25.360> here<00:03:25.689> you'll<00:03:26.200> see<00:03:27.150> another<00:03:28.150> plate

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
the tree here you'll see another plate

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.089 
the tree here you'll see another plate
on<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.720> top<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.290> that's<00:03:29.379> another<00:03:29.739> piece<00:03:30.040> of

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
on the top and that's another piece of

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.140 
on the top and that's another piece of
steel<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.629> is<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> little<00:03:32.560> bit<00:03:32.680> finer<00:03:33.670> lighter

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
steel this is a little bit finer lighter

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.910 
steel this is a little bit finer lighter
weight<00:03:34.420> steel<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:34.989> really<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.349> just<00:03:35.379> meant<00:03:35.799> to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
weight steel and really is just meant to

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.309 
weight steel and really is just meant to
hold<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.250> rivet<00:03:36.519> head<00:03:36.670> so<00:03:36.909> that<00:03:37.060> when<00:03:37.180> you

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
hold the rivet head so that when you

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.929 
hold the rivet head so that when you
clench<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.500> rivet<00:03:38.739> heads<00:03:38.920> down<00:03:39.189> tight<00:03:39.670> they

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
clench the rivet heads down tight they

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.690 
clench the rivet heads down tight they
don't<00:03:40.120> sink<00:03:40.750> into<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.079> wood<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.379> the<00:03:41.409> tree<00:03:41.700> and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
don't sink into the wood of the tree and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.630 
don't sink into the wood of the tree and
there<00:03:42.909> wouldn't<00:03:43.150> be<00:03:43.209> as<00:03:43.359> much<00:03:43.569> strength<00:03:43.959> of

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
there wouldn't be as much strength of

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.849 
there wouldn't be as much strength of
rivet<00:03:45.640> head<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.450> wood<00:03:46.750> as<00:03:46.959> there<00:03:47.140> would<00:03:47.260> be<00:03:47.319> of

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
rivet head in wood as there would be of

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.270 
rivet head in wood as there would be of
it<00:03:48.609> being<00:03:48.790> supported<00:03:49.269> by<00:03:49.299> metal<00:03:50.099> there's<00:03:51.099> the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
it being supported by metal there's the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.750 
it being supported by metal there's the
stirrup<00:03:51.609> bar<00:03:53.159> so<00:03:54.159> that's<00:03:54.340> what<00:03:54.459> they<00:03:54.549> look

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
stirrup bar so that's what they look

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.099 
stirrup bar so that's what they look
like<00:03:54.790> before<00:03:55.629> they<00:03:55.780> go<00:03:55.930> into<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.409> saddle<00:03:57.190> and

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
like before they go into the saddle and

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.729 
like before they go into the saddle and
over<00:03:59.109> here<00:04:00.959> standing<00:04:01.959> up<00:04:02.109> against<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.560> back

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
over here standing up against the back

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.030 
over here standing up against the back
of<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:02.980> workbench<00:04:03.310> here<00:04:04.349> here's<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.590> saddle

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
of the workbench here here's the saddle

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.949 
of the workbench here here's the saddle
where<00:04:06.220> I've<00:04:06.340> started<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.939> put<00:04:07.150> in<00:04:07.269> some<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.900> the

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
where I've started to put in some of the

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.460 
where I've started to put in some of the

webbings and as you can see there's one

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.960 
webbings and as you can see there's one
long<00:04:14.470> webbing<00:04:14.889> that<00:04:15.010> runs<00:04:15.250> from<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.549> front<00:04:15.879> to

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
long webbing that runs from the front to

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.490 
long webbing that runs from the front to
the<00:04:16.000> back<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.919> splits<00:04:19.169> going<00:04:20.169> from<00:04:20.349> either

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
the back and it splits going from either

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.010 
the back and it splits going from either
side<00:04:20.889> to<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.669> back<00:04:21.789> of<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.090> cattle<00:04:22.419> area<00:04:22.690> here

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
here that you can see is the main bill

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.110 
here that you can see is the main bill
of<00:04:35.830> webbing<00:04:36.130> where<00:04:36.280> there'll<00:04:36.460> be<00:04:36.490> two<00:04:36.729> billets

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.939 
sewn to that and then the front wedding
is<00:04:41.010> for<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.250> first<00:04:43.210> billet<00:04:43.539> a<00:04:43.720> lot<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:44.770> times

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
is for the first billet a lot of times

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.260 
is for the first billet a lot of times
these<00:04:45.099> billets<00:04:45.430> are<00:04:45.580> just<00:04:45.760> nailed<00:04:46.000> or<00:04:46.240> screwed

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
run from side to side across the top of

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.129 
run from side to side across the top of
the<00:05:00.250> saddle<00:05:00.610> there's<00:05:01.360> really<00:05:01.599> very<00:05:01.750> little

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
the saddle there's really very little

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.159 
the saddle there's really very little
chance<00:05:02.470> then<00:05:02.860> of<00:05:03.130> any<00:05:03.310> kind<00:05:03.639> of<00:05:03.760> damage<00:05:04.300> where

chance then of any kind of damage where

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.990 
chance then of any kind of damage where
the<00:05:05.289> webbing<00:05:05.470> might<00:05:05.979> pull<00:05:06.310> out<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:06.729> tree

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
the webbing might pull out of the tree

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.520 
the webbing might pull out of the tree
or<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.389> screw<00:05:07.720> might<00:05:07.930> pull<00:05:08.169> through<00:05:08.409> the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
or a screw might pull through the

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.399 
or a screw might pull through the
webbing<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.880> way<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:10.449> that<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.080> weddings

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
webbing this way this that the weddings

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.080 
webbing this way this that the weddings
are<00:05:11.560> completely<00:05:12.010> attached<00:05:12.370> to<00:05:12.639> one<00:05:12.820> another

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
are completely attached to one another

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.409 
are completely attached to one another
and<00:05:13.419> there's<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.870> much<00:05:14.320> more<00:05:14.789> safe<00:05:15.789> and<00:05:16.030> secure

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
and there's a much more safe and secure

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.939 
and there's a much more safe and secure
way<00:05:17.139> of<00:05:17.289> constructing<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:19.080> over<00:05:20.080> here<00:05:20.380> is<00:05:20.919> a

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
way of constructing it over here is a

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.870 
way of constructing it over here is a
large<00:05:21.900> piece<00:05:22.900> of<00:05:22.960> sail<00:05:23.500> cloth<00:05:23.860> very<00:05:24.639> very

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
large piece of sail cloth very very

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.379 
large piece of sail cloth very very
heavy<00:05:25.240> heavy<00:05:25.539> cloth<00:05:26.380> material<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:28.180> will

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
heavy heavy cloth material and that will

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.580 
heavy heavy cloth material and that will
get<00:05:28.570> stretched

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
get stretched

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.980 
get stretched
front<00:05:29.890> to<00:05:30.040> back<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.960> we'll<00:05:31.960> be<00:05:32.230> forming<00:05:33.040> the

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
front to back and we'll be forming the

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.040 
front to back and we'll be forming the
seat<00:05:34.990> area<00:05:35.260> of<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.250> saddle<00:05:36.900> sometimes<00:05:37.900> this

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
seat area of the saddle sometimes this

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.450 
seat area of the saddle sometimes this
would<00:05:38.200> also<00:05:38.350> be<00:05:38.620> done<00:05:38.830> with<00:05:38.860> additional

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
would also be done with additional

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.900 
would also be done with additional
webbings<00:05:40.200> that<00:05:41.200> can<00:05:41.590> also<00:05:41.830> be<00:05:42.040> done<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.730> I've

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
webbings that can also be done and I've

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.110 
webbings that can also be done and I've
seen<00:05:43.150> that<00:05:43.330> on<00:05:43.540> a<00:05:43.570> lot<00:05:44.140> of<00:05:44.260> construction<00:05:44.680> over

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
seen that on a lot of construction over

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.800 
seen that on a lot of construction over
the<00:05:46.120> years<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:47.590> is<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:48.240> little<00:05:49.240> bit<00:05:49.390> easier

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
the years this is a little bit easier

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.410 
the years this is a little bit easier
way<00:05:50.710> of<00:05:50.740> doing<00:05:51.190> it<00:05:51.340> without<00:05:51.610> having<00:05:52.030> to<00:05:52.120> pull

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
way of doing it without having to pull

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.910 
way of doing it without having to pull
three<00:05:52.900> or<00:05:52.990> four<00:05:53.170> more<00:05:53.350> pieces<00:05:53.680> of<00:05:53.800> webbing

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
three or four more pieces of webbing

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.610 
three or four more pieces of webbing
across<00:05:54.370> there<00:05:54.670> but<00:05:54.850> also<00:05:55.440> it<00:05:56.440> is<00:05:56.620> a<00:05:56.890> little

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
across there but also it is a little

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.870 
across there but also it is a little
little<00:05:59.620> less<00:05:59.740> expensive<00:06:00.310> than<00:06:00.430> all<00:06:00.610> of<00:06:00.760> the

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
little less expensive than all of the

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.430 
little less expensive than all of the
webbings<00:06:01.240> that<00:06:01.510> would<00:06:01.690> have<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:01.900> be<00:06:01.960> put<00:06:02.320> in

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
webbings that would have to be put in

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:13.020 
webbings that would have to be put in
there<00:06:02.680> so<00:06:08.880> just<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:10.060> give<00:06:10.210> you<00:06:10.300> an<00:06:10.390> idea<00:06:12.030> what

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
there so just to give you an idea what

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.910 
there so just to give you an idea what
the<00:06:13.270> beginning<00:06:13.450> stages<00:06:13.960> look<00:06:14.290> like<00:06:14.530> I'll<00:06:14.740> run

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
the beginning stages look like I'll run

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.840 
the beginning stages look like I'll run
another<00:06:15.160> video<00:06:15.580> in<00:06:15.820> a<00:06:15.910> few<00:06:16.090> minutes<00:06:16.420> and<00:06:17.850> post

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
another video in a few minutes and post

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.070 
another video in a few minutes and post
that<00:06:18.970> on<00:06:19.120> my<00:06:19.360> website<00:06:19.570> and<00:06:20.080> show<00:06:20.830> you<00:06:20.890> the

that on my website and show you the
construction<00:06:23.460> once<00:06:24.460> I<00:06:24.610> put<00:06:24.850> the<00:06:26.040> sailcloth

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
construction once I put the sailcloth

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.260 
construction once I put the sailcloth
material<00:06:29.430> take<00:06:30.430> care<00:06:30.640> and<00:06:30.880> we'll<00:06:31.000> see<00:06:31.210> you
