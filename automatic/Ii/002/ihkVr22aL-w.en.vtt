00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 always at apple at the conference of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.950
 London press so for the press 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.059
 European 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.690
 after the ipad mini retina we go to the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.679
 novelty 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.990
 the big novelty is the ipad r then 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.100
 ipad r it's the fifth generation of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.869
 ipad then the big the big value 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.850
 added I find this ipad r it's going 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.810
 to be first at the level of congestion 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.119
 we can see everyone we can see 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.369
 that we are close enough to the ipad mini in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.520
 terms of forms factor ie 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.649
 here is a much finer border 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.590
 result we have an ipad compared to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.600
 here is my ipad 2 4 we can see that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.800
 this is visually it's not at all 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.300
 same thing we have a product that is 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.219
 much more compact 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.950
 there we can see it's a lot 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.559
 much more compact so more compact 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.239
 was also much more end 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.489
 that's going to be the pretty story that is going 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.320
 tell us apple in his tv spots 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.820
 it's a thickness that has been really 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.530
 reduced will I have not really the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 numbers as usual you me me 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 excuse me I do not have any specs in 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.049
 head it's always very very sport in 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.189
 any case in terms of weight then there 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.119
 it's really day and night 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.680
 had an ipad so 4 which was pretty 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.180
 heavy nevertheless to take in hand there we 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.970
 really has something that is very 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.159
 very comfortable lightweight before me 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.530
 I already liked the format of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.979
 the ipad mini ben here we have an ipad mini 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.530
 big screen 9.7 inches still retina 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.939
 obviously we will go around 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.130
 from the owner as usual 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.780
 Well, here we have seen already nothing 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.579
 behind that 's it's nice really 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.630
 clutter month me I'm a fan 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.150
 since in addition it is really light 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.369
 finally we'll see with the specs a little 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.409
 more a little further and with a video 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.720
 debrief tomorrow at the level here's the weight 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.180
 etc as the ipad mini 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.020
 2 including 4 min retina on a double microphone 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.140
 that's good 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.840
 the sensor it is still a 5 megapixel its 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.750
 blu grosso modo to its equivalents to those 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.200
 found on the iphone 5 s in 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.520
 inside an apple and apple at 7 with 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.170
 the coprocessor the coprocessor m 7 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.480
 because we had what we saw 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.140
 bastien delrot will be an apple m7 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.280
 for all that is gone here are 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.209
 sister accelerometer and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.380
 company to a front camera 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.540
 fessetime atx so that's still a 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.220
 it's very comfortable 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.240
 we are going to put it we will put it 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.650
 and that's okay so here it is at 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.660
 just about everything we can say in everything 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.670
 case here on the grip on the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.260
 first grip we will see after at 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.000
 level of losses but overall it 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.490
 should be very very very strong 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.810
 we finish with the entrance ticket which 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:53.010
 is set at 499 euros for this ipad r in 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.769
 version 16 giga to remind the ipad 4 years 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.870
 and gia was offered at 509 euros so we 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.370
 has a nice move in terms of price 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.260
 since a product that is clearly 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.810
 lighter it's really striking the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.739
 difference in weight and a little more 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.140
 accessible 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.900
 so that's good if the last 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.209
 not a thing throw from Cialdi nor you 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.010
 on the ipad retina nor on the ipad r 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.390
 unfortunately that's it was a 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.739
 little innovation we had about 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.330
 iphone and up on the 5th on the 5th 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.890
 here we are cleaning my ipad parisien it's 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.110
 perfect good I leave you there on 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.269
 it was with his bios for sin is with 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.269
 a pretty seductive ipad r
