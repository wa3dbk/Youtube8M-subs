00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
was the one that was really tricky

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.360 
was the one that was really tricky
because<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:26.840> was<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:26.990> real<00:04:27.260> thing<00:04:27.889> about<00:04:28.099> doing

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370

because it was a real thing about doing
the<00:04:28.460> paint<00:04:28.700> right<00:04:28.969> and<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.539> the<00:04:29.630> look<00:04:29.840> right

and honestly he couldn't tell which
guitar<00:05:07.110> was<00:05:07.260> what<00:05:07.500> at<00:05:07.710> first<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:08.220> know<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.430> fooled

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
guitar was what at first I know I fooled

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.310 
guitar was what at first I know I fooled
him<00:05:08.850> for<00:05:09.030> like<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> couple<00:05:09.510> seconds<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:10.230> know

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
him for like a couple seconds you know

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.660 
him for like a couple seconds you know
that's<00:05:10.500> his<00:05:10.590> baby<00:05:10.830> he<00:05:11.010> brought<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.370> one<00:05:11.550> to

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
that's his baby he brought that one to

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.190 
that's his baby he brought that one to
the<00:05:11.760> United<00:05:12.060> States<00:05:12.270> when<00:05:12.510> he<00:05:12.540> was<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.750> kid<00:05:12.960> and

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
the United States when he was a kid and

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.480 
the United States when he was a kid and
the<00:05:13.560> whole<00:05:13.710> story<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.070> guys<00:05:14.190> know<00:05:14.310> about<00:05:14.400> that

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
the whole story you guys know about that

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.420 
the whole story you guys know about that
but<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.540> figure<00:05:16.470> if<00:05:16.560> I<00:05:16.650> could<00:05:16.800> fool<00:05:17.010> him<00:05:17.040> for

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
but I figure if I could fool him for

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.690 
but I figure if I could fool him for
5-10<00:05:18.270> seconds<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:18.990> could<00:05:19.980> probably<00:05:20.280> do<00:05:20.550> that

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
5-10 seconds I could probably do that

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.800 
5-10 seconds I could probably do that
with<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.940> rest<00:05:21.090> of<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.270> people<00:05:21.420> in<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.630> world

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
with the rest of the people in the world

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.170 
with the rest of the people in the world
that<00:05:22.050> you<00:05:22.950> know<00:05:23.010> and<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.460> think<00:05:23.670> we<00:05:23.760> did<00:05:23.910> it<00:05:23.940> and

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
that you know and I think we did it and

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.550 
that you know and I think we did it and
I<00:05:24.420> think<00:05:24.510> we<00:05:24.690> pulled<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.960> off<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.080> he<00:05:25.290> signed

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
I think we pulled it off and he signed

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.200 
I think we pulled it off and he signed
off<00:05:25.710> at<00:05:25.890> record<00:05:26.250> time<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.640> was<00:05:26.730> a<00:05:26.760> done<00:05:26.940> deal

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
off at record time it was a done deal

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.700 
off at record time it was a done deal
the<00:05:27.690> rest<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.020> time<00:05:28.140> we<00:05:28.320> spent<00:05:28.560> hanging

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
the rest of the time we spent hanging

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.160 
the rest of the time we spent hanging
out<00:05:28.920> together<00:05:29.040> going<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.490> dinner<00:05:29.760> lunch<00:05:30.170> he
