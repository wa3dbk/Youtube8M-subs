00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.710
 Thank you so I could do that great 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.059
 now with only 14 reais and ten 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.799
 cents per month 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.109
 I would have access to the fantastic 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.119
 service of max itaú account and could 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.580
 use a debit card you ten 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.340
 check sheets per month and hold eight 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.260
 request four account statements 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.869
 make two transfers between accounts 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.620
 to carry out unlimited consultations 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.360
 internet or what is cool you can only 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.309
 You wanted to, I went to see you. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.350
 the dirty teaching of the collections of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.879
 packet service is so great that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 first moment while the court 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.629
 higher fares 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.520
 the fantastic ids like 20 sheets of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.230
 more than 30 checks per month 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 transfers between accounts and itaú beyond 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.340
 benefit from unique services they are 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.500
 even with an automatic warning of 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.590
 account movement with ms messages 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.290
 if this strategy does not work 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.690
 they offered a discount based on the 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.580
 investment is not made in the bank obtained 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.120
 exemption from tariffs from 30 thousand 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.310
 real invested smart guys they né 1 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.930
 30 thousand reais invested in savings 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.790
 you are giving much more money to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.729
 them than any package rate of 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.350
 service wants to see most of the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.910
 money invested in saving is 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.750
 used by banks for credit 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.100
 real estate 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.590
 because the savings would be yielding 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.840
 about half a percent per month and that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.010
 lend money to 0 29% per month for 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.869
 someone else to own a home 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.840
 for example they have not only succeeded 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.740
 return your 6 percent of the savings 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.649
 as they still have the values 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.790
 which are more than 100 reais but 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.770
 if you do not have the money for 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.850
 invest or simply complain about the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.860
 fare amount 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.979
 they are then trying to emulate more 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.140
 low and with fewer services until the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.840
 package as simple as max counts then 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.470
 the economical that max in a new tariff but 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.990
 the services offered 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.700
 they offer services as if it were a 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.350
 great advantage for that consumer 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.330
 does not use many services 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.680
 banks but they just forget about 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.810
 say that there is another alternative 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.130
 for those same people who would be the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.800
 opening a checking account with 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.300
 essential services for free 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.100
 in accordance with the regulations issued 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.130
 by the national monetary council and the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.560
 central bank resolution 3,919 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.450
 that all banks 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.650
 essential services without 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.510
 any rate 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.730
 these essential services 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.660
 basically the following supply of 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.430
 debit card 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.959
 four loot per month two 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.070
 transfers between accounts in the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.959
 same institution 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.000
 two monthly extracts consultations 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.670
 unlimited through the internet and three sheets 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.900
 check per month 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.430
 in short, you do not need 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.750
 more than these 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.510
 you do not have to pay absolutely 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.010
 no cent to keep your account and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.170
 if this quantity is not exceeded 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.570
 you will only pay for the item you 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.030
 exceed this limit is how to measure 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.490
 minimum 160 reais per year in the case of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.300
 benefit regardless of the value of the 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.880
 salary 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.220
 your social or skin class background 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.110
 sexual choice or religion he 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.239
 simply can not refuse to do 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.130
 But the daughter of the pu ta gem is so 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.720
 great that some agencies 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.130
 he went so far as to say that 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.470
 resolution of the central bank really 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.810
 there is more shouting you can not anymore 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.260
 open account of this type because the system 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.330
 would not allow what this type of account 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.090
 would only be for low-income people 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.290
 I will not let the fucking low income is the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.989
 fuck 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.790
 she made it very clear in Portuguese if 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.080
 you request a change or 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.090
 opening of checking account or savings 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.580
 for essential services 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.840
 they are obliged to comply is not 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.299
 only itaú is doing this 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.590
 sucking is not happening at all 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.480
 the banks 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.709
 these banks are literally falling 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.900
 by the rules of the monetary council 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.700
 national and central bank 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.860
 if you 're paying absurd rates 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.930
 and totally unnecessary 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.350
 the package of services you do not need 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.269
 uses requires you to change your account 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.130
 but if you still do not have it 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.170
 so I'll help you 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.360

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.439
 the bank itself 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.670
 Let's make these fuckers respect the 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.409
 consumer
