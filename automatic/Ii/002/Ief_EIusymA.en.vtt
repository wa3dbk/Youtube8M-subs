that is a reasonably good mechanic and
we're<00:03:10.370> actually<00:03:10.549> thinking<00:03:10.940> about<00:03:11.000> making<00:03:11.360> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
we're actually thinking about making a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.410 
we're actually thinking about making a
video<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:12.250> we're<00:03:13.250> gonna<00:03:13.370> rebuild<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.090> car

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
video and we're gonna rebuild that car

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.690 
video and we're gonna rebuild that car
on<00:03:15.170> video<00:03:16.090> kind<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.180> step<00:03:17.480> by<00:03:17.690> step<00:03:18.489> so<00:03:19.489> that

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
on video kind of step by step so that

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.870 
on video kind of step by step so that
not<00:03:20.150> only<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.870> learn<00:03:21.140> again<00:03:21.650> how<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.980> do<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.340> but

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
not only I learn again how to do it but

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.729 
not only I learn again how to do it but
you<00:03:23.060> guys<00:03:23.239> get<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.630> follow<00:03:23.810> along<00:03:24.079> with<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.530> so

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
you guys get to follow along with it so

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.569 
you guys get to follow along with it so
we'll<00:03:25.130> see<00:03:25.280> how<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.459> goes<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:27.170> then

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
we'll see how that goes and then

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.050 
we'll see how that goes and then
obviously<00:03:28.579> an<00:03:28.700> engine<00:03:29.060> flush<00:03:29.380> needs<00:03:31.060> belts

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
obviously an engine flush needs belts

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.759 
obviously an engine flush needs belts
hoses<00:03:32.239> all<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.440> stuff<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.920> can<00:03:34.160> do<00:03:34.280> obviously

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
hoses all that stuff I can do obviously

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.229 
hoses all that stuff I can do obviously
but<00:03:36.769> once<00:03:36.980> he<00:03:37.100> gets<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.340> transmission<00:03:38.000> done

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
but once he gets the transmission done

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.530 
but once he gets the transmission done
as<00:03:39.049> he<00:03:39.230> says<00:03:39.470> that's<00:03:40.459> what<00:03:40.730> he'll<00:03:40.880> really<00:03:41.299> get

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
as he says that's what he'll really get

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.860 
as he says that's what he'll really get
a<00:03:41.570> good<00:03:42.190> down<00:03:43.190> low<00:03:43.459> on<00:03:43.730> everything<00:03:44.120> else<00:03:44.570> needs

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
a good down low on everything else needs

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.520 
a good down low on everything else needs
to<00:03:44.930> be<00:03:44.989> done<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.470> van<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:47.019> what<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.049> can<00:03:48.350> do
