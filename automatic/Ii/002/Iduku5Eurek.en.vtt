to<00:03:04.040> keep<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.400> secure<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.780> they<00:03:05.930> stage<00:03:06.739> right

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.840 

and<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:11.000> just<00:03:11.180> want<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.480> repeat<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.140> process

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
and you just want to repeat that process

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:25.120 
and you just want to repeat that process
on<00:03:13.850> all<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:14.870> your<00:03:14.989> flowers

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.380 

so<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:26.460> want<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.700> repeat<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.120> process

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
so you just want to repeat this process

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.260 
so you just want to repeat this process
the<00:03:28.350> glossy<00:03:28.740> accents<00:03:29.250> acts<00:03:29.430> as<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> brilliant

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
the glossy accents acts as a brilliant

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.860 
the glossy accents acts as a brilliant
note<00:03:30.630> because<00:03:31.050> it's<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:32.420> doesn't<00:03:33.420> take<00:03:33.630> too

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
note because it's it doesn't take too

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.500 
note because it's it doesn't take too
long<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.320> dry<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.100> glued<00:03:35.550> quite<00:03:35.820> instantly

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.540 

okay<00:03:39.510> as<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.840> get<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.230> smaller<00:03:40.560> pieces<00:03:40.920> if

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
okay as you get to the smaller pieces if

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.710 
okay as you get to the smaller pieces if
you<00:03:42.210> just<00:03:42.360> roll<00:03:42.600> them<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.930> slightly<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.720> this

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
you just roll them in slightly and this

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.080 
you just roll them in slightly and this
is<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.020> one<00:03:46.140> with<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.320> two<00:03:46.560> petals<00:03:46.800> on<00:03:47.840> just

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
is the one with the two petals on just

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.450 
is the one with the two petals on just
glue<00:03:51.090> along<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.080> back<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:53.090> glue<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.300> together

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
glue along the back and glue it together

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.480 
glue along the back and glue it together
to<00:03:56.460> make<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.850> clone<00:03:58.340> this<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.250> last

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
to make like a clone this and the last

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.420 
to make like a clone this and the last
time<00:04:02.760> which<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.090> once<00:04:03.830> they<00:04:04.830> get<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.040> little<00:04:05.220> bit

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
time which is once they get a little bit

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.170 
time which is once they get a little bit
fiddly<00:04:05.940> as<00:04:06.210> they<00:04:06.390> get<00:04:06.570> towards<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.140> end<00:04:07.260> but

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
fiddly as they get towards the end but

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:24.330 
fiddly as they get towards the end but
they're<00:04:09.180> worth<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.630> effort<00:04:09.930> in<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.170> end

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.860 

okay<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.669> next<00:04:25.879> day<00:04:26.210> each<00:04:26.449> you<00:04:26.629> want<00:04:26.810> to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
okay so the next day each you want to

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.409 
okay so the next day each you want to
start<00:04:27.169> with<00:04:27.349> your<00:04:27.470> biggest<00:04:28.030> flower<00:04:29.030> which

a blob of that in the five petal one and
put<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:26.960> four<00:05:27.199> pizza<00:05:27.529> one<00:05:27.710> in<00:05:27.949> the<00:05:28.039> sides<00:05:34.449> now

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
put the four pizza one in the sides now

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.719 
put the four pizza one in the sides now
you<00:05:35.509> just<00:05:35.750> want<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:35.990> repeat<00:05:36.289> this<00:05:36.440> process

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
you just want to repeat this process

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.680 
you just want to repeat this process
using<00:05:38.319> the<00:05:39.319> free<00:05:39.589> petal<00:05:40.099> flower<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:41.000> two<00:05:41.270> and

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
using the free petal flower the two and

00:05:41.690 --> 00:06:24.740 
using the free petal flower the two and
then<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.020> one

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.230 

the<00:06:25.750> two<00:06:25.990> pets<00:06:26.350> are<00:06:26.500> going<00:06:26.710> in<00:06:26.940> then<00:06:27.940> the<00:06:28.030> last

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
the two pets are going in then the last

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.180 
the two pets are going in then the last
piece<00:06:28.570> will<00:06:28.840> be<00:06:28.990> the<00:06:29.260> single<00:06:29.590> petal<00:06:30.100> that

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
piece will be the single petal that

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.610 
piece will be the single petal that
you've<00:06:30.340> got<00:06:30.670> if<00:06:31.480> you're<00:06:31.690> doing<00:06:32.140> this<00:06:32.320> process

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
you've got if you're doing this process

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.830 
you've got if you're doing this process
using<00:06:33.280> metal<00:06:33.700> probably<00:06:34.240> won't<00:06:34.420> be<00:06:34.540> able<00:06:34.690> to

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
using metal probably won't be able to

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.860 
using metal probably won't be able to
get<00:06:34.990> the<00:06:35.200> last<00:06:35.590> petal<00:06:35.920> in<00:06:36.420> but<00:06:37.420> you<00:06:37.540> could<00:06:37.690> use

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
get the last petal in but you could use

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:53.700 
get the last petal in but you could use
like<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.080> bead<00:06:38.440> or<00:06:38.710> something<00:06:39.310> in<00:06:39.460> the<00:06:39.580> center

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.780 

you<00:06:54.640> just<00:06:54.850> pop<00:06:55.000> that<00:06:55.210> in<00:06:55.360> and<00:06:55.600> let<00:06:55.720> that<00:06:55.870> dry<00:06:56.790> so

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
you just pop that in and let that dry so

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.400 
you just pop that in and let that dry so
this<00:06:58.000> is<00:06:58.150> the<00:06:58.270> final<00:06:58.510> effect<00:06:58.780> you're<00:06:59.170> going<00:06:59.350> to

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
this is the final effect you're going to
