00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
instead first step is to grab your

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.640 
instead first step is to grab your
cardboard<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.769> draw<00:00:29.160> out<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.849> wing<00:00:30.449> shape<00:00:30.810> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
cardboard and draw out the wing shape my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.240 
cardboard and draw out the wing shape my
shape<00:00:32.009> looks<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.149> B<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> capital<00:00:34.980> B

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
shape looks like a B like a capital B

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.270 
shape looks like a B like a capital B
with<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> curve<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.920> can't<00:00:38.160> really

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
with a curve and I know you can't really

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.639 
with a curve and I know you can't really
see<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> shape<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.930> when<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> cut<00:00:40.559> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
see the shape of it but when I cut it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.889 
see the shape of it but when I cut it
out<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.950> will<00:00:41.100> look<00:00:41.340> better<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.300> after<00:00:42.750> you're

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
out it will look better so after you're

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.900 
out it will look better so after you're
done<00:00:43.110> drawing<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.890> cut<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> out

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.570 

so<00:00:49.720> this<00:00:49.900> is<00:00:50.020> what<00:00:50.200> it<00:00:50.320> looks<00:00:50.560> like<00:00:50.830> um

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
so this is what it looks like um

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.190 
so this is what it looks like um
hopefully<00:00:52.090> you<00:00:52.390> see<00:00:52.600> what<00:00:52.720> I<00:00:52.780> mean<00:00:52.960> when<00:00:53.170> I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
hopefully you see what I mean when I

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.870 
hopefully you see what I mean when I
said<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.590> looks<00:00:53.710> like<00:00:53.770> a<00:00:53.860> capital<00:00:54.400> B<00:00:54.580> that's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
said it looks like a capital B that's

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.520 
said it looks like a capital B that's
been<00:00:55.180> curved<00:00:55.570> instead<00:00:56.020> of<00:00:56.110> having<00:00:56.320> that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
been curved instead of having that

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.500 
been curved instead of having that
straight<00:00:57.040> back<00:00:57.280> for<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.610> capital<00:00:58.060> B<00:00:58.210> it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
straight back for the capital B it's

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.260 
straight back for the capital B it's
slightly<00:00:58.990> curved<00:00:59.680> not<00:01:00.010> as<00:01:00.220> curved<00:01:00.490> MC<00:01:01.000> um

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
slightly curved not as curved MC um

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.840 
slightly curved not as curved MC um
other<00:01:01.750> part<00:01:02.080> but<00:01:02.800> still<00:01:03.220> add<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.580> curve<00:01:03.820> to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
other part but still add that curve to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.240 
other part but still add that curve to
give<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.270> that<00:01:04.480> wing<00:01:04.750> shape<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.350> this<00:01:05.980> next

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
give it that wing shape and this next

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.490 
give it that wing shape and this next
step<00:01:06.460> is<00:01:06.640> totally<00:01:07.030> optional<00:01:07.240> but<00:01:08.140> my

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
step is totally optional but my

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.320 
step is totally optional but my
cardboard<00:01:08.890> had<00:01:09.250> blue<00:01:09.550> words<00:01:09.850> on<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.120> that<00:01:10.300> I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
cardboard had blue words on it that I

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.390 
cardboard had blue words on it that I
wanted<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.720> cover<00:01:10.900> up<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:11.590> all<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:11.890> did<00:01:12.040> was<00:01:12.250> grab

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
wanted to cover up so all I did was grab

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.750 
wanted to cover up so all I did was grab
white<00:01:12.970> spray<00:01:13.480> paint<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.960> spray<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:15.430> top<00:01:15.610> of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
white spray paint and spray on top of

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.719 
white spray paint and spray on top of
those<00:01:15.880> words<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.390> make<00:01:16.540> my<00:01:16.780> entire<00:01:17.080> wing

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
those words to make my entire wing

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.510 
those words to make my entire wing
cardboard<00:01:18.729> thing<00:01:19.090> white<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.100> next<00:01:21.280> step

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
cardboard thing white so the next step

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.460 
cardboard thing white so the next step
is<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.880> apply<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.240> feathers<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:23.140> grab<00:01:23.350> your

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
is to apply the feathers so grab your

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.530 
is to apply the feathers so grab your
hot<00:01:23.650> glue<00:01:23.830> gun<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.340> if<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.640> simply<00:01:25.150> glue<00:01:25.330> them

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
hot glue gun and if I simply glue them

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.810 
hot glue gun and if I simply glue them
onto<00:01:25.690> your<00:01:25.960> cardboard<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.680> think<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.640> looks

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
onto your cardboard I think it looks

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.370 
onto your cardboard I think it looks
best<00:01:28.060> when<00:01:28.270> all<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.479> feathers<00:01:28.810> are<00:01:28.960> facing

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
best when all the feathers are facing

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.219 
best when all the feathers are facing
down<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.950> slightly<00:01:30.670> overlap<00:01:31.479> one<00:01:31.810> another

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
down and slightly overlap one another

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.469 
down and slightly overlap one another
that<00:01:32.710> way<00:01:32.890> they<00:01:33.220> could<00:01:33.460> cover<00:01:33.880> each<00:01:34.150> other's

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
that way they could cover each other's

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.770 
that way they could cover each other's
gaps<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.200> also<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.160> looks<00:01:36.369> neater<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.660> way

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
gaps and also it looks neater that way

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.320 
gaps and also it looks neater that way
that<00:01:38.050> they're<00:01:38.200> all<00:01:38.350> facing<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.800> same<00:01:38.890> way<00:01:39.330> but

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
that they're all facing the same way but

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.030 
that they're all facing the same way but
yeah<00:01:40.509> just<00:01:40.780> go<00:01:40.900> crazy<00:01:41.110> with<00:01:41.320> feathers<00:01:41.800> and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
yeah just go crazy with feathers and

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.880 
yeah just go crazy with feathers and
cover<00:01:42.430> up<00:01:42.610> as<00:01:42.820> much<00:01:43.450> as<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:44.140> hopefully

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
cover up as much as you can hopefully

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.310 
cover up as much as you can hopefully
all<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.520> gaps<00:01:45.700> are<00:01:45.970> covered<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:47.140> have

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
all the gaps are covered and you have

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.440 
all the gaps are covered and you have
the<00:01:47.619> corners<00:01:48.040> definitely<00:01:48.700> covered<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:49.330> you

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
the corners definitely covered so you

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.390 
the corners definitely covered so you
could<00:01:49.810> barely<00:01:50.229> see<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.650> cardboard<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.340> you

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
could barely see the cardboard and you

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.059 
could barely see the cardboard and you
see<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.030> fluff<00:01:52.300> of<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.630> feathers<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.800> after

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
see the fluff of the feathers so after

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.620 
see the fluff of the feathers so after
you're<00:01:54.220> done<00:01:54.250> with<00:01:54.580> one<00:01:54.789> side<00:01:55.030> don't<00:01:55.330> forget

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
you're done with one side don't forget

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
your arms to fit through that's why I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.559 
your arms to fit through that's why I
would<00:02:36.190> recommend<00:02:36.610> getting<00:02:36.790> elastic<00:02:37.390> because

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
would recommend getting elastic because

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.180 
would recommend getting elastic because
it's<00:02:37.840> stretchy<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.830> don't<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
it's stretchy and you don't have to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.370 
it's stretchy and you don't have to
worry<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.610> much<00:02:39.640> about<00:02:40.330> your<00:02:40.690> arm<00:02:40.870> holes<00:02:41.110> being

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
worry as much about your arm holes being

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.350 
worry as much about your arm holes being
too<00:02:41.590> small<00:02:41.830> because<00:02:42.220> they<00:02:42.490> actually<00:02:42.760> stretch

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
too small because they actually stretch

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.970 
too small because they actually stretch
out<00:02:43.540> if<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.930> cut<00:02:44.110> them<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.380> little<00:02:44.620> too<00:02:44.740> small

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
out if you cut them a little too small

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.710 
out if you cut them a little too small
