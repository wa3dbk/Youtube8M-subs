00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.819
 it is a very delicate topic no 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.440
 ask for compulsory treatment of psychic 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.450
 Ill so against their sake 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.480
 Actually, the highest judges 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.250
 a year ago judged that there is no 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.580
 give such compulsory treatments more 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.350
 may 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.180
 but now politics has changed 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.529
 regulations on the way 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 tomorrow the law will go through the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.340
 Federal Council and this law makes one 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.830
 Such treatment now again 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.510
 possible and not only at the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.470
 concerned on incomprehension 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.420
 Karin Wenzel It's been years and years 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.200
 He still pursues him he does not want 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.000
 be recognized 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.100
 after a quarrel with his grandmother 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.370
 he was admitted to psychiatry 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.469
 because his grandma and the ambulance one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.690
 gynecologist believed he had one 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.460
 he got psychosis in psychiatry 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.719
 no thorough investigation but 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.719
 strong psychotropic drugs 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.559
 they threatened me when I got this 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.870
 Do not take neuroleptics voluntarily 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.530
 then they give me something by force 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.780
 inject that really blows me something like that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.149
 It could not happen to him at the moment 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.649
 because, judging by the 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.789
 constitutional court and the 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.970
 Bundesgerichtshof has been a good one for a long time 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.590
 no more compulsory treatment possible 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.570
 and some have psychiatrists and caregivers 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.640
 in the time without compulsory treatment 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.619
 surprising experiences made to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.470
 for example, in the hospital heidenheim 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.440
 everything that was so feared that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 did not occur 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.860
 do not heat any other coercive measures 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.310
 that is, that officer we have Ungen 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.560
 no more attacks from now 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.319
 Patients on other patients or too 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.899
 staff of heidenheim's chief physician has 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.610
 Therefore, to the Federal Minister of Justice 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.740
 written and asked no new one 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.259
 law to create compulsory treatment 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.200
 vainly recently has the Bundestag 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.130
 approved the bill 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.780
 Forced treatment should be under strict 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.940
 be possible again 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.700
 the psychiatrist associations are satisfied 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.259
 I welcome that by the legislator 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.099
 acted very fast and determined 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.429
 she does not know everyone under all 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.899
 convincing circumstances with talking of something 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.150
 and the other way to tell us 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.069
 these people just do not treat the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.750
 works in very many cases too 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.489
 not because the behavioral problems 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.280
 so strong are the police that they are two 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.620
 days later, who brings no again 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.440
 Disease insight may be allowed in the future 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.310
 be treated forcibly 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.660
 you can not be uninhibited 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.640
 he thinks he is subordinate 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.890
 he is afraid of arbitrary the cdu 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.840
 faction even demanded that 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.470
 enforced outpatient forced treatment 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.489
 shall be 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.560
 what luckily not the case though 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.150
 I think with this new law 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.519
 the damocles sword of the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.230
 Forced treatment over every lawyer 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.269
 had the constitutional court's verdict 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.819
 against the forced treatment 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.299
 Now he has filed a criminal complaint against 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.260
 The Federal Minister of Justice and the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.390
 Minister of Justice for the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.340
 new law had made strong 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.260
 reproach tried dangerous and 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.780
 attempted severe bodily injury in 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.340
 a number of cases the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.980
 Accused are in the foyer 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.890
 stickelberger as an instigator the others 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.920
 at least have been active in the background 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.830
 and then either as a mediator 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.990
 also responsible or criminally 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.280
 but also as the culprit behind the culprit 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.980
 responsible 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.020
 have medicines in psychiatry 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.910
 he argues, serious side effects 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.319
 and already prepares the next one 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.930
 suit before the Federal Constitutional Court 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.610
 in front 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.680
 his case will soon be at stuttgart 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.810
 he negotiates the district court calls 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.700
 he has compensation and pain 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.330
 long under the consequences of the medication 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.820
 suffered 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.920
 I had movement problems for years 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.080
 even when I dropped that off 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.239
 that has slowly returned 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.640
 formed but in some people goes 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.890
 they will not run away anymore 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.910
 her life long twitching and cramping and 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.910
 through the area
