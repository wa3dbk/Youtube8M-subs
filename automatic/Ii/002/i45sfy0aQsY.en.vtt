okay<00:00:00.690> now<00:00:00.840> let's<00:00:00.989> have<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.110> look<00:00:01.199> at<00:00:01.319> MIDI<00:00:01.500> shift

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
okay now let's have a look at MIDI shift

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.860 
okay now let's have a look at MIDI shift
mode<00:00:02.129> we've<00:00:02.429> just<00:00:03.090> had<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.270> quick<00:00:03.419> look<00:00:03.570> at<00:00:03.689> MIDI

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
mode we've just had a quick look at MIDI

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.280 
mode we've just had a quick look at MIDI
mapping<00:00:04.160> so<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.460> Ableton<00:00:05.930> control-m<00:00:06.930> what

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
mapping so in Ableton control-m what

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.540 
mapping so in Ableton control-m what
just<00:00:07.470> into<00:00:07.649> mapping<00:00:07.980> mode<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.340> I'm<00:00:08.429> actually

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
just into mapping mode and I'm actually

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.040 
just into mapping mode and I'm actually
going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.910> delete<00:00:09.179> off<00:00:09.389> all<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> mappings

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
going to delete off all the mappings

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.129 
going to delete off all the mappings
that<00:00:10.200> we've<00:00:10.320> just<00:00:10.469> made<00:00:11.719> you<00:00:12.719> can<00:00:12.870> start

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
that we've just made you can start

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.080 
that we've just made you can start
afresh

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
afresh

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.660 
afresh
just<00:00:15.780> want<00:00:15.930> a<00:00:15.990> map<00:00:16.590> ascend<00:00:17.040> so<00:00:17.340> I'm<00:00:17.460> just<00:00:17.550> gonna

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
just want a map ascend so I'm just gonna

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.660 
just want a map ascend so I'm just gonna
click<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.000> send<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.170> use<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.670> analog

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
click on send a and we use this analog

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
click on send a and we use this analog
rotary<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.780> see<00:00:21.900> there<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.170> comes<00:00:22.350> up

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
rotary you can see there it comes up

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
rotary you can see there it comes up
sixteen<00:00:23.340> nine<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:23.970> that's<00:00:24.029> basically

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
sixteen nine and that's basically

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.269 
sixteen nine and that's basically
telling<00:00:24.660> me<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.020> it's<00:00:25.140> MIDI<00:00:25.320> channel<00:00:25.680> 16<00:00:26.100> and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
telling me that it's MIDI channel 16 and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.400 
telling me that it's MIDI channel 16 and
control<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:26.790> number<00:00:27.000> nine<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.170> come<00:00:28.290> out

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
control and number nine so what come out

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.580 
control and number nine so what come out
of<00:00:28.670> MIDI<00:00:29.670> mapping<00:00:29.910> mode<00:00:30.199> move<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
of MIDI mapping mode move this and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.320 
of MIDI mapping mode move this and
you'll<00:00:31.680> see<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.010> that<00:00:32.129> is<00:00:32.279> now<00:00:32.489> operating

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
you'll see that that is now operating

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.840 
you'll see that that is now operating
the<00:00:33.449> send<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.949> want<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.430> multi

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the send and what I want to do is multi

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.950 
the send and what I want to do is multi
map<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.210> control<00:00:37.489> for<00:00:38.489> D<00:00:38.670> has<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.960> great

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
map this control for D has a great

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260 
map this control for D has a great
little<00:00:40.199> feature<00:00:40.850> where<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.030> press<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
little feature where if you press and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.720 
little feature where if you press and
hold<00:00:42.449> this<00:00:43.440> encoder<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.100> notice<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.519> says

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
hold this encoder you notice it says

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.310 
hold this encoder you notice it says
shift<00:00:44.970> underneath<00:00:45.390> it'll<00:00:45.930> put<00:00:46.019> us<00:00:46.050> into<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
shift underneath it'll put us into a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.970 
shift underneath it'll put us into a
shift<00:00:46.620> mode<00:00:48.020> which<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.140> displayed<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.710> this

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
shift mode which is displayed on this

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.610 
shift mode which is displayed on this
BPM<00:00:50.489> display<00:00:50.820> sft<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.989> allows<00:00:52.290> us<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
BPM display sft this allows us to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
BPM display sft this allows us to
completely<00:00:52.950> remap<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> surface<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
completely remap the surface and just to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.780 
completely remap the surface and just to
prove<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:55.800> gonna<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.550> I'm

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
prove it what I'm gonna do now is I'm

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.940 
prove it what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna<00:00:56.940> go<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.270> MIDI<00:00:57.450> mapping<00:00:57.660> mode<00:00:57.950> I'm

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
gonna go into MIDI mapping mode I'm

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.100 
gonna go into MIDI mapping mode I'm
gonna<00:00:59.130> go<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> send<00:00:59.850> B<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.690> I'm<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
gonna go on to send B and I'm going to

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.549 
gonna go on to send B and I'm going to
map<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.710> same<00:01:01.920> control<00:01:03.050> what<00:01:04.050> you'll<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.379> now

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
map the same control what you'll see now

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.710 
map the same control what you'll see now
is<00:01:04.589> its<00:01:04.830> ending<00:01:05.160> fifteen<00:01:05.640> nine<00:01:05.940> instead<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
is its ending fifteen nine instead of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
is its ending fifteen nine instead of
sixteen<00:01:07.140> nine

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.140 

in<00:01:16.570> order<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:16.960> we<00:01:17.170> can<00:01:17.320> make<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:18.150> middie

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
in order that we can make the middie

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.850 
in order that we can make the middie
relatively<00:01:19.900> seamless<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.500> way<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.770> it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
relatively seamless in the way that it

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.430 
relatively seamless in the way that it
works<00:01:21.100> we<00:01:21.430> do<00:01:21.670> need<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.150> be<00:01:22.660> able<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:26.020> use<00:01:26.260> it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
works we do need to be able to use it

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.080 
works we do need to be able to use it
without<00:01:26.590> any<00:01:26.740> nasty<00:01:27.580> results

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
without any nasty results

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.660 
without any nasty results
if<00:01:29.659> I'm<00:01:29.960> looking<00:01:30.079> at<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.320> moment<00:01:30.619> sent<00:01:31.040> B<00:01:31.280> if<00:01:31.549> I

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
if I'm looking at the moment sent B if I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.179 
if I'm looking at the moment sent B if I
put<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.000> three-quarters<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.049> way<00:01:33.140> up

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
put it three-quarters of the way up

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.760 
put it three-quarters of the way up
you'll<00:01:34.189> see<00:01:34.369> send<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:35.060> down<00:01:35.329> at<00:01:35.630> zero<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.710> if

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
you'll see send a is down at zero so if

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.200 
you'll see send a is down at zero so if
I<00:01:36.890> swap<00:01:37.340> my<00:01:37.460> lair<00:01:39.759> historically<00:01:40.759> as<00:01:40.880> soon<00:01:41.030> as<00:01:41.149> I

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
I swap my lair historically as soon as I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.249 
I swap my lair historically as soon as I
move<00:01:41.390> this<00:01:41.509> control<00:01:41.720> we<00:01:42.350> would<00:01:42.500> see<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:44.259> send

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
move this control we would see the send

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.109 
move this control we would see the send
a<00:01:45.439> come<00:01:46.009> flicking<00:01:46.399> around<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.789> position

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
a come flicking around to the position

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.910 
a come flicking around to the position
of<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.299> controller<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:48.320> if<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.500> watch<00:01:48.679> we

of the controller but if you watch we

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.859 
of the controller but if you watch we
have<00:01:49.039> to<00:01:49.189> go<00:01:49.369> down<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.330> position<00:01:50.750> that

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
have to go down to the position that

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.730 
have to go down to the position that
send<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.259> is<00:01:51.409> in<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.860> pick<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.130> up<00:01:52.929> there<00:01:53.929> bring
