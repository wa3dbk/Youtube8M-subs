00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
so just happen array looking for spots

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.470 
so just happen array looking for spots
close<00:00:10.120> inshore<00:00:10.360> I<00:00:10.660> can<00:00:11.139> check<00:00:11.590> this<00:00:12.480> power

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
close inshore I can check this power

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.539 
close inshore I can check this power
worm<00:00:13.840> thing<00:00:14.320> that<00:00:14.530> I'm<00:00:14.679> fishing<00:00:14.889> and<00:00:15.280> it's

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
worm thing that I'm fishing and it's

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.330 
worm thing that I'm fishing and it's
weedless<00:00:16.029> so<00:00:16.270> it's<00:00:17.170> kind<00:00:17.680> of<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:17.860> opposite<00:00:18.279> of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
weedless so it's kind of the opposite of

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.990 
weedless so it's kind of the opposite of
what<00:00:18.550> I<00:00:18.580> normally<00:00:18.700> do<00:00:19.270> so<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:21.430> searching<00:00:21.970> for

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
what I normally do so it's searching for

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.450 
what I normally do so it's searching for
the<00:00:22.300> we<00:00:22.510> do<00:00:22.720> staggie<00:00:23.170> as<00:00:23.410> places<00:00:23.859> I<00:00:24.010> can<00:00:24.189> find

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
the we do staggie as places I can find

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.620 
the we do staggie as places I can find
and<00:00:25.019> I've<00:00:26.019> got<00:00:26.199> one<00:00:26.380> of<00:00:26.410> these<00:00:26.849> power<00:00:27.849> worms<00:00:28.240> I

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
and I've got one of these power worms I

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.810 
and I've got one of these power worms I
think<00:00:29.170> it's<00:00:29.320> called<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.650> Kenko<00:00:30.220> something<00:00:30.670> like

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
think it's called a Kenko something like

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.110 
think it's called a Kenko something like
that<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:32.820> seven<00:00:33.820> gram<00:00:34.120> conehead<00:00:34.989> led<00:00:36.120> just

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
that and seven gram conehead led just

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.060 
that and seven gram conehead led just
slides<00:00:37.420> on

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.029 

20<00:00:40.820> pound<00:00:41.089> fluorocarbon<00:00:41.870> something<00:00:42.859> like

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
20 pound fluorocarbon something like

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.380 
20 pound fluorocarbon something like
that<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:44.510> just<00:00:45.260> Texas<00:00:46.190> Rick<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:46.519> worm<00:00:46.670> so

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
that and just Texas Rick the worm so

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.360 
that and just Texas Rick the worm so
we've<00:00:47.510> got<00:00:47.659> a<00:00:47.690> special<00:00:47.929> hook<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.190> can

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
we've got a special hook that you can

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.459 
we've got a special hook that you can
see<00:00:49.930> rigging<00:00:50.930> them<00:00:51.079> like<00:00:51.260> this

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.490 

put<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.800> hook<00:00:54.980> in

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.690 

and<00:00:57.830> then<00:00:58.070> Nick

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
and then Nick

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.740 
and then Nick
to<00:01:00.910> make<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.810> hook<00:01:02.760> through<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:04.059> side<00:01:04.330> of<00:01:04.360> the

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
to make the hook through the side of the

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.330 
to make the hook through the side of the
world

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.940 

and<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> idea<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.509> that<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> fish<00:01:13.619> takes

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and the idea is that when a fish takes

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.010 
and the idea is that when a fish takes
it<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:15.780> pull<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> hook<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.810> when

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it it will pull the hook out but when

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.529 
it it will pull the hook out but when
you're<00:01:19.170> fishing<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.850> around<00:01:20.850> weeds<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
you're fishing it around weeds and

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.929 
you're fishing it around weeds and
things<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.890> hook<00:01:23.159> doesn't<00:01:23.700> get

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
things like that the hook doesn't get

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.660 
things like that the hook doesn't get
stuck<00:01:24.329> here<00:01:25.079> on<00:01:25.289> rocks<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> seaweed<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.520> can

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
stuck here on rocks and seaweed you can

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.289 
stuck here on rocks and seaweed you can
see<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> hook<00:01:27.119> doesn't<00:01:27.330> stick<00:01:27.689> out<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:30.149> can

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
see the hook doesn't stick out you can

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
see the hook doesn't stick out you can
see<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.539> fish<00:01:30.960> grabbed<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
see a fish grabbed it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.429 
see a fish grabbed it
it<00:01:32.039> would<00:01:32.310> hook<00:01:32.490> itself<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.810> hopefully<00:01:33.990> we'll

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it would hook itself and hopefully we'll

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.609 
it would hook itself and hopefully we'll
see<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.039> a<00:01:35.100> minute<00:01:35.810> little<00:01:36.810> fishing<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
see that in a minute little fishing is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.300 
see that in a minute little fishing is
all<00:01:37.770> about<00:01:37.799> feel<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.530> using<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.679> eyes<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
all about feel and using your eyes to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.169 
all about feel and using your eyes to
find<00:01:41.549> little<00:01:41.850> spots<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.509> little<00:01:42.750> breaks<00:01:44.179> and

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
find little spots and little breaks and

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.260 
find little spots and little breaks and
the<00:01:45.299> idea<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> cast<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> feel<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the idea is you cast a and you feel the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.809 
the idea is you cast a and you feel the
lure<00:01:51.539> as<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.929> comes<00:01:52.140> back<00:01:52.439> you'll<00:01:52.679> you'll<00:01:53.490> feel

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
lure as it comes back you'll you'll feel

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.300 
lure as it comes back you'll you'll feel
it<00:01:53.970> touch<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> bottom<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.039> want<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it touch the bottom and then you want to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.910 
it touch the bottom and then you want to
bounce<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.240> over<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.959> bottom<00:01:58.349> because

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
bounce it just over the bottom because

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.120 
bounce it just over the bottom because
you're<00:01:59.759> using<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.149> weedless<00:02:00.390> setup<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.799> have

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you're using a weedless setup you have

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.820 
you're using a weedless setup you have
to<00:02:02.310> worry<00:02:02.520> too<00:02:03.090> much<00:02:03.119> about<00:02:03.959> it<00:02:04.349> getting

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
to worry too much about it getting

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.809 
to worry too much about it getting
snagged<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.209> will<00:02:06.390> lose<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.899> lure

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
snagged you do you will lose your lure
