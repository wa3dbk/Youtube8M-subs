00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.560 

in<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.040> short<00:00:02.100> demo<00:00:02.700> I'm<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.120> show<00:00:03.330> how

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
in this short demo I'm going to show how

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.309 
in this short demo I'm going to show how
I<00:00:03.810> organize<00:00:04.110> my<00:00:04.940> jobs<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.270> data<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:06.839> Lightroom

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
I organize my jobs and data in Lightroom

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.440 
I organize my jobs and data in Lightroom
and<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:08.370> think<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> fairly<00:00:09.059> efficient

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and I think this is a fairly efficient

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.640 
and I think this is a fairly efficient
method<00:00:09.719> though<00:00:09.900> there<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.320> other<00:00:10.530> methods

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
method though there are other methods

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.549 
method though there are other methods
that<00:00:11.250> I'm<00:00:11.400> also<00:00:11.580> considering<00:00:12.059> doing<00:00:12.559> I've

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
that I'm also considering doing I've

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.379 
that I'm also considering doing I've
opened<00:00:13.830> like<00:00:14.009> right<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.280> here<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.910> all<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
opened like right up here with all of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.240 
opened like right up here with all of
the<00:00:15.450> photographs<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.289> catalog<00:00:16.770> selected

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the photographs in the catalog selected

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.519 
the photographs in the catalog selected
but<00:00:17.789> when<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> shoot<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.480> specific<00:00:19.140> job<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
but when I shoot a specific job for a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.830 
but when I shoot a specific job for a
client<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.180> organize<00:00:21.539> them<00:00:21.750> on

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
client what I do is I organize them on

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.029 
client what I do is I organize them on
the<00:00:21.930> hard<00:00:22.109> drive<00:00:22.320> by<00:00:23.250> job<00:00:24.150> ID<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.650> go<00:00:25.680> into

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the hard drive by job ID so if I go into

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.689 
the hard drive by job ID so if I go into
my<00:00:26.689> folder<00:00:27.689> area<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.199> Lightroom<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:29.550> thing

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
my folder area in Lightroom first thing

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.310 
my folder area in Lightroom first thing
I'll<00:00:29.789> draw<00:00:29.939> attention<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> number<00:00:31.289> of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I'll draw attention to is the number of

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.870 
I'll draw attention to is the number of
hard<00:00:31.650> drives<00:00:31.949> I'm<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.550> hide<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
hard drives I'm just going to hide the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.430 
hard drives I'm just going to hide the
navigator<00:00:33.270> window<00:00:33.480> open<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
navigator window open so we can see that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.580 
navigator window open so we can see that
a<00:00:34.500> bit<00:00:34.649> better<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.870> what<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
a bit better and what we can see here is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.330 
a bit better and what we can see here is
that<00:00:37.770> my<00:00:38.160> folder<00:00:38.579> area<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.420> two<00:00:39.719> three

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
that my folder area I have one two three

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.130 
that my folder area I have one two three
three<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.760> hard<00:00:42.000> drives<00:00:42.360> which<00:00:42.660> show<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
three or so hard drives which show the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.040 
three or so hard drives which show the
c1<00:00:43.710> fact<00:00:44.010> three<00:00:44.190> four<00:00:44.520> five<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.840> grayed

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
c1 fact three four five which are grayed

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
c1 fact three four five which are grayed
out<00:00:46.079> these<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.710> off<00:00:46.860> line<00:00:47.129> drives<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.760> these

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
out these are off line drives so these

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
out these are off line drives so these
contain<00:00:48.360> data<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.289> currently<00:00:49.649> not

contain data that are currently not

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
drives that I can access at a later date

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.569 
drives that I can access at a later date
if<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.449> plug<00:00:54.660> them<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.989> via<00:00:55.170> USB<00:00:55.500> my<00:00:56.309> main

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
cataloguing drives are these six that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
cataloguing drives are these six that
are<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.120> which<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.510> always<00:01:01.440> online<00:01:01.620> because

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
are here which are always online because

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.619 
are here which are always online because
they're<00:01:02.219> installed<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> mac<00:01:03.120> pro<00:01:03.300> tower

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
they're installed in the mac pro tower

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.080 
they're installed in the mac pro tower
itself<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.799> I've<00:01:04.890> currently<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.670> four

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
itself and I've currently got about four

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
itself and I've currently got about four
well<00:01:06.450> 1<00:01:06.990> 2<00:01:07.500> 3<00:01:07.530> 4<00:01:08.280> 5<00:01:08.640> 1<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.689> 1.5<00:01:09.869> terabyte<00:01:10.530> drives

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
well 1 2 3 4 5 1 to 1.5 terabyte drives

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.499 
well 1 2 3 4 5 1 to 1.5 terabyte drives
and<00:01:11.909> 1<00:01:12.090> 2<00:01:12.360> terabyte<00:01:12.869> drive<00:01:14.299> installed<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and 1 2 terabyte drive installed in the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.020 
and 1 2 terabyte drive installed in the
system<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.530> lot<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> capacity<00:01:17.030> now

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
system so that's a lot of capacity now

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
system so that's a lot of capacity now
what<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.220> technique<00:01:20.220> which<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
what I do is I use a technique which I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.820 
what I do is I use a technique which I
read<00:01:21.060> about<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:21.990> while<00:01:22.170> ago<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> digital

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
read about some while ago in the digital

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.520 
read about some while ago in the digital
asset<00:01:23.220> management<00:01:23.250> book<00:01:24.259> which<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.409> designed

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
asset management book which was designed

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.740 
asset management book which was designed
really<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.040> CD<00:01:26.310> ROMs<00:01:26.549> where<00:01:26.850> data<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:27.450> backed

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
really for CD ROMs where data was backed

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.620 
really for CD ROMs where data was backed
up<00:01:27.900> onto<00:01:28.080> CD<00:01:28.350> ROMs<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.100> gigabyte<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
up onto CD ROMs in one gigabyte or the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.230 
up onto CD ROMs in one gigabyte or the
say<00:01:30.780> five<00:01:31.020> gigabytes<00:01:31.380> units<00:01:32.189> what<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
say five gigabytes units what I do is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.140 
say five gigabytes units what I do is
all<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.640> subdirectories<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.970> keep

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
all of all of the subdirectories I keep

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.100 
all of all of the subdirectories I keep
my<00:01:36.270> images<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.020> stored<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.689> 500<00:01:39.689> gigabyte

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
my images in are stored in 500 gigabyte

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.870 
my images in are stored in 500 gigabyte
units<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.070> reason<00:01:41.310> I've<00:01:41.400> done<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.729> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
units the reason I've done this is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.190 
units the reason I've done this is
because<00:01:42.030> I've<00:01:42.119> got<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> lot<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.509> hard<00:01:42.899> drives

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
because I've got a lot of hard drives

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800 
because I've got a lot of hard drives
sure<00:01:43.590> 500<00:01:44.100> gigabytes<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.640> size<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.630> can

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
sure 500 gigabytes in size and I can

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.480 
sure 500 gigabytes in size and I can
make<00:01:45.990> physical<00:01:46.259> backups<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> those<00:01:47.159> drives

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
make physical backups on to those drives

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.200 
make physical backups on to those drives

with several of those that are scattered
across<00:02:53.260> different<00:02:53.769> drives<00:02:54.180> doesn't<00:02:55.180> really

across different drives doesn't really

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.440 
across different drives doesn't really
matter<00:02:55.599> that<00:02:55.959> those<00:02:56.470> drives<00:02:57.000> don't<00:02:58.000> hold<00:02:58.180> each

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
matter that those drives don't hold each

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.020 
matter that those drives don't hold each
one<00:02:58.659> in<00:02:58.810> date<00:02:58.989> order<00:02:59.129> because<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.609> searching

capabilities of lightroom you know i

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.670 
capabilities of lightroom you know i
could<00:03:03.099> find<00:03:03.370> anything<00:03:03.519> really<00:03:03.909> quickly<00:03:04.329> just

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
could find anything really quickly just

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.470 
could find anything really quickly just
by<00:03:05.680> using<00:03:05.889> the<00:03:06.069> search<00:03:06.280> capabilities<00:03:06.879> I<00:03:07.180> don't

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
by using the search capabilities I don't

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.990 
by using the search capabilities I don't
really<00:03:07.629> need<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.900> go<00:03:08.049> bit<00:03:08.739> by<00:03:08.919> bit<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.819> if<00:03:09.939> I

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
really need to go bit by bit so if I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.479 
really need to go bit by bit so if I
click<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.329> that<00:03:10.389> I<00:03:10.540> can<00:03:10.810> see<00:03:10.959> all<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.489> 8400

that's how I organize my roars now
within<00:04:16.900> that

this<00:04:41.919> is<00:04:42.039> really<00:04:42.190> just<00:04:42.280> about<00:04:42.610> categorizing

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
this is really just about categorizing

this is really just about categorizing
the<00:04:43.570> raw<00:04:43.720> files<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.350> perhaps<00:04:44.889> my<00:04:45.160> picks<00:04:45.430> for

the raw files and perhaps my picks for
that<00:04:45.699> particular<00:04:45.850> job<00:04:46.320> what<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.350> do<00:04:47.470> instead<00:04:47.860> is

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
that particular job what I do instead is

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.370 
that particular job what I do instead is
I<00:04:48.190> use<00:04:48.270> collections<00:04:49.270> within<00:04:49.750> Lightroom<00:04:50.199> for

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
I use collections within Lightroom for

I use collections within Lightroom for
doing<00:04:50.560> all<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:51.009> work<00:04:51.039> flow<00:04:51.370> stuff<00:04:51.789> so<00:04:52.509> if<00:04:52.630> I

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
doing all of the work flow stuff so if I

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.990 
doing all of the work flow stuff so if I
hide<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.169> folders<00:04:53.500> away<00:04:53.740> what<00:04:54.400> I'll<00:04:54.520> have<00:04:54.729> is

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
hide the folders away what I'll have is

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.150 
hide the folders away what I'll have is
a<00:04:55.030> parallel<00:04:55.509> structure<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:55.990> collections<00:04:56.470> that

a parallel structure in collections that

doing<00:04:58.840> now<00:04:59.710> I<00:04:59.770> actually<00:05:00.729> number<00:05:01.919> subsections

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
doing now I actually number subsections

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.120 
doing now I actually number subsections
of<00:05:03.130> my<00:05:03.970> collection<00:05:04.479> hierarchy<00:05:05.289> so<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:06.009> I<00:05:06.039> can

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
of my collection hierarchy so that I can

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.810 
of my collection hierarchy so that I can
control<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:06.940> ordering<00:05:07.449> of<00:05:07.539> these<00:05:07.720> things

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
control the ordering of these things

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.100 
control the ordering of these things
without<00:05:09.820> having<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.360> have<00:05:10.509> alphabetical

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
I've done here is I've created a

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.779 
I've done here is I've created a
separate<00:06:01.539> series<00:06:02.409> of<00:06:02.710> collections<00:06:03.310> of<00:06:03.400> images

separate series of collections of images

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.600 
separate series of collections of images
that<00:06:04.000> are<00:06:04.229> completely<00:06:05.229> arbitrary<00:06:05.590> what<00:06:06.490> I<00:06:06.520> do

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
that are completely arbitrary what I do

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.810 
that are completely arbitrary what I do
is<00:06:06.820> I<00:06:06.940> use<00:06:06.970> it<00:06:07.419> in<00:06:08.229> it<00:06:08.409> I<00:06:08.620> use<00:06:09.099> it<00:06:09.250> to<00:06:09.400> implement

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
is I use it in it I use it to implement

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.330 
is I use it in it I use it to implement
of<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.180> workflow<00:06:10.690> so<00:06:11.530> I<00:06:11.560> have<00:06:11.800> collections

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
of a workflow so I have collections

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.490 
of a workflow so I have collections
which<00:06:12.610> tell<00:06:12.909> me<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.570> specific<00:06:13.930> sets<00:06:14.259> of<00:06:14.380> the

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
which tell me the specific sets of the

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.860 
which tell me the specific sets of the
workflow<00:06:15.370> images<00:06:15.820> after<00:06:16.449> my<00:06:16.690> initial

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:16.290 
is spotted they'll be removed from this
collection<00:07:14.639> and<00:07:15.639> then<00:07:15.789> there's<00:07:15.969> one<00:07:16.119> here

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300
