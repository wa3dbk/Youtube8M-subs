here<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.590> underlying<00:00:38.309> threat<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.059> almost

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
here this underlying threat of almost

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.590 
here this underlying threat of almost
this<00:00:40.010> cosmic<00:00:41.010> attachment<00:00:41.820> between<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this cosmic attachment between all the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.700 
this cosmic attachment between all the
characters<00:00:43.140> yeah<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.280> there<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:45.710> key
