somebody<00:01:38.490> well<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> break<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.270> comes<00:01:39.509> with

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
plus 3 fire rated just gonna take more

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.469

shots<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.790> kill<00:01:41.909> somebody<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
shots to kill somebody because it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.639 
shots to kill somebody because it

you guys to my score at the end of the
game<00:02:09.250> I'm<00:02:09.670> not<00:02:09.819> trying<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.179> brag<00:02:10.300> or<00:02:10.509> anything

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
game I'm not trying to brag or anything

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.170 
game I'm not trying to brag or anything
but<00:02:11.340> definitely<00:02:12.340> think<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.790> weapon<00:02:13.090> would

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
but definitely think this weapon would

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.759 
but definitely think this weapon would
be<00:02:13.300> better<00:02:13.480> than<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.720> breakneck<00:02:13.930> if<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.319> had<00:02:14.620> it

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
be better than the breakneck if I had it

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.470 
be better than the breakneck if I had it
hopefully<00:02:15.250> I'll<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.940> next<00:02:16.209> supply

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
hopefully I'll get it in the next supply

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.479 
hopefully I'll get it in the next supply
ship<00:02:16.690> opening<00:02:17.170> video<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.470> do<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.950> master<00:02:18.370> one

ship opening video I do a master one
that<00:02:18.610> will<00:02:18.790> be<00:02:19.000> probably<00:02:19.780> for<00:02:20.110> quite<00:02:20.260> some

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
that will be probably for quite some

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.630 
that will be probably for quite some
time<00:02:20.440> because<00:02:20.800> there's<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.069> nothing<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
of the break neck itself how much you

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.600 
of the break neck itself how much you

like<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.180> don't<00:02:35.019> know<00:02:35.200> my<00:02:35.410> personal<00:02:35.799> opinion

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
like it I don't know my personal opinion

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.770 
like it I don't know my personal opinion
I<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.340> think<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.580> wouldn't<00:02:36.790> be<00:02:36.940> as<00:02:37.239> good<00:02:37.630> as<00:02:37.750> a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
I just think it wouldn't be as good as a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.370 
I just think it wouldn't be as good as a
genuine<00:02:38.200> our<00:02:38.519> pre<00:02:39.519> our<00:02:39.819> own<00:02:40.090> homemade<00:02:40.690> our

made<00:02:44.319> KF<00:02:44.950> five<00:02:45.099> breakneck<00:02:45.430> since<00:02:46.000> we're

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
made KF five breakneck since we're

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.220 
made KF five breakneck since we're
dealing<00:02:46.239> with<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.569> high<00:02:46.720> rate<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:46.959> fire<00:02:47.079> I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
dealing with the high rate of fire I

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.170 
dealing with the high rate of fire I
definitely<00:02:47.680> suggest<00:02:47.980> putting<00:02:48.400> on<00:02:48.700> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
definitely suggest putting on the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.580 
definitely suggest putting on the
foregrip<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:50.079> so<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.230> have<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.349> little<00:02:50.500> bit

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
foregrip just so you have a little bit

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.229 
foregrip just so you have a little bit
more<00:02:50.769> control<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.310> less<00:02:51.549> recoil<00:02:51.790> while

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
more control and less recoil while

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.720 
more control and less recoil while
shooting<00:02:52.599> this<00:02:53.140> weapon<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:54.010> last<00:02:54.220> attachment

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
shooting this weapon you last attachment

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.890 
shooting this weapon you last attachment
could<00:02:54.819> be<00:02:54.910> whatever<00:02:55.060> think<00:02:55.299> you<00:02:55.390> guys<00:02:55.510> want

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
could be whatever think you guys want

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.030 
could be whatever think you guys want
you<00:02:56.110> don't<00:02:56.200> even<00:02:56.319> have<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.620> put<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:56.860> third

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
you don't even have to put a third

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.199 
you don't even have to put a third
attachment<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.640> don't<00:02:57.819> want<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.150> i

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
attachment if you don't want to i

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.789 
attachment if you don't want to i
usually<00:02:58.569> do<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.959> i'd<00:02:59.470> highly<00:02:59.680> suggest

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
usually do and i'd highly suggest

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.559 
usually do and i'd highly suggest
putting<00:03:00.280> on<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.700> extended<00:03:01.120> mags<00:03:01.329> just

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
putting on the extended mags just

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.420 
putting on the extended mags just
because<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.900> rate<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.140> fire<00:03:02.380> really<00:03:02.980> depletes

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
because the rate of fire really depletes

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.100 
because the rate of fire really depletes
the<00:03:03.549> amount<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.849> bullets<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.690> your<00:03:04.930> magazine
