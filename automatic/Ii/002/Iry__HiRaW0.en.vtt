I<00:01:03.910> think<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:05.350> Alanis<00:01:05.650> is<00:01:05.770> coming<00:01:06.100> he's<00:01:06.370> done<00:01:06.520> a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
I think the Alanis is coming he's done a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.190 
I think the Alanis is coming he's done a
very<00:01:06.729> good<00:01:06.850> job<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.300> he's<00:01:07.330> gotten<00:01:07.690> very<00:01:07.870> well

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
very good job and he's gotten very well

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.560

using<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.830> Jag<00:01:09.070> eating<00:01:09.400> lots<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.670> shots<00:01:09.880> but<00:01:10.510> I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
using the Jag eating lots of shots but I

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.380 
using the Jag eating lots of shots but I
think<00:01:10.780> people<00:01:10.930> will<00:01:11.800> maybe<00:01:12.130> expect<00:01:13.120> a<00:01:13.210> bit

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
think people will maybe expect a bit
