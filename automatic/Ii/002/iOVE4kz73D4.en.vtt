00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello paul please tell me 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.750
 how to choose the aquarium and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.750
 equipment 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.019
 apartment cleaning hello key 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.389
 the difference between aquarism and content 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.660
 any other animals lies in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.560
 that aquarium is kind 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 existing 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.920
 which all must be settled all 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 connected if the book is from a small church 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.730
 you can let go for a walk from 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.730
 time with fish this trick will not work 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.699
 accordingly, the volume is more convenient than 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.230
 those within 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.839
 availability of place and immediately opportunity 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.010
 read larger aquarium 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.979
 certain errors i.e. if 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.079
 small volume you slightly overfed 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:59.079
 fish you can sport something behind it 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.359
 the fish we create will benefit the big 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.320
 volume with this is easier 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:10.330
 no batteries are recycled 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.119
 there are no special problems whatsoever 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.280
 except the aquarium itself 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.399
 if the aquarium is more or less large 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.770
 they may need a stand because 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.940
 that not every table will be discharged without 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.250
 normal aquarium 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.049
 if very roughly the volume of the aquarium 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.539
 nominal but multiply 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.670
 about one and a half times random 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.310
 kill a kilo that is an aquarium on 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.819
 a hundred liters will weigh about 150 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:45.099
 kilogram it is clear that the desk 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:47.739
 sds-plus line will collapse except the most 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.160
 aquarium needs some kind of system 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:52.149
 filtering 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.569
 depending on the volume it can be 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.950
 internal filters 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.399
 different types can be a little 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 external 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:13.310
 also filtering is involved on the bear 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:17.180
 settle bacteria that decompose 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.180
 scientific information is not so 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.769
 in some cases you may need 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:31.379
 heating operation 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:34.500
 Well, this is not always the case either. 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.959
 to speed up the process 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.980
 use water conditioners to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:45.150
 there was no need to defend and 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.459
 Steve substitutions need it or some sort 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.000
 hose incoming length the best option 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:59.129
 This immediately code aquarium and to sink 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.819
 or clever men can get it all with 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.659
 it doesn't even 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.659
 thank
