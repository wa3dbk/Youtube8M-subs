00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
were a bit tough to get used to me

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.570 
were a bit tough to get used to me
personally<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.680> only<00:02:37.860> thing<00:02:38.070> similar<00:02:38.340> to

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
personally the only thing similar to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.010 
personally the only thing similar to
like<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> call<00:02:39.030> duty<00:02:39.240> was<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> trigger<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
like a call duty was a trigger in the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.230 
like a call duty was a trigger in the
eighth<00:02:40.230> other<00:02:40.950> than<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.640> mean<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.060> then

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
eighth other than that I mean and then

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.110 
eighth other than that I mean and then
your<00:02:42.450> access<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.190> know<00:02:44.310> your<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
your access your you know your the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.760 
your access your you know your the
control<00:02:45.480> sticks<00:02:45.810> other<00:02:46.110> than<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.620> was<00:02:46.680> a

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
control sticks other than that it was a

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.440 
control sticks other than that it was a
little<00:02:46.950> bit<00:02:47.100> different<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.360> little

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
little bit different to be a little

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.630 
little bit different to be a little
while<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.840> get<00:02:48.959> used<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.380> which<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.340> kind<00:02:50.550> of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
while to get used to which is kind of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.699 
while to get used to which is kind of
cool<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:51.150> mean<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.110> always<00:02:52.350> hard<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.590> get

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
cool I mean but it's always hard to get

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.110 
cool I mean but it's always hard to get
used<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> different<00:02:53.130> type<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.580> game<00:02:53.880> when

beta's<00:04:10.380> enemy<00:04:10.680> 3v3<00:04:11.070> or<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.760> game<00:04:11.940> itself<00:04:12.269> but

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
beta's enemy 3v3 or the game itself but

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.340 
beta's enemy 3v3 or the game itself but
I<00:04:12.810> really<00:04:13.560> enjoyed<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:14.010> part<00:04:15.229> the<00:04:16.229> other

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
that were easy to figure out and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.809 
that were easy to figure out and
understand<00:04:28.259> and<00:04:29.259> that's<00:04:30.099> why<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.310> feel<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.610> lot

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.629 
that to like a juggernaut and a few
other<00:05:07.690> ones<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.349> that's<00:05:08.919> it<00:05:09.069> you<00:05:09.219> get<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.490> one

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
other ones and that's it you get the one

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.339 
other ones and that's it you get the one
perk<00:05:09.849> and<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.449> thought<00:05:10.629> that<00:05:10.690> was<00:05:10.900> so<00:05:11.139> cool

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
perk and I thought that was so cool

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.659 
perk and I thought that was so cool
because<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:14.080> know<00:05:14.229> you<00:05:14.289> don't<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.860> most<00:05:15.580> of

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
because you know you don't it most of

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.279 
because you know you don't it most of
the<00:05:15.759> games<00:05:15.909> are<00:05:16.060> just<00:05:16.210> so<00:05:16.300> overly<00:05:16.719> complicated

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
the games are just so overly complicated

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.589 
the games are just so overly complicated
now<00:05:17.500> with<00:05:18.069> all<00:05:18.430> these<00:05:18.729> different<00:05:19.000> like<00:05:19.300> three

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
now with all these different like three

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.379

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
I thought I I'm not gonna say I hated it

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.149 
I thought I I'm not gonna say I hated it
but<00:05:33.490> that<00:05:33.669> I<00:05:33.699> didn't<00:05:34.060> like<00:05:34.240> is<00:05:34.779> that<00:05:35.680> like

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
mostly the shooting itself was in a

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.999 
mostly the shooting itself was in a
cover<00:05:38.469> system<00:05:39.240> like<00:05:40.409> it<00:05:41.409> wasn't<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:41.830> lot<00:05:41.979> of

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
cover system like it wasn't a lot of

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.499 
cover system like it wasn't a lot of

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
cover like pretty much the whole game

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:50.969 
cover like pretty much the whole game
was<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.690> cover<00:05:49.900> system<00:05:50.169> as<00:05:50.440> you<00:05:50.560> can<00:05:50.710> if<00:05:50.889> you

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
with scopes an enemy

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.640 
with scopes an enemy
so<00:06:41.020> I<00:06:41.050> mean<00:06:41.500> it<00:06:41.590> was<00:06:41.650> pretty<00:06:41.860> cool<00:06:42.150> but<00:06:43.150> uh<00:06:43.650> all

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
so I mean it was pretty cool but uh all

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.980 
so I mean it was pretty cool but uh all
in<00:06:44.830> all<00:06:44.950> I<00:06:45.190> would<00:06:45.220> I<00:06:45.520> would<00:06:45.640> rate<00:06:45.940> this<00:06:46.090> game<00:06:46.330> on

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
in all I would I would rate this game on

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.600 
in all I would I would rate this game on
a<00:06:47.050> scale<00:06:47.560> of<00:06:47.590> zero<00:06:47.890> to<00:06:47.950> five<00:06:48.190> i<00:06:48.220> would<00:06:48.430> give<00:06:48.550> it

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
a scale of zero to five i would give it

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.460 
a scale of zero to five i would give it
a<00:06:48.700> 4<00:06:48.910> it's<00:06:49.060> definitely<00:06:49.450> worth<00:06:49.630> the<00:06:49.990> for<00:06:50.380> an

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
a 4 it's definitely worth the for an

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.550 
a 4 it's definitely worth the for an
arky<00:06:50.800> game<00:06:51.040> and<00:06:51.250> how<00:06:51.910> smooth<00:06:52.300> it<00:06:52.480> was<00:06:52.630> in<00:06:53.080> the

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
arky game and how smooth it was in the

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.590 
arky game and how smooth it was in the
gameplay<00:06:53.980> itself<00:06:54.040> it's<00:06:54.760> definitely<00:06:55.150> worth

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
gameplay itself it's definitely worth

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.220
