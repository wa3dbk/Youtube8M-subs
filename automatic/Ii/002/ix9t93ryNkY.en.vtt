all right today's tool day next tool in
the<00:00:12.330> job<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> table<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:14.129> a<00:00:14.160> table<00:00:14.879> that

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
the job is a table with a table that

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.290 
the job is a table with a table that
allow<00:00:15.179> me<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.360> cut<00:00:15.660> 90<00:00:15.959> degrees<00:00:16.910> and<00:00:17.910> also

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
allow me to cut 90 degrees and also

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.660 
allow me to cut 90 degrees and also
maybe<00:00:18.450> round<00:00:18.840> over<00:00:19.200> the<00:00:20.039> sandal

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
maybe round over the sandal

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.120 
maybe round over the sandal
done<00:00:21.269> a<00:00:21.300> video<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.320> sandal<00:00:22.710> yet<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.039> it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
done a video on the sandal yet but it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.679 
done a video on the sandal yet but it
doesn't<00:00:23.400> really<00:00:23.490> have<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> lot<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.029> 90-degree

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
doesn't really have a lot of 90-degree

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.370 
doesn't really have a lot of 90-degree
corners<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.380> little<00:00:25.619> bit<00:00:25.769> right<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
corners a little bit right here so I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.810 
corners a little bit right here so I
thought<00:00:28.590> I'd<00:00:28.650> build<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.009> table<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.670> since

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
thought I'd build a table for it since

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.470 
thought I'd build a table for it since
I'm<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> mood<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.420> building<00:00:31.410> tools<00:00:32.450> but<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
I'm in the mood for building tools but I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.090 
I'm in the mood for building tools but I
also<00:00:33.660> need<00:00:33.990> to<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.110> rounding<00:00:34.560> for<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:34.860> fire

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
also need to do rounding for my fire

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.840 
also need to do rounding for my fire
steels<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.530> they'll<00:00:37.530> try<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.740> end<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.220> with<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
steels so they'll try to end up with you

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.370 
steels so they'll try to end up with you
know<00:00:38.970> maybe<00:00:39.240> two<00:00:39.420> corners<00:00:39.810> that<00:00:39.990> are<00:00:40.080> square

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
know maybe two corners that are square

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.310 
know maybe two corners that are square
and<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:41.400> corners<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.850> are<00:00:41.910> rounded<00:00:42.330> so<00:00:42.480> I'm

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and two corners that are rounded so I'm

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.940 
and two corners that are rounded so I'm
going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.560> use<00:00:43.740> a<00:00:44.000> truck<00:00:45.000> axle

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.070 

as<00:00:50.640> my<00:00:51.240> base<00:00:51.720> stock

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.110 

this<00:00:55.530> user<00:00:55.800> goes<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:58.970> alright<00:00:59.970> here

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
this user goes from there alright here

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580 
this user goes from there alright here
we<00:01:00.150> go<00:01:00.240> again<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.840> gonna<00:01:00.930> square<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.320> off

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we go again we're gonna square that off

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:19.460 
we go again we're gonna square that off
with<00:01:01.890> our<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.220> tool<00:01:17.780> let's<00:01:18.780> start<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
with our the tool let's start of it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:33.020 
with our the tool let's start of it
right<00:01:19.620> there

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.340 

we<00:01:34.030> will<00:01:34.270> heat<00:01:34.570> up<00:01:34.600> about<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:36.930> I'll<00:01:37.930> take<00:01:38.170> my

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
we will heat up about it I'll take my

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.650 
we will heat up about it I'll take my
time<00:01:38.560> at<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:39.010> again<00:01:39.310> I'm<00:01:39.430> trying<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.330> squeeze

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
time at it again I'm trying to squeeze

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.410 
time at it again I'm trying to squeeze
right<00:01:40.830> here<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:42.490> where<00:01:42.700> I'm<00:01:42.820> really<00:01:42.880> trying<00:01:43.360> to

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
right here is where I'm really trying to

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.760 
right here is where I'm really trying to
get<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.660> width<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.960> can<00:01:44.110> see<00:01:44.230> it<00:01:44.350> happening

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
get the width you can see it happening

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.390 
get the width you can see it happening
already

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
already

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:58.830 
already
oh<00:01:56.730> yeah<00:01:57.730> and<00:01:57.790> our<00:01:57.970> objective<00:01:58.480> is<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.600> make

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
oh yeah and our objective is to make

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.470 
oh yeah and our objective is to make
this<00:01:59.020> as<00:01:59.230> wide<00:01:59.470> as<00:01:59.650> possible<00:02:00.180> before<00:02:01.180> I<00:02:01.240> cut

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
this as wide as possible before I cut

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.170 
this as wide as possible before I cut
the<00:02:01.630> thing<00:02:01.840> off<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.440> I'm<00:02:02.560> gonna<00:02:02.680> keep<00:02:02.890> going<00:02:02.950> at

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
the thing off so I'm gonna keep going at

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.090 
the thing off so I'm gonna keep going at
we<00:02:05.720> should<00:02:05.930> just<00:02:06.050> cut<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.410> thing<00:02:06.590> off<00:02:06.770> and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
we should just cut the thing off and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.740 
we should just cut the thing off and
start<00:02:07.370> flattening<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.940> out<00:02:07.970> but<00:02:08.390> I'm<00:02:08.510> gonna<00:02:08.600> do

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
start flattening it out but I'm gonna do

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.140 
start flattening it out but I'm gonna do
one<00:02:08.900> more<00:02:09.110> at<00:02:09.740> least<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:10.130> more

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
one more at least one more

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.410 
one more at least one more
I<00:02:16.630> think<00:02:17.630> that's<00:02:17.810> long<00:02:18.050> enough<00:02:18.410> for<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> table

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
I think that's long enough for a table

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.060 
I think that's long enough for a table
and<00:02:20.420> we'll<00:02:20.630> probably<00:02:20.870> cut<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.350> somewhere<00:02:21.830> if

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
and we'll probably cut it somewhere if

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.290 
and we'll probably cut it somewhere if
in<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.640> area<00:02:23.090> here<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:24.550> little<00:02:25.550> higher<00:02:25.880> and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
in this area here a little higher and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.660 
in this area here a little higher and
then<00:02:26.420> try<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.750> bring<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.140> down<00:02:27.410> again<00:02:28.340> what

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
then try to bring that down again what

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.370 
then try to bring that down again what
I'm<00:02:28.760> trying<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.480> learn<00:02:29.720> how<00:02:29.780> not<00:02:30.050> to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
I'm trying to do is learn how not to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.740 
I'm trying to do is learn how not to
have<00:02:30.950> such<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> sharp<00:02:31.610> roll<00:02:32.030> here<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.390> want<00:02:32.630> to

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
have such a sharp roll here I want to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:42.690 
have such a sharp roll here I want to
squeeze<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.500> mature<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.890> little<00:02:34.100> more

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.569 

okay<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.730> don't<00:02:43.969> know<00:02:44.329> what<00:02:44.890> what<00:02:45.890> steals<00:02:46.249> in

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
okay I don't know what what steals in

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.849 
okay I don't know what what steals in
this<00:02:46.760> axle<00:02:47.269> but<00:02:47.450> it's

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
this axle but it's

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.050 
this axle but it's
that's<00:02:48.859> pretty<00:02:49.099> damn<00:02:49.340> hard<00:02:49.609> I<00:02:49.819> think<00:02:49.909> the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
that's pretty damn hard I think the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.349 
that's pretty damn hard I think the
cutoff<00:02:50.299> tool<00:02:50.629> take<00:02:50.989> care<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.379> rest<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.799> it

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
cutoff tool take care of the rest of it

00:02:52.359 --> 00:03:03.759 
cutoff tool take care of the rest of it
heat<00:02:53.359> it<00:02:53.389> up<00:02:53.629> for<00:02:53.900> that<00:03:01.569> yeah<00:03:02.569> I<00:03:03.049> think<00:03:03.620> it

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
heat it up for that yeah I think it

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.240 
heat it up for that yeah I think it
should<00:03:03.950> be<00:03:03.980> enough<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:06.230> hopefully<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:06.799> can<00:03:07.010> get

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
should be enough so hopefully I can get

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.240 
should be enough so hopefully I can get
enough<00:03:07.519> steel<00:03:07.790> out<00:03:07.969> of<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.389> make<00:03:08.889> tape

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:24.589 

please

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599
