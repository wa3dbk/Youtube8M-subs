00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
recommend and what this means is a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.470 
recommend and what this means is a
shorter<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.500> more<00:01:01.710> intense<00:01:02.190> style<00:01:02.699> exercise

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
shorter but more intense style exercise

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.870 
shorter but more intense style exercise
training<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.309> give<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.640> more

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
benefits for burning more fat and even

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.810 
benefits for burning more fat and even
studies<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.720> shown<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:10.979> shorter

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
studies have shown that the more shorter

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.109 
studies have shown that the more shorter
intense<00:01:12.630> style<00:01:12.900> training<00:01:13.229> increased

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
intense style training increased

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.090 
intense style training increased
post-workout<00:01:15.119> metabolism<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.200> two<00:01:16.500> days

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
post-workout metabolism for up two days

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.190 
post-workout metabolism for up two days
after<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.270> means<00:01:18.540> once<00:01:18.810> you've<00:01:18.990> worked

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
