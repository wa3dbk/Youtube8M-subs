this<00:00:36.219> battery<00:00:36.700> here<00:00:36.940> what<00:00:37.780> I've<00:00:37.899> done<00:00:38.079> is<00:00:39.070> just

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
this battery here what I've done is just

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590 
this battery here what I've done is just
started<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.840> peel<00:00:41.110> back<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.559> case<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:43.570> a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
started to peel back the case with a

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.080 
started to peel back the case with a
pair<00:00:44.020> of<00:00:44.140> side<00:00:44.379> cutters<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.760> what<00:00:45.879> you<00:00:45.969> can

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
pair of side cutters and what you can

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.360 
pair of side cutters and what you can
see<00:00:46.270> there<00:00:46.480> is<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:46.719> can<00:00:46.840> see<00:00:47.020> carbon<00:00:47.410> on<00:00:48.309> the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
see there is you can see carbon on the

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.029 
see there is you can see carbon on the
outside<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.840> there's<00:00:50.170> an<00:00:50.350> inner<00:00:50.500> core<00:00:50.829> this

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
outside and there's an inner core this

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.200 
outside and there's an inner core this
is<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:52.079> negative<00:00:53.079> this<00:00:53.530> end<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:55.090> an

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
is the negative this end there's an

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
is the negative this end there's an
inner<00:00:55.449> core

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 

pull<00:00:59.730> back

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.580 

to<00:01:02.460> reveal<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.060> inside

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 

so<00:01:07.950> I'll<00:01:08.040> show<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.520> more<00:01:08.549> light<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so I'll show you a bit more light in a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.580 
so I'll show you a bit more light in a
moment

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
moment

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.200 
moment
without<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> core

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
as a seed on it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.780 
as a seed on it
see<00:01:17.060> if<00:01:17.119> we<00:01:17.240> can<00:01:17.390> zoom<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.840> bit

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 

and<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.420> seal<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.080> basically<00:01:26.030> made<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and that seal is basically made of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.560 
and that seal is basically made of
rubber<00:01:28.640> which<00:01:29.640> means<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.180> very<00:01:30.390> good

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
rubber which means it's not very good

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.960 
rubber which means it's not very good
seal

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.700 

you<00:01:34.360> know<00:01:34.480> Waldo's<00:01:34.870> will<00:01:35.050> cut<00:01:35.230> away<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.530> rest

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
you know Waldo's will cut away the rest

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.069 
you know Waldo's will cut away the rest
of<00:01:35.830> this<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:37.170> show<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.200> what's<00:01:38.410> inside

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.599 

okay<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.799> I've<00:01:44.039> stripped<00:01:44.399> away

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
okay you can see here I've stripped away

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.929 
okay you can see here I've stripped away
some<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.569> the<00:01:45.840> remainder<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.460> outer<00:01:47.609> core

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
some of the remainder of the outer core

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.620 
some of the remainder of the outer core
and<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.509> an<00:01:48.600> inner<00:01:48.869> core<00:01:50.450> now<00:01:51.450> what

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and you can see an inner core now what

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.289 
and you can see an inner core now what
you've<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:51.929> in<00:01:52.109> that<00:01:52.350> inner<00:01:52.649> core<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.850> carbon

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you've got in that inner core is carbon

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
you've got in that inner core is carbon
around<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> outside<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> inner<00:01:56.399> core

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
around the outside and in the inner core

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.589 
around the outside and in the inner core
you<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.590> sludge<00:01:59.450> which<00:02:00.450> I'll

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
you have a kind of sludge which I'll

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.520 
you have a kind of sludge which I'll
show<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.109> if<00:02:01.319> I<00:02:01.469> scrape<00:02:01.799> some<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:03.349> now<00:02:04.349> these

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
show you if I scrape some out now these

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.580 
show you if I scrape some out now these
batteries<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:04.979> called<00:02:05.219> alkaline<00:02:05.700> batteries

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
batteries are called alkaline batteries

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.979 
batteries are called alkaline batteries
because<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.099> sludge<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.000> alkaline<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.690> used

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
because that sludge the alkaline is used

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.610 
because that sludge the alkaline is used
as<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> kind<00:02:10.799> of<00:02:11.810> electrolyte<00:02:12.810> which<00:02:13.349> allows

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
as a kind of electrolyte which allows

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.490 
as a kind of electrolyte which allows
the<00:02:14.220> sludge<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.700> conduct<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:16.230> what<00:02:16.319> that

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the sludge to conduct and what that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.949 
the sludge to conduct and what that
sludge<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.310> was<00:02:17.549> known<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.540> traders

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
sludge is is was known in the traders

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.770 
sludge is is was known in the traders
electroni<00:02:19.769> sludge<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:21.299> it's<00:02:21.420> actually

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
electroni sludge and it's actually

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.059 
electroni sludge and it's actually
bonded<00:02:22.349> pairs<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:24.110> metals<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.410> resonate<00:02:25.920> in

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
bonded pairs of metals that resonate in

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.660 
bonded pairs of metals that resonate in
harmony

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
harmony

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.090 
harmony
usually<00:02:28.540> it's<00:02:28.840> something<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.530> nickel

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
usually it's something like nickel

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.680 
usually it's something like nickel
cadmium<00:02:30.990> cadmium<00:02:31.990> or<00:02:32.230> nickel<00:02:32.650> hydride

the<00:02:38.380> pairs<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.770> metals<00:02:39.100> are<00:02:41.430> now<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:42.670> happens

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
the pairs of metals are now what happens

gives them a positive charge and when
the<00:03:03.070> battery<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.430> fully<00:03:03.670> charged<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.300> use

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
the battery is fully charged and you use

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.170 
the battery is fully charged and you use
it<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.170> an<00:03:05.350> application<00:03:05.500> like<00:03:06.070> your<00:03:06.250> camera<00:03:06.459> or

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
it in an application like your camera or

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.560 
it in an application like your camera or

happens<00:03:17.230> when<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.500> charge<00:03:17.800> your<00:03:17.980> battery<00:03:18.459> you

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
happens when you charge your battery you

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.190 
happens when you charge your battery you
align<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.989> atoms<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:22.480> battery<00:03:22.840> sludge

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
align the atoms in the battery sludge

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.949 
align the atoms in the battery sludge
all<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.550> certain<00:03:24.880> direction<00:03:25.030> similar<00:03:25.810> to

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
all in a certain direction similar to

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.130 
all in a certain direction similar to
when<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.680> charge<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.670> magnet<00:03:28.269> with<00:03:28.840> another

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
when you charge a magnet with another

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.380 
when you charge a magnet with another
magnet<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.130> all<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> atoms<00:03:30.730> line<00:03:31.030> up<00:03:31.209> in<00:03:31.330> a

up<00:03:33.790> as<00:03:33.970> best<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.420> they<00:03:34.720> can<00:03:34.780> possibly<00:03:34.900> be

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
up as best that they can possibly be

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.199 
up as best that they can possibly be
then<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.100> battery<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.489> considered<00:03:36.940> fully

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
then the battery is considered fully

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.319 
then the battery is considered fully
charged<00:03:37.750> okay<00:03:38.680> now<00:03:39.190> when<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.430> discharge<00:03:40.180> the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
charged okay now when you discharge the

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.140 
charged okay now when you discharge the
battery<00:03:40.360> ie<00:03:40.989> when<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.500> use<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:42.070> then<00:03:42.940> those

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
battery ie when you use it then those

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.190 
battery ie when you use it then those
pairs<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.900> atoms<00:03:44.820> begin<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:46.060> become<00:03:46.900> out<00:03:47.170> of

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
pairs of atoms begin to become out of

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.289 
pairs of atoms begin to become out of
alignment<00:03:47.700> when<00:03:48.700> they'll<00:03:48.880> completely

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
alignment when they'll completely

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.840 
alignment when they'll completely
disarrayed<00:03:50.190> then<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.400> battery<00:03:51.760> is

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
disarrayed then the battery is

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.870 
disarrayed then the battery is
considered<00:03:52.299> flat<00:03:53.579> another<00:03:54.579> thing<00:03:54.760> about

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
considered flat another thing about

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.539 
considered flat another thing about
these<00:03:55.380> alkaline<00:03:56.380> batteries<00:03:56.860> are<00:03:57.100> not<00:03:57.130> built

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
these alkaline batteries are not built

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.250 
these alkaline batteries are not built
to<00:03:57.730> last

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
to last

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.750 
to last
now<00:03:59.260> what<00:03:59.620> happens<00:03:59.920> they<00:04:00.070> tell<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.400> on<00:04:00.519> they

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
now what happens they tell you on they

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.490 
now what happens they tell you on they
tell<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.030> on<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.180> outside<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.900> packaging

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
tell you on the outside of the packaging

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.069 
tell you on the outside of the packaging
what<00:04:03.310> happens<00:04:03.579> if<00:04:03.730> we<00:04:04.209> try<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.510> recharge<00:04:04.900> it

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
what happens if we try and recharge it

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.470 
what happens if we try and recharge it
it<00:04:05.230> will<00:04:05.380> leak<00:04:05.590> or<00:04:05.890> explode<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.790> that's

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
it will leak or explode and that's

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.440 
it will leak or explode and that's
highly<00:04:07.840> likely<00:04:07.989> because<00:04:08.709> when<00:04:09.579> you<00:04:09.700> charge<00:04:10.090> it

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
highly likely because when you charge it

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.060 
highly likely because when you charge it
and<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.870> force<00:04:11.170> electric<00:04:11.620> current<00:04:11.920> through

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
and you force electric current through

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.460 
and you force electric current through
it<00:04:12.190> backwards<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:13.570> alkaline<00:04:13.959> solution<00:04:14.380> in

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
it backwards the alkaline solution in

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.740 
it backwards the alkaline solution in
there<00:04:14.650> starts<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.100> fizz<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.790> heat<00:04:16.030> up<00:04:16.269> react

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
there starts to fizz and heat up react

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.750 
there starts to fizz and heat up react
probably<00:04:17.650> wouldn't<00:04:17.950> explode

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
probably wouldn't explode

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.780 
probably wouldn't explode
you<00:04:18.850> put<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.480> on<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.630> bonfire<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:21.310> charged<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
you put it on a bonfire you charged it

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.250 
you put it on a bonfire you charged it
with<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.060> wrong<00:04:22.180> kind<00:04:22.480> of<00:04:22.570> charger<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.110> put

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
with the wrong kind of charger and put

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.770 
with the wrong kind of charger and put
too<00:04:23.590> much<00:04:23.740> electricity<00:04:24.160> through<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.640> but<00:04:25.630> then

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
too much electricity through it but then

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.860 
too much electricity through it but then
they've<00:04:26.140> designed<00:04:27.240> not<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.300> be<00:04:28.600> recharged

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.780 

now<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.380> feel<00:04:34.620> thinking<00:04:35.010> about<00:04:35.250> doing<00:04:35.669> this

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
now I feel thinking about doing this

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.939 
now I feel thinking about doing this
experiment<00:04:36.210> home<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:37.050> opening<00:04:37.380> opening<00:04:37.830> a

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
experiment home and opening opening a

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.040 
experiment home and opening opening a
battery<00:04:38.310> for<00:04:38.460> yourself<00:04:38.850> one<00:04:39.600> thing<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.900> want

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
battery for yourself one thing you want

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.560 
battery for yourself one thing you want
to<00:04:40.080> keep<00:04:40.260> in<00:04:40.410> mind<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:41.340> if<00:04:41.550> it's<00:04:41.699> a<00:04:42.060> nickel

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
to keep in mind is if it's a nickel

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.230 
to keep in mind is if it's a nickel
cadmium<00:04:42.780> battery<00:04:43.440> then<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.520> cadmium<00:04:44.729> is

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
cadmium battery then the cadmium is

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.070 
cadmium battery then the cadmium is
highly<00:04:45.750> toxic<00:04:46.280> it's<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.400> heavy<00:04:47.610> metal<00:04:47.900> you<00:04:48.900> can

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
highly toxic it's a heavy metal you can

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.170 
highly toxic it's a heavy metal you can
cause<00:04:49.320> here<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.650> into<00:04:50.040> your<00:04:50.130> skin<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.790> your

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
cause here it into your skin and your

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.870 
cause here it into your skin and your
eyes<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.810> if<00:04:52.710> it's<00:04:52.830> ingested<00:04:53.430> or<00:04:53.580> gets<00:04:53.760> into

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
eyes and if it's ingested or gets into

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.430 
eyes and if it's ingested or gets into
your<00:04:54.000> system<00:04:54.060> can<00:04:54.570> also<00:04:54.660> cause<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.169> problems

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
your system can also cause you problems

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.710 
your system can also cause you problems
with<00:04:55.830> your<00:04:56.479> respiration<00:04:57.479> system<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:59.720> don't

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
with your respiration system so don't

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.840 
with your respiration system so don't
handle<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:04.040> like<00:05:05.040> I<00:05:05.190> said<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.520> reason<00:05:05.639> they

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
handle it like I said the reason they

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.550 
handle it like I said the reason they
tell<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.240> not<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.419> recharge<00:05:06.990> them<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.350> because

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.570 
on charge and go away and forget about
them<00:06:39.600> because<00:06:39.900> they<00:06:40.080> will<00:06:40.260> leak<00:06:40.530> and<00:06:40.830> they

them because they will leak and they

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.550 
them because they will leak and they
might<00:06:41.760> explode<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.510> if<00:06:42.600> they<00:06:42.750> short-circuit

might explode and if they short-circuit

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.020 
might explode and if they short-circuit
it<00:06:44.340> could<00:06:44.520> damage<00:06:44.760> your<00:06:45.060> charger<00:06:45.540> as<00:06:45.690> well

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
it could damage your charger as well
