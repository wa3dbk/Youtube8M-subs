flowers<00:01:52.800> this<00:01:55.110> these<00:01:56.110> just<00:01:57.070> kind<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.369> hard<00:01:57.520> to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
flowers this these just kind of hard to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.940 
flowers this these just kind of hard to
reach<00:01:58.030> all<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.330> positions<00:01:58.810> here<00:01:59.050> this<00:01:59.770> is

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
reach all the positions here this is

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.920 
reach all the positions here this is
actually<00:02:00.250> like<00:02:00.369> a<00:02:00.400> six<00:02:00.700> foot<00:02:00.910> tall<00:02:01.119> plant<00:02:01.479> and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
actually like a six foot tall plant and

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.920 
actually like a six foot tall plant and
a<00:02:02.710> lot<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.460> uh<00:02:03.490> oh<00:02:03.940> I<00:02:04.240> guess<00:02:04.600> that's<00:02:04.750> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
a lot of it is uh oh I guess that's the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.880 
a lot of it is uh oh I guess that's the
point<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.260> was<00:02:05.380> supposed<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.650> be<00:02:05.740> out<00:02:05.860> here

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
point I was supposed to be out here

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.760 
point I was supposed to be out here
showing<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.820> it's<00:02:06.940> broken<00:02:07.150> off

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
showing this is that it's broken off

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.760 
showing this is that it's broken off
what's<00:02:08.770> happened<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.280> all<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.610> rain<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:10.149> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
what's happened is all the rain is and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.710 
what's happened is all the rain is and
wet<00:02:11.770> cold<00:02:12.070> this<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.459> whatever<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.880> just<00:02:13.120> it's

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
wet cold this and whatever is just it's

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.220 
wet cold this and whatever is just it's
just<00:02:13.920> killed<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> top<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:17.080> know

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
just killed the top of it and you know

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.980 
just killed the top of it and you know
and<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:17.770> these<00:02:17.920> leafs<00:02:18.250> are<00:02:18.910> blocking<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
and so then these leafs are blocking the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.440 
and so then these leafs are blocking the
whole<00:02:20.230> bottom<00:02:20.620> layers<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:21.910> still<00:02:22.090> living

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
whole bottom layers so it's still living

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.830 
whole bottom layers so it's still living
and<00:02:22.630> stuff<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:23.880> these<00:02:24.880> top<00:02:25.209> leaves<00:02:25.510> get

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and stuff and then these top leaves get

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.100 
and stuff and then these top leaves get
it<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.860> they<00:02:27.610> start<00:02:27.880> molding<00:02:28.180> or<00:02:28.540> rotting<00:02:28.900> or

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
it and they start molding or rotting or

it and they start molding or rotting or
whatever<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.860> they<00:02:30.580> day<00:02:30.760> off<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:31.330> at<00:02:31.420> the

whatever and they day off but at the
same<00:02:31.690> time<00:02:31.959> it's<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:32.530> fully<00:02:32.890> viable<00:02:33.550> meaning

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
same time it's it's fully viable meaning

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.580 
same time it's it's fully viable meaning
that<00:02:34.120> it's<00:02:34.330> healthy<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.810> happy<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.410> these

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
that it's healthy and happy and these

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.520 
that it's healthy and happy and these
are<00:02:35.739> like<00:02:35.890> new<00:02:36.100> growths<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.110> meanwhile<00:02:38.110> all

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
are like new growths and meanwhile all

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.350 
are like new growths and meanwhile all
below<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.190> stage<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:40.750> still<00:02:41.019> have<00:02:42.360> lots<00:02:43.360> of

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360

after<00:02:59.939> that<00:03:00.090> gets<00:03:00.329> flowered<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.609> pollinated

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
after that gets flowered and pollinated

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.830 
after that gets flowered and pollinated
by<00:03:02.879> pollinator<00:03:03.569> Spees<00:03:04.010> then<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:06.209> starts<00:03:06.599> these

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
by pollinator Spees then it starts these

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.190 
by pollinator Spees then it starts these
what<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.859> call<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.219> lanterns<00:03:08.760> and

what I like to call the lanterns and
this<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.409> totally<00:03:10.799> hollow<00:03:11.040> feeling<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.760> it's

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
lot about how these things work I'm just

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.000 
lot about how these things work I'm just
describing<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:51.689> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.079> from<00:03:52.319> my

describing it you know from my
understanding<00:03:54.919> this<00:03:55.919> right<00:03:56.189> here<00:03:57.139> is

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.550 

you<00:04:01.849> can<00:04:02.060> see<00:04:02.300> there's<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.840> little<00:04:03.050> green<00:04:03.230> fruit

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
you can see there's a little green fruit

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.370 
you can see there's a little green fruit
in<00:04:03.739> there<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.280> that's<00:04:05.830> an<00:04:07.360> undeveloped<00:04:08.380> going

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
in there and that's an undeveloped going

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.680 
in there and that's an undeveloped going
to<00:04:09.530> die

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
to die

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:18.000 
to die
fruit<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:15.400> fruit<00:04:16.400> should<00:04:16.760> turn<00:04:17.090> into<00:04:17.480> a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
fruit and this fruit should turn into a

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.670 
fruit and this fruit should turn into a
literally<00:04:19.010> looks<00:04:19.250> like<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.489> golden<00:04:20.000> raspberry

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
literally looks like a golden raspberry

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.370 
literally looks like a golden raspberry
and<00:04:21.680> that's<00:04:22.310> what<00:04:22.520> we're<00:04:22.669> hoping<00:04:23.230> we'll<00:04:24.230> be

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
and that's what we're hoping we'll be

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.430 
and that's what we're hoping we'll be
able<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.770> fully<00:04:25.010> develop<00:04:25.340> off<00:04:25.730> of<00:04:25.940> this<00:04:26.440> plant

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
able to fully develop off of this plant

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.470 
able to fully develop off of this plant
and<00:04:29.500> it's<00:04:30.500> like<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:31.250> said<00:04:31.280> it's<00:04:31.880> going<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.389> be

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
and it's like I said it's going to be

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.600 
and it's like I said it's going to be
the<00:04:32.720> coldest<00:04:33.200> month<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.910> year<00:04:36.370> right<00:04:37.370> now

winds and such so yeah these this is
that<00:04:59.090> flower<00:04:59.389> it<00:04:59.660> just<00:04:59.900> died<00:05:00.139> back<00:05:00.380> recently

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
that flower it just died back recently

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.660 
that flower it just died back recently
and<00:05:02.380> then<00:05:03.380> they've<00:05:03.950> all<00:05:04.160> been<00:05:04.340> pollinated

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
and then they've all been pollinated

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.360 
and then they've all been pollinated
they<00:05:05.000> get<00:05:05.180> pollinated<00:05:05.480> really<00:05:05.960> easily<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.590> or

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
they get pollinated really easily and or

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.970 
they get pollinated really easily and or
in<00:05:07.550> my<00:05:07.760> yard<00:05:08.000> because<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.450> have<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:08.780> lot<00:05:09.050> of<00:05:09.080> my

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
in my yard because I have a lot of my

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.910 
in my yard because I have a lot of my
whole<00:05:10.130> yard<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.490> natural<00:05:11.000> so<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.300> have<00:05:11.510> a<00:05:11.540> lot<00:05:11.780> of

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
whole yard is natural so I have a lot of

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.680 
whole yard is natural so I have a lot of
life-forms<00:05:12.920> that<00:05:13.010> are<00:05:13.330> actively<00:05:14.330> searching

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
life-forms that are actively searching

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.190 
life-forms that are actively searching
out<00:05:14.990> in<00:05:15.110> my<00:05:15.200> yard<00:05:15.230> to<00:05:15.970> pollinate<00:05:16.970> plants<00:05:17.330> and

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
out in my yard to pollinate plants and

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.260 
out in my yard to pollinate plants and
whatever<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:19.070> survive<00:05:19.490> because<00:05:19.850> there's<00:05:20.210> a

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
whatever and survive because there's a

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.090 
whatever and survive because there's a
lot<00:05:20.450> of<00:05:20.540> pesticides<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.350> stuff<00:05:21.560> around<00:05:21.710> him

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
lot of pesticides and stuff around him

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:32.590 
lot of pesticides and stuff around him
so<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:26.560> waiting<00:05:30.400> thing<00:05:31.400> that'll<00:05:32.120> be<00:05:32.210> great<00:05:32.480> it

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
so the waiting thing that'll be great it

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.320 
so the waiting thing that'll be great it
looks<00:05:32.780> like<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.610> figure<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:34.700> you<00:05:35.000> can<00:05:35.180> get

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
looks like a figure that you can get

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.610 
looks like a figure that you can get
this<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.720> better<00:05:35.870> chance<00:05:36.200> you'll<00:05:36.380> have<00:05:36.410> of

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
this the better chance you'll have of

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.380 
this the better chance you'll have of
its<00:05:37.010> surviving<00:05:37.520> throughout<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.910> year<00:05:38.150> is

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
its surviving throughout the year is

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.870 
its surviving throughout the year is
another<00:05:39.050> point<00:05:39.410> because<00:05:39.800> of<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.340> fact<00:05:40.700> that

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
another point because of the fact that

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.050 
another point because of the fact that
they<00:05:41.030> do<00:05:41.090> actually<00:05:41.720> die<00:05:41.990> back<00:05:42.290> and<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.850> rain

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
they do actually die back and the rain

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.510 
they do actually die back and the rain
and<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.420> freeze<00:05:44.720> will<00:05:45.380> kill<00:05:45.620> your<00:05:45.830> plants<00:05:46.340> so

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
and the freeze will kill your plants so

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.720 
and the freeze will kill your plants so
if<00:05:46.640> you<00:05:46.730> have<00:05:46.880> a<00:05:46.910> small<00:05:47.240> plant<00:05:47.510> like<00:05:48.260> this<00:05:48.730> then

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
if you have a small plant like this then

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.850 
if you have a small plant like this then
you<00:05:50.360> have<00:05:50.390> a<00:05:50.510> much<00:05:50.690> like<00:05:50.960> less<00:05:51.410> likely<00:05:51.830> chance

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
you have a much like less likely chance

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.150 
you have a much like less likely chance
of<00:05:52.280> it<00:05:52.430> surviving<00:05:53.060> year<00:05:53.570> round<00:05:53.780> and<00:05:54.290> or<00:05:54.740> in<00:05:54.980> the

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
of it surviving year round and or in the

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.090 
of it surviving year round and or in the
below<00:05:56.000> 30<00:05:56.360> below<00:05:57.320> 40<00:05:57.770> degrees<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:59.200> in<00:06:00.200> the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
below 30 below 40 degrees and in the

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.190 
below 30 below 40 degrees and in the
rain<00:06:01.340> season<00:06:01.760> specifically<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:02.870> the

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
rain season specifically to the

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.530 
rain season specifically to the
combination<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:05.650> it<00:06:06.650> grows<00:06:07.340> actively<00:06:08.150> you

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
combination it it grows actively you

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.060 
combination it it grows actively you
quick<00:06:08.840> and<00:06:09.020> happy<00:06:09.380> it's<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.560> really<00:06:09.710> happy

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
quick and happy it's a really happy

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.430 
quick and happy it's a really happy
plant<00:06:10.880> it'll<00:06:11.270> just<00:06:11.450> take<00:06:11.750> off<00:06:11.990> actively

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
plant it'll just take off actively

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.640 
plant it'll just take off actively
so<00:06:14.440> I<00:06:16.770> guess<00:06:17.770> that's<00:06:18.009> a<00:06:18.370> yes<00:06:19.289> that's<00:06:20.289> good<00:06:20.470> with

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
so I guess that's a yes that's good with

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.159 
so I guess that's a yes that's good with
for<00:06:20.979> that<00:06:21.720> all<00:06:22.720> right<00:06:23.729> well<00:06:24.729> I<00:06:25.150> hope<00:06:25.900> you<00:06:26.050> get

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
for that all right well I hope you get

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.860 
for that all right well I hope you get
to<00:06:26.320> see<00:06:26.470> the<00:06:26.590> fruits
