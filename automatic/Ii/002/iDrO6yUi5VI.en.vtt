00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.310 
anything so I was just like watching
movies<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.690> course<00:01:45.900> one<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.170> things

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
movies and of course one of the things

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.540 
movies and of course one of the things
that<00:01:46.440> happens<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> me<00:01:46.830> when<00:01:46.920> I'm<00:01:47.070> bored<00:01:47.400> I'm

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
that happens to me when I'm bored I'm

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.520 
that happens to me when I'm bored I'm
just<00:01:47.729> sitting<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.240> nothing<00:01:48.660> is<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> tend<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.350> eat

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
just sitting do nothing is I tend to eat

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
just sitting do nothing is I tend to eat
a<00:01:49.560> lot<00:01:49.820> um<00:01:51.530> but<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.920> did<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.880> something<00:01:54.300> out<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
a lot um but I did get something out of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.990 
a lot um but I did get something out of
this<00:01:54.979> one<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.160> things<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.550> learned<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
this one of the things I learned and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880 
this one of the things I learned and
again<00:01:57.300> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> an<00:01:57.690> experiment<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.229> course<00:01:58.470> as

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
again this is an experiment of course as

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.460 
again this is an experiment of course as
I<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.330> observing<00:02:00.869> what's<00:02:01.050> going<00:02:01.110> on

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
I because I'm observing what's going on

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.070 
I because I'm observing what's going on
when<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.890> certain<00:02:02.250> things<00:02:02.570> when<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.630> started

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
when I do certain things when I started

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.029 
when I do certain things when I started
eating<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.680> lot<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:06.750> my<00:02:06.899> vacation<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.710> actually

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
eating a lot on my vacation I actually

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.850 
eating a lot on my vacation I actually
started<00:02:08.700> losing<00:02:09.179> weight<00:02:09.229> before<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.470> started

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
started losing weight before I started

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.699 
started losing weight before I started
gaining<00:02:11.190> some<00:02:11.550> weight<00:02:11.580> again<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:13.590> was

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
gaining some weight again and that was

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.220 
gaining some weight again and that was
very<00:02:13.769> strange<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.610> what<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.390> found<00:02:15.690> out<00:02:15.959> was

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
very strange but what I found out was

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.500 
very strange but what I found out was
that<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.800> actual<00:02:17.220> process<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.730> eating<00:02:17.940> more<00:02:18.360> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
that the actual process of eating more a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.470 
that the actual process of eating more a
little<00:02:18.810> more<00:02:18.840> than<00:02:19.739> usual<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.910> started

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
little more than usual because I started

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.430 
little more than usual because I started
out<00:02:21.600> too<00:02:21.660> slow<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.870> course<00:02:22.019> because<00:02:22.320> my

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
out too slow of course because my

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.500 
out too slow of course because my
stomach<00:02:23.040> shrinks<00:02:23.489> when<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.120> know<00:02:24.239> you're

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
stomach shrinks when you know you're

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.120 
stomach shrinks when you know you're
losing<00:02:24.840> weight<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.230> could<00:02:25.290> eat<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.739> once<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
losing weight so I could eat that once I

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.770 
losing weight so I could eat that once I
wasn't<00:02:26.280> only<00:02:26.430> even<00:02:26.700> that's<00:02:26.910> like<00:02:27.420> ten<00:02:27.600> at<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
wasn't only even that's like ten at a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.220 
wasn't only even that's like ten at a
time

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
time

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.070 
time
and<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> scale<00:02:30.180> or<00:02:30.209> whatever<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.959> know

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
and I have a scale or whatever you know

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.770 
and I have a scale or whatever you know
too<00:02:31.260> much<00:02:31.380> immersive<00:02:31.709> whatever<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.370> i<00:02:32.580> am<00:02:33.450> i

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
too much immersive whatever but i am i

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.660 
too much immersive whatever but i am i
saw<00:02:34.290> my<00:02:34.440> claim<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.950> i'm<00:02:35.070> suppose<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.370> getting

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
saw my claim and i'm suppose we getting

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.509 
saw my claim and i'm suppose we getting
right<00:02:35.820> here<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.450> i<00:02:37.140> should've<00:02:37.829> stopped<00:02:38.190> right

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
right here and i should've stopped right

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.670 
right here and i should've stopped right
there<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.750> kept<00:02:40.019> eating<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.470> course

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
there but I kept eating and of course

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.370 
there but I kept eating and of course
size<00:02:40.829> D<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.160> some<00:02:41.340> weight<00:02:41.989> but<00:02:42.989> what<00:02:43.230> that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
size D in some weight but what that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.810 
size D in some weight but what that
means<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.769> my<00:02:43.920> metabolism<00:02:44.310> actually

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
means is my metabolism actually

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.729 
means is my metabolism actually
increased<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:45.930> what<00:02:46.110> I've<00:02:46.230> learned<00:02:46.260> from<00:02:46.590> this

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
increased so what I've learned from this

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.949 
increased so what I've learned from this
is<00:02:46.799> if<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.220> start<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:48.360> you're<00:02:48.570> gonna<00:02:48.690> die<00:02:48.930> for

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
is if you start if you're gonna die for

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.220 
is if you start if you're gonna die for
a<00:02:49.230> while<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.700> once<00:02:51.480> maybe<00:02:51.810> once<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.200> week

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
a while and just once maybe once a week

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.949 
a while and just once maybe once a week
or<00:02:52.470> something<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:53.269> add<00:02:54.269> something<00:02:54.660> more

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
or something you just add something more

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.120 
or something you just add something more
and<00:02:55.019> I've<00:02:55.140> noticed<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.560> stuff<00:02:55.739> along<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
and I've noticed this stuff along the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.670 
and I've noticed this stuff along the
way<00:02:56.250> too<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.500> one<00:02:58.500> that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
way too and this is just a one that

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.860 
way too and this is just a one that
really<00:02:58.860> hit<00:02:59.100> me<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.850> you're<00:03:00.420> just<00:03:00.540> being<00:03:00.780> a

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
really hit me if you're just being a

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.900 
really hit me if you're just being a
little<00:03:00.900> more<00:03:01.350> than<00:03:01.470> usual<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.070> satisfy

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
little more than usual and you satisfy

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.220 
little more than usual and you satisfy
yourself<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.360> actually<00:03:03.660> speeds<00:03:04.019> up<00:03:04.200> your

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
yourself it actually speeds up your

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.030 
yourself it actually speeds up your
metabolism

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
metabolism

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.009 
metabolism
just<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.579> getting<00:03:06.299> out<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> norm<00:03:06.930> a

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
just like getting out of the norm a

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.300 
just like getting out of the norm a
little<00:03:07.260> bit<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.680> stick<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:07.920> us<00:03:08.160> it's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
little bit it kind of stick with us it's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.800 
little bit it kind of stick with us it's
just<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.519> wait<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> minute<00:03:09.060> where<00:03:09.209> we<00:03:09.480> don't<00:03:09.660> have

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
just a wait a minute where we don't have

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.449 
just a wait a minute where we don't have
to<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.079> at<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.410> level<00:03:10.650> anymore<00:03:11.040> we're

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
to be at this level anymore we're

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.910 
to be at this level anymore we're
getting<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.820> little<00:03:12.090> more<00:03:12.299> food<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.680> need<00:03:13.829> to

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
getting a little more food so we need to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.110 
getting a little more food so we need to
speed<00:03:14.160> up<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.400> think<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.610> said<00:03:14.820> something<00:03:15.000> like

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
speed up I think I said something like

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.850 
speed up I think I said something like
that<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.780> was<00:03:15.959> really<00:03:16.200> awesome<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.739> way

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
that but this was really awesome the way

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.199 
that but this was really awesome the way
just<00:03:17.070> half<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:17.730> still<00:03:17.880> losing<00:03:18.180> weight

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
just half and I just still losing weight

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.460
