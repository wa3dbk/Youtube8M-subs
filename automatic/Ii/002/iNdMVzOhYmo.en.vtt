have the long sniper barrel on it and I
have<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> scope<00:00:33.170> but<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.290> kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> didn't<00:00:34.829> come

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

out too well so here's the scope it's a
little<00:00:40.890> red<00:00:41.100> dot<00:00:41.129> scope<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.059> better<00:00:42.300> than<00:00:42.450> my

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
