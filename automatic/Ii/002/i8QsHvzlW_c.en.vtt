00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
to the robots body and the head can turn

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.830 
to the robots body and the head can turn
relative<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> body<00:02:17.420> now<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.450> can

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
relative to the body now you can

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.670 
relative to the body now you can
decorate<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.440> robot<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:21.050> chose<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.260> glue<00:02:22.440> eyes

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
pieces of pipe cleaner as I did for the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.990 
pieces of pipe cleaner as I did for the
antennas<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:21.650> could<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.799> used<00:03:23.010> cardboard<00:03:23.700> or

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
antennas I could have used cardboard or

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.069 
antennas I could have used cardboard or
pieces<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.720> plastic<00:03:25.200> straw<00:03:25.530> too<00:03:26.750> now<00:03:27.750> let's

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
pieces of plastic straw too now let's

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.240 
pieces of plastic straw too now let's
choose<00:03:28.380> some<00:03:28.650> wheels

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
choose some wheels

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.420

I<00:03:30.320> collect<00:03:31.320> lids<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.709> bottles<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.280> containers

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
I collect lids of bottles and containers

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.210 
I collect lids of bottles and containers
and<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.480> will<00:03:33.690> see<00:03:33.900> if<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.320> find<00:03:34.530> for<00:03:34.980> needs

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
and I will see if I can find for needs

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.670 
and I will see if I can find for needs
of<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.549> same<00:03:35.790> size<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.420> same<00:03:36.630> color<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.620> I

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
of the same size and the same color so I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.020 
of the same size and the same color so I
can<00:03:37.920> use<00:03:38.130> them<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.700> wheels<00:03:39.239> for<00:03:39.540> my<00:03:39.570> robot

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
can use them as wheels for my robot

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.600 
can use them as wheels for my robot
I<00:03:41.170> would<00:03:42.170> have<00:03:42.350> liked<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.620> use<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.010> orange

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
I would have liked to use the orange

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.820 
I would have liked to use the orange
leads<00:03:43.819> but<00:03:44.150> unfortunately<00:03:45.140> I<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.680> only

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
leads but unfortunately I have only

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
leads but unfortunately I have only
three<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.700> same<00:03:46.940> color<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.430> find<00:03:49.700> that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
three of the same color but I find that

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.470 
three of the same color but I find that
I<00:03:49.970> have<00:03:50.000> enough<00:03:50.420> green<00:03:50.720> leads<00:03:50.990> I<00:03:52.240> put<00:03:53.240> hot<00:03:53.420> glue

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
I have enough green leads I put hot glue

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.780 
I have enough green leads I put hot glue
on<00:03:53.840> half<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.319> each<00:03:54.530> lid<00:03:54.830> and<00:03:55.069> glue<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.610> wheels

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
on half of each lid and glue the wheels

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.640 
on half of each lid and glue the wheels
one<00:03:56.510> by<00:03:56.720> one<00:03:57.020> on<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.530> sides<00:03:57.830> of<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.130> robot<00:03:58.520> and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
one by one on the sides of the robot and

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.360 
one by one on the sides of the robot and
now<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.709> robot<00:04:01.220> has<00:04:01.430> four<00:04:01.700> wheels<00:04:02.980> but<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.130> see

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
now the robot has four wheels but I see

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.229 
now the robot has four wheels but I see
that<00:04:04.520> I<00:04:04.580> actually<00:04:05.030> have<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.750> fifth<00:04:06.170> green<00:04:06.560> lid<00:04:06.920> I

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
that I actually have a fifth green lid I

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.120 
that I actually have a fifth green lid I
will<00:04:08.239> put<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.600> at<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.050> back<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.620> robot<00:04:09.950> as

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
will put it at the back of the robot as

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.780 
will put it at the back of the robot as
a<00:04:10.190> spare<00:04:10.700> wheel<00:04:11.860> collect<00:04:12.860> all<00:04:13.040> kinds<00:04:13.400> of<00:04:13.489> leads
