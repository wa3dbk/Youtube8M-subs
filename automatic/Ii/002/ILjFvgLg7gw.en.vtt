00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.979
 very good girls very good guys today 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.120
 Look how you are doing, I hope you are 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:06.830
 all very well 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.530
 today I tell you a lot of news 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.719
 important since I already said once in the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.999
 channel and it does not hurt to return it to 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.730
 repeat because there have been more cases 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.250
 as it has advanced a little bit in the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.869
 history and it's important was made 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.160
 quite echo this news on the channel 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.810
 given the impact it does not turn out that the 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.880
 Greenland ice is changing from 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.580
 color sharply or colors 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.970
 totally opposite as the target is 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.040
 transforming into black 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.930
 it turns out that a service scientist 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.120
 geological map of denmark and greenland 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.720
 is trying to find the causes of 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.690
 this phenomenon because this is the cause of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.770
 decrease in ice is causing 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.290
 that the glaciers disappear and 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.850
 will you say why 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.420
 I explain 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.500
 perfectly because when he gives the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.019
 ice because the ice 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.310
 white for example those that I for 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.410
 example never gone snow and it's worth 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.570
 but think very brief those who are going to 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.360
 ski with those who have gone some 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.700
 time to snow 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.340
 many times the vast majority of times 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.130
 you have to always use a protector 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.260
 very high solar because you have 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.650
 white and sunlight when 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.930
 hits or when it goes straight or crashes 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.430
 Against the snow to be white light 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.840
 white what it does on the surface 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.240
 white bounce is that solar health not the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.890
 bounces out and collides with 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.960
 elements like humans for example 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.420
 that make that solar radiation be 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.910
 absorbed by our skin and we 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.470
 this reddening of the area appears 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.050
 facial for example that's where most 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.960
 Apply cream and you'll say and this because 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.370
 pussy of the two counting very easy if in 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.370
 the surface of the ice instead of 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.710
 become white 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.580
 that when the sun hits it bounces and does not 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.010
 it produces both wear so much thaw 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.640
 turns black into black what it does 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.000
 is when it bounces when the light of the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.870
 sun to the black surface of this ice 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.090
 the black absorbs the light therefore at 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.210
 absorb that light produces heat and that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.750
 heat melts the ice is very simple 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.300
 why this phenomenon is being very 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.770
 dangerous and very important of maximum 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.720
 priority for scientists 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.819
 the most likely explanation they give to 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.090
 this to this phenomenon this phenomenon 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.340
 write this year's comparison of a 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.439
 lower number of dust snow storms 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.810
 brought by the wind activity 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:50.189
 microbial and clouds of soot caused 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.810
 by forest fires but another 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.500
 another one of the probable explanations 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.639
 it is also global warming 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.400
 it turns out that the scientist has mentioned 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.230
 the mysterious holes in Siberia that 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.840
 You already know that we have commented a lot 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.969
 in the channel that have registered this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.709
 year and also the methane bubbles in 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.530
 the Atlantic coast as proof that the 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.980
 Arctic can change quickly and 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.560
 unpredictable is to say 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.129
 is warning us but this is going 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.340
 accelerating at a very fast pace has 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.159
 calculated that in 2014 the ice mantle 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.590
 it's 56 percent darker and it produces 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.180
 an additional absorption of energy that 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.020
 is approximately double the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.850
 Annual US electricity consumption 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.760
 maybe it 's a coincidence but 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.990
 It turns out that this year will also be the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.240
 year with the number of fires 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.680
 highest forest ever registered in 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.379
 the Artic 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.299
 the scientist assures that the challenge 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.340
 principal is to determine what part of the 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.950
 Soot found in Greenland 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.859
 comes from the fires 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.390
 and what part is owed to other 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.270
 causes as I have told you about 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.180
 microbial activity few storms 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:10.150
 of snow the dust attracted by the wind 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.159
 all of that has to be identified 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.709
 also good for example emissions 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.730
 coming from factories 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.799
 regardless of the effect they are 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.750
 having the forest fires in the 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.220
 Greenland snow this year have 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.169
 become a new source 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.509
 important gas emissions 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.600
 greenhouse effect from the arctic the 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.850
 last year the scientists of the nasa 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.520
 they discovered incredible levels of 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.139
 carbon dioxide and methane emanated from 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.960
 alaska freeze theme 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.409
 the system to be able to identify everything 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.919
 this I do not know if I'm wrong I've seen it in 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:49.289
 several documentaries but surely 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.300
 someone will correct me is making a 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.460
 small piercing this is also 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.270
 spend to see the levels of CO2 that 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.240
 has the air 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.520
 it is very easy very easy the explanation is 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.180
 really easy what you do is with 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.180
 a drilling machine 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.740
 a wad of snow is extracted a cue from 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.660
 ice is not like a cylinder of ice and 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.220
 what is done is to identify the 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.230
 different layers of ice and you'll say the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.750
 that the ice has layers of course 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.290
 that has layers all the ice has 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.000
 very similar layers like those of a 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.250
 surface of a mountain when you by 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.940
 example, imagine if we cut one 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.330
 mountain if we made a slice 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.280
 vertical to a vertical cut and 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.410
 we will cut a mountain like a cake 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.530
 we extracted that little piece we would see 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.510
 different distinct zones of land 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.930
 different types of land that we 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.090
 they could say things that have happened 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.890
 during periods of time in this case 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.340
 it happens exactly the same with snow 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.410
 when they take out that cylinder they can see the 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.080
 different layers of snow that there are 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.830
 ice and in those layers of ice that is 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.680
 ebola saved the carbon dioxide 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.870
 carbon dioxide that is in the air and 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.930
 that when the ice storms come 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.620
 and that ice is pressed dioxide 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.870
 carbon 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.840
 in the air it also stays pressed 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.240
 then thanks to that cylinder they can 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.510
 see how much dioxide has increased 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.190
 carbon in X years time is very 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.410
 interesting this topic could happen to me 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.650
 hours and hours talking because it 's something 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.479
 I love it and as always I ask you 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.570
 your opinion please tell me what 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.880
 you think about this in the growth of 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.490
 ice not I always think that's why the 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.960
 pollution does a lot and the 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.720
 pollution and everything is linked to what 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.520
 same so good guys I hope you 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.470
 I have interested this news a little kiss 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.210
 everyone and see you in another video more than 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.389
 this channel until next time 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.389
 bye
