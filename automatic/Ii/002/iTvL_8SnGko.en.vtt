there's actually four got fork health in

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.640 
there's actually four got fork health in
this<00:01:19.530> map<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.509> because<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.630> actually<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:22.080> farm

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
this map so because you actually do farm

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.580 
this map so because you actually do farm
food<00:01:23.009> faster<00:01:23.549> from<00:01:23.700> cows<00:01:24.020> compared<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> bushes

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
food faster from cows compared to bushes

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
food faster from cows compared to bushes
