dead pushing them all to the top left
corner<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.100> then<00:02:20.640> once<00:02:20.880> they're<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.240> big

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
clump I move to the other side and this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.030 
clump I move to the other side and this
gets<00:02:23.610> them<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.030> nice<00:02:24.180> big<00:02:24.480> ball<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.920> that

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
gets them in a nice big ball so that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.800 
gets them in a nice big ball so that
once<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.400> object<00:02:26.520> lands<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.210> literally<00:02:27.600> kills

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
once the object lands it literally kills

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.790 
once the object lands it literally kills
all<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.020> them<00:02:28.230> at<00:02:28.350> once
