00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.190 

I<00:00:01.100> can<00:00:02.100> hear<00:00:02.310> again<00:00:02.750> I<00:00:03.750> made<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> nother<00:00:06.200> flute

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
I can hear again I made a nother flute

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.700 
I can hear again I made a nother flute
out<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:08.460> PVC<00:00:08.940> pipe<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.960> time<00:00:10.290> out<00:00:10.559> of

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
out of PVC pipe this time out of

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.490 
out of PVC pipe this time out of
half-inch<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> key<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.750> G<00:00:13.349> as

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
half-inch and it's in the key of G as

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.790 
half-inch and it's in the key of G as
well<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:14.730> one<00:00:14.969> you'll<00:00:15.150> notice<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.990> lot

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
well this one you'll notice it's a lot

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.980 
well this one you'll notice it's a lot
quieter<00:00:17.130> than<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> other<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:18.000> lot<00:00:18.510> easier<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
quieter than the other one lot easier to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.519 
quieter than the other one lot easier to
play<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.910> more<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.570> tune<00:00:21.840> because<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
play and it's more in tune because I

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.370 
play and it's more in tune because I
used<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:23.010> cork<00:00:23.310> rather<00:00:23.699> than<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.150> end<00:00:24.390> cap<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
used a cork rather than an end cap so I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.970 
used a cork rather than an end cap so I
can<00:00:25.590> slide<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.340> out<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.939> adjust<00:00:27.420> for

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
can slide it in and out to adjust for

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.380 
can slide it in and out to adjust for
the<00:00:28.980> tuning<00:00:29.880> between<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.599> octaves<00:00:32.149> this<00:00:33.149> one

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the tuning between the octaves this one

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.660 
the tuning between the octaves this one
doesn't<00:00:33.930> play<00:00:34.320> nearly<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:36.260> IQ<00:00:37.260> flat<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
doesn't play nearly as IQ flat as the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.510 
doesn't play nearly as IQ flat as the
other<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.210> did<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:41.360> actually<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.870> oh<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
other one did and actually the oh and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.380 
other one did and actually the oh and
probably<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.700> best<00:00:45.090> feature<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:47.059> as<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> billy

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
probably this best feature is as a billy

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
probably this best feature is as a billy
club<00:00:49.670> but<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.820> does<00:00:51.030> play<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.570> no<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.250> my

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
club but it does play a no and it was my

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.000
