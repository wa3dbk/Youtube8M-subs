00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the same really I thought that would be

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.679 
the same really I thought that would be
a<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.340> back<00:01:26.580> why<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.150> go<00:01:27.330> back<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
a go back why is that I go back and

a go back why is that I go back and
that's<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.930> okay<00:01:28.290> whatever<00:01:28.979> they've<00:01:29.790> decided

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that's not okay whatever they've decided

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.940 
that's not okay whatever they've decided
to<00:01:30.210> code<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.840> some<00:01:31.229> reason<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950

I've chosen the same colors for both of

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.300 
I've chosen the same colors for both of
those<00:06:22.909> but<00:06:23.719> nevermind<00:06:24.529> let's<00:06:24.710> go<00:06:24.889> for<00:06:25.130> the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
those but nevermind let's go for the

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.159 
those but nevermind let's go for the
longest<00:06:25.639> duration<00:06:25.849> possible<00:06:26.509> if<00:06:26.900> I<00:06:26.960> work

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
longest duration possible if I work

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.870 
longest duration possible if I work
finished<00:06:27.500> launch<00:06:27.770> it<00:06:27.979> with<00:06:28.069> my<00:06:28.310> work<00:06:28.520> number

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
finished launch it with my work number

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.689 
finished launch it with my work number
so<00:06:29.149> we'll<00:06:29.360> do<00:06:29.479> firework<00:06:29.990> or<00:06:30.169> one<00:06:30.500> there<00:06:31.399> we<00:06:31.490> go

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
so we'll do firework or one there we go

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.470 
so we'll do firework or one there we go
and<00:06:32.710> that<00:06:33.710> was<00:06:33.860> very

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
and that was very

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.690 
and that was very
okay<00:06:34.900> maybe<00:06:35.170> I<00:06:35.260> shouldn't<00:06:35.650> have<00:06:35.800> chosen<00:06:36.160> such

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
okay maybe I shouldn't have chosen such

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.600 
okay maybe I shouldn't have chosen such
a<00:06:36.730> long<00:06:37.090> duration<00:06:37.450> but<00:06:38.140> apparently<00:06:38.740> that<00:06:38.950> was

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
a long duration but apparently that was

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.490 
a long duration but apparently that was
a<00:06:39.640> creeper<00:06:40.150> head<00:06:40.360> with<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.020> colors<00:06:41.260> that<00:06:41.290> I

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
a creeper head with the colors that I

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.940 
a creeper head with the colors that I
had<00:06:41.680> chosen<00:06:41.920> so<00:06:42.460> I<00:06:42.910> think<00:06:43.600> this<00:06:43.690> is<00:06:43.750> a<00:06:43.950> 15

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
had chosen so I think this is a 15

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.920 
had chosen so I think this is a 15
seconds<00:06:45.490> so<00:06:45.670> shall<00:06:46.000> we<00:06:46.060> wait<00:06:46.210> 15<00:06:46.570> seconds

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
seconds so shall we wait 15 seconds

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.210 
seconds so shall we wait 15 seconds
let's<00:06:47.380> have<00:06:47.530> a<00:06:47.560> look<00:06:47.710> see<00:06:47.740> what<00:06:47.890> else<00:06:48.100> we've

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
let's have a look see what else we've

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.250 
let's have a look see what else we've
got<00:06:48.250> the<00:06:48.490> particle<00:06:48.970> pack<00:06:49.210> is<00:06:49.510> the<00:06:49.900> last<00:06:50.110> thing

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
got the particle pack is the last thing

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.420 
got the particle pack is the last thing
this<00:06:50.410> is<00:06:50.530> pretty<00:06:50.740> much<00:06:50.890> the<00:06:50.950> same<00:06:51.190> as<00:06:51.310> it

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
this is pretty much the same as it

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.580 
this is pretty much the same as it
always<00:06:51.460> has<00:06:52.000> been<00:06:52.030> it's<00:06:52.810> just<00:06:53.110> in<00:06:53.260> a<00:06:53.350> different

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
always has been it's just in a different

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.460 
always has been it's just in a different
layout<00:06:54.220> and<00:06:54.520> it<00:06:54.610> tells<00:06:54.760> you<00:06:55.020> the<00:06:56.020> number<00:06:56.380> of

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
layout and it tells you the number of

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.960 
layout and it tells you the number of
items<00:06:56.620> that<00:06:56.950> are<00:06:57.100> coming<00:06:57.340> soon<00:06:57.490> it<00:06:57.670> does<00:06:57.820> that

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
items that are coming soon it does that

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.760 
items that are coming soon it does that
in<00:06:58.090> every<00:06:58.240> single<00:06:58.660> one<00:06:58.930> as<00:06:59.110> well<00:06:59.260> so<00:06:59.560> if<00:06:59.650> I<00:06:59.740> go

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
in every single one as well so if I go

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.010 
in every single one as well so if I go
into<00:06:59.980> the<00:07:00.130> gadget<00:07:00.520> I<00:07:00.760> got<00:07:01.180> like<00:07:01.270> that<00:07:01.480> you<00:07:01.870> can

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
into the gadget I got like that you can

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.690 
into the gadget I got like that you can
see<00:07:02.170> there's<00:07:02.500> quite<00:07:02.530> a<00:07:02.680> few<00:07:02.770> that<00:07:03.130> are<00:07:03.310> coming

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
see there's quite a few that are coming
