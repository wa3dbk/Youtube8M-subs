back pieces facing stitch the shoulders
and<00:00:26.550> size<00:00:26.820> together<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:28.079> they're<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> spots

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and size together so they're the spots

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.430 
and size together so they're the spots
that<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:28.859> marked<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.430> red<00:00:29.489> on<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.210> diagram

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.740 

so<00:00:36.440> here's<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.950> shoulder<00:00:37.400> scene<00:00:37.670> I'm<00:00:38.420> going

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
so here's the shoulder scene I'm going

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.870 
so here's the shoulder scene I'm going
to<00:00:38.930> stitch<00:00:39.200> forwards<00:00:39.740> go<00:00:40.340> backwards<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.850> few

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
to stitch forwards go backwards a few

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.660 
to stitch forwards go backwards a few
stitches<00:00:41.330> and<00:00:41.900> then<00:00:42.110> come<00:00:42.380> back<00:00:42.410> again<00:00:42.710> right

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
stitches and then come back again right

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.600 
stitches and then come back again right
to<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.940> end<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:44.450> then<00:00:45.080> we'll<00:00:45.860> do<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.130> same

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
to the end and then we'll do the same

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.770 
to the end and then we'll do the same
when<00:00:47.150> we<00:00:47.390> finish<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.020> end<00:00:48.200> of<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.800> shoulder

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
when we finish the end of the shoulder

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.150 
when we finish the end of the shoulder
this<00:00:50.780> makes<00:00:51.080> sure<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.710> Machine

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
this makes sure that the Machine

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.310 
this makes sure that the Machine
stitches<00:00:52.640> stay<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:52.910> place<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.570> we'll<00:00:54.050> do<00:00:54.170> the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
stitches stay in place and we'll do the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.700 
stitches stay in place and we'll do the
same<00:00:54.559> for<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.100> side<00:00:55.309> seams<00:00:55.640> as<00:00:55.879> well<00:00:56.710> we're

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
same for the side seams as well we're

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.280 
same for the side seams as well we're
currently<00:00:57.920> just<00:00:58.280> making<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:58.970> test<00:00:59.390> piece<00:00:59.870> to

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
currently just making a test piece to

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.189 
currently just making a test piece to
test<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.650> pattern<00:01:00.980> using<00:01:01.820> some<00:01:02.360> cheap<00:01:02.660> fabric

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
test the pattern using some cheap fabric

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.320 
test the pattern using some cheap fabric
but<00:01:03.440> once<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.070> do<00:01:04.250> make<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.580> final<00:01:04.940> version

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
but once you do make the final version

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.510 
but once you do make the final version
you<00:01:05.570> can<00:01:05.840> zigzag<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.590> seams<00:01:06.860> together<00:01:07.130> as

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
you can zigzag the seams together as

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.280 
you can zigzag the seams together as
seen<00:01:08.149> in<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.360> diagram<00:01:08.540> here

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.630 

this<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.470> where<00:01:16.649> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:16.979> begin<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
this is where you can really begin to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.179 
this is where you can really begin to
customize<00:01:18.329> your<00:01:18.540> dress<00:01:18.869> try<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> dress<00:01:20.130> on

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
customize your dress try the dress on

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.700 
customize your dress try the dress on
and<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:21.119> front<00:01:21.329> of<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> mirror<00:01:21.720> adjust<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and in front of a mirror adjust the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.889 
and in front of a mirror adjust the
neckline<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.430> sits<00:01:23.670> nicely<00:01:24.030> against<00:01:24.720> your

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
neckline so it sits nicely against your

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.560 
neckline so it sits nicely against your
body<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.380> am<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:26.670> two<00:01:26.729> small<00:01:27.270> plates

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

after<00:01:45.020> playing<00:01:45.230> around<00:01:45.440> with<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.830> little<00:01:45.980> bit

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
after playing around with a little bit

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.880 
after playing around with a little bit
this<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.370> what<00:01:46.850> I've<00:01:46.970> settled<00:01:47.270> on<00:01:50.650> mark<00:01:51.650> your

this is what I've settled on mark your

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.370 
this is what I've settled on mark your
pleats<00:01:52.190> with<00:01:52.370> a<00:01:52.400> fabric<00:01:52.850> pin<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:53.420> use<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.020> ruler

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
pleats with a fabric pin and use a ruler

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.680 
pleats with a fabric pin and use a ruler
to<00:01:54.680> measure<00:01:54.800> how<00:01:55.160> far<00:01:55.490> apart<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.180> plates<00:01:56.450> are

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
to measure how far apart the plates are

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:08.389 
to measure how far apart the plates are
and<00:01:56.990> also<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.860> width<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.400> each<00:01:58.790> pleat

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.309 

we<00:02:09.399> need<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.729> grab<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.149> original<00:02:10.360> paper<00:02:10.840> at<00:02:11.170> it

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
we need to grab the original paper at it

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.750 
we need to grab the original paper at it
and<00:02:11.530> mark<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.950> pleats<00:02:12.250> using<00:02:12.670> the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
and mark the pleats using the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.670 
and mark the pleats using the
measurements<00:02:13.240> you've<00:02:13.330> just<00:02:13.600> made<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:14.530> is

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
measurements you've just made this is

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.680 
measurements you've just made this is
what<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.950> police<00:02:15.130> look<00:02:15.459> like<00:02:15.700> before<00:02:16.420> they

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
what the police look like before they

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.690 
what the police look like before they
folded<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.740> black<00:02:17.980> dotted<00:02:18.220> line<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
folded the black dotted line is the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.190 
folded the black dotted line is the
center<00:02:19.209> line

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.530 

here's<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.069> original<00:02:26.400> paper<00:02:26.910> pattern<00:02:27.360> we

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
here's the original paper pattern we

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.229 
here's the original paper pattern we
made<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:28.020> part<00:02:28.319> one<00:02:28.620> my<00:02:29.459> pleats<00:02:29.790> are<00:02:30.000> 5

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
made in part one my pleats are 5

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.750 
made in part one my pleats are 5
centimeters<00:02:30.840> apart<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.770> I'll<00:02:31.950> make<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.190> mark<00:02:32.459> at

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
centimeters apart so I'll make a mark at

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.540 
centimeters apart so I'll make a mark at
half<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.450> measurement<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.319> that'll<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.680> 2.5

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
half that measurement so that'll be 2.5

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.589 
half that measurement so that'll be 2.5
centimeters<00:02:35.880> from<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.810> center<00:02:37.290> line

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.509 

my<00:02:41.140> plates<00:02:41.469> are<00:02:41.620> one<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.980> half<00:02:42.159> centimeters

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
my plates are one and a half centimeters

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.390 
my plates are one and a half centimeters
wide<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.749> I'll<00:02:43.900> make<00:02:44.079> two<00:02:44.379> more<00:02:44.560> marks<00:02:45.010> which

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
wide so I'll make two more marks which

00:02:45.400 --> 00:03:01.520 
wide so I'll make two more marks which
are<00:02:45.430> one<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:45.999> a<00:02:46.090> half<00:02:46.269> centimeters<00:02:46.629> apart
