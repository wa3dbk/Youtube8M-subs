Dooley's and whatnot these are like

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.130 
Dooley's and whatnot these are like
pickups<00:00:41.950> light<00:00:42.950> SUVs<00:00:43.520> they<00:00:44.150> don't<00:00:44.360> need<00:00:44.540> ten

pickups light SUVs they don't need ten

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.650 
pickups light SUVs they don't need ten
plies<00:00:45.380> and<00:00:45.739> what<00:00:46.520> happens<00:00:46.910> is<00:00:47.090> all<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:47.420> extra

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
plies and what happens is all that extra

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.470 
plies and what happens is all that extra
rotating<00:00:48.230> mass<00:00:49.030> puts<00:00:50.030> where<00:00:50.239> in<00:00:50.360> your

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
rotating mass puts where in your

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.139 
rotating mass puts where in your
drivetrain<00:00:50.720> and<00:00:51.260> it<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:52.370> know<00:00:52.489> uses<00:00:52.940> more

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
drivetrain and it you know uses more

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.240 
drivetrain and it you know uses more
power<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.600> get<00:00:53.720> going<00:00:54.079> which<00:00:54.260> kills<00:00:54.890> your<00:00:55.040> fill

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
power to get going which kills your fill

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.389 
power to get going which kills your fill
knowledge<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:59.020> what<00:01:00.020> I've<00:01:00.170> done<00:01:00.350> is<00:01:00.770> I've

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
knowledge so what I've done is I've

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.950 
knowledge so what I've done is I've
gotten<00:01:01.730> Dyna<00:01:02.540> Pro<00:01:02.870> ATMs<00:01:04.810> they're<00:01:05.810> made<00:01:05.929> by

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
gotten Dyna Pro ATMs they're made by

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.789 
gotten Dyna Pro ATMs they're made by
hand<00:01:06.109> cook<00:01:06.499> and<00:01:08.139> they're<00:01:09.139> really<00:01:09.409> good<00:01:09.560> tires

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
hand cook and they're really good tires

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.429 
hand cook and they're really good tires
and<00:01:10.130> here's<00:01:10.429> the<00:01:10.549> difference

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
and here's the difference

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.699 
and here's the difference
these<00:01:12.439> are<00:01:12.619> p2<00:01:13.340> 65<00:01:13.939> 75<00:01:14.450> 16<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:15.259> it's<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.469> same

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
these are p2 65 75 16 so it's the same

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.919 
these are p2 65 75 16 so it's the same
size<00:01:16.009> as<00:01:16.219> the<00:01:16.369> other<00:01:16.399> tire<00:01:16.819> but<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
size as the other tire but it's the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.289 
size as the other tire but it's the
passenger<00:01:18.439> rated<00:01:18.679> version<00:01:18.880> so<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.030> doesn't

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
passenger rated version so it doesn't

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.709 
passenger rated version so it doesn't
have<00:01:20.450> ten<00:01:20.749> plies<00:01:21.609> it's<00:01:22.609> a<00:01:22.789> lighter<00:01:23.060> tire<00:01:23.389> than

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
have ten plies it's a lighter tire than

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.209 
have ten plies it's a lighter tire than
other<00:01:23.929> tire<00:01:24.139> I<00:01:24.170> just<00:01:24.499> showed<00:01:24.679> you<00:01:24.709> is<00:01:24.889> about<00:01:25.189> a

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
other tire I just showed you is about a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.459 
other tire I just showed you is about a
50<00:01:25.549> pound<00:01:25.670> tire<00:01:26.770> these<00:01:27.770> tires<00:01:28.159> are<00:01:28.639> about

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
50 pound tire these tires are about

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.830 
50 pound tire these tires are about
forty<00:01:30.469> pounds<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.579> it's<00:01:31.759> at<00:01:32.090> least<00:01:32.389> 10<00:01:32.630> pounds

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
forty pounds so it's at least 10 pounds

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.410 
forty pounds so it's at least 10 pounds
less<00:01:33.229> stock<00:01:34.039> tires<00:01:34.279> came<00:01:34.759> on<00:01:34.939> these<00:01:35.119> weigh

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
less stock tires came on these weigh

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.989 
less stock tires came on these weigh
about<00:01:35.569> thirty-eight<00:01:36.109> pounds<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.789> gives

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
about thirty-eight pounds so it gives

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:39.940 
about thirty-eight pounds so it gives
you<00:01:38.090> an<00:01:38.179> idea<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.630> what<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.350> truck<00:01:39.590> was<00:01:39.740> meant

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
you an idea of what the truck was meant

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.760 
you an idea of what the truck was meant
to<00:01:40.179> drive<00:01:41.179> with<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.170> if<00:01:42.289> you're<00:01:42.439> going<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.649> go

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
to drive with so if you're going to go

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.589 
to drive with so if you're going to go
to<00:01:42.829> a<00:01:42.920> bigger<00:01:43.159> size<00:01:43.429> again<00:01:44.029> this<00:01:44.209> is<00:01:44.389> like

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599 
to a bigger size again this is like

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:49.679 
to a bigger size again this is like
going<00:01:44.899> from<00:01:45.079> a<00:01:45.319> 31<00:01:45.889> to<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.069> 32<00:01:46.959> from<00:01:47.959> overstock

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
going from a 31 to a 32 from overstock

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.629 
going from a 31 to a 32 from overstock
keeping<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.749> modest<00:01:51.259> makes<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.159> handle

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
keeping it modest makes it handle

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.319 
keeping it modest makes it handle
extremely<00:01:53.539> well<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:55.700> know<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.090> another

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
extremely well you know and another

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
thing with these tires is I had the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.429 
thing with these tires is I had the
expensive<00:01:59.270> stock<00:01:59.569> tires

going down the road I can honestly say
that<00:02:08.030> these<00:02:08.479> don't<00:02:09.289> seem<00:02:09.500> any<00:02:09.649> louder<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
they're more like a 1.75 but in its

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
as 21 to 22 so that's pretty impressive

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.870 
as 21 to 22 so that's pretty impressive
with<00:03:18.349> having<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.709> really<00:03:19.430> good<00:03:19.609> aggressive

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.370 
tire that's livable these hand kick gun
pros<00:03:25.099> I've<00:03:25.669> just<00:03:25.910> been<00:03:26.090> real<00:03:26.329> satisfied<00:03:27.200> with

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
pros I've just been real satisfied with

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.589 
pros I've just been real satisfied with
them<00:03:27.500> but<00:03:28.280> again<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.669> trick<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.120> getting<00:03:29.510> the

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
them but again the trick is getting the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.670 
them but again the trick is getting the
passenger<00:03:30.260> rated<00:03:31.930> tire<00:03:32.930> because<00:03:33.349> if<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.590> get

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
passenger rated tire because if you get

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.280 
passenger rated tire because if you get
the<00:03:33.799> LTE<00:03:34.220> you're<00:03:34.849> getting<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.120> 10<00:03:35.299> ply<00:03:35.510> tire<00:03:35.780> and

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
the LTE you're getting a 10 ply tire and

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.670 
the LTE you're getting a 10 ply tire and
you<00:03:36.769> just<00:03:36.919> don't<00:03:37.160> need<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.430> implies<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:38.000> these

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
you just don't need to implies on these

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.319 
you just don't need to implies on these
you<00:03:39.680> know<00:03:39.799> it's<00:03:39.980> like<00:03:40.160> giving<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.549> pair<00:03:41.299> of

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
you know it's like giving a pair of

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.809 
you know it's like giving a pair of
steel-toed<00:03:41.690> boots<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.500> track<00:03:42.889> runner<00:03:43.130> it's

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
steel-toed boots to a track runner it's

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.879 
steel-toed boots to a track runner it's
just<00:03:43.970> going<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.150> slow<00:03:44.329> them<00:03:44.450> down<00:03:44.650> tire<00:03:45.650> like

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
just going to slow them down tire like

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.670 
just going to slow them down tire like
this<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:47.000> know<00:03:47.319> still<00:03:48.319> a<00:03:48.349> little<00:03:48.530> bit

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
this is you know still a little bit

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.909 
this is you know still a little bit
heavier<00:03:48.950> in<00:03:48.980> stock<00:03:49.370> but<00:03:49.669> I<00:03:50.650> think<00:03:51.650> it's<00:03:51.739> well

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
heavier in stock but I think it's well

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.199 
heavier in stock but I think it's well
worth<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.280> if<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.430> especially<00:03:52.819> if<00:03:53.090> you're

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
worth it if you especially if you're

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.030 
worth it if you especially if you're
doing<00:03:53.329> an<00:03:53.480> upgrade<00:03:53.599> from<00:03:53.959> stock<00:03:54.319> they<00:03:54.919> also

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
doing an upgrade from stock they also

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.000 
doing an upgrade from stock they also
make<00:03:55.370> these<00:03:55.519> tires<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.120> stock<00:03:56.359> size<00:03:56.629> and<00:03:57.019> I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
make these tires in the stock size and I

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.470 
make these tires in the stock size and I
think<00:03:58.370> cos<00:03:58.519> you're<00:03:58.790> actually<00:03:59.060> lighter<00:03:59.359> than

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
think cos you're actually lighter than

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.339 
think cos you're actually lighter than
the<00:03:59.720> tires<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.230> came<00:04:00.379> on<00:04:00.639> so<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.959> that's<00:04:03.169> my
