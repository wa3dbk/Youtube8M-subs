releases and and that's something that I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.110 
releases and and that's something that I
think<00:01:00.079> actually<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.590> when<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.309> win<00:01:02.640> an<00:01:02.760> artist

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
think actually if when you win an artist

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.399 
think actually if when you win an artist
does<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> kind<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.780> frustrates<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.350> when

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
does that it kind of frustrates me when

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.070 
does that it kind of frustrates me when
artists<00:01:04.739> take<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.100> long<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.549> write<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
artists take that long to write to to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
artists take that long to write to to

you know I mentioned those in those

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.000 
you know I mentioned those in those
moments<00:03:41.570> where<00:03:41.900> it's<00:03:41.989> more<00:03:42.170> insane<00:03:42.530> kind<00:03:42.890> of<00:03:42.950> a

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
moments where it's more insane kind of a

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.400 
moments where it's more insane kind of a
creepy<00:03:43.370> vibe<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.420> at<00:03:44.540> least<00:03:44.720> at<00:03:45.049> least<00:03:45.080> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
creepy vibe to to at least at least the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.580 
creepy vibe to to at least at least the
vocals<00:03:45.739> in<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:45.830> lyrics<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.810> also<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.200> highly

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
vocals in the lyrics it also is highly

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.140 
vocals in the lyrics it also is highly
contrasted<00:03:49.190> there's<00:03:49.340> more<00:03:49.640> sentimental

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
contrasted there's more sentimental

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.880 
contrasted there's more sentimental
moments<00:03:50.600> on<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.780> album<00:03:50.959> too<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:51.860> I

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
moments on this album too and so I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.470 
moments on this album too and so I
thought<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.400> way<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.209> moods

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
thought that the way that that the moods

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.910 
thought that the way that that the moods
were<00:03:53.690> controlled<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.470> was<00:03:54.650> was

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
were controlled like that was was

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.890 
were controlled like that was was
actually<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.459> really<00:03:56.060> nice<00:03:56.269> addition<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.780> the

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
actually a really nice addition to the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.259 
actually a really nice addition to the
to<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.260> sound<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.769> thought<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.280> really<00:03:58.820> allowed

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
to the sound I thought it really allowed

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.880 
to the sound I thought it really allowed
the<00:03:59.480> album<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.930> flow<00:04:00.170> nicely<00:04:00.440> where<00:04:00.799> you

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
the album to flow nicely where you

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.320 
the album to flow nicely where you
weren't<00:04:01.070> getting<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.489> same<00:04:01.700> sort<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.060> track

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
weren't getting the same sort of track

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.880 
weren't getting the same sort of track
delivered<00:04:02.750> over<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.200> over<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.500> over<00:04:03.590> again

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
delivered over and over and over again

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.390 
delivered over and over and over again
um<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.940> know<00:04:05.060> I<00:04:05.090> think<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.980> album<00:04:07.310> is

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
um you know I think that this album is

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.430 
um you know I think that this album is
actually<00:04:07.730> paste<00:04:07.970> very<00:04:08.269> well<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.630> starts<00:04:08.959> from

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
actually paste very well it starts from

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.170 
actually paste very well it starts from
beginning<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:09.950> end<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.250> plays<00:04:10.489> very<00:04:10.730> fluidly

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
beginning to end in plays very fluidly

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.729 
beginning to end in plays very fluidly
throughout<00:04:11.600> i<00:04:11.630> think<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.170> hotknife<00:04:12.560> has

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
throughout i think that the hotknife has

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.580 
throughout i think that the hotknife has
a<00:04:12.769> closer<00:04:13.160> just<00:04:13.940> kind<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.239> was<00:04:14.390> like

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
a closer just kind of was like

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.319 
a closer just kind of was like
the<00:04:14.709> icing<00:04:15.220> on<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.489> cake<00:04:15.670> was<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.150> such<00:04:16.299> a

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
the icing on the cake was just such a

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.960 
the icing on the cake was just such a
beautiful<00:04:17.049> weight<00:04:17.230> and<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.680> album<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.760> in

beautiful weight and the album and in
kind<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.449> sadistic<00:04:20.139> sort<00:04:20.739> of<00:04:20.829> beautiful<00:04:21.250> way

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
kind of a sadistic sort of beautiful way

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.340

and a half minutes that most of them are

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.719 
and a half minutes that most of them are
comprised<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.200> there's<00:04:54.100> not<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.280> lot<00:04:54.490> we<00:04:54.520> can

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
comprised of there's not a lot we can

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.909 
comprised of there's not a lot we can
say<00:04:55.000> that<00:04:55.030> other<00:04:55.570> reviewers<00:04:56.229> haven't<00:04:56.770> already

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
say that other reviewers haven't already

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.969 
say that other reviewers haven't already
said<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.340> think<00:04:57.669> that<00:04:57.850> when<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.479> comes<00:04:58.600> down<00:04:58.810> to

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
said I think that when it comes down to

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.260 
said I think that when it comes down to
while<00:04:59.979> we<00:05:00.160> like<00:05:00.370> this<00:05:00.580> out<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.880> don't<00:05:01.030> think<00:05:01.090> we

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
while we like this out I don't think we

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.550 
while we like this out I don't think we
liked<00:05:01.479> it<00:05:01.630> as<00:05:01.720> much<00:05:01.750> as<00:05:01.900> everyone<00:05:02.229> else<00:05:02.350> I

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
liked it as much as everyone else I

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.960 
liked it as much as everyone else I
think<00:05:02.710> this<00:05:02.830> will<00:05:02.919> be<00:05:02.979> at<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.729> top<00:05:03.910> of

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
think this will be at the top of

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.670 
think this will be at the top of
everyone's<00:05:04.479> list<00:05:04.720> for<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.139> year<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.440> I<00:05:05.500> think

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
everyone's list for the year and I think

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.409 
everyone's list for the year and I think
that<00:05:05.800> that's<00:05:05.830> kind<00:05:06.160> of<00:05:06.280> well<00:05:07.000> first<00:05:07.180> of<00:05:07.330> all

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
that that's kind of well first of all

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.690 
that that's kind of well first of all
it's<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:07.960> little<00:05:07.990> early<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:09.130> jump<00:05:09.340> into<00:05:09.520> that

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
it's a little early to jump into that

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.310 
it's a little early to jump into that
it's<00:05:09.910> I<00:05:09.970> mean<00:05:10.240> it's<00:05:10.330> only<00:05:10.479> hears<00:05:11.020> only<00:05:11.139> a

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
it's I mean it's only hears only a

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.279 
it's I mean it's only hears only a
little<00:05:11.740> over<00:05:11.950> half<00:05:12.190> over<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:13.020> but<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.050> think

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
little over half over so but I think

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.370 
little over half over so but I think
that<00:05:14.850> this<00:05:15.850> album<00:05:16.240> has<00:05:16.270> some<00:05:16.840> strengths<00:05:17.169> but

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
that this album has some strengths but

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.750 
that this album has some strengths but
it<00:05:17.500> also<00:05:17.650> has<00:05:17.889> a<00:05:17.949> couple<00:05:18.400> weaknesses

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
it also has a couple weaknesses

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.400 
it also has a couple weaknesses
definitely<00:05:19.240> I<00:05:19.389> mean<00:05:19.479> I'm<00:05:20.020> gonna<00:05:20.139> give<00:05:20.320> this

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
definitely I mean I'm gonna give this

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.779 
definitely I mean I'm gonna give this

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
throughout while the songwriting is

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.990 
throughout while the songwriting is
great<00:06:07.539> the<00:06:07.930> artistic<00:06:08.380> state<00:06:08.650> exactly<00:06:09.099> it<00:06:09.789> just

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
great the artistic state exactly it just

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.450 
great the artistic state exactly it just
feels<00:06:10.150> a<00:06:10.360> little<00:06:10.539> reserved<00:06:11.050> for<00:06:11.440> Mia<00:06:11.620> as<00:06:12.130> far

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
feels a little reserved for Mia as far

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.219 
feels a little reserved for Mia as far
as<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.669> performance<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.479> as<00:06:13.539> far<00:06:13.810> as<00:06:14.020> the

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
as the performance and as far as the

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.529 
as the performance and as far as the
high<00:06:14.500> points<00:06:15.010> in<00:06:15.099> the<00:06:15.190> dynamics<00:06:15.760> yeah<00:06:15.910> yeah

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
high points in the dynamics yeah yeah

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.330 
high points in the dynamics yeah yeah
and<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:17.020> I<00:06:17.080> think<00:06:17.289> that<00:06:17.440> that<00:06:17.470> you<00:06:18.070> know<00:06:18.099> that

and and I think that that you know that

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.589 
and and I think that that you know that
definitely<00:06:18.700> affected<00:06:19.090> you<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.240> little<00:06:19.479> bit

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
definitely affected you a little bit

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.110 
definitely affected you a little bit
more<00:06:19.720> I<00:06:19.900> was<00:06:20.080> just<00:06:20.470> really<00:06:20.650> i'm<00:06:21.639> probably<00:06:21.849> with

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
the school that this is a

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.110 
the school that this is a
good<00:06:23.380> album<00:06:23.710> probably<00:06:24.550> one<00:06:24.640> of<00:06:24.670> the<00:06:24.790> best<00:06:24.940> of

was just you know kind of a beautiful

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.510 
was just you know kind of a beautiful
artistic<00:06:49.750> experience<00:06:50.380> I'm<00:06:50.500> going<00:06:50.710> to<00:06:50.770> 86<00:06:51.280> and

artistic experience I'm going to 86 and

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.790 
artistic experience I'm going to 86 and
going<00:06:51.700> to<00:06:51.790> 80<00:06:51.940> okay<00:06:52.450> so<00:06:52.510> lower<00:06:53.080> 80s<00:06:53.500> from<00:06:53.710> us

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
going to 80 okay so lower 80s from us

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.860 
going to 80 okay so lower 80s from us
that<00:06:54.310> is<00:06:54.670> I<00:06:55.000> think<00:06:55.030> a<00:06:55.270> good<00:06:55.300> fit<00:06:55.600> for<00:06:55.630> this

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
that is I think a good fit for this

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.450 
that is I think a good fit for this
album<00:06:56.050> actually<00:06:56.590> i<00:06:56.620> think<00:06:56.680> it<00:06:56.920> is<00:06:56.950> slightly

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
album actually i think it is slightly

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.160 
album actually i think it is slightly
overhyped<00:06:58.180> I<00:06:58.360> mean<00:06:58.510> it's<00:06:58.720> getting<00:06:58.960> a<00:06:58.990> lot<00:06:59.110> of

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
overhyped I mean it's getting a lot of

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.740 
overhyped I mean it's getting a lot of
10<00:06:59.440> out<00:06:59.560> of<00:06:59.590> 10<00:06:59.830> zahn<00:07:00.160> on<00:07:00.340> different<00:07:01.000> you<00:07:01.660> know
