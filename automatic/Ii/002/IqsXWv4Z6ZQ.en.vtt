you do that you can just simply lift and
work<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:06.989> up<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:10.370> back<00:03:11.370> out<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.780> way<00:03:12.959> you

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
work this up and back out of the way you

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.229 
work this up and back out of the way you
can<00:03:13.439> lift<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.769> over<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.069> shifter<00:03:14.519> you
