00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
different between this and the other

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.520 
different between this and the other
versions<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.720> technology<00:02:15.930> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
versions was we have the technology to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.680 
versions was we have the technology to
do<00:02:16.890> motion<00:02:17.370> capture<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.180> I'm<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> first

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
do motion capture so I'm the first

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.350 
do motion capture so I'm the first
factor<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.069> played<00:02:20.310> both<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.819> Hulk<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
factor to have played both the Hulk and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.080 
factor to have played both the Hulk and
Bruce<00:02:21.630> Banner<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.610> because<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.970> think

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
Bruce Banner and because of that I think

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.780 
Bruce Banner and because of that I think
the<00:02:24.480> Hulk<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:25.049> has<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.370> humanistic<00:02:26.370> and
