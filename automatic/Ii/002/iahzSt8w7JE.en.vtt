00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.009
 I got this glasses 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:16.289

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:20.939
 she bought airsoft for playing airsoft 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.070
 seller with a good rating of 200 orders 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.650
 one hundred percent positive feedback reviews 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.869
 good people write that complete 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.469
 matching what you see on 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.590
 photos of what you see in the package 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.730
 now I will actually give you 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.980
 opportunity to see with my own eyes 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.480
 the package came so soft 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:51.730
 I already opened the package 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:01:01.179
 outer package inside we and day more 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:03.250
 I have n't opened a strong package yet 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.540
 immediately say that glasses come in 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.380
 complete with case 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:13.350
 in this case it's a pair of points two pieces 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.259
 here we see the hard case 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.259
 some secondary housing also we have here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.490
 carton package 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:32.200
 which is very convenient because you can and 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:34.530
 lay down someone to present in such a 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.530
 in language 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:47.539
 points of sediment are needed and so are the appearance 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:50.270
 case cover hard there are special 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.459
 straps for fastening as on one case 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.229
 such a friend 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.909
 if the barrels came without a cover, I think not 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.549
 would not reach me but since 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.929
 The bundle included a case, so apparently 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.619
 the packaging was done so let's check 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:11.360
 what do we have inside in a moment and it goes very 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:15.849
 easy and simple logo that's what we have 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:21.860
 there is such a rag inside 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.799
 information stickers one more 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.989
 information 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.390
 detailed instructions like 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.370
 interchangeable parts that go into 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.129
 complete 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.440
 it is we until we postpone it we do not need and 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:47.180
 so what we see inside inside we see 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:49.900
 the cord is transferred to the spare 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.900
 actually themselves 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.440
 here are the glasses in this case they 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.380
 staffed by default worth 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.359
 transferred with a nozzle for correction 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.120
 of view 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.540
 removed not easy enough to fall 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.069
 yourself 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.019
 with little effort but not necessary 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.599
 attach any additional 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.680
 super effort replaced is removed ta 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.700
 the thing is easy too 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.540
 there is a small latch which 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.269
 just as easy and put 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.269
 plastic is pretty good part 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.630
 transferred to plastic 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.000
 there is 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.130
 rubberizing in order to be comfortable 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.120
 skin is so external 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.560
 external enough fine i would say 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.110
 Fully fit that photo 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:50.770
 which you see from the seller here is on 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.140
 the arms are also part of rubberizing here 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.140
 proper opening for staging 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:06.910
 of this cord and here is a carabiner 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:11.790
 small buckle length varies and so 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.790
 what we have we put the usual bridge 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.380
 that's just as easy to put 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.070
 snapping here our glasses are ready for 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:26.950
 use as our understand 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:31.420
 glasses originally there is a lock we 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:38.200
 remove the nose and just take off 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:42.130
 lenses here I was not fooled 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:46.030
 we have extra glass yellow 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.440
 and transparent case we have 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.570
 special places 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.430
 home above calmly put back 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.660
 these glasses they will be 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.660
 upright position 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.430
 can easily take them out puts in place 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.210
 so let's put it off for now. 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.800
 glass back when I looked for a long time 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.130
 instruction that is a little trick 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.570
 you can just get the hang of it for installation 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.830
 stew first put 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:24.660
 grooves 1 and 2 and then installed in 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:28.200
 the glass itself after installing the glass you 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.710
 put the lock in place and 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.300
 install is transferred 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.510
 all our glasses are ready for again 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.510
 operation 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.790
 what does he say outwardly to me all very 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:50.700
 like plastic smell frank 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:55.330
 no, there are small markings 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.840
 the producer is well read 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:02.200
 logo of the plays with easy enough 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.120
 removed for interchangeable parts they 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.700
 do not fall out 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.390
 overall impression of points is enough 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:13.800
 good I got two pairs one pair 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.540
 it remains for me 2 to go to my friend 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:21.040
 Further, I think to spend a little 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:25.540
 bullet stability test 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.130
 here is airsoft weapons i think it will 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.020
 not soon 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:34.540

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.530
