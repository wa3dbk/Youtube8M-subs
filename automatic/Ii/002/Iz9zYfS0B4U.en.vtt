something that women are pushing for it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.100 
something that women are pushing for it
has<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.270> something<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.689> we're<00:01:24.930> all

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and we know historically that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.130 
and we know historically that
communities<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.490> better<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.630> women<00:01:30.960> are
