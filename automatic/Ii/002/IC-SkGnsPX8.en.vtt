00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.260
 Welcome to the second part of 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.840
 tutorial how to delete in maya in this 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.090
 Second part, let's see how to illuminate 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.830
 and render the shadow layer so 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.160
 let us begin 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.529
 well in that bed what we want to do 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.090
 is to render just this part of 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.369
 the shadow that is under the battery 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.189
 and below our character so 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.160
 we need a floor to project 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.890
 the shadow of these two objects and can 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.960
 separate in our layers then we go 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.629
 to do the following we are going to select 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.480
 all the objects plus the risk 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.580
 that in addition to roger more the floor in in this 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.250
 in this render laws and we will use 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.559
 the floor and we're going to add them to a new one 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.559
 layer this layer is going to call 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.120
 well and for that we are going to occupy 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.310
 a material that is called here in 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.010
 Mesh material called news 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.690
 background then if I selected it 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.830
 here it appears I'm going to change it once 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.610
 the name to flower shader 1 and I'm going to 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.300
 assign to the floor that nothing changed but 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.190
 let's edit this material if I give it 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.260
 double click open the attributes and 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.170
 I repeat as it is a material in which 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.790
 let's project the shadow then what 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.420
 The first thing to do is to lower the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.610
 speculate color at 0 to black as he 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.580
 reflective and also to 0 reflection 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.970
 limit to 0 and health more let's 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.040
 leave it in 1 that now what next 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.590
 we have to do is logically create 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.720
 a new light to project the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.940
 shadow we could really add two 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.009
 lights like one that belonged to the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.770
 orange light that we put a little while ago and the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.790
 another the blue light but for simplicity we go 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.510
 to create one nothing more 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.240
 we go to the lights spotlight again 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.370
 we are going to panama look your glasses and 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.970
 let's set the light I'm going to put it 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.740
 behind 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.540
 and yes for me always a little 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.240
 to cast a shadow as to 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.530
 the camera while the light is encompassing 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.200
 the object does not need to be 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.390
 more more out issues like here 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.270
 back but simply with that these two 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.300
 are within the area is green with 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.790
 that's more than enough then we 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.069
 we came back 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.040
 and what we are going to do is again go 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.700
 here below the rays saved us 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.140
 we turn on and for this shadow what 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.599
 I want is a shadow a little bit more 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.780
 soft then let's put who 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.810
 King 26 in the rays once 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.200
 we go with 30 and in the limit we leave it 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.819
 again in 1 as it is still not 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.639
 it's final but let's see what it is that 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.639
 maya does then let's render it 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.190
 ok and again they will see that they appear 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.900
 all your things 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.180
 The first thing is that the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.710
 black shadow and below that is 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.440
 projecting on the plane that not long ago 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.180
 we had 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.370
 and the second is that it reappears 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.760
 our character reappears 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.970
 our background and that is logically something 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.250
 that we do not want if we want to separate the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.240
 shadow of the character then we have 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.730
 that find a way to hide 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.250
 both the battery and the drumsticks as 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.570
 our character and as the background 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.340
 so well the background you know what 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.630
 they select from here if you have not 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.400
 lost and the bottom will always be 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.069
 present is one thing that has 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.680
 the indec lighting elements face lighting 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.470
 that appears in all of them in all 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.409
 layers then again here take it off 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.299
 here the program visibility the sphere 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.819
 that although they do not see each other here 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.950
 affecting is there present then and what 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.989
 second thing to do is turn off the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.599
 visibility of our characters 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.409
 then the simplest way to 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.450
 do it is the following we select from 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:06.880
 this side the main node of our 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:10.400
 character and we go here to window 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.160
 editors and then to the second option 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.190
 exit 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.350
 and here where it says render the tap that says 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.600
 render there is a column called 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.470
 prime visibility the click is 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.750
 select all write the number 0 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.830
 the antenta and then all the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.510
 visibility of that of this layer as it 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.000
 they go or not this layer forgiveness of this 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.300
 character goes the same with the 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.980
 drumsticks 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.500
 here display 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.050
 forgiveness windows satellites editor 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.550
 pÃ©rez its selection in flat networks 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:52.449
 visibility lancer and again 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.500
 for the battery 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:05:01.840
 windows general to three sets 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.280
 they go here first and third enter 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.070
 so now we are going to see what is it 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.400
 what happens we are going to perform again 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.400
 this 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.490
 and the first thing they will notice is that the 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.960
 so it got dark and they are going to say 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.440
 well we have past where are my 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.690
 shades 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.270
 there are nothing else that you can not see because 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.970
 they are completely black yes this is 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.190
 normal if you want to see that shadow like that 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.200
 has been calculated only enough 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.030
 Click here to give alpha chanel and 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.740
 while you see here the shadow that 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.210
 is going to come out white is not white really 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.340
 It's black but then nothing else 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.230
 alpha chana then watching while 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.210
 come out this way it means that 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.090
 it's fine then ready that's how 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.700
 we separate the shadow of color and 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.730
 rest of the characters and their own 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.380
 that are in our show then we 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.380
 we see in part 3
