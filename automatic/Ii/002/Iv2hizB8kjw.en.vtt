00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
know this one and we do the hips side to

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.490 
know this one and we do the hips side to
side<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.510> one<00:01:11.690> that<00:01:11.900> prevents

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
side and this is the one that prevents

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.890 
side and this is the one that prevents
the<00:01:13.400> hip<00:01:13.610> replacement<00:01:13.820> because<00:01:14.570> this

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
the hip replacement because this

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.820 
the hip replacement because this
strengthens<00:01:15.500> all<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:18.020> ligaments<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:18.710> the

feet together microcosmic orbit now
people<00:01:27.020> ask<00:01:27.260> me<00:01:27.470> all<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.650> time<00:01:27.800> they<00:01:28.040> say

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
people ask me all the time they say

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.580 
people ask me all the time they say
which<00:01:28.730> one<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.390> single<00:01:29.870> most<00:01:29.900> important

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
which one is the single most important

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.090 
which one is the single most important
exercise<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.700> all<00:01:31.910> the<00:01:32.270> 14<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.080> I<00:01:33.650> say<00:01:33.920> you'll

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
exercise of all the 14 and I say you'll

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.910 
exercise of all the 14 and I say you'll
never<00:01:34.160> guess<00:01:35.050> it's<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.260> microcosmic<00:01:36.770> orbit

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
never guess it's the microcosmic orbit

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.070 
never guess it's the microcosmic orbit
that's<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.940> single<00:01:38.150> most<00:01:38.420> important<00:01:38.930> one

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
that's the single most important one

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.010 
that's the single most important one
because<00:01:39.290> we<00:01:39.560> do<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.890> 128<00:01:40.850> times<00:01:41.180> all<00:01:41.720> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
because we do that 128 times all the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.510 
because we do that 128 times all the
other<00:01:42.170> exercises<00:01:42.530> are<00:01:43.010> only<00:01:43.220> done<00:01:43.610> once<00:01:44.510> the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
other exercises are only done once the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.490 
other exercises are only done once the
second<00:01:46.520> most<00:01:46.640> important<00:01:47.119> exercise<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.990> the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
second most important exercise is the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.280 
second most important exercise is the
non<00:01:49.460> complete<00:01:49.940> breaths<00:01:50.210> because<00:01:50.540> we<00:01:50.869> do<00:01:51.050> that

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
non complete breaths because we do that

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.730 
non complete breaths because we do that
114<00:01:52.220> times<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:54.430> Qigong<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.670> not<00:01:56.290> limited<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.710> a

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
114 times so Qigong is not limited to a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.840 
114 times so Qigong is not limited to a
set<00:01:58.160> of<00:01:58.400> exercises<00:01:59.260> Qigong<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:01.130> mindset

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
set of exercises Qigong is a mindset

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.350 
set of exercises Qigong is a mindset
it's<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.600> lifestyle<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:04.280> an<00:02:04.520> understanding

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
it's a lifestyle it's an understanding

it's a lifestyle it's an understanding
that<00:02:05.390> we<00:02:05.810> are<00:02:06.110> part<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.679> nature<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:08.020> as<00:02:09.020> we

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
that we are part of nature and as we

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.320 
that we are part of nature and as we
balance<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.009> energy<00:02:10.190> from<00:02:10.729> side<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.060> side

balance the energy from side to side

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.570 
balance the energy from side to side
from<00:02:12.230> hand<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.770> hand

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
from hand to hand

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.330 
from hand to hand
we're<00:02:14.860> understanding<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.130> we<00:02:16.310> are

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
we're understanding that we are

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
we're understanding that we are
literally<00:02:17.060> swimming<00:02:17.660> through<00:02:18.410> air<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.360> this

literally swimming through air and this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.270 
literally swimming through air and this
is<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.110> crux<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:22.810> Medical<00:02:23.810> Qigong<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:25.100> are

is the crux of Medical Qigong you are

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.600 
is the crux of Medical Qigong you are

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
lymphatic fluid so that there is no

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.570 
lymphatic fluid so that there is no

and<00:02:40.670> premature<00:02:41.240> death<00:02:42.040> okay<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.580> last

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
and premature death okay the last

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.320 
and premature death okay the last
exercise<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.110> lung<00:02:45.470> kidney<00:02:45.830> exercise<00:02:46.550> the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
exercise is a lung kidney exercise the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.110 
exercise is a lung kidney exercise the
first<00:02:47.660> three<00:02:47.960> ribs<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.590> area<00:02:49.120> innervates

first three ribs this area innervates
the<00:02:50.270> lung<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:50.810> we're<00:02:50.930> going<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.110> make<00:02:51.290> our

fingers very stiff as we breathe in

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.710 
fingers very stiff as we breathe in
we're<00:02:54.530> going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.680> strike<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.370> area<00:02:55.880> by

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
we're going to strike that area by

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
every day but we don't take internal

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.420 
every day but we don't take internal
showers<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:20.930> Qigong<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.770> way<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.190> do

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
showers so Qigong is the way we do

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.150 
showers so Qigong is the way we do
internal<00:03:23.060> showers<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.710> is<00:03:24.890> how<00:03:25.100> we

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
internal showers and this is how we

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.320 
internal showers and this is how we
break<00:03:25.550> up<00:03:25.610> stagnation<00:03:26.600> in<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> lungs<00:03:27.140> and

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
break up stagnation in the lungs and

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.120 
break up stagnation in the lungs and
this<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:29.510> how<00:03:29.630> we<00:03:29.690> break<00:03:30.050> up<00:03:30.110> stagnation<00:03:31.010> in

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
this is how we break up stagnation in

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.750 
this is how we break up stagnation in
the<00:03:31.250> kidneys<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:33.190> now<00:03:34.190> we're<00:03:34.400> going<00:03:34.550> to<00:03:34.640> do

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
the kidneys and now we're going to do

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.700 
the kidneys and now we're going to do
the<00:03:34.880> thymus<00:03:35.210> thump<00:03:35.630> there's<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.900> thymus<00:03:36.410> gland

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
the thymus thump there's a thymus gland

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.420 
the thymus thump there's a thymus gland
behind<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.490> breastbone<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.690> now<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:43.070> immune
