00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.540 
to sort of see in there then you're
going<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.260> start<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.650> roof<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.100> for<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.370> roof

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
going to start the roof and for the roof

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.780 
going to start the roof and for the roof
I<00:01:15.700> start<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.360> used<00:01:16.840> brick<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:18.400> do<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.670> roof

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
I start I used brick to do the roof

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.530 
I start I used brick to do the roof
because<00:01:19.000> I<00:01:19.030> thought<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.300> would<00:01:19.390> look<00:01:19.480> pretty

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
because I thought it would look pretty

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.210 
because I thought it would look pretty
cool<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:20.050> can<00:01:20.200> use<00:01:20.350> whatever<00:01:20.500> material<00:01:21.100> you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220

cool you can use whatever material you
want<00:01:21.430> but<00:01:22.060> already<00:01:22.690> done<00:01:22.930> nose<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.230> the<00:01:23.320> roof

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
want but already done nose to the roof

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
but I'll show you the general pattern of

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.450 
but I'll show you the general pattern of
what<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.600> want<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.840> be<00:01:25.930> doing<00:01:26.260> so<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.950> want<00:01:27.370> to

start on a side like this and you want
to<00:01:30.190> build<00:01:30.340> one<00:01:30.580> out<00:01:30.790> like<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.750> then

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
to build one out like that and then

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.140 
to build one out like that and then
build<00:01:32.500> on<00:01:32.620> top<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:33.010> that<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.490> then<00:01:33.910> you<00:01:33.940> want

sort<00:01:35.830> of<00:01:35.950> one<00:01:36.190> above<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:37.230> then<00:01:38.230> I'm<00:01:38.620> going<00:01:38.890> to

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
sort of one above and then I'm going to

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.440 
sort of one above and then I'm going to
fly<00:01:39.190> mode<00:01:39.400> and<00:01:39.670> then<00:01:39.760> you<00:01:39.880> want<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.330> sort

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
fly mode and then you want to just sort

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.620 
fly mode and then you want to just sort
of<00:01:40.630> fill<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.110> in<00:01:41.230> in<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:42.580> same<00:01:42.760> pattern<00:01:43.060> so

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
of fill it in in the same pattern so

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.960 
of fill it in in the same pattern so
when<00:01:44.620> you<00:01:44.710> get<00:01:44.860> into<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> corners<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.670> want

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
when you get into the corners you want

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.090 
when you get into the corners you want
to<00:01:46.060> do<00:01:46.210> we're<00:01:46.900> losing<00:01:47.230> bag<00:01:47.380> corners<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:47.950> want

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
to do we're losing bag corners you want

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.520 
to do we're losing bag corners you want
to<00:01:48.160> do<00:01:48.250> sort<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.610> staircase<00:01:48.910> pattern<00:01:49.540> to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
to do sort of a staircase pattern to

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.560 
to do sort of a staircase pattern to
make<00:01:51.370> sure<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:51.790> get<00:01:51.940> all<00:01:52.060> those<00:01:52.270> in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
make sure that you can get all those in

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.390 
make sure that you can get all those in
and<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.380> just<00:01:53.560> really<00:01:53.830> want<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.070> keep<00:01:54.250> on

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
I think maybe to Minecraft days to like

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.850 
I think maybe to Minecraft days to like
half<00:02:12.460> hour<00:02:12.700> 45<00:02:13.450> minutes<00:02:13.690> go<00:02:13.990> too<00:02:14.260> long

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
half hour 45 minutes go too long

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.220 
half hour 45 minutes go too long
but<00:02:15.610> that's<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.450> beginning<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.960> first

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
but that's the beginning of the first

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.670 
but that's the beginning of the first
tower<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.710> it's<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> biggest<00:02:18.220> one<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.640> yeah
