going back in the day my pattern uses do

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.750 
going back in the day my pattern uses do
the<00:00:56.280> inconsistent<00:00:57.059> broken<00:00:57.420> angle<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:58.109> pattern

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
the inconsistent broken angle my pattern

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
the inconsistent broken angle my pattern
was<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.870> way<00:01:01.109> kind<00:01:01.379> of

but I came up with a vertical person to
try<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.820> force<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.630> pattern<00:01:19.049> straight<00:01:19.460> without

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
try to force my pattern straight without

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.450 
try to force my pattern straight without
scalping<00:01:21.590> any<00:01:22.590> work<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.960> class<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.650> noticed

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
scalping any work and class I noticed

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.950

when<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.939> doing<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.360> got<00:01:27.540> rid<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.930> lot

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
when I was doing that I got rid of a lot

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.160 
when I was doing that I got rid of a lot
of<00:01:28.140> course<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> had<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.170> inconsistent

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
of course that I had do the inconsistent

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.899 
of course that I had do the inconsistent
angles<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.570> if<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.720> got<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.049> water<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:35.009> couple

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
angles so if you got that water a couple

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.109 
angles so if you got that water a couple
of<00:01:36.119> quarts<00:01:36.799> more<00:01:37.799> fit<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
of quarts more fit but it's not the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
of quarts more fit but it's not the
people<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.479> source<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:40.829> all
