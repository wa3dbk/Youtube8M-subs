 in assessing its mechanism for anyone 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.259
 It's no secret that my street is straight. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.210
 Racers delayed a little 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.870
 and therefore allowing myself even Denmark i 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.460
 decided to do a little review on 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.349
 toy on 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.179
 losing own movie street racers 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.179
 of course phrases 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.480
 Russian toy for Russian film 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.540
 the value sounds very terrible so better 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.670
 enter immediately kobzon look 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.789
 east because sometimes they are 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.190
 really interesting 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.290
 graphics which low more kazis on 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.090
 high protein render beer let it be 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.960
 high difficulty games 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.900
 Ministry of Culture maximum 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.700
 I passed 6 2 but only at the highest 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.060
 our difficulty level will not be 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.690
 new game yes i want to start new year 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 Apparently for this, she pressed new players 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.930
 how to choose a level 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.430
 and I want state bridges oh well 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.340
 initially show you all levels 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.630
 on previously erring therefore 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.340
 choose the first one of them 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.210
 to bridges 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.390
 but the local fleet is five cars 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.720
 quite similar names here only 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.250
 listen 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.930
 warehouse team 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.280
 phoenix lighter 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.900
 Oslo 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.580
 super easy to name you 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.109
 on give away medal although no 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.599
 the one who painted these cars should be given 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.249
 medal would such an acid bg i dont 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.270
 seen a long time ago 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 why acid new say what 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.330
 horseradish Volga faster dvenashki 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.550
 but the car is all concerned so we 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.770
 choose 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.480
 there was no such team 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.430
 in the third Russia 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.620
 no relation to the film she certainly is not 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.780
 has choose sneakers score the scene 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 percent 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.549
 perhaps yes this account of this whole road 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.810
 not enough except with you 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.489
 gimme here I wonder what attitude is this 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.460
 the game has a movie that is, there is no 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.930
 screensavers in the subject of the film and 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.299
 why there were no splash screens at all I didn't understand 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.299
 Where are they 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.839
 for people's strikes 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.609
 I waited for shots from the movie or some 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.059
 different behavior but for now 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.719
 from the film there is nothing even the title 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.069
 no movie street racers hot 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.899
 asphalt 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.229
 apparently hot of us 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.969
 but I want to discuss it 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.899
 so here's the original to failures 14 dialogs i dont 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.139
 I know what to call 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.109
 should then connect to 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.679
 princess korea on some supercar but 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.649
 the fact is that this is the princesses 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.779
 kapishon loan for ridiculous than 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.059
 design it does not issue engaged that 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.319
 same person as design 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.379
 cars from the movie 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.399
 on her control of Tokyo 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.329
 Yes, I do not know what could be easier 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.919
 drive cars need 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.649
 just one finger 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.480
 and not necessarily on the river 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.430
 what the hell but what could it be 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.369
 such to imagine 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.809
 two hours I'll be a lithuanian these what 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.499
 it's a lot 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.589
 sick of shame and disgrace the movie were 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.449
 American cars are disfigured 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.759
 here apparently decided to get there our 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.759
 but of course the stupid opponent is stupid 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.599
 so they filed take 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.789
 a year later I fell well that I overtook 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.069
 the beginning could do harm 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.709
 hurt more 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.769
 and create a dangerous situation on the road 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.769
 my he doesn't even have it anyway 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.779
 you take a look at the vote I have 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.269
 hot but the size of may nile 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.159
 Here is the same fear that your car 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.180
 coal seam put it on 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.409
 the window sill is calm 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.590
 either cats stuff can't improve 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.700
 and then if you wish on the fourth floor oh 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.739
 how unlucky to communicate 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.889
 so we are the next level airfield 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.340
 Besides 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.340
 like that he was in the car and 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.680
 stock did not understand 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.730
 me that one one race all the cars opened that 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:33.830
 whether 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.490
 she's great 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.639
 probably 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.849
 choose Volga 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.849
 which is faster than dvenashki 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:46.689
 airfield thaw title for those who 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.069
 after the underground miss racing 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.289
 coolers 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.909
 such a delay 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.520
 in our century 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.610
 But there were savers in the second 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.830
 missions 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.219
 This is all data to teach text 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.219
 three months and started singing, you can write a book 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.389
 in Vladivostok 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.479
 come the day you look at these 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.069
 five field 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.430
 Look 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.580
 on the third 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.930
 on these koloboks on the posts upstairs 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.889
 because calling it a light bulb like that 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.889
 difficult big figure it looks like half a point 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.569
 and where I did not want 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:30.939
 why the heck is open 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.639
 space in the race 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.059
 where 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.849
 what for 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.150
 Ivanov 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.479
 my rivals from there 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.110
 What makes me happy is that I work 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.610
 turn signals 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.129
 in which some Chinese mothers want 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.460
 to be realistic auto simulator it would 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.139
 handy but 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.169
 in the game are simple tracers or you 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.839
 ever seen during races 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.489
 or at least in the afterburner the winner 

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:02.939
 turn on the turn signal 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.279
 I can't remember such a scene 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.319
 want circles esil ionic yellow red 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.779
 probably one of them can make a traffic light 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.939
 it's so obvious 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.939
 fine, I came second 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.749
 prices you know what already 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:23.389
 Joe Cole CIA 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.529
 she too 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.119
 on his
