00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.609 
old-fashioned water level determine Iser
is<00:01:36.570> actually<00:01:37.570> working<00:01:37.840> off<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:40.619> which

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
is actually working off of and I which

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.670 
is actually working off of and I which
can<00:01:41.649> steal<00:01:42.340> your<00:01:42.549> water<00:01:42.939> level<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.689> then<00:01:44.439> can

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
can steal your water level and then can

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.450 
can steal your water level and then can
determine<00:01:45.159> if<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:46.539> has<00:01:46.869> if<00:01:47.649> your<00:01:47.920> water<00:01:48.189> level

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
determine if it has if your water level

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.849 
determine if it has if your water level
is<00:01:48.789> balanced<00:01:49.270> or<00:01:49.509> if<00:01:49.869> it's<00:01:50.020> lower<00:01:50.320> good<00:01:50.649> need

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
is balanced or if it's lower good need

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.980 
is balanced or if it's lower good need
to<00:01:51.070> bring<00:01:51.909> more<00:01:52.090> water<00:01:52.329> in<00:01:52.689> it

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
to bring more water in it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.740 
to bring more water in it
however<00:01:53.740> for<00:01:54.039> backup<00:01:54.670> which<00:01:55.179> is<00:01:55.359> one<00:01:55.600> thing

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
however for backup which is one thing

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.230 
however for backup which is one thing
that<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.990> really<00:01:56.170> great<00:01:56.530> about<00:01:56.679> tansy<00:01:57.369> is<00:01:57.549> that

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
that is really great about tansy is that

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.209 
that is really great about tansy is that
they<00:01:58.420> have<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.600> backup<00:01:58.869> system<00:01:59.109> to<00:01:59.710> on<00:01:59.859> a<00:01:59.890> backup

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
they have a backup system to on a backup

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.849 
they have a backup system to on a backup
you<00:02:00.549> have<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:02.439> put<00:02:02.649> on<00:02:02.799> a

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
you have this one and you put on a

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.029 
you have this one and you put on a
different<00:02:03.070> angle<00:02:03.490> like<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:05.079> if<00:02:05.590> your

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
different angle like so and if your

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.550 
different angle like so and if your
water<00:02:06.280> level<00:02:06.939> raised<00:02:07.359> it<00:02:07.890> will<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.780> will<00:02:11.020> argue

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
water level raised it will it will argue

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.980 
water level raised it will it will argue
on<00:02:11.680> start<00:02:12.040> beat<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.970> can<00:02:13.180> connect<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.780> to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
on start beat and you can connect it to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.970 
on start beat and you can connect it to
your<00:02:14.790> reef<00:02:15.790> elite<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:17.380> can<00:02:17.590> send

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
going to put it in your aquarium how are

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.300 
going to put it in your aquarium how are
you<00:02:40.239> using<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.720> sump<00:02:41.049> like<00:02:41.440> most<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.890> us<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.040> can

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
you using a sump like most of us you can

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.789 
you using a sump like most of us you can
put<00:02:42.519> in<00:02:42.640> two<00:02:42.819> different<00:02:43.000> location<00:02:43.780> again<00:02:44.680> it

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
put in two different location again it

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.330 
put in two different location again it
comes<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.160> this<00:02:45.250> own<00:02:45.489> pump<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.379> has<00:02:47.590> so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
comes to this own pump that it has so

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.069
