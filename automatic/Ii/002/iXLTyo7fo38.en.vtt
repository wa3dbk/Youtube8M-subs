00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the back of my head and then I take it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.830 
the back of my head and then I take it
make<00:00:49.860> sure<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:50.309> twisted<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
