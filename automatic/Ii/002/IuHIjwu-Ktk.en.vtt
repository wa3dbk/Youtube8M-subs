right now we are looking at a pretty
horrible<00:00:08.370> rubber<00:00:08.790> roof<00:00:09.090> in<00:00:09.389> Newton

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
horrible rubber roof in Newton

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.339 
horrible rubber roof in Newton
Massachusetts<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.599> roof<00:00:13.170> has

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
Massachusetts and this and this roof has

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.379 
Massachusetts and this and this roof has
been<00:00:13.380> looking<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.490> number<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.940> years<00:00:15.059> now

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
been looking for a number of years now

been looking for a number of years now
so<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.350> can<00:00:16.560> see<00:00:16.770> how<00:00:16.920> badly<00:00:17.190> then<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
so you can see how badly then it is

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.890 
so you can see how badly then it is
installed<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:20.000> part<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> problem<00:00:21.570> is

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
installed and part of the problem is

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.720 
installed and part of the problem is
installation<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:22.800> another<00:00:23.070> part<00:00:23.430> is

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
installation but another part is

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.150 
installation but another part is
actually<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.330> rubber<00:00:24.539> roof<00:00:24.779> itself<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
actually the rubber roof itself and the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.870 
actually the rubber roof itself and the
way<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.550> flashing<00:00:27.060> works<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.230> here

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
way the flashing works you can see here

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.440 
way the flashing works you can see here
the<00:00:29.880> coroner<00:00:30.539> flash<00:00:30.840> they're<00:00:31.619> all<00:00:32.059> reliant<00:00:33.059> on

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the coroner flash they're all reliant on

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.530 
the coroner flash they're all reliant on
the<00:00:33.870> adhesive<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.850> adhesive<00:00:35.850> rings<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.510> can

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the adhesive and adhesive rings you can

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.580 
the adhesive and adhesive rings you can
see<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:37.920> glued<00:00:38.219> down<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.590> this

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
see here this was glued down and this

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.450 
see here this was glued down and this
came<00:00:41.280> right<00:00:41.520> off<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.870> glue<00:00:43.110> broke<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
came right off the glue broke and the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.479 
came right off the glue broke and the
roof<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.910> leaking<00:00:45.530> here<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.980> multiple

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
roof is leaking here and in multiple

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.380 
roof is leaking here and in multiple
other<00:00:47.700> spots<00:00:49.430> even<00:00:50.430> though<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> roof<00:00:51.090> has

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
other spots even though this roof has

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
other spots even though this roof has
about<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.250> half<00:00:53.280> roof<00:00:54.090> pitch<00:00:54.770> there

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
about one and a half roof pitch there

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
about one and a half roof pitch there
the<00:00:56.190> leaks<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.879> been<00:00:56.910> pretty<00:00:57.719> persistent

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the leaks have been pretty persistent

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.139 
the leaks have been pretty persistent
and<00:00:58.559> lasted<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> while<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.500> also<00:01:01.680> see

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
and lasted a while and you can also see

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.990 
and lasted a while and you can also see
heat<00:01:03.149> wire<00:01:03.420> which<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.559> intended<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.580> melt<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
heat wire which is intended to melt the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600 
heat wire which is intended to melt the
ice<00:01:06.210> around<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> skylights<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:08.010> all

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
ice around the skylights and just all

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.780 
ice around the skylights and just all
around<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.970> roof<00:01:09.409> but<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.130> problem<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.640> not

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
around the roof but the problem is not

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
around the roof but the problem is not
the<00:01:11.850> ice<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.540> snow<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> rubber<00:01:14.610> is

the ice and snow the way the rubber is
put<00:01:15.240> together<00:01:16.130> once<00:01:17.130> again<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
put together once again you can see the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.670 
put together once again you can see the
flashing<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.229> adhesive<00:01:20.040> coming<00:01:20.400> off<00:01:21.680> so

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
flashing and the adhesive coming off so

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
flashing and the adhesive coming off so
what<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.909> roof<00:01:24.150> will

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
what we're going to do on this roof will

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.990 
what we're going to do on this roof will
install<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.049> brand-new<00:01:25.439> ib<00:01:26.040> PVC<00:01:26.670> roofing

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
install a brand-new ib PVC roofing

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.950 
install a brand-new ib PVC roofing
system<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:29.280> hit<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.360> seems

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
system and I be has hit well that seems

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.039 
system and I be has hit well that seems
so<00:01:31.290> although<00:01:31.680> all<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.700> material<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so although all the material all the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.890 
so although all the material all the
components<00:01:34.759> flashing<00:01:35.759> around<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.210> outside

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
components flashing around the outside

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
components flashing around the outside
corners<00:01:37.380> inside<00:01:37.770> corners<00:01:38.159> everything<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
corners inside corners everything is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.990 
corners inside corners everything is
heat<00:01:39.000> welded<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.810> once<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.619> weld<00:01:40.860> them<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
heat welded and once you weld them the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.530 
heat welded and once you weld them the
seams<00:01:42.299> never<00:01:42.600> come<00:01:42.869> apart<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
seams never come apart so you have a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
seams never come apart so you have a
completely<00:01:46.049> watertight<00:01:46.470> roof<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:50.220> also

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
completely watertight roof and it's also

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.149 
completely watertight roof and it's also
cool<00:01:51.210> roof<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.079> reflects<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.680> lot<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.950> heat

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
cool roof so it reflects a lot of heat

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.609 
cool roof so it reflects a lot of heat
you<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> run<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.420> AC<00:01:54.810> all<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
you don't have to run your AC all the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.319 
you don't have to run your AC all the
time<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.590> we'll<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.399> doing<00:01:59.670> an

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
time so there you go we'll be doing an

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.640 
time so there you go we'll be doing an
IB<00:02:00.719> PP<00:02:00.990> 0<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.009> Newton<00:02:02.520> Massachusetts

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.859 

so<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.460> pictures<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:08.030> are<00:02:08.090> looking<00:02:08.420> at<00:02:08.479> here

so the pictures you are looking at here

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.990 
so the pictures you are looking at here
they<00:02:09.110> show<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.680> weakened<00:02:10.040> skylights<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:10.820> this

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
they show the weakened skylights on this

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.850 
they show the weakened skylights on this
roof<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.660> can<00:02:11.810> see<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.050> extent<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.590> water

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
roof and you can see the extent of water

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.460 
roof and you can see the extent of water
damage<00:02:13.210> that<00:02:14.210> came<00:02:14.600> through<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.990> skylights

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
damage that came through the skylights

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.260 
damage that came through the skylights
and<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.770> flashing<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.790> can<00:02:17.030> see<00:02:17.240> that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and the flashing and you can see that

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.020 
and the flashing and you can see that
they<00:02:17.840> put<00:02:18.110> plastic<00:02:18.710> on<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.950> skylights<00:02:19.820> to

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
they put plastic on the skylights to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.630 
they put plastic on the skylights to
cover<00:02:20.270> them<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.540> prevent<00:02:20.960> roof<00:02:21.260> leaks<00:02:21.640> but

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
cover them and prevent roof leaks but
