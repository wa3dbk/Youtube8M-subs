00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
for a nine pool here I would say this is

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.620 
for a nine pool here I would say this is
definitely<00:01:44.460> unexpected<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> map<00:01:45.509> like

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
definitely unexpected on a map like

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.149 
definitely unexpected on a map like
Andromeda<00:01:46.170> which<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> very<00:01:46.590> Mac<00:01:46.829> or<00:01:47.009> heavy

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Andromeda which is a very Mac or heavy

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
Andromeda which is a very Mac or heavy
map<00:01:47.369> he's<00:01:47.820> been<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> nine<00:01:48.689> pool

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
map he's been going for a nine pool

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.200 
map he's been going for a nine pool
speedling<00:01:49.439> push<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:51.030> thing<00:01:51.180> is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
speedling push here and the thing is

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.389 
speedling push here and the thing is
though<00:01:51.630> rock<00:01:51.930> has<00:01:52.170> built<00:01:52.409> his<00:01:52.530> pile<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:52.950> inside

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
though rock has built his pile on inside

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.249 
though rock has built his pile on inside
of<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.520> space<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:54.509> assuming<00:01:54.630> he's<00:01:55.049> not

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
of a space so I'm assuming he's not

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.389 
of a space so I'm assuming he's not
going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> pee<00:01:56.040> sooo<00:01:56.189> build

going to be going for a pee sooo build
he's<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.790> going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.329> forge<00:01:57.630> first

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
he's not going to go for the forge first

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.929 
he's not going to go for the forge first
and<00:01:58.200> expansion<00:01:58.740> actually<00:01:59.040> no<00:01:59.159> he<00:01:59.310> actually

off to a bang here July's are now he's

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.520 
off to a bang here July's are now he's
going<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.340> set<00:02:44.489> up<00:02:44.579> his<00:02:44.989> second<00:02:45.989> base<00:02:46.139> here<00:02:46.379> at

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
going to set up his second base here at

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.020 
going to set up his second base here at
his<00:02:46.709> natural<00:02:47.069> expansion<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.700> one<00:02:47.849> that's

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
his natural expansion the one that's

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.339 
his natural expansion the one that's
harder<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.329> hold<00:02:48.569> but<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.139> comes

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
harder to hold but the one that comes

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.619 
harder to hold but the one that comes
with<00:02:49.530> gas<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.980> he<00:02:50.760> probably<00:02:51.000> will<00:02:51.269> just<00:02:51.299> bring

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
with gas and he probably will just bring

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.319 
with gas and he probably will just bring
his<00:02:51.810> first<00:02:52.079> six<00:02:52.530> leggings<00:02:53.069> down<00:02:53.189> here<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.639> try

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
his first six leggings down here and try

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.780 
his first six leggings down here and try
to<00:02:54.389> do<00:02:54.510> some<00:02:54.659> harassment<00:02:54.840> critically<00:02:55.829> I<00:02:56.340> don't

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
to do some harassment critically I don't

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.429 
to do some harassment critically I don't
see<00:02:56.970> one<00:02:57.239> zealot<00:02:57.569> out<00:02:57.689> yet<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.049> rock<00:02:58.200> rock

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
see one zealot out yet for rock rock

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.470 
see one zealot out yet for rock rock
looks<00:02:58.650> like<00:02:58.769> he<00:02:58.859> has<00:02:59.040> one<00:02:59.340> zealot<00:02:59.669> another

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
looks like he has one zealot another

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.059 
looks like he has one zealot another
thing<00:03:00.659> is<00:03:00.780> his<00:03:00.930> probe<00:03:01.439> has<00:03:01.590> scattered<00:03:01.799> in<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
thing is his probe has scattered in the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.800 
thing is his probe has scattered in the
wrong<00:03:02.189> direction<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.730> he<00:03:03.000> will<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.359> see<00:03:03.659> these

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
wrong direction so he will not see these

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.390 
wrong direction so he will not see these
Earthlings<00:03:04.230> coming<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.980> one's<00:03:05.219> Ella

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
Earthlings coming and this one's Ella

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.830 
Earthlings coming and this one's Ella
may<00:03:05.669> not<00:03:05.879> be<00:03:06.000> enough<00:03:06.239> he<00:03:06.419> needs<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.689> get<00:03:06.780> some

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
may not be enough he needs to get some

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.899 
may not be enough he needs to get some
probes<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.379> their<00:03:07.560> ramp<00:03:07.859> there<00:03:08.099> but<00:03:08.669> he's<00:03:08.760> not

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
probes on their ramp there but he's not

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.209 
probes on their ramp there but he's not
going<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.180> these<00:03:09.359> earnings<00:03:09.629> are<00:03:09.900> coming

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.009 
up i'm not sure what shall I has in
terms<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.340> anti<00:04:02.639> air<00:04:02.819> he<00:04:03.419> probably<00:04:03.659> will<00:04:03.900> get

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
terms of anti air he probably will get

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.539 
terms of anti air he probably will get
hydrolysed<00:04:04.500> then<00:04:04.680> inside<00:04:05.040> was<00:04:05.220> based<00:04:05.400> right

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
hydrolysed then inside was based right

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.659 
hydrolysed then inside was based right
now<00:04:05.669> to<00:04:06.209> deal<00:04:06.599> with<00:04:06.689> the<00:04:06.780> Stargate<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:08.459> rock

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
now to deal with the Stargate the rock

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.309 
now to deal with the Stargate the rock
doing<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.030> very<00:04:09.150> good<00:04:09.239> job<00:04:09.389> of<00:04:09.569> using<00:04:10.109> his

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
doing a very good job of using his

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.229 
doing a very good job of using his
zealots<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:11.009> to<00:04:11.280> defend<00:04:11.579> against<00:04:11.759> his<00:04:11.909> organs

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
zealots to to defend against his organs

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.759 
zealots to to defend against his organs
actually<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.569> think<00:04:12.599> he<00:04:12.840> only<00:04:12.989> lost<00:04:13.139> one<00:04:13.500> probe

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
actually I think he only lost one probe

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.939 
actually I think he only lost one probe
so<00:04:13.979> far<00:04:14.159> and<00:04:14.479> hydrogen<00:04:15.479> is<00:04:15.659> going<00:04:15.930> up<00:04:16.079> for<00:04:16.320> july

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
so far and hydrogen is going up for july

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.740 
so far and hydrogen is going up for july
here<00:04:17.190> in<00:04:17.310> size<00:04:17.489> base<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:17.909> this<00:04:18.209> game<00:04:18.389> is<00:04:18.419> stole

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
here in size base so this game is stole

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.569 
here in size base so this game is stole
away<00:04:18.930> too<00:04:19.109> close<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.739> say<00:04:19.889> who's<00:04:20.039> an<00:04:20.220> advantage

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
away too close to say who's an advantage

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.730 
away too close to say who's an advantage
but<00:04:20.729> rock<00:04:21.509> seems<00:04:21.779> like<00:04:21.930> he's<00:04:22.139> held<00:04:22.469> off<00:04:22.590> this

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740

I<00:06:00.900> think<00:06:01.050> he's<00:06:01.230> gonna<00:06:01.320> pick<00:06:01.440> off<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.710> saw<00:06:01.830> pics

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
I think he's gonna pick off the saw pics

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.710 
I think he's gonna pick off the saw pics
off<00:06:02.220> this<00:06:02.310> out<00:06:02.460> but<00:06:02.670> the<00:06:02.730> core<00:06:02.940> is<00:06:03.030> there<00:06:03.180> still

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
off this out but the core is there still

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.270 
off this out but the core is there still
alive<00:06:03.900> and<00:06:04.110> nothing<00:06:04.650> the<00:06:04.680> stuff<00:06:04.950> is<00:06:05.100> one

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
alive and nothing the stuff is one

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.160 
alive and nothing the stuff is one
course<00:06:05.550> area<00:06:05.730> it's<00:06:05.850> got<00:06:05.940> to<00:06:06.210> Overlord<00:06:06.870> kills

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
course area it's got to Overlord kills

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.330 
course area it's got to Overlord kills
already<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:07.650> it's<00:06:07.740> gonna<00:06:07.830> get<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.040> third

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
already and it's gonna get a third

Overlord<00:06:08.820> kill<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.300> rock<00:06:10.170> is<00:06:10.350> definitely

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
Overlord kill and rock is definitely

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.560 
Overlord kill and rock is definitely
head<00:06:10.950> so<00:06:11.130> far<00:06:11.310> in<00:06:11.430> this<00:06:11.490> matchup<00:06:11.700> I'd<00:06:11.970> say<00:06:12.390> he's

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570

photon can this front base also at the

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.810 
photon can this front base also at the

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
getting into his base and wow this is

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.950 
getting into his base and wow this is
just<00:06:25.140> an<00:06:25.500> intense<00:06:26.130> mackerel<00:06:26.730> a<00:06:26.880> micro<00:06:27.420> fight

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
just an intense mackerel a micro fight

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.930

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
opportunity to macro up and this is

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.520 
opportunity to macro up and this is
decidedly<00:06:32.340> different<00:06:32.700> from<00:06:33.030> most<00:06:33.180> of<00:06:33.420> the

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530

I just covered in the pro league to have
you<00:06:43.470> know<00:06:43.560> Lucifer<00:06:44.550> I<00:06:44.850> mean<00:06:45.030> luxury<00:06:45.750> got<00:06:45.900> four

bases off the bat I think it was on
Andromeda<00:06:49.140> actually<00:06:49.680> or<00:06:50.100> it<00:06:50.190> was<00:06:50.280> a<00:06:50.310> Coliseum

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
uh I'm actually not sure I think was in

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.080 
uh I'm actually not sure I think was in
drama<00:06:52.590> actually<00:06:52.920> it<00:06:52.980> just<00:06:53.010> gets<00:06:53.280> four<00:06:53.760> bases

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
drama actually it just gets four bases

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.880 
drama actually it just gets four bases
off<00:06:54.210> the<00:06:54.360> back<00:06:54.510> and<00:06:54.750> Lucifer<00:06:55.380> comfortably

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890
