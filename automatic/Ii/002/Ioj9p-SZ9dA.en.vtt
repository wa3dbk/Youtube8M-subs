00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.800
 follow find your sport of mirror 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.619
 online and achim achilles the sport 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.619
 Today cyclocross means with the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.199
 wheel through the snowy muddy 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.390
 Dirty forest and markus max is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.859
 Expert from Eisenstein Kader in Berlin 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.869
 he has been doing that for quite a lot 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.380
 years markus why because it's just fun 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.390
 makes 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 I mean you can be in the course 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.630
 Put winter on the roll 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.579
 living room from tv or you can 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.719
 I go out there my sport is 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.460
 taking place outside 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.980
 There is outside and we try 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.539
 now consciously here I have that 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.379
 honestly never done and 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.379
 creates as today 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.980
 he had to go out 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 b 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.869
 that would be great combo we know 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.790
 all as children we always like to be in 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.159
 played dirt and that nothing else 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.450
 We can be children again can I 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.549
 that as I say completely 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.020
 untrained man comes to me the box 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.360
 sets me on it was through the forest yes 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.229
 that's just easy going on like cycling 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.960
 drive through the forest 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.600
 the fun comes in what can happen 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.600
 I'm laying right 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.909
 joke you should but one 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.860
 special bike but very special 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.439
 special tires the interesting thing is yes 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.170
 in the first rough point 4 and secondly there 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.000
 is really little air on it 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.420
 rather, that's all for me 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.070
 interesting thinking comes around you come 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.270
 no longer moving through the few air 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.460
 through the wide tires one has 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.860
 incredible stability of a completely 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.210
 new wheel feeling yes and it has that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.189
 advantage over mountain bikes for 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.840
 For example, it will be easier 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.170
 because the tires are not that wide 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.270
 are 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.310
 insofar the perfect mix times 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.050
 apart from that in summer you pack 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.350
 Just other tires on the rims and 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.350
 has a nice one 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.290
 that's embarrassing in such a way 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.600
 clothes soon to run well yes it is 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.480
 So one and the other said 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.920
 beachvolleyball you are the sex 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.920
 honest that men 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.880
 Left 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.140
 the book by hajo schumacher moves you 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.140
 you can order in the mirror shop
