memory hog but this time I feel like it

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.609 
memory hog but this time I feel like it
is<00:01:30.850> using<00:01:31.240> less<00:01:31.509> you<00:01:31.780> can<00:01:31.929> actually<00:01:32.079> see<00:01:32.229> in

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.940 
that's that's the way they do it and I
like<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:12.420> let<00:02:13.420> me<00:02:13.510> say<00:02:13.720> oh<00:02:14.260> yeah<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.890> is

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
like it let me say oh yeah this is

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.940 
like it let me say oh yeah this is
probably<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:16.209> thing<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:17.140> love<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.709> best

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
probably the thing that I love the best

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.319 
probably the thing that I love the best
because<00:02:18.099> in<00:02:18.489> Google<00:02:18.730> Chrome<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.090> couldn't

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
because in Google Chrome you couldn't

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.759 
because in Google Chrome you couldn't
get<00:02:19.420> flash<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.870> work<00:02:20.049> so<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.230> couldn't<00:02:20.650> really

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
get flash to work so I couldn't really

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.220 
get flash to work so I couldn't really
tell<00:02:21.130> if<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.760> was<00:02:21.880> really<00:02:22.209> better<00:02:22.420> or<00:02:22.600> not<00:02:22.780> but

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
tell if it was really better or not but

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.690 
tell if it was really better or not but
in<00:02:23.880> Firefox<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.810> compared<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
in Firefox and you compared the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.750 
in Firefox and you compared the
minefield<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.540> Firefox<00:02:29.230> three-point

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
minefield to the Firefox three-point

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.680 
minefield to the Firefox three-point
you'll<00:02:30.760> see<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.090> there<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.389> clear

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
you'll see that there is a clear

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.479 
you'll see that there is a clear
difference<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.620> believe<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.310> due<00:02:33.459> to

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
difference and I believe this is due to

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.590 
difference and I believe this is due to
the<00:02:33.700> html5<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:35.109> they<00:02:35.170> have<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:37.209> know<00:02:37.239> hyped

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
the html5 that they have you know hyped

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.900 
the html5 that they have you know hyped
up<00:02:37.780> about<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.950> hype<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.280> worth<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.670> I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
up about and the hype is worth it I

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.720 
up about and the hype is worth it I
believe<00:02:40.630> Israel<00:02:41.109> html5<00:02:41.889> not<00:02:42.069> really<00:02:42.280> sure<00:02:42.459> but

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
believe Israel html5 not really sure but

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.199 
believe Israel html5 not really sure but

like it and keep it okay and for the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.680 
like it and keep it okay and for the
add-ons<00:03:44.580> not<00:03:45.580> all<00:03:45.760> atoms<00:03:46.150> were<00:03:46.299> struck<00:03:46.540> now

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
add-ons not all atoms were struck now

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.740 
add-ons not all atoms were struck now
but<00:03:47.049> majority<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.910> good<00:03:49.090> ones<00:03:49.239> work<00:03:49.540> like

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
but majority of the good ones work like

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.559 
but majority of the good ones work like
you<00:03:49.900> know<00:03:50.019> adblock<00:03:50.620> auto<00:03:51.610> pager<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.269> all<00:03:52.390> that

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
you know adblock auto pager and all that

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.440 
you know adblock auto pager and all that
I<00:03:53.190> believe<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.459> one<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:54.910> going<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.269> have

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
I believe this one is going to have

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.780 
I believe this one is going to have
ubiquity<00:03:56.200> by<00:03:56.410> default<00:03:56.920> now<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.459> know<00:03:57.670> what

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
ubiquity by default now you know what

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.530 
ubiquity by default now you know what
ubiquity<00:03:58.330> is<00:03:58.510> it's<00:03:59.470> kind<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.769> like<00:03:59.830> gnome<00:04:00.160> do

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
ubiquity is it's kind of like gnome do

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.770 
ubiquity is it's kind of like gnome do
for<00:04:01.540> Firefox<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.799> makes<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:04.330> guess

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
for Firefox and it makes I guess

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.470 
for Firefox and it makes I guess
integration<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.650> others<00:04:05.950> services<00:04:06.910> better

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
integration with others services better

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.140 
integration with others services better
so<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.349> post<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.709> video<00:04:08.890> on<00:04:09.099> that<00:04:09.220> if<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:09.880> want<00:04:10.060> to

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
so I post a video on that if you want to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.940 
so I post a video on that if you want to
learn<00:04:10.510> what<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.810> hell<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.110> is<00:04:11.140> but<00:04:11.319> that

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
learn what the hell that is but that

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.449 
learn what the hell that is but that
thing<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.370> would<00:04:12.610> say<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.910> game<00:04:13.269> changer<00:04:13.440> for
