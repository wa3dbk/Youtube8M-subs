that was deep how much of that was light
it<00:02:04.439> even<00:02:04.770> displays<00:02:05.189> when<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> went<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.119> sleep

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
it even displays when you went to sleep

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.719 
it even displays when you went to sleep
and<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.899> woke<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.350> both<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.190> which<00:02:08.310> can

now<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.440> my<00:02:11.560> surprise<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.310> me<00:02:12.430> found<00:02:12.580> does

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
now to my surprise the me found does

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.089 
now to my surprise the me found does
extremely<00:02:13.209> well<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:14.230> was<00:02:14.349> doing<00:02:14.620> better<00:02:14.890> than

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
extremely well it was doing better than

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.530 
extremely well it was doing better than
the<00:02:15.250> sentence<00:02:15.580> unit<00:02:15.849> until<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.269> got<00:02:16.360> its

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the sentence unit until it got its

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.839 
the sentence unit until it got its
updates<00:02:16.930> now<00:02:17.530> both<00:02:17.800> are<00:02:18.069> pretty<00:02:18.250> much<00:02:18.459> equal

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
updates now both are pretty much equal

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.000 
updates now both are pretty much equal
in<00:02:18.970> detecting<00:02:19.510> when<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.080> go<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.410> sleep<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:20.890> when

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
in detecting when I go to sleep and when

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.699 
in detecting when I go to sleep and when
I<00:02:21.040> wake<00:02:21.250> up<00:02:21.489> they<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.420> roughly<00:02:22.780> within<00:02:23.349> 30

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
I wake up they are roughly within 30

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.130 
I wake up they are roughly within 30
minutes<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.250> each<00:02:24.400> other<00:02:24.610> now<00:02:25.300> what<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:26.050> you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
minutes of each other now what can you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.800 
minutes of each other now what can you
do<00:02:26.440> with<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.800> data<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.450> enough<00:02:28.780> to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
do with this data so it's enough to

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.780 
do with this data so it's enough to
indicate<00:02:29.500> whether<00:02:29.800> you're<00:02:30.160> roughly<00:02:30.519> getting

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
indicate whether you're roughly getting

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.220 
indicate whether you're roughly getting
a<00:02:30.849> good<00:02:31.000> amount<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.330> sleep<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.810> what<00:02:32.080> you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
a good amount of sleep and what you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.290 
a good amount of sleep and what you
might<00:02:32.470> want<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.400> make<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.730> better<00:02:33.940> or

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
might want to do to make it better or

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.690 
might want to do to make it better or
even<00:02:34.840> if<00:02:34.900> you're<00:02:35.019> getting<00:02:35.319> too<00:02:35.500> much<00:02:35.800> because

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
even if you're getting too much because

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.820 
even if you're getting too much because
that's<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:37.030> thing<00:02:37.269> you<00:02:37.390> know<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:38.049> sensor<00:02:38.500> does

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
that's a thing you know the sensor does

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.920 
that's a thing you know the sensor does
offer<00:02:39.040> more<00:02:39.430> which<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.180> want<00:02:40.390> more<00:02:40.510> detail

offer more which if you want more detail

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.050 
offer more which if you want more detail
it<00:02:41.110> will<00:02:41.290> be<00:02:41.410> better<00:02:41.620> for<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.640> contains

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
it will be better for you it contains

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.300 
it will be better for you it contains
data<00:02:43.269> for<00:02:43.569> air<00:02:43.750> quality<00:02:43.930> light<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.040> sound

better idea about factors outside of
your<00:02:49.959> sleep<00:02:50.290> pattern<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.400> while<00:02:51.760> striking

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
your sleep pattern so while striking

your sleep pattern so while striking
asleep<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.870> also<00:02:53.079> monitors<00:02:53.380> when<00:02:53.950> you're

asleep it also monitors when you're

I've<00:02:58.959> just<00:02:59.140> mentioned

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
I've just mentioned

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.650 
I've just mentioned
however<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.519> highly<00:03:00.940> inaccurate<00:03:01.209> in

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
however it's highly inaccurate in

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.530 
however it's highly inaccurate in

the me banned sleep tracking is

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.610 
the me banned sleep tracking is
surprising<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.150> great<00:03:19.660> value<00:03:20.109> for<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.350> money

price the promise of Kickstarter drew me

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.099 
price the promise of Kickstarter drew me
into<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.680> sense<00:03:32.980> unit<00:03:33.430> however<00:03:33.970> at<00:03:34.870> this

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
into the sense unit however at this

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:35.729 
into the sense unit however at this
moment<00:03:35.290> in<00:03:35.500> time

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739

anything beyond basic functionality and
the<00:03:38.470> unit<00:03:38.859> seems<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.310> have<00:03:39.569> major<00:03:40.569> trouble<00:03:41.049> so

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
the unit seems to have major trouble so
