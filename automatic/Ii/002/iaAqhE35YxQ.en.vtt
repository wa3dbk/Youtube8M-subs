00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.339

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.950
 in wedding party called more 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.710
 attention than the cake and what is in the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.139
 Fashion is now the rent you've heard 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.750
 It seems strange but we'll know everything. 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.470
 everything with the rock natália that is there 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 All right, Natalia. 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.140
 My God, how many goals did you bring to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.039
 people here natália must be a 18 19 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.439
 more or less 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 let's start with the themes here look 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.059
 that theme is either a couple of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.160
 There are a lot of people in the ballad that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.309
 You know the ballad in this way. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110
 the people ask for it so broad is Carlos is 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.180
 blinking right there 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.980
 Look if you at home can see he looks 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.039
 It's flashing, it really does look like a nightclub. 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.750
 a grace because I liked that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.719
 history and why this story began 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.730
 how dumb is the rented donkey? 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.949
 true cakes for rent 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.090
 they arose because first to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.460
 to cheap 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.899
 second because many buffets are seen 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.610
 it's very expensive you keep a professional 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 icing to a cake 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.580
 marriage that gives a lot of work leads 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.070
 several days then a cake has been created 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.100
 So you just take the picture and the kitchen already 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.040
 in cake served in the treats 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.650
 we eat good cake and nowadays the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.200
 Scenic cakes they are so expensive 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.420
 how true are you really 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.430
 sometimes pay up to 10% only of the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.689
 value or scenery that are in the range 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.000
 of 150 reais and the real one of 602 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.829
 thousand reais is an average common price 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.049
 now the scenographic is done with the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.970
 material that looks like a 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.159
 real cake, people 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.049
 But we can not understand what 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.280
 has in it how the structure is made 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.500
 he is styrofoam 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.229
 it is covered with the dough that covers cake 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.360
 normal is an edible mass of andrade 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.130
 is who has two types of mass has 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.500
 edible that this American paste that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.320
 is equal to that of conventional cake and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.540
 no one listens too, it's the same 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.120
 appearance but our glue base 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.220
 do you understand that guys 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.310
 the effect of this bride people looks at 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.310
 truth is this is the will of the bride 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.680
 And if it's from the pink cake 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.880
 this one on the side he is the will of the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.950
 boyfriend always trust that he is like 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.170
 all marriages, right? 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.480
 always the bride wins I know the bride 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.500
 win for sure each one saw that I 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.380
 I'm gonna tell you 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 and this here for example this is a goal 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.160
 call the bride on the run 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.930
 the groom digs a hole out here 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.880
 down or the poor little bride is 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.270
 desolate eye in the old underneath people goes 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.280
 Escaping bride but I do not believe 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.190
 in these things and these men 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.820
 look here a happy couple right in the middle of 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.340
 So much confusion here and now. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.970
 separation there are also many women who 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.520
 celebrating the separation and for 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.320
 so we have a cake and that there has 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.930
 divorce bullies have people who 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.820
 It's a party, man, ask for a divorce. 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.100
 here I put the reality that the 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.800
 men think that women want to 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.780
 paste them and his credit card into the 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.780
 Hand, are not we, and this is it? 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.540
 Of course it's a joke, you do not have to 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.730
 have a good mood here now have a couple 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.190

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:43.980

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.530
