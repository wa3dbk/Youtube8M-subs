in the mail is always exciting so I'm
filming<00:00:23.130> well<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:31.559> guess<00:00:32.559> it's<00:00:32.800> springtime<00:00:33.330> tea

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330

Cabana<00:00:55.660> so<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.559> guess<00:00:56.860> I<00:00:57.160> did<00:00:57.730> them<00:00:58.530> request<00:00:59.530> for

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
Cabana so I guess I did them request for

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.810 
Cabana so I guess I did them request for
specific<00:01:00.270> samples<00:01:04.259> I<00:01:05.259> want<00:01:06.160> to<00:01:06.280> mention<00:01:06.490> I

when you buy the filters it's like eight
dollars<00:01:43.660> each<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.020> that's<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.890> good<00:01:45.040> deal<00:01:45.100> so

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880
