00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.519
 YouTube channel all-all ru and now 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.559
 solve the problem numbered 262 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.349
 how many five-digit numbers can 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.389
 compose of even numbers 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 if the numbers in the record numbers do not repeat 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.800
 our let's remember what numbers you have 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.119
 generally even there are even numbers happen 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 023 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:38.329
 oh i write 4 6 and 8 13 5 7 and 9 this 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:44.160
 odd numbers reporting is 0 2 4 6 8 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:46.710
 there are 5 such figures in total 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.370
 we need to make a certain five-digit 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.809
 number 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.120
 it will consist of five times two three 4 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.500
 5 out of 5 digits 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.480
 This means that we are told that the numbers are not 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.789
 must be repeated let's think 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 the very first highest figure here 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.909
 here it can be zero is Th 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 numbers 0 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:15.000
 123 for example or 1234 such a number can 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.270
 there is no perige stand 0 cannot be 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.049
 so in the first place we can 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.630
 put either a two or four or 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.880
 six or eight 0 put on 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.369
 first place we can not how much he 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 options we can put a deuce 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.210
 we can four we can six 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.590
 eight 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.400
 just four options one of 4 numbers and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.369
 we can supply 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.409
 because we cannot substitute 0 therefore 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.509
 four options further we are told that 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.299
 numbers should not be repeated so if 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.180
 we for example put in the first place 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:58.229
 figure 2 then we use it already 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.420
 we can not therefore in second place we can 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.939
 put only one digit out of four 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 we can put the rest we can 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.429
 four can six or eight 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.379
 one of the four can only be put 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.500
 therefore, we are again four options that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.100
 to substitute 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.560
 for example we will substitute the eight 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.260
 substituted the eight on the third place 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.720
 how much about brew of what to substitute 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.300
 which digit either zero substitute or 4 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.690
 either 6 because deuce eight we 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.270
 already used all the even numbers was 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.150
 5 2 already used only three left 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.530
 numbers that we can use therefore 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.080
 we can only put on this place 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:46.320
 one of the three numbers left 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 for example, 0 then we use numbers then 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.800
 Only 2 left 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.430
 and next time we will be able to substitute 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.790
 only here one of two numbers is well 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.560
 for example, then we substitute 6 at the end 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.650
 there will be a choice from only one digit 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.460
 which we can substitute 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.880
 only four to get you number 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.490
 28 1628 1104 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.910
 it doesn't matter what the first time we do 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.130
 choose one of 4 digits then one of 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.430
 four then one of three then one of 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.120
 two 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.209
 and put the rest why every time 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.030
 numbers all the time less and less because 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.709
 that we can not keep the numbers repeated 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.040
 therefore, those that we have already used 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.080
 can't use a second time here 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.480
 so in a good way would have to be 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.430
 five four three two one 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.480
 but why are we not here 5 but only 4 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.020
 because the first time we can't 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.940
 use 0 and so need to count 4 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.290
 multiply by 4 multiply by 3 multiply by 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.489
 2 times 1 as we count 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.310
 let's go for 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:04:01.350
 back to front 1 by 2 will be 2 2 by 3 6 6 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.370
 by 4 24 and 24 must be multiplied by 4 24 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.790
 need to multiply by 4 4 by 4 16 16 we write 1 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.450
 in mind 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:15.840
 4 by 2 8 to 1 you 996 is obtained 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:20.850
 it turns out 96 ninety six different 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:25.889
 numbers we can make only of 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.469
 even numbers 596 five-digit 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.449
 forces we can make of only even 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:34.560
 numbers that do not repeat that is 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.949
 the answer of the problem is 96 such numbers on this 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.080
 everything 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.460
