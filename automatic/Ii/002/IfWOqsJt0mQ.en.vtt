game little did I know there was a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490 
game little did I know there was a
recently<00:01:23.580> played<00:01:23.909> section<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.200> user

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
recently played section in the user

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
recently played section in the user
generated<00:01:25.860> content<00:01:26.340> stuff<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> start

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
generated content stuff on the start

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.660 
generated content stuff on the start
menu<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:30.560> yeah<00:01:31.560> let's<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.280> let's<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
menu so yeah let's go let's go do it and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.039 
menu so yeah let's go let's go do it and
again<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
again I think this what I'm about to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.870 
again I think this what I'm about to
show<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.290> guys<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.890> mean<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.670> core

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
show you guys is I mean the core

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.499 
show you guys is I mean the core
mechanics<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.659> are<00:01:39.840> very<00:01:40.670> simple<00:01:41.670> it

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
mechanics of it are very simple it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.480 
mechanics of it are very simple it
didn't<00:01:42.810> require<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.590> make<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
didn't require much to make it but I

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
didn't require much to make it but I
mean<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> fact<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.780> actually<00:01:45.990> play

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
mean the fact that you can actually play

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560 
mean the fact that you can actually play
skee-ball<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> game<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.549> that's<00:01:48.270> really

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
skee-ball in the game is that's really

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.569 
skee-ball in the game is that's really
cool<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.259> kind<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.560> underestimated<00:01:49.890> this

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
cool and I kind of underestimated this

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.910 
cool and I kind of underestimated this
game's<00:01:50.820> potential<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.200> kind<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.649> little

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
game's potential to be kind of a little

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.359 
game's potential to be kind of a little
big<00:01:53.070> planet<00:01:53.100> contender<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.770> Skeeter<00:01:55.770> ball<00:01:56.040> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
big planet contender but Skeeter ball is

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.179 
big planet contender but Skeeter ball is
just<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.000> fantastic<00:01:57.420> example<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
just a fantastic example what the you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.770 
just a fantastic example what the you
know<00:01:59.700> people<00:01:59.909> are<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.329> capable<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
know people are going to be capable of

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.020 
know people are going to be capable of
when<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.259> game<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:02.100> retail<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> let's<00:02:05.100> play

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
when this game is retail so let's play

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.779 
when this game is retail so let's play
this<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> perfect

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
this here and and here is a perfect

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.770 
this here and and here is a perfect
example<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:10.430> little<00:02:11.430> bug<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> game<00:02:12.209> so

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
example of a little bug in the game so

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.910 
example of a little bug in the game so
here<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.590> guy

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
here we have this guy

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.690 
here we have this guy
it<00:02:14.010> was<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.400> completely<00:02:14.910> white<00:02:16.459> again<00:02:17.459> let's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
it was just completely white again let's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.080 
it was just completely white again let's
keep<00:02:17.849> in<00:02:17.970> mind<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.420> beta<00:02:18.709> but<00:02:19.709> I'm<00:02:20.700> sure

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
keep in mind this is a beta but I'm sure

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.449 
keep in mind this is a beta but I'm sure
that's<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.630> fixed<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:23.069> here<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.370> go

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
that's going to be fixed so here we go

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.970 
that's going to be fixed so here we go
here<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.480> see<00:02:24.690> like<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> square<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.830> they've

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
here you see like a square that they've

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.699 
here you see like a square that they've
made<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.480> totally<00:02:27.690> walked<00:02:28.080> out<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.319> bounds

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
made and I totally walked out of bounds

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.740 
made and I totally walked out of bounds
by<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.860> way<00:02:29.099> but<00:02:29.160> basically<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.510> get<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
by the way but basically you can get the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.420 
by the way but basically you can get the
idea<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.110> what's<00:02:31.260> going<00:02:31.319> on<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.040> there's

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
idea of what's going on here so there's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.420 
idea of what's going on here so there's
a<00:02:32.520> larger<00:02:33.420> circles<00:02:33.840> for<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> lower<00:02:34.709> point<00:02:35.010> value

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
a larger circles for a lower point value

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.340 
a larger circles for a lower point value
and<00:02:35.700> then<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.239> middle<00:02:36.420> there's<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.810> very

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
and then in the middle there's a very

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.260 
and then in the middle there's a very
small<00:02:37.530> circle<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> higher<00:02:38.640> point<00:02:38.910> value

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
small circle for a higher point value

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.410 
small circle for a higher point value
get<00:02:39.420> 50<00:02:39.720> points<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.940> not<00:02:42.239> gotten<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
get 50 points and I have not gotten the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.300 
get 50 points and I have not gotten the
the<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.870> ball<00:02:46.080> into<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.560> middle<00:02:46.860> one<00:02:47.040> it's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the the ball into the middle one it's

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.000 
the the ball into the middle one it's
really<00:02:47.819> difficult<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.660> every<00:02:49.470> time<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.920> get

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
really difficult you every time you get

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.970 
really difficult you every time you get
a<00:02:50.069> ball<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.640> get<00:02:50.850> two<00:02:51.180> chances<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.980> projectile

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
a ball you get two chances to projectile

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.370 
a ball you get two chances to projectile
it<00:02:53.190> forward<00:02:53.580> using<00:02:53.790> L<00:02:54.180> 1<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.450> X<00:02:54.720> which<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.049> that

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
it forward using L 1 and X which is that

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.550 
it forward using L 1 and X which is that
kind<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.620> force<00:02:55.890> push<00:02:56.130> move<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.540> me<00:02:58.170> talking

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
kind of force push move but me talking

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.870 
kind of force push move but me talking
is<00:02:58.680> kind<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.950> lame<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.400> I'm<00:02:59.610> just<00:02:59.700> going<00:02:59.819> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
triangle start and the ball is going to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.390 
triangle start and the ball is going to
come<00:03:03.660> down<00:03:03.810> here<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:07.319> also<00:03:07.590> says<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:08.220> get

close see it's hard going like straight
down<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.390> middle<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.690> keeping<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.410> centered

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
down the middle and keeping it centered

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.870 
down the middle and keeping it centered
all<00:03:35.430> man<00:03:36.030> I'm<00:03:36.269> getting<00:03:36.420> close<00:03:37.400> I'm<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.700> going

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
all man I'm getting close I'm just going

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.750 
all man I'm getting close I'm just going
to<00:03:38.940> go<00:03:39.060> straight<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.570> one<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.579> yeah<00:03:41.579> my

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
to go straight for that one but yeah my

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.810 
to go straight for that one but yeah my
top<00:03:42.030> score<00:03:42.390> on<00:03:42.540> this<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.190> 30<00:03:44.190> something

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
top score on this is like 30 something

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.400 
top score on this is like 30 something
which<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.180> not<00:03:45.209> good<00:03:45.420> because<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:46.019> get<00:03:46.170> nine

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
which is not good because you get nine

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.539 
which is not good because you get nine
shots<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.380> potentially<00:03:50.100> get<00:03:50.220> hundreds

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
shots and you potentially get hundreds

the rest of this video I want to go

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.779 
the rest of this video I want to go
check<00:04:48.490> out<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:50.080> little<00:04:50.789> protuberance

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
check out the that little protuberance

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.580 
check out the that little protuberance
at<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.120> bottom<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.930> map<00:04:53.110> if<00:04:53.289> you<00:04:53.320> will<00:04:53.440> I

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
at the bottom of the map if you will I

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.260 
at the bottom of the map if you will I
can't<00:04:53.919> want<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.130> check<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.430> out<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:55.000> right

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
can't want to check that out so right

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.800 
can't want to check that out so right
here<00:04:55.800> let's<00:04:56.800> see<00:04:56.949> if<00:04:57.010> we<00:04:57.130> could<00:04:57.250> get<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.520> that

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
here let's see if we could get to that

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.850 
here let's see if we could get to that
doesn't<00:04:58.810> look<00:04:58.900> like<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.169> can<00:04:59.320> make<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.470> jump

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
doesn't look like I can make that jump

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.839 
doesn't look like I can make that jump
but<00:05:00.160> was<00:05:00.370> so<00:05:00.940> let's<00:05:01.270> check<00:05:01.479> it<00:05:01.600> out<00:05:01.630> regardless

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.499 

I<00:05:06.969> just<00:05:07.659> love<00:05:07.839> sandbox<00:05:08.379> games<00:05:08.969> like<00:05:09.969> just

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
I just love sandbox games like just

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.230

being able to walk around and just do
this<00:05:13.449> this<00:05:13.899> random<00:05:14.830> nonsense<00:05:15.039> it's<00:05:15.669> a<00:05:16.629> lot<00:05:16.809> of

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:16.839 
this this random nonsense it's a lot of

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.959 
this this random nonsense it's a lot of
fun<00:05:17.249> offers<00:05:18.249> a<00:05:18.279> lot<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.639> replay<00:05:18.939> value

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
fun offers a lot of replay value

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.299 
fun offers a lot of replay value
especially<00:05:19.509> in<00:05:20.080> infamous<00:05:20.469> 2<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.039> now<00:05:21.129> that

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:21.309 
especially in infamous 2 and now that

especially in infamous 2 and now that
they<00:05:21.429> have<00:05:21.459> user<00:05:21.879> generated<00:05:22.149> levels<00:05:22.629> that's

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
they have user generated levels that's

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.969 
they have user generated levels that's
just<00:05:23.229> awesome<00:05:23.649> and<00:05:25.199> see<00:05:26.199> this<00:05:26.349> is<00:05:26.529> like<00:05:26.740> this

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
just awesome and see this is like this

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.070 
just awesome and see this is like this
is<00:05:27.129> very<00:05:27.369> unique<00:05:27.550> every<00:05:28.119> you<00:05:28.599> know<00:05:28.629> there's

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
is very unique every you know there's

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.549 
is very unique every you know there's
like<00:05:29.439> almost<00:05:29.679> not<00:05:30.449> know<00:05:31.449> two<00:05:31.509> buildings<00:05:32.229> seem

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:32.559 
like almost not know two buildings seem

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.379 
like almost not know two buildings seem
to<00:05:32.709> be<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.919> same<00:05:32.949> from<00:05:33.459> what<00:05:33.669> I've<00:05:33.879> been

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
to be the same from what I've been

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.249 
to be the same from what I've been
looking<00:05:35.080> at<00:05:35.259> thus<00:05:35.529> far<00:05:35.800> which<00:05:36.550> is<00:05:36.629> a<00:05:37.629> huge

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
looking at thus far which is a huge

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.079 
looking at thus far which is a huge
difference<00:05:39.189> from<00:05:39.699> the<00:05:39.759> first<00:05:40.209> infamous<00:05:40.689> where

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.089 
difference from the first infamous where

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.639 
difference from the first infamous where
they<00:05:43.089> would<00:05:43.240> just<00:05:43.419> copy<00:05:43.689> and<00:05:43.899> paste<00:05:44.050> a<00:05:44.379> lot<00:05:44.559> of

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:44.649 
they would just copy and paste a lot of

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:51.389 
they would just copy and paste a lot of
stuff<00:05:45.149> so<00:05:46.149> it<00:05:46.839> looks<00:05:47.169> to<00:05:47.409> me<00:05:47.439> like<00:05:49.979> we<00:05:50.979> might

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:51.399 
stuff so it looks to me like we might

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.879 
stuff so it looks to me like we might
not<00:05:51.610> be<00:05:51.669> able<00:05:51.879> to<00:05:52.209> get<00:05:52.689> across<00:05:52.959> this<00:05:53.499> might<00:05:53.709> be

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
not be able to get across this might be

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.070 
not be able to get across this might be
for<00:05:54.099> a<00:05:54.159> story<00:05:54.999> mission<00:05:55.449> but<00:05:55.689> we're<00:05:55.929> going<00:05:56.019> to

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:10.119 
it's really hard to my only complaint

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:11.699 
it's really hard to my only complaint
with<00:06:10.240> this<00:06:10.389> game<00:06:10.599> thus<00:06:10.869> far<00:06:10.899> is<00:06:11.379> it's

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:11.709 
with this game thus far is it's

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:13.350 
with this game thus far is it's
impossible<00:06:12.550> to<00:06:12.579> see<00:06:12.849> where<00:06:12.999> you<00:06:13.089> are<00:06:13.119> on<00:06:13.329> the

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
impossible to see where you are on the

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.079 
impossible to see where you are on the
radar<00:06:13.599> so<00:06:14.259> this<00:06:14.529> little<00:06:14.979> small<00:06:15.550> white<00:06:15.819> light

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:16.089 
radar so this little small white light

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:18.839 
radar so this little small white light
right<00:06:16.300> there<00:06:16.329> indicates<00:06:17.199> where<00:06:17.409> you<00:06:17.499> are<00:06:17.849> and

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
right there indicates where you are and

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.549 
right there indicates where you are and
it's<00:06:19.029> just<00:06:19.360> impossible<00:06:19.779> to<00:06:20.259> follow

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:20.559 
it's just impossible to follow

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:23.639 
it's just impossible to follow
especially<00:06:21.839> if<00:06:22.839> you<00:06:23.019> move<00:06:23.229> around<00:06:23.379> your

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:23.649 
especially if you move around your

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.899 
especially if you move around your
cursor<00:06:24.039> after<00:06:24.519> going<00:06:24.969> to<00:06:25.119> the<00:06:25.149> map<00:06:26.729> it's<00:06:27.729> hard

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
cursor after going to the map it's hard

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.819 
cursor after going to the map it's hard
to<00:06:27.969> find<00:06:28.269> again<00:06:28.509> so<00:06:29.079> we're<00:06:29.409> going<00:06:29.469> to<00:06:29.589> try<00:06:29.769> this

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:29.829 
to find again so we're going to try this

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:31.889 
to find again so we're going to try this
one<00:06:30.009> more<00:06:30.249> time<00:06:30.369> I<00:06:30.819> really<00:06:31.389> want<00:06:31.569> to<00:06:31.599> see<00:06:31.689> if<00:06:31.839> I

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:31.899 
one more time I really want to see if I

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:34.529 
one more time I really want to see if I
could<00:06:31.959> get<00:06:32.139> out<00:06:32.289> there<00:06:32.789> there's<00:06:33.789> obviously<00:06:33.999> an

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
could get out there there's obviously an

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.619 
could get out there there's obviously an
island<00:06:34.990> out<00:06:35.110> there<00:06:35.169> for<00:06:35.559> a<00:06:35.589> reason<00:06:39.360> but<00:06:40.360> I'm

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.629 
island out there for a reason but I'm

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.269 
island out there for a reason but I'm
beginning<00:06:40.779> to<00:06:41.050> think<00:06:41.139> it's<00:06:41.469> for<00:06:42.159> a<00:06:42.189> story

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:42.279 
beginning to think it's for a story

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.040 
beginning to think it's for a story
mission<00:06:42.879> and<00:06:43.119> you<00:06:43.329> can't<00:06:43.539> get<00:06:43.689> there<00:06:43.839> till

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
mission and you can't get there till

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.059 
mission and you can't get there till
later<00:06:45.209> I'll<00:06:46.209> just<00:06:46.449> try<00:06:46.659> this<00:06:46.719> one<00:06:46.959> more<00:06:46.990> time<00:06:47.110> I

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:50.069 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:52.859 

feel<00:06:51.069> confident<00:06:51.550> enough<00:06:51.669> that<00:06:51.849> I<00:06:52.240> can<00:06:52.300> jump<00:06:52.719> on

00:06:52.859 --> 00:06:52.869 
feel confident enough that I can jump on

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:56.939 
feel confident enough that I can jump on
some<00:06:53.110> stuff<00:06:53.379> to<00:06:54.990> it<00:06:55.990> looks<00:06:56.469> like<00:06:56.679> I<00:06:56.800> could
