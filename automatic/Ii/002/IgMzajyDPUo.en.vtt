00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello my mozilla I want you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.650
 today show how you can do 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.080
 picture style battlefield 3 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.929
 for this you need adobe photoshop cs5 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.900
 background from battlefield 3 and stalker pictures 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.639
 all transfer our our background from 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.170
 battlefield rome in photoshop 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.150
 let's increase it a little and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.180
 we transfer our picture and stalker too 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.539
 photoshop come on picture and stalkers 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 also increase it to fit our 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.349
 background doom will be so much further we 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.410
 right click on our 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.840
 condition with a bloodsucker and press 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.850
 blending options 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.480
 here we remove the shadow inner shadow and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 embossed do all this not necessarily me 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.559
 made it purely for beauty 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.780
 then we select here we press this one 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.579
 circle and choose here a gradient map 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.219
 see that we are all white here and we 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.750
 now click on this one 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.120
 a rectangle and we see before us 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.059
 various colors that are given to us on 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.030
 choice but we choose this one 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.280
 light but most likely you don't have it 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.530
 let's do it click on the first 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.740
 control point right mouse button and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.420
 writes numbers like 475 461 below we 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.530
 click on the last control point 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 and successful numbers like 80 902 and one all 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.320
 press ok 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 this we close and now we press 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.560
 right click on the credit card 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.030
 and and turn on and create a clipping mask 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.909
 because now our blue color is gone from the background and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.759
 stayed only on the bloodsucker but he 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.299
 not really beautiful here, that is, not 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.810
 even such and to fix we 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:56.579
 click we choose the usual mode 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.939
 On the color mode now our 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.280
 bloodsucker has become more beautiful handsome im 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.600
 this is what we do next we 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.720
 create at 8 we press a button here 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.300
 mice on the 1 and and we create gardens 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.660
 clipping mask gave him we choose 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.970
 overlay mode and select color 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.530
 pure red orange 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.129
 treated and created a clipping mask of us on 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.430
 u1 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:30.860
 and chose overlap mode a for 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.599
 so that our orange light does not go beyond 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.310
 the contours of our bloodsucker see i 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.060
 Now I can not draw on the background with 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.280
 battlefield 3 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.550
 but I can calmly draw on our 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.269
 bloodsuckers. make a brush a little smaller 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.050
 No , I do not need a big one and draw it to him 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.180
 somewhere half thorson 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.290
 I think that's enough, we create a duplicate 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.080
 layer in order for our light to become pain 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.629
 more bright gave them create create 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.200
 new layer choose that light yellow too 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.379
 do clipping mask and mode 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:17.640
 overlap and draw men on our 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:23.580
 we shine earlier visit here I think it will be 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.019
 enough . a little tweak a little 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.340
 went beyond the contours 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.930
 orange color further further we 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.260
 create another duplicate soon 2 all 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.650
 now our yellow light has become much 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.090
 brighter gave it to us what we do we 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 choose yellow and create a new one 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:55.280
 layer choose the size of the brush slightly 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.400
 more and doing here such circles 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.630
 click a couple of times over our bloodsuckers 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.640
 next we go to the filter and m mode 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.740
 and then we go to blur and blur in 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.450
 movement choose here exactly 90 degrees 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.540
 lighting what you want that is 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:21.720
 to your taste but i choose personally 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.940
 somewhere 620 635 is the most it will be if you 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.870
 still not enough of this light 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.280
 let's make a duplicate layer 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.190
 Now you catch as you can see I will be much 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.430
 more and we can calm it 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.410
 I think it will be enough to move 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.240
 let's make it a little smaller 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.650
 I think it will be so good that the matches are not 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.480
 enough we lack smoke 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:53.190
 go to the folder I will throw the link in the description 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.580
 choose any smoke number for example 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.790
 this 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.260
 and make it smaller to us so big 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:05.190
 do not need live click enter and select 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.870
 screen mode now see a black background 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.720
 us 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.600
 disappeared and only smoke remained 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:17.460
 let's just trim it up a little 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:20.910
 take extra think as though enough and 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.540
 Substitute under our bloodsuckers more precisely 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.380
 Here come under this red even more precisely 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.380
 orange yellow color 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:35.850
 further we can still principle 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:39.740
 rub think everything will be enough so 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:43.400
 well well then we go to the file 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.400
 save this image 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:53.169
 Well, for example, 56 okay and see what we have 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.990
 turned out pretty good in style 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.669
 battlefield 3 and if it 's a lesson here 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.259
 seemed interesting or you somehow 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.880
 helped then put your finger up not 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.880
 forget about the subscription all bye
