 then here while the teeth are hazelnuts 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.420
 chopped so I bought some 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.090
 whole hazelnuts veiled and toasted and I have them 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.200
 switch to the mixer to mix the flour 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.649
 with the vanillin to which I also add the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.259
 teaspoon of baking powder 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.770
 so the pastry will be a 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.619
 a little bit more sony is in quotation marks 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.420
 then combine a flour with hazelnuts 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.400
 group I dispose iv 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.010
 cold around 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:27.110
 I also add the egg a pinch of salt 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:29.300
 and quickly work with your hands 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.520
 meal is ready wrap the film 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.550
 transparent and leaves in the refrigerator for 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.840
 about an hour 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.180
 then I took out the pastry 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.490
 from the fridge I had Appia Antica 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.310
 slightly before putting the fridge 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.860
 so it is easier even to lay no 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.830
 cut a small piece that I put from 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.680
 part because here I want to add the 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.780

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.600
 put back in the vicky fridge is finished 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.730
 work glued to the TV as you can see 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.540
 or ago the crying job was born 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.640
 also make my rolling pin 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.450
 also a little pasta and began to 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.450
 roll out 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.120
 then with this pasta I want to make i 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.770
 classic Christmas shaped cookies 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.750
 heart so I take my my beautiful 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.610
 beautiful heart-shaped mold e 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.610
 he started making molds 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.909
 from this first draft of the room 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.680
 got these hearts only 2467 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.769
 we always try to have them even 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:46.049
 clearly so as to form couples 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:49.829
 now it's hole 3 with the little heart more 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:53.489
 small that will be the strella lines of 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.470
 the smallest heart jam 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.390
 clearly I keep it aside because 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.640
 He also will be a cookie v 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.920
 helping me with a deadline 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.290
 biscuits from the base and the support on the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.220
 pan where I have already placed the card 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.760
 oven we collect the short pastry 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.609
 advanced and quickly with a little bit of 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.250
 we are about to get flour 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.299
 clearly the other biscuits for i 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.299
 let's lay it down 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.130
 the first pan is ready at 180 degrees for 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.110
 10 minutes 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.200
 be careful which cookies do not have to 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.110
 become burnished burnished, however 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.660
 stay on the clear here instead use 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.290
 this nice and stencil is written 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:48.690
 with home made mail and then the 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:52.020
 before the first in the first then Farino 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.260
 as if it were a stamp on pasta 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.230
 shortcrust then use this glass 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.020
 he asks for the precise circumference of his own 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.470
 of the mold to cut the biscuit 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.860
 and then I make another circle to do 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.430
 the base pulled out biscuits from the oven 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.430
 still warm I sprinkle them generously 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.520
 of jam every use of jam 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.320
 apricot jam plums and but 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.980
 even wild berry jam is 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.790
 perfect and especially with hazelnuts 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:30.450
 vendola part of the above and to crush 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.820
 lightly over the bis 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.270
 with the base on top or stuffed with the 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:42.990
 also the basics of the second jam 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:45.009
 fired oral and cover with an email I 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.089
 the series was also taken out of the fridge 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:53.110
 pastry foundation the work 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:56.159
 a few moments, always flour on the top 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.159
 why it doesn't stick 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:06.730
 starting slightly with the hands dc 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.930
 I distribute over the drops of 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:15.190
 chocolate if you intend to make only these 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.070
 with chocolate you can knead it from 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.300
 immediately the short pastry adding the 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.690
 chocolate chips 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.550
 I decided after first to say goodbye 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.490
 only with a jam then but let's do 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:31.080
 also some putin you with the voices of 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:35.040
 chocolate and then there is the dough now 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:38.140
 as before I take the rolling pin and state 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.650
 I always make them in the shape of a heart but of the 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.650
 little ones 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.760
 is back there lying on the plate in 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.760
 oven for a dozen victims
