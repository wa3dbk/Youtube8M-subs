00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the athena armor is actually the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.080
 god state that is built in 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 of the sanctuary but to recover the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.940
 your life and your brilliance is necessary 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.160
 Athena's own blood and the only one 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.500
 I knew about this she found a 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.250
 daily reveal the whole reason behind 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 of shaka's death on the air 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.619
 You'll know all about it. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.380
 The truth is that they are already 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.289
 practically dead are victims of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.000
 treasure of shaka sky because it was that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.520
 shaka died 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.670
 surely there is a deeper meaning 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.910
 the fact that he decided to die die 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.789
 I'm already full of listening to you and not 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.360
 there is nothing you can do to 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.940
 try to stop me ioria you can 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.530
 philosophize as much as you want but if not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.870
 do nothing after one of our 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.629
 companions have been murdered in the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.649
 in front of our eyes is not a 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.500
 knight is not even a man he 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.659
 already are not even gold knights are 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.140
 only cowards who serve the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.040
 dis do not want to reconsider we already talked 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.450
 too much 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.450
 This is for the alligator. 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.040
 she is paid for expelling France from here 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.340
 with all my strength the latter more 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.500
 dangerous vital point of the scarlet needle 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.320
 story the emperor promised us 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.870
 eternal life in exchange for antenna death 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.240
 we can count on your word yet we 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.970
 we will lose all honor at once 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.800
 have been knights and even after the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.530
 death we will carry the stigma of 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.060
 indignity and we will be despised by 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.880
 all eternity 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.540
 until we meet again to God 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.300
 My friend, I really think it's out of our 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 way now if you do not leave you will 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.619
 regret and thought I should have 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.580
 something that you could not 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.510
 say openly but apparently I 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.670
 I cheated 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.810
 So now I will give my life to 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.959
 destroy them 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.050
 you will say last word continue 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.459
 dreaming what we could do 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.120
 single person 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.100
 it's us who will ask for the last word 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.050
 did not hit 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.090
 I do not care if the lion is that 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 because for me it's nothing more than a 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.100
 insignificant knight 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.459
 please do not worry pandora from 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.100
 that I can guarantee that everything 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.410
 It's going to be the way you want it. 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.230

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.760

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.519

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.420
 situation we have to stop this 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:54.890
 it's a nonsense battle 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:04.280
