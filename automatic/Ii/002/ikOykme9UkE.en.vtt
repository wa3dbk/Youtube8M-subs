drive or something like that off the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.670

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
system so if you ever have to reboot

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.010 
system so if you ever have to reboot
rebuild<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.060> actual<00:02:31.330> operating<00:02:31.660> system

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
rebuild the the actual operating system

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.410 
rebuild the the actual operating system
you<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.650> reactivate<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:33.910> it'll<00:02:34.300> be

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
you can just reactivate it and it'll be

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.900 
you can just reactivate it and it'll be
very<00:02:34.690> useful<00:02:35.080> for<00:02:35.110> technicians<00:02:35.710> so<00:02:36.580> let's<00:02:36.760> see

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
very useful for technicians so let's see

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.180 
very useful for technicians so let's see
how<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.120> reactivate<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.170> I'm<00:02:38.710> going<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.010> get<00:02:39.130> a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
how we reactivate it I'm going to get a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.950 
how we reactivate it I'm going to get a
fresh<00:02:39.520> copy<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.970> Windows<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.600> show<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.870> how

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
fresh copy of Windows and show you how

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.360 
fresh copy of Windows and show you how
to<00:02:41.020> do<00:02:41.200> that

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.640 

okay<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.430> here<00:02:46.879> we<00:02:46.970> have<00:02:47.120> our<00:02:47.330> copy<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.260> Windows

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
okay so here we have our copy of Windows

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.369 
okay so here we have our copy of Windows
freshly<00:02:49.159> installed<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:50.049> for<00:02:51.049> show<00:02:51.230> the

freshly installed and for show the

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:59.440 
freshly installed and for show the
actual<00:02:53.680> activation<00:02:54.680> part<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:59.060> can<00:02:59.120> see

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
actual activation part and you can see

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.240 
actual activation part and you can see
it's<00:02:59.720> not<00:02:59.900> been<00:03:00.080> activated<00:03:00.470> yet<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.069> we're

it's not been activated yet and we're

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.839 
it's not been activated yet and we're
going<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.430> activate<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.849> with<00:03:02.180> our<00:03:02.420> backed<00:03:03.379> up

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
going to activate it with our backed up

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:11.410 
going to activate it with our backed up
activation<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:10.280> I've<00:03:10.430> already<00:03:10.760> pulled<00:03:11.150> mine

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
activation so I've already pulled mine

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.839 
activation so I've already pulled mine
off<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:11.840> my<00:03:12.200> thumb<00:03:12.409> drive<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.980> here<00:03:13.519> we<00:03:13.670> have

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.640 
off and my thumb drive and here we have
our<00:03:14.120> activation<00:03:14.750> part<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:18.140> this<00:03:18.379> is<00:03:18.530> what

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
our activation part and this is what

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.460 
our activation part and this is what
we're<00:03:18.739> going<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.890> be<00:03:19.010> using<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.989> what<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.290> want

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
we're going to be using so what we want

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.440 
we're going to be using so what we want
to<00:03:21.560> do<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.890> going<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.700> right<00:03:22.879> click<00:03:22.910> on<00:03:23.269> this

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
to do is going to right click on this

says it needs to be activated so we're

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.789 
says it needs to be activated so we're
going<00:03:35.629> to<00:03:35.720> restore<00:03:36.019> activation<00:03:41.560> okay<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:42.620> we

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
going to restore activation okay so we

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.199 
going to restore activation okay so we
have<00:03:42.920> some<00:03:43.069> success<00:03:43.310> now<00:03:43.700> it's<00:03:43.849> is<00:03:43.970> done

remember<00:03:46.879> we're<00:03:47.030> not<00:03:47.060> cracking<00:03:47.540> windows<00:03:48.079> here

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
remember we're not cracking windows here

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.470 
remember we're not cracking windows here
what<00:03:48.530> we're<00:03:48.680> doing<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:49.010> putting<00:03:49.430> our<00:03:49.700> saved

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
what we're doing is putting our saved

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.960 
what we're doing is putting our saved
activation<00:03:51.380> back<00:03:51.620> into<00:03:52.010> Windows<00:03:52.430> okay<00:03:52.910> so

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
activation back into Windows okay so

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.520 
activation back into Windows okay so
we're<00:03:53.269> not<00:03:53.359> cracking<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:53.959> or<00:03:54.109> anything<00:03:54.260> like

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
we're not cracking it or anything like

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.819 
we're not cracking it or anything like
that

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
that

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.559 
that
well<00:03:55.310> actually<00:03:55.639> just<00:03:55.880> backing<00:03:56.269> up<00:03:56.389> and

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
well actually just backing up and

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.089 
well actually just backing up and
restoring<00:03:57.200> our<00:03:57.799> activation<00:03:59.769> so<00:04:00.769> I'm<00:04:00.889> going<00:04:01.040> to

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
restoring our activation so I'm going to

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.110 
restoring our activation so I'm going to
close<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:01.400> off<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:01.760> have<00:04:01.849> a<00:04:01.879> look<00:04:02.030> at

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
close this off and have a look at

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.909 
close this off and have a look at
Windows<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:05.450> we'll<00:04:05.599> come<00:04:05.780> up<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.139> my<00:04:06.410> computer

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
Windows so we'll come up to my computer

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.699 
Windows so we'll come up to my computer
again<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:10.480> as<00:04:11.480> you<00:04:11.599> can<00:04:11.690> see<00:04:11.750> windows<00:04:12.319> is<00:04:12.530> now

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
again and as you can see windows is now

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.920 
again and as you can see windows is now
been<00:04:13.160> activated<00:04:13.609> back<00:04:14.030> without<00:04:14.269> previous

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
been activated back without previous

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.140 
been activated back without previous
activated<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:16.760> we<00:04:16.910> backed<00:04:17.150> up<00:04:17.560> okay<00:04:19.150> and

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
activated that we backed up okay and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.150 
activated that we backed up okay and
it's<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.389> very<00:04:20.599> useful<00:04:20.780> tool<00:04:21.019> as<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.829> said<00:04:22.010> if
