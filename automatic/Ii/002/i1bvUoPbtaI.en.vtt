00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.969
 hi i am ali and it does not follow much echo 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.410
 but he did not find place with more 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.560
 significance because it is raining to 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.990
 rible using this horrible food but 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.380
 there is no sun then more luminosity or in 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.669
 my dark room then it's a problem 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.669
 of neutrality 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.180
 and years 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 so 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.790
 trying it longer 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.420
 discover how to make it easier 7 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.220
 go through what I then here does not 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.290
 wasted no queens who are in 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.760
 against rooms and he has like five 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.860
 years without anything they knew that the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.900
 makeup has concerts and that what 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.030
 of should not cease and can not codices 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.460
 excessive for a chew in three years is 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:23.710
 a very important day because for six 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:23.710
 months a year to record it 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.640
 but here I just wanted to show you that 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.160
 absolutely all the mascara tubes 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.370
 they have the same mechanism if they are fixed 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.790
 very well they have like a little jump between 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.400
 the little boat and the cap this blanquito is 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.180
 where the mascara slips so you do not 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.800
 come out full and that will prevent us 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.350
 clean it so if you do not take it off it goes 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.870
 to be almost impossible to remove it if you're 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.850
 minor asks for help from an adult I put the 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.950
 knife between the bob and the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.870
 small boat and I started pushing until 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.870
 it came out and so it looks 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.880
 then I put the mascara in a cup of 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.880
 water and I put it in the micro for 2 minutes 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.230
 then take them out and sinking little 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.170
 because it does not sink alone and leave it as 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.650
 10 seconds there then I took it out I opened it 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 and I put a little bit of baby oil 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.030
 You can also use make-up remover 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.030
 and return it to the cup 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.910
 then it will be what I had inside the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.800
 tube in a napkin and started to 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.840
 put napkins to remove the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.980
 excess of mascara until the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.870
 napkins came out clean almost clean 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.050
 when I left very little I went 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.480
 wet wipes to clean it better 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.480
 and so on until it came out completely 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.480
 Clean help me also with a stick 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.990
 here I do not know if you can see but I wanted 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.940
 teach them how clean they were and for the 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.370
 brochita shines a wet wipe and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.360
 I passed it by the stick and also by the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.360
 top inside 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.560
 and I did the same with the drained 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.390
 not after I returned everything to its place and 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.390
 ready and you 're done 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.340
 in a video 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.340
