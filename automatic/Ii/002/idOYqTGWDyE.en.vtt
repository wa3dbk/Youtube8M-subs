00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:10.210
 x of 27 was not any robot 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:13.629
 on his plate said x of 27 the best and most 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.570
 modern robot was the robot model more 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:20.050
 modern of your generation a product 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:24.279
 really difficult to improve and it felt 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.500
 really proud of it so much that 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.410
 when he crossed paths with other robots 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.290
 the street looked at them with a certain air of 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.660
 superiority and only reacted with 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.860
 joy and enthusiasm when 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.550
 I found another x 27 because it was 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 equal to all robots would have to 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.809
 be like the x of 27 thought the robot 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.199
 I really was convinced that 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:57.370
 no new robot could exceed the x 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:00.160
 227 and that the world would be much better if 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.370
 all the robots were like that model 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.549
 perfect 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.570
 one day I was walking around the robot city 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:13.190
 when suddenly he appeared next to 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:17.409
 millimeters of your eyes a great door 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:22.850
 Yellow did not know where it had come from 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:26.060
 but it was an x 27 and his speed 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.790
 allowed to avoid the curious golpazo 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.420
 He decided to go through the door and went to 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.500
 stop to a spectacular city all 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.399
 its inhabitants were x of 27 and everything 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.630
 it looked awesome 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.090
 excited to have found in the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.270
 perfect city for him he walked 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 touring that place boasting of 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.740
 be an x of 27 and stopping to talk to 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 all of how great it was to make a 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.570
 robot so advanced and really it 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.540
 settled in a house far from the city 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.850
 the days went by but right away 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.869
 he realized that in that city 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.130
 there was something he did not like like all 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.770
 they were x out of 27 nobody really had 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.830
 reasons to feel better and more 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.709
 modern than anyone and that's why nobody 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.890
 they made none looked with airs of 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.470
 superiority and deep down he proved that 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.190
 with the passage of time not even him 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.489
 same felt special plus everything 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.180
 It was terribly boring all 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.750
 they did all things equally well 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.450
 it was impossible to stand out in anything when 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.120
 he could think of something that he thought was 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.460
 brilliant everyone has come up 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.690
 the same and at the same time 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.420
 so x 27 began to miss 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.600
 all those varied robots of his 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.020
 world each with his good things and 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 bad but different and fun and it 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.690
 he realized that he would have preferred 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.800
 sometimes meet a clumsy but 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.590
 funny robot mark pp 4 and chat a 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.940
 time with him before you cross again 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.580
 with another x of 27 so it started to 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.280
 look for the big yellow door took 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.280
 several days until finally the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.430
 found as the first time just in 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.730
 half of any street supported the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.590
 hand in the door and looked back 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.990
 as saying goodbye to that world that 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.540
 it had seemed perfect and with great 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.859
 I push joy 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.379
 when he woke up the robot x of 27 was 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:55.010
 on the ground and some helped him 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.310
 get up there was no door just 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.030
 a huge and bright yellow robot with 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.980
 the one that x of 27 had hit so hard 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.150
 that he had short of the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.670
 x circuits of 27 missed if there is no 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.760
 could dodge the blow he looked 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.479
 carefully that great bounced 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.780
 I had never seen one like it seemed 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.650
 perfect in everything higher and stronger 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:29.630
 that none and on his plate could be read 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:32.449
 x of 28 the best and most modern robot well 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.500
 that they had achieved it although it seemed 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:40.070
 impossible the x of 27 were no longer the 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.520
 best robots however our friend 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.020
 he was not sad at all 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.330
 because seconds before 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.150
 while I dreamed of that city 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.729
 perfect he had learned that he was 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.129
 happy to be different and that 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:00.250
 there would be hundreds of different robots 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.250
 each with his best and worst things
