this is just to make sure you can click
it<00:03:53.090> even<00:03:54.050> faster<00:03:54.380> because<00:03:56.230> if<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.410> have<00:03:57.560> this

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
it even faster because if you have this

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.949 
it even faster because if you have this
slick<00:03:58.190> surface<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.820> makes<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.150> lot<00:03:59.450> easier

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959
