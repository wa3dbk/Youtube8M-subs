in the tiny spur the cydia takes pretty

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.440 
in the tiny spur the cydia takes pretty
much<00:02:08.560> felon<00:02:08.920> abscess<00:02:09.220> care<00:02:09.490> but<00:02:09.850> it<00:02:09.970> does<00:02:10.150> like

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
much felon abscess care but it does like

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.780 
much felon abscess care but it does like
brighter<00:02:10.780> light<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.500> give<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.430> orchid

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
brighter light I give this orchid

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.790 
brighter light I give this orchid
oncidium<00:02:13.240> light<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.930> seems<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.350> like<00:02:14.500> it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
oncidium light and it seems to like it

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.220 
oncidium light and it seems to like it
some<00:02:15.700> articles<00:02:16.180> suggest<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.900> needs<00:02:17.110> a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
some articles suggest that it needs a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.440 
some articles suggest that it needs a
cool-down<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> winter<00:02:18.340> otherwise<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
cool-down in the winter otherwise it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.970 
cool-down in the winter otherwise it
will<00:02:19.600> die<00:02:19.840> within<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.230> few<00:02:20.440> years

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
will die within a few years

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.250 
will die within a few years
so<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.610> actually<00:02:22.060> place<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.600> orchid<00:02:22.990> along

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
so I actually place to this orchid along

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.930 
so I actually place to this orchid along
with<00:02:23.410> my<00:02:23.560> Dendrobium<00:02:24.130> Nobile<00:02:24.160> ease<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
with my Dendrobium Nobile ease in the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.330 
with my Dendrobium Nobile ease in the
cold<00:02:25.180> balcony<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.170> gave<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.740> minimum<00:02:27.190> of

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
cold balcony and I gave it a minimum of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.520 
cold balcony and I gave it a minimum of
10<00:02:27.730> degrees<00:02:28.030> Celsius<00:02:28.270> for<00:02:28.570> about<00:02:28.960> a<00:02:28.990> month<00:02:29.200> now

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
10 degrees Celsius for about a month now

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.380 
10 degrees Celsius for about a month now
I'm<00:02:30.220> not<00:02:30.400> sure<00:02:30.580> if<00:02:30.700> this<00:02:30.850> helped<00:02:31.210> with

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
I'm not sure if this helped with

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.210 
I'm not sure if this helped with
flowering<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.350> certainly<00:02:32.650> did<00:02:32.860> not<00:02:32.980> kill

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
flowering but it certainly did not kill

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.240 
flowering but it certainly did not kill
my<00:02:33.370> orchid<00:02:33.990> one<00:02:34.990> thing<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.470> keep<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.770> mind<00:02:35.830> with

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
my orchid one thing to keep in mind with

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.250 
my orchid one thing to keep in mind with
this<00:02:36.400> one<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.450> can<00:02:37.630> take<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> lot<00:02:38.230> of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
this one is that it can take a lot of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.280 
this one is that it can take a lot of
time<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.800> adjust<00:02:39.070> your<00:02:39.340> environment<00:02:40.020> mine<00:02:41.020> did

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
time to adjust your environment mine did

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.230 
time to adjust your environment mine did
not<00:02:41.470> grow<00:02:41.680> any<00:02:41.890> leaves<00:02:42.220> for<00:02:42.490> about<00:02:42.730> one<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.060> a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
not grow any leaves for about one and a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.720 
not grow any leaves for about one and a
half<00:02:43.270> years<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.990> then<00:02:44.290> out<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.620> nowhere<00:02:44.860> after

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
half years and then out of nowhere after

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.550 
half years and then out of nowhere after
the<00:02:45.880> cold<00:02:46.090> treatment<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.780> produced<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.350> flower

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
the cold treatment it produced a flower

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.250 
the cold treatment it produced a flower
spike<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.250> new<00:02:48.400> leaf<00:02:48.670> again<00:02:49.570> I'm<00:02:49.810> not<00:02:50.080> sure

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
spike and a new leaf again I'm not sure

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.050 
spike and a new leaf again I'm not sure
if<00:02:50.380> there<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.710> any<00:02:50.950> connection<00:02:51.310> there<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:52.030> a
