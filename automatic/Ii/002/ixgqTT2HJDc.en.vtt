00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.859
 Servus youtube and joy of gamings 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.140
 I welcome you to 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.070
 a final presentation today from 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.509
 kallas roland 250 from the glass rolland 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.590
 250 baler with the rog lettering 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.060
 So has raw version yes it is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.619
 here is a pointed clearly as 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 it can be seen that this is about 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.140
 a slightly older baler is 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.780
 a small but in comparison to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.640
 if presented yesterday 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.370
 has significantly higher levels of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.610
 4,000 then those of crown would only be 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.210
 400 liters has fallen that was real 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.980
 nothing is normal it is so that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 round bales have more volume because of that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.210
 here the roland but nice in the picture 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.969
 You can not say anything about the logo 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.920
 is OK 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.809
 description is not available 25 euro 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 Maintenance costs 27 1750 euro purchase price 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.220
 What I'm missing here would be actually the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.570
 capacity the loading capacity of a ball 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880
 and maybe the standard description 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 that was enough for me but we stand 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.130
 Definitely a great one here 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.780
 scuffed font that really looks 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 very good we would be back here again 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 Elements have the of the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 texture quality so really bomb 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.759
 standard are the stickers that were 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.590
 hints are very sharp we will 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.119
 one side the texture is not so tingling 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.520
 I only have three stars for you 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 We forgive much again below 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.979
 better textures here down the front pick 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 up was amazing how cool it looks 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.560
 here them this these are the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.180
 no idea 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.159
 The tires are very good 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.600
 this is a model of 13 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.189
 but I do not have to be surprised 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.579
 that even then a good texture 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.869
 knew as I said down here 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.750
 are not you so great at these 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.719
 small plates there 's great again 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.719
 from mac area mirror or mirror 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.299
 taillights and wall panels resp 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.799
 Reflectors are very sharp here 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.479
 a scuffed class logo that looks 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.580
 but really very good 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.890
 So we are minimal in texture 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.599
 two we put down here at maximum 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.519
 Of course five stars I notice 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.739
 that the stock just does not sit that 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.019
 is not the end of the world now 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.200
 What we notice here is also the one 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.670
 lower area absolutely fine exactly 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.110
 What I notice here is just 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.690
 this logo that with light there 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.360
 You do not have to get that from us 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.220
 logo here and then we take 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.870
 looks on it you can see then 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.000
 somehow this transparency 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.190
 but let's get the light 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.420
 otherwise the part is really top of 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.610
 Model can not say anything 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.230
 Texture as I said just so mediocre 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.579
 four sternen specify if he 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.590
 sometimes a top textor sometimes like that 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.470
 miserable but not again 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.720
 three digit minimal 2 so i would 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.530
 say a lot make sense come very much 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.370
 are very positive and can 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.140
 let absolutely 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.609
 look in the lok klopp is 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.000
 unfortunately not faultless that falls to us 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:09.160
 up here if we have the class here 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.190
 Roland now cooks high in the cds 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.650
 outtakes custom shader has a wrong one 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.739
 version or as the Troll fairground 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.200
 xml it would be to let conwert the 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.169
 msf bilbao taylor point of sample also has 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.340
 which to convert but then have below 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:30.250
 Two merchants resource implements png 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.269
 and implementers selected pmg these are 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.870
 Now I do not believe that 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:38.639
 but worst things are four out 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.579
 just should not be a pity 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:44.290
 could you still fix is ​​not a thing 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.910
 but otherwise real horny part would 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.910
 I say test it again 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.069
 on the field I already have a bit 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.989
 preprocessed we now have about 90 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.209
 volume sees that we do not have to be long 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.859
 then we would have the ball due 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.709
 which , of course, can see that, of course 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:07.010
 this beautiful stalls here really nice 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.189
 goes up when we lower the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.290
 also beautiful is the hoses are 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.870
 here not quite on the tractor but it 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.299
 looks good the PTO sits 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.680
 flawless then I want to say lower 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.099
 we do the pick up that works completely 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.389
 easy the slow but the area the 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.250
 The pick up has to do is not 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.270
 very large 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.949
 if we switch on now we will see 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.710
 I nice here first time that the 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.930
 PTO turns it so great 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.639
 and at the back all this turns too 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.539
 Whole bales but weighs this whole 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.320
 enter the rotating cylinder 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.190
 over here 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.190
 the pick up 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.830
 So I am amazed just beeping this beep 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.510
 comes from 90 percent 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.970
 beep have that we are almost full 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.860
 that is a good indication what now 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.510
 unfortunately we are not happy friends 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.250
 have no rear light functions 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:06.130
 again left or brake light 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.320
 does not let that matter now 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.520
 just left 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.810
 we also see everything up here 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.660
 turn and now we will now 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.479
 Now we are full of pressure 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.960
 Of course, where then fall of the two out 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.960
 and has a volume of 4000 liters that 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.639
 That's what I really am 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.169
 can imagine 4 and how that in real 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:34.139
 far too little and as I said 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:34.139
 does it work with small errors 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.919
 in the still small errors delon and 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.810
 just perfect texture and not 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.199
 really works if we only 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.330
 still at four stars because the model 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.470
 So just head works 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.789
 I want you a little better than that 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.960
 crown proven although here actually 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.190
 not much difference is that 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.700
 almost the same part has a higher one 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.580
 quality has a nice image that makes 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.660
 there is no jump in my point 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.090
 out but I like this used 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.000
 looks very good these signs of use 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.710
 very good 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.280
 functional everything top as said the 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.050
 error 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.330
 yes, that was what I believed in the crown 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.919
 even more at the crown and because it's him 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.930
 So I would go here for 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.840
 stars give friends i say thanks for 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.389
 watching it makes good and then see us 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.900
 again on monday with new fashion 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.900
 imaginations
