look at the front panel this amp has two

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.220 
look at the front panel this amp has two
channels<00:00:39.850> on<00:00:40.180> it<00:00:40.330> it's<00:00:40.540> got<00:00:40.720> an<00:00:40.810> overdrive

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
channels on it it's got an overdrive

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.440 
channels on it it's got an overdrive
Channel<00:00:41.650> and<00:00:41.800> a<00:00:41.980> clean<00:00:42.190> channel<00:00:42.640> channel<00:00:43.330> two

Channel and a clean channel channel two

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.680 
Channel and a clean channel channel two
is<00:00:43.480> your<00:00:43.660> overdrive<00:00:44.050> Channel<00:00:45.450> along<00:00:46.450> with<00:00:46.600> the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
is your overdrive Channel along with the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.660 
is your overdrive Channel along with the
boost<00:00:46.989> switch<00:00:47.260> which<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.470> nice<00:00:47.770> so<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:48.550> have

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
boost switch which is nice so you have

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.870 
boost switch which is nice so you have
two<00:00:48.880> stages<00:00:49.360> of<00:00:49.660> gain<00:00:49.870> here

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120

since we're using passive pickups on the
back<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:46.930> amplifier<00:01:47.170> we<00:01:47.800> have<00:01:48.090> two

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
back of the amplifier we have two

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
will combine effects with channel one

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.260 
will combine effects with channel one
when<00:01:57.340> you're<00:01:57.460> playing<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.850> so<00:01:57.910> that's<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.150> kind

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
band EQ and I'm going to run you through

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.280 
band EQ and I'm going to run you through
a<00:02:15.970> couple<00:02:16.150> channels<00:02:16.690> over<00:02:17.050> run<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.260> through

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
a couple channels over run you through

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.020 
a couple channels over run you through
the<00:02:17.500> clean<00:02:17.739> first<00:02:18.099> let's<00:02:18.670> hear<00:02:18.849> what<00:02:19.000> that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
the clean first let's hear what that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:45.830 
the clean first let's hear what that
sounds<00:02:19.569> like<00:02:19.800> let's<00:02:20.800> check<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.040> out

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:03:10.470 

you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:21.860 

you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.060 

okay<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.140> was<00:03:23.260> channel<00:03:23.590> 1<00:03:23.710> the<00:03:23.740> clean

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
okay so that was channel 1 the clean

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.920 
okay so that was channel 1 the clean
channel<00:03:24.490> we<00:03:24.670> did<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.850> couple<00:03:25.060> riffs<00:03:25.390> there<00:03:25.660> with

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
channel we did a couple riffs there with

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.200 
channel we did a couple riffs there with
chorus<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.740> reverb<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:27.430> little<00:03:27.700> bit<00:03:27.820> delay<00:03:28.150> so

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
chorus and reverb a little bit delay so

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.330 
chorus and reverb a little bit delay so
you<00:03:28.480> can<00:03:28.630> hear<00:03:28.840> what<00:03:29.050> you<00:03:29.140> can<00:03:29.380> do<00:03:29.590> with<00:03:30.190> the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
you can hear what you can do with the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.830 
you can hear what you can do with the
effects<00:03:30.670> loop<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.150> then<00:03:31.240> we<00:03:31.360> also<00:03:31.510> did<00:03:31.720> the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
effects loop and then we also did the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.210 
effects loop and then we also did the
drive<00:03:32.110> for<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.560> get<00:03:32.680> an<00:03:32.770> idea<00:03:32.950> about

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
drive for you so you get an idea about

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.070 
drive for you so you get an idea about
the<00:03:33.520> crystal-clear<00:03:34.240> sound<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.960> this

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
the crystal-clear sound that this

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.380 
the crystal-clear sound that this
amplifier<00:03:35.590> does<00:03:35.770> provide<00:03:36.220> let's<00:03:36.970> take<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.180> look

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
amplifier does provide let's take a look

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.600 
amplifier does provide let's take a look
on<00:03:37.510> 2<00:03:37.750> channel<00:03:38.260> 2<00:03:38.470> now<00:03:38.680> this<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.160> overdrive

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
on 2 channel 2 now this is the overdrive

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.610 
on 2 channel 2 now this is the overdrive
channel<00:03:40.060> where<00:03:40.240> we<00:03:40.270> can<00:03:40.570> click<00:03:41.110> in<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.410> boost

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
channel where we can click in the boost

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.990 
channel where we can click in the boost
I'm<00:03:41.860> going<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.040> play<00:03:42.160> some<00:03:42.370> risks<00:03:42.700> for<00:03:42.850> you

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
I'm going to play some risks for you

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.270 
I'm going to play some risks for you
with<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.110> without<00:03:44.230> boost<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:44.950> can<00:03:45.070> get<00:03:45.190> an

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
with and without boost so you can get an

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.560 
with and without boost so you can get an
idea<00:03:45.550> of<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.790> overall<00:03:45.820> tone<00:03:46.330> of<00:03:46.510> this

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
idea of the overall tone of this

00:03:46.570 --> 00:04:47.790 
idea of the overall tone of this
amplifier

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:05:15.190 

you

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:44.480 

you

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.670 

okay<00:05:45.490> that<00:05:45.669> was<00:05:45.789> channel<00:05:46.120> 2<00:05:46.270> now<00:05:47.229> going<00:05:47.560> into

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
okay that was channel 2 now going into

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.350 
okay that was channel 2 now going into
some<00:05:48.039> additional<00:05:48.310> dynamics<00:05:49.000> that<00:05:49.030> you<00:05:49.150> can<00:05:49.270> do

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
some additional dynamics that you can do

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.689 
some additional dynamics that you can do
with<00:05:49.479> this<00:05:49.570> amp<00:05:49.870> on<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.800> FS<00:05:51.070> 1<00:05:51.280> foot<00:05:51.490> switch

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
with this amp on the FS 1 foot switch

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:52.800 
with this amp on the FS 1 foot switch
that's<00:05:51.850> included<00:05:52.300> with<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.479> amp<00:05:52.630> you<00:05:52.720> can

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
that's included with the amp you can

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.930 
that's included with the amp you can
combine<00:05:53.590> both<00:05:53.620> channels<00:05:54.400> so<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.610> can<00:05:54.789> have

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
combine both channels so you can have

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.300 
combine both channels so you can have
clean<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.539> dirty<00:05:56.260> which<00:05:56.680> makes<00:05:56.979> for<00:05:57.130> some

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
clean and dirty which makes for some

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.010 
clean and dirty which makes for some
kind<00:05:57.520> of<00:05:57.580> unique<00:05:57.880> sounds<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:58.449> unique<00:05:58.720> tones

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
kind of unique sounds and unique tones

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.320 
kind of unique sounds and unique tones
and<00:05:59.289> add<00:05:59.500> some<00:05:59.800> versatility<00:06:00.610> this<00:06:00.910> amp<00:06:01.120> that<00:06:01.300> I

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
and add some versatility this amp that I

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.640 
and add some versatility this amp that I
think<00:06:01.539> a<00:06:01.630> lot<00:06:01.750> of<00:06:01.780> amplifiers<00:06:02.260> out<00:06:02.470> there

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
think a lot of amplifiers out there

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:22.939 
think a lot of amplifiers out there
missing<00:06:03.039> so<00:06:03.400> let's<00:06:03.520> give<00:06:03.699> that<00:06:03.850> a<00:06:03.880> listen<00:06:04.270> to

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.110 

now<00:06:23.949> let's<00:06:24.130> hear<00:06:24.280> what<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.520> samp<00:06:24.729> was<00:06:24.910> meant

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
now let's hear what the samp was meant

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.830 
now let's hear what the samp was meant
to<00:06:25.180> do<00:06:25.419> searing<00:06:26.139> lead<00:06:26.350> tones<00:06:26.759> aggressive

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
to do searing lead tones aggressive

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.689 
to do searing lead tones aggressive
dive-bombs<00:06:28.840> and<00:06:29.380> we're<00:06:30.130> just<00:06:30.220> going<00:06:30.370> to<00:06:30.430> have
