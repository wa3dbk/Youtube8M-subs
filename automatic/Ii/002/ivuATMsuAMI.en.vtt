hey guys we are here to test well the
first<00:00:04.170> make<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> review<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.490> twister

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
first make a review of the twister

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.270 
first make a review of the twister
quadcopter<00:00:06.660> it's<00:00:06.899> an<00:00:07.049> RTF<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.799> don't<00:00:08.069> think<00:00:08.220> you

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
quadcopter it's an RTF I don't think you

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.709 
quadcopter it's an RTF I don't think you
can<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:08.940> read<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:10.190> well

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
can do that can you read that well

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.740 
can do that can you read that well
anyway<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.590> an<00:00:13.830> RTF<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:15.030> channel<00:00:15.540> 2

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
anyway it's in it's an RTF for channel 2

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.429 
anyway it's in it's an RTF for channel 2
quad<00:00:16.440> copter<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.160> think<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.760> realize<00:00:18.230> it's<00:00:19.230> got

quad copter I think you realize it's got

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.080 
quad copter I think you realize it's got
a<00:00:19.470> 2.4<00:00:20.250> gigahertz<00:00:20.900> remote<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.320> LED<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.090> it's

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090

with one big sale though which is pretty
annoying<00:00:32.149> for<00:00:33.290> four<00:00:34.290> propellers<00:00:34.590> extra<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
annoying for four propellers extra and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.040 
annoying for four propellers extra and
one<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:37.110> little<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:39.050> extra<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:42.050> in

the box and the box model you get you
get<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> quadcopter<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.329> two<00:00:51.510> cases

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
get the quadcopter but you got two cases

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.069 
get the quadcopter but you got two cases
you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.199> choose<00:00:52.500> between<00:00:52.530> golden<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:54.079> golden

blue red white and black which is pretty

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109 
blue red white and black which is pretty
cool<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:05.100> you've<00:01:05.250> got<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.549> quadcopter

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
cool and here you've got the quadcopter

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.929 
cool and here you've got the quadcopter
it's<00:01:06.570> pretty<00:01:07.260> light<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> well<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it's pretty light and well in the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
it's pretty light and well in the
beginning<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.390> some<00:01:09.720> trouble<00:01:10.320> flying<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
beginning I had some trouble flying it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.740 
beginning I had some trouble flying it
because<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.460> couldn't<00:01:12.060> seem<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.540> this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
because I couldn't seem to make this

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.140 
because I couldn't seem to make this
propeller<00:01:13.170> spin<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.340> realized<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.939> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
propeller spin but I realized that you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
propeller spin but I realized that you
have<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.540> bind<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> remote<00:01:16.320> every<00:01:16.710> time

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
have to bind the remote every time

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
have to bind the remote every time
otherwise<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.729> two<00:01:18.060> propellers<00:01:18.479> won't

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
otherwise these two propellers won't

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.859 
otherwise these two propellers won't
spin<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.340> yeah<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.580> doesn't<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.240> fly<00:01:21.600> then

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
spin and yeah it doesn't really fly then

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.499 
spin and yeah it doesn't really fly then
of<00:01:22.439> course<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.750> got<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:27.180> get

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
of course you got these and get you get

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.890 
of course you got these and get you get
oh<00:01:27.930> wait<00:01:33.500> you<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.650> course<00:01:35.430> well<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.600> kind<00:01:36.840> of

your end get the manual for the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.770 
your end get the manual for the
quadrotor<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.509> no

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
quadrotor that know what that is no

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
quadrotor that know what that is no
really<00:01:46.170> patty<00:01:46.380> oh<00:01:46.619> yeah<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> guarantee

though so it's got flight guarantee you
get<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:52.619> other<00:01:52.829> four<00:01:53.130> propellers<00:01:53.460> which<00:01:53.790> are

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
get the other four propellers which are

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.800 
get the other four propellers which are
here

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
here

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.660 
here
you<00:01:56.810> can<00:01:56.990> see<00:01:57.170> here<00:01:57.560> I'm<00:01:58.220> not<00:01:58.370> going<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.550> take

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
you can see here I'm not going to take

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.390 
you can see here I'm not going to take
the<00:01:58.850> map<00:01:59.000> with<00:01:59.180> no<00:01:59.210> point<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:01.670> get<00:02:01.910> this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
the map with no point you get this

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.370 
the map with no point you get this
pretty<00:02:04.400> big<00:02:04.850> one<00:02:04.910> cell<00:02:06.340> battery<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:09.080> doesn't

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
pretty big one cell battery it doesn't

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.840 
pretty big one cell battery it doesn't
give<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.649> much<00:02:09.679> flight<00:02:10.130> time<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.520> just<00:02:10.550> gives

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
give you much flight time it just gives

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.699 
give you much flight time it just gives
you<00:02:10.940> 10<00:02:11.150> minutes<00:02:11.360> but<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.930> think<00:02:12.260> it's<00:02:12.500> normal

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
you 10 minutes but I think it's normal

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.820 
you 10 minutes but I think it's normal
for<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.100> quadcopter<00:02:13.490> now<00:02:14.480> many<00:02:14.830> quadcopters

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
for a quadcopter now many quadcopters

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.160 
for a quadcopter now many quadcopters
can<00:02:15.980> fly<00:02:16.190> well<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:17.240> long<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:20.170> charger

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
can fly well that long you get a charger

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.280 
can fly well that long you get a charger
it<00:02:21.680> was<00:02:21.800> just<00:02:21.920> charger<00:02:22.340> something<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:22.850> hot

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
it was just charger something that's hot

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.710 
it was just charger something that's hot
which<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.560> pretty<00:02:24.770> useful<00:02:25.070> since<00:02:25.550> when<00:02:26.540> you're

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
which is pretty useful since when you're

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.320 
which is pretty useful since when you're
charging<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.590> light<00:02:27.800> is<00:02:28.040> red<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.760> turn

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
charging the light is red and turn

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.420 
charging the light is red and turn

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
put a timer on hit the remote which is

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.670 
put a timer on hit the remote which is
great<00:02:37.790> because<00:02:38.480> since<00:02:39.020> this<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.410> four

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.790 
great because since this is a four
channel<00:02:39.860> I'll<00:02:40.160> turn<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.550> on<00:02:41.410> since<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.620> is<00:02:42.680> a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
channel I'll turn it on since this is a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.229
