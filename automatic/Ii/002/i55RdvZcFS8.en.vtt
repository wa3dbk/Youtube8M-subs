sits and that'll get sorted out as well

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.830 
sits and that'll get sorted out as well
on<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> origins<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.630> work

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
on the origins of that that's it work

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.249
