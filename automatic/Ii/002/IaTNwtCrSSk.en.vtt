a small um I kind wish I got a small but
I'm<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.629> bad<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:43.110> returning<00:00:43.559> things

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I'm really bad about returning things

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.340 
I'm really bad about returning things
most<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> time<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> made<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.960> work<00:00:46.140> and

most of the time so I made it work and
it's<00:00:46.500> okay<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> small<00:00:48.210> could've

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it's okay but I think a small could've

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.630 
it's okay but I think a small could've
worked<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.739> anyway<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.250> love<00:00:50.460> this
