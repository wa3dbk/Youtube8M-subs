okay<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.050> four<00:00:01.469> causes<00:00:01.709> of<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:02.250> hyper<00:00:02.580> current

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay so four causes of of hyper current

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.789 
okay so four causes of of hyper current
microcytic<00:00:03.330> enemy<00:00:03.720> about<00:00:03.899> only<00:00:04.170> one<00:00:04.529> or<00:00:04.770> two

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
microcytic enemy about only one or two

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.309 
microcytic enemy about only one or two
principles<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.940> first<00:00:06.150> principle<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.870> this

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
principles the first principle is this

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.790 
principles the first principle is this
if<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:08.189> have<00:00:08.370> decree<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.269> serum<00:00:09.809> ferritin<00:00:10.019> MW

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
if you have decree is serum ferritin MW

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.740 
if you have decree is serum ferritin MW

model macrophages or macrophages or
whatever<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.059> then<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.990> matter<00:00:16.350> whatever

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
whatever and then in the matter whatever

decrease<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.150> 13<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.020> macrophages<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
decrease in 13 in macrophages it is the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.279 
decrease in 13 in macrophages it is the
positive<00:00:20.789> signal<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> deliver<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:22.109> only

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
positive signal to deliver to only

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.009 
positive signal to deliver to only
create<00:00:22.560> synthesis<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.630> transferring<00:00:24.630> which

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
create synthesis of transferring which

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.259 
create synthesis of transferring which
is<00:00:25.199> basically<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.920> same<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.369> turtle<00:00:26.880> iron

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
is basically the same as turtle iron

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.169 
is basically the same as turtle iron
binding<00:00:27.660> capacity<00:00:28.050> okay<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.000> have

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
binding capacity okay so if you have

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.359 
binding capacity okay so if you have
decreased<00:00:30.480> serum<00:00:30.810> 13<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.800> will<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:32.160> any

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
decreased serum 13 you will have any

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250 
decreased serum 13 you will have any
crease<00:00:32.669> serum<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.450> increase<00:00:33.809> total<00:00:33.989> iron

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
crease serum and increase total iron

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170 
crease serum and increase total iron
binding<00:00:34.410> capacity<00:00:34.800> by<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> end<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
binding capacity by the end this is the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.970 
binding capacity by the end this is the
first<00:00:36.390> transfer<00:00:36.750> loss<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.350> second<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:37.800> how

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
first transfer loss the second one how

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.130 
first transfer loss the second one how
about<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.309> iron<00:00:38.610> saturations<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.629> don't

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
about the iron saturations I don't

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.750 
about the iron saturations I don't
saturation<00:00:40.829> accordingly<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.640> an

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
saturation accordingly there is an

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.700 
saturation accordingly there is an
equation<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.300> any<00:00:42.480> saturation<00:00:43.020> recall<00:00:43.410> which

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
equation for any saturation recall which

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.940 
equation for any saturation recall which
which<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.219> equal<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.820> serum<00:00:45.120> ion<00:00:45.570> or<00:00:45.950> total

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
which is equal to serum ion or total

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.819 
which is equal to serum ion or total
iron<00:00:47.250> binding<00:00:47.550> capacity<00:00:48.260> multiplied<00:00:49.260> by<00:00:49.440> 100

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
iron binding capacity multiplied by 100

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.130 
iron binding capacity multiplied by 100
so<00:00:50.550> let's<00:00:50.760> apply<00:00:51.090> these<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.510> principles<00:00:51.809> on

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so let's apply these two principles on

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
so let's apply these two principles on
for<00:00:52.530> examples<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.789> examples

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
for examples for examples

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.430 
for examples for examples
okay<00:00:55.230> let's<00:00:55.440> divide<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> page<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.340> four

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
okay let's divide the page into four

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.650 
okay let's divide the page into four
okay<00:00:58.440> let's<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.489> examples<00:00:59.969> first<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.480> have

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
okay let's for examples first you have

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.740 
okay let's for examples first you have
here<00:01:00.989> iron<00:01:01.410> deficiency<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.750> here

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
here iron deficiency in here and here

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.130 
here iron deficiency in here and here
you<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.199> any<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.920> chronic<00:01:05.280> disease<00:01:06.140> okay

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you have any of chronic disease okay

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
you have any of chronic disease okay
here<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:09.140> another<00:01:10.140> color<00:01:10.790> let's<00:01:11.790> take

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
here you have another color let's take

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.109 
here you have another color let's take
this<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> same<00:01:14.670> here

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this one I think this is the same here

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.630 
this one I think this is the same here
you<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.420> thalassemia<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:20.090> finally<00:01:22.640> here

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you have thalassemia and finally here

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.070 
you have thalassemia and finally here
you<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.180> pseudo<00:01:24.630> plastic<00:01:24.869> anemia

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.960 

okay<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:30.370> a<00:01:30.430> plastic<00:01:30.640> enemy<00:01:32.610> okay<00:01:33.610> how

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
okay this is a plastic enemy okay how

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.550 
okay this is a plastic enemy okay how
about<00:01:34.000> island<00:01:34.540> efficiency<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:34.990> mean<00:01:35.170> I<00:01:35.290> believe

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
about island efficiency I mean I believe

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.470 
about island efficiency I mean I believe
she<00:01:35.680> sent<00:01:35.920> him<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.190> problem<00:01:36.460> first<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.150> problem

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
she sent him a problem first the problem

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.180 
she sent him a problem first the problem
you<00:01:37.570> have<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:38.020> first<00:01:38.290> thing<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:38.920> iron

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
you have the first thing in iron

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.040 
you have the first thing in iron
deficiency<00:01:39.820> anemia<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.360> have<00:01:40.540> decreased

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
deficiency anemia you have decreased

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.260 
deficiency anemia you have decreased
serum<00:01:41.290> 13<00:01:41.920> that's<00:01:42.430> mean<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> storage<00:01:43.090> system

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
serum 13 that's mean a storage system

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.720 
serum 13 that's mean a storage system
decrease<00:01:43.870> so<00:01:44.350> if<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.620> decrease<00:01:44.980> serum

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
decrease so if the decrease serum

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.430 
decrease so if the decrease serum
ferritin<00:01:45.910> according<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.690> Civic<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.320> this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
ferritin according to Civic to this

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.320 
ferritin according to Civic to this
equations<00:01:48.040> means<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.700> have<00:01:48.880> an<00:01:49.030> increased

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
equations means you have an increased

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.890 
equations means you have an increased
total<00:01:49.570> iron<00:01:50.260> binding<00:01:50.910> capacity<00:01:51.910> so<00:01:52.600> this<00:01:52.750> is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
total iron binding capacity so this is

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.200 
total iron binding capacity so this is
the<00:01:53.050> second<00:01:53.440> thing<00:01:53.500> or<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.340> second<00:01:54.700> change<00:01:54.940> in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
the second thing or the second change in

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.870 
the second thing or the second change in
iron<00:01:55.810> deficiency<00:01:56.380> anemia<00:01:56.800> how<00:01:57.370> about<00:01:57.610> how

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
iron deficiency anemia how about how

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.030 
iron deficiency anemia how about how
about<00:01:57.910> serum<00:01:58.450> iron<00:01:58.630> as<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.020> result<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.800> this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
about serum iron as a result of this

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.940 
about serum iron as a result of this
serum<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:00.940> don't<00:02:01.150> already<00:02:01.570> already<00:02:01.900> serum<00:02:02.860> I

don't when you have run out of the
storage<00:02:05.170> system<00:02:05.650> you<00:02:06.070> will<00:02:06.190> have<00:02:06.250> decreased

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
storage system you will have decreased

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.180 
storage system you will have decreased
serum<00:02:07.000> iron<00:02:07.270> in<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.660> blood<00:02:07.780> which<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.350> it

and<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.560> will<00:04:09.709> not<00:04:09.860> have<00:04:10.129> iron<00:04:10.549> coming<00:04:10.879> out<00:04:11.239> so

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
and you will not have iron coming out so

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.350 
and you will not have iron coming out so
the<00:04:12.049> serum<00:04:12.440> iron<00:04:12.650> as<00:04:13.129> a<00:04:13.190> result<00:04:13.849> of<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.120> will

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
the serum iron as a result of this will

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.060 
the serum iron as a result of this will
be<00:04:14.510> decreased<00:04:14.930> because<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.560> will<00:04:15.769> not<00:04:16.010> have

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
be decreased because you will not have

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.300 
be decreased because you will not have
iron<00:04:16.639> on<00:04:16.880> going<00:04:17.269> out<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.079> macrophages<00:04:18.650> so

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
iron on going out of the macrophages so

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.659 
iron on going out of the macrophages so
basically<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:20.000> iron<00:04:20.239> which<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.280> it's<00:04:22.280> already

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
basically the iron which is it's already

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.909 
basically the iron which is it's already
in<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.120> blood<00:04:23.330> all<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:24.020> iron<00:04:24.380> from<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.680> but

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
in the blood all the iron from the but

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.890 
in the blood all the iron from the but
will<00:04:25.160> get<00:04:25.400> trapped<00:04:25.850> inside<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.419> macrophages

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
will get trapped inside the macrophages

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.070 
will get trapped inside the macrophages
as<00:04:27.200> 14<00:04:27.680> I'll<00:04:27.860> not<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.330> iron<00:04:29.510> will<00:04:29.810> not<00:04:29.960> to

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
as 14 I'll not and the iron will not to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.140 
as 14 I'll not and the iron will not to
be<00:04:30.110> able<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.680> leave<00:04:31.010> macrophages<00:04:31.669> so<00:04:31.820> the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
be able to leave macrophages so the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.640 
be able to leave macrophages so the
serum<00:04:32.479> iron<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.139> blood<00:04:33.260> will<00:04:33.530> be

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
serum iron in the blood will be

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.529 
serum iron in the blood will be
decreased<00:04:34.010> how<00:04:34.340> about<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.700> saturation<00:04:35.210> is

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
decreased how about the saturation is

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.180 
decreased how about the saturation is
how<00:04:35.720> about<00:04:35.870> saturation<00:04:36.500> according<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
how about saturation according to the

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.460 
how about saturation according to the
equation<00:04:37.550> if<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.240> if<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.660> need<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:39.080> measure

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
equation if you if you need to measure

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.529 
equation if you if you need to measure
the<00:04:39.650> saturation<00:04:40.220> current<00:04:40.430> equations<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.210> C<00:04:41.419> on

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
the saturation current equations so C on

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.840 
the saturation current equations so C on
island<00:04:41.930> will<00:04:42.080> decrease<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:43.010> total<00:04:43.699> iron

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
island will decrease and total iron

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.250 
island will decrease and total iron
binding<00:04:44.000> capacity<00:04:44.389> will<00:04:44.810> decrease<00:04:45.110> the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
binding capacity will decrease the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.779 
binding capacity will decrease the
saturation<00:04:45.530> definitely<00:04:46.370> will<00:04:46.490> decrease

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
saturation definitely will decrease

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:47.980 
saturation definitely will decrease
because<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.180> will<00:04:47.300> not<00:04:47.389> have<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:47.630> iron

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
because you will not have that iron

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.690 
because you will not have that iron
binding<00:04:48.169> capacity<00:04:48.410> transferring<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.430> you

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
binding capacity transferring and you

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.940 
binding capacity transferring and you
already<00:04:49.880> don't<00:04:50.210> have<00:04:50.389> iron<00:04:50.630> okay<00:04:51.320> okay

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
already don't have iron okay okay

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.350 
already don't have iron okay okay

any crazy around 13 you will have de
Cristo<00:06:16.550> to<00:06:16.700> an<00:06:16.820> Amanda<00:06:17.090> capacity<00:06:17.660> okay

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
Cristo to an Amanda capacity okay

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.080 
Cristo to an Amanda capacity okay
and<00:06:18.170> how<00:06:18.440> about<00:06:18.500> saturation<00:06:19.220> I<00:06:19.400> think<00:06:19.640> it's<00:06:19.760> so

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
and how about saturation I think it's so

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.230 
and how about saturation I think it's so
easy<00:06:20.410> situations<00:06:21.410> in<00:06:21.620> hemochromatosis<00:06:22.460> more

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
easy situations in hemochromatosis more

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.750 
easy situations in hemochromatosis more
non<00:06:23.540> differently<00:06:24.470> more<00:06:24.650> than<00:06:24.830> 30<00:06:25.580> percent

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
non differently more than 30 percent

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.870 
non differently more than 30 percent
more<00:06:26.000> than<00:06:26.240> 33<00:06:26.720> 1<00:06:26.960> maybe<00:06:27.140> 45<00:06:27.770> so<00:06:28.310> saturation

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
more than 33 1 maybe 45 so saturation

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.460 
more than 33 1 maybe 45 so saturation
will<00:06:29.030> be<00:06:29.150> more<00:06:29.510> and<00:06:29.720> more<00:06:29.900> and<00:06:30.080> according<00:06:30.440> to

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
will be more and more and according to

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.170 
will be more and more and according to
this<00:06:30.650> principle<00:06:30.860> also<00:06:31.400> you<00:06:31.580> have<00:06:31.790> a<00:06:31.910> lot<00:06:32.150> of

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
this principle also you have a lot of

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.150 
this principle also you have a lot of
serum<00:06:32.660> iron<00:06:32.810> more<00:06:33.200> more<00:06:33.530> more<00:06:33.830> more<00:06:34.040> and

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
serum iron more more more more and

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160 
serum iron more more more more and
decrease<00:06:34.850> total<00:06:35.180> iron<00:06:35.270> binding<00:06:35.450> capacity<00:06:35.870> a

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
decrease total iron binding capacity a

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.960 
decrease total iron binding capacity a
lot<00:06:36.410> is<00:06:36.740> so<00:06:37.010> if<00:06:37.160> you<00:06:37.280> need<00:06:37.430> according<00:06:37.700> to<00:06:37.850> the

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
lot is so if you need according to the

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.360 
lot is so if you need according to the
equation<00:06:38.210> serum<00:06:38.960> iron<00:06:39.110> a<00:06:39.440> lot<00:06:39.710> of<00:06:39.860> serum<00:06:40.220> iron

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
equation serum iron a lot of serum iron

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.430 
equation serum iron a lot of serum iron
that<00:06:40.910> an<00:06:41.090> iron<00:06:41.240> mine<00:06:41.420> the<00:06:41.570> capacity<00:06:42.050> decreased

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
that an iron mine the capacity decreased

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.710 
that an iron mine the capacity decreased
so<00:06:42.920> as<00:06:43.070> a<00:06:43.100> result<00:06:43.310> of<00:06:43.610> the<00:06:43.700> saturation<00:06:44.090> will<00:06:44.540> be

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
so as a result of the saturation will be

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.530 
so as a result of the saturation will be
increase
