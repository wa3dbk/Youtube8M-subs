they are two open chest and being this
tank<00:02:59.720> admittedly<00:03:00.379> helps<00:03:00.739> me<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:01.220> take<00:03:01.430> at

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
tank admittedly helps me to take at

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.149 
tank admittedly helps me to take at
least<00:03:01.670> one<00:03:01.940> hit<00:03:02.090> for<00:03:02.870> most<00:03:03.139> monsters<00:03:03.620> which<00:03:03.980> is

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
least one hit for most monsters which is

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.629 
least one hit for most monsters which is
already<00:03:04.340> half<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.389> rent<00:03:05.540> light<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:07.459> yeah<00:03:07.609> I

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
already half the rent light so yeah I

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.009 
already half the rent light so yeah I
have<00:03:07.879> a<00:03:07.909> little<00:03:08.090> bit<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.299> discipline<00:03:08.780> closed

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
have a little bit of discipline closed

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.690 
have a little bit of discipline closed

I'm<00:03:26.209> not<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:27.139> above<00:03:27.500> eunuch<00:03:28.280> passive<00:03:28.669> is

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
I'm not so above eunuch passive is

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.439 
I'm not so above eunuch passive is
really<00:03:29.299> nice<00:03:29.620> because<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.980> symbolizes<00:03:31.449> very

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
really nice because it symbolizes very

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
very well with the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.120 
very well with the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130

those bone cages or cerebral object i

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.780 
those bone cages or cerebral object i
get<00:03:45.690> from<00:03:46.320> fifty<00:03:46.860> percent<00:03:47.130> movement<00:03:47.580> speed

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
get from fifty percent movement speed

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.110 
get from fifty percent movement speed
which<00:03:48.060> lasts<00:03:48.380> for<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.770> few<00:03:49.830> seconds<00:03:50.490> that<00:03:50.880> makes

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
which lasts for a few seconds that makes

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.410 
which lasts for a few seconds that makes
quite<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.570> difference<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:52.260> terms<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.680> speed<00:03:53.010> and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
quite a difference in terms of speed and

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.610 
quite a difference in terms of speed and
run<00:03:54.420> efficiency<00:03:54.990> not<00:03:55.170> underestimate<00:03:55.800> that

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
run efficiency not underestimate that

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.710 
run efficiency not underestimate that
alright<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> quick<00:04:00.060> map<00:04:00.390> overlay

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
alright so this is a quick map overlay

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.510 
alright so this is a quick map overlay
address<00:04:01.020> created<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.590> paint<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.160> show<00:04:02.460> you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
address created and paint to show you

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.790 
address created and paint to show you
all<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.060> possible<00:04:03.480> spawn<00:04:03.750> locations<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.470> the

all the possible spawn locations of the

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
area or of ariat so all the yellow ones

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.670 
area or of ariat so all the yellow ones
you<00:04:14.700> negate<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.270> possible<00:04:15.930> locations<00:04:16.350> where

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
you negate the possible locations where

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.670 
you negate the possible locations where
you<00:04:16.980> might<00:04:17.190> find<00:04:17.239> demonic<00:04:18.239> vessels<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.780> the

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
you might find demonic vessels and the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.130 
you might find demonic vessels and the
red<00:04:19.859> ones<00:04:20.100> are<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.609> possible<00:04:21.120> jest<00:04:21.450> spawn

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
red ones are the possible jest spawn

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.170 
red ones are the possible jest spawn
locations<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.490> what<00:04:23.670> you<00:04:23.760> want<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.060> be<00:04:24.150> doing

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
locations so what you want to be doing

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.820 
locations so what you want to be doing
once<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.840> start<00:04:25.110> here<00:04:25.260> at<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.410> checkpoint

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
once you start here at the checkpoint

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.150 
once you start here at the checkpoint
get<00:04:26.640> as<00:04:26.760> fast<00:04:27.060> as<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.270> can<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.720> first

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
get as fast as you can to the first

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.490 
get as fast as you can to the first
spawn<00:04:29.810> because<00:04:30.810> there's<00:04:31.170> not<00:04:31.260> gonna<00:04:31.440> be

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
spawn because there's not gonna be

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.320 
spawn because there's not gonna be
anything<00:04:31.740> on<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.070> way<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.670> then<00:04:32.940> just<00:04:33.150> like

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
anything on the way and then just like

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.420 
anything on the way and then just like
move<00:04:33.510> along<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.870> route<00:04:34.250> fairly<00:04:35.250> linear

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
move along the route fairly linear

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.670 
move along the route fairly linear
obvious<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.150> think<00:04:36.180> straight<00:04:36.750> forward<00:04:37.050> and

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
obvious I think straight forward and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.640 
obvious I think straight forward and
once<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.130> pass<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:39.600> point<00:04:39.810> here<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:40.440> can

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
once you pass this point here you can

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.680 
once you pass this point here you can
get<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.610> hell<00:04:41.730> out<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.090> as<00:04:42.150> fast<00:04:42.419> as<00:04:42.600> you

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
get the hell out of you as fast as you

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.560 
get the hell out of you as fast as you
can<00:04:42.870> because<00:04:43.050> from<00:04:43.830> this<00:04:43.980> point<00:04:44.190> on<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.580> not

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
can because from this point on this not

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.930 
can because from this point on this not
going<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> be<00:04:45.870> any<00:04:46.140> more<00:04:46.520> possible<00:04:47.520> spawn

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
going to be any more possible spawn

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.720 
going to be any more possible spawn
location<00:04:48.360> here<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.919> yeah<00:04:50.040> that's<00:04:50.250> about<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.580> I

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
location here so yeah that's about it I

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.760 
location here so yeah that's about it I
think<00:04:51.270> if<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.870> have<00:04:51.960> any<00:04:52.110> questions<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.740> can

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
think if you have any questions you can

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.710 
think if you have any questions you can
