00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
this at zero and this f-100 actually

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.000 
this at zero and this f-100 actually
helps<00:02:42.909> out<00:02:44.549> key<00:02:45.549> bindings<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:47.739> don't<00:02:47.859> have<00:02:47.950> to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
helps out key bindings you don't have to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.240 
helps out key bindings you don't have to
worry<00:02:48.129> about<00:02:48.159> that<00:02:48.989> however<00:02:49.989> on<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.470> jet<00:02:50.739> here

this is correct sorry
so<00:03:16.370> I'll<00:03:16.460> trigger<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.940> trigger<00:03:17.300> one<00:03:17.780> it's

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
so I'll trigger to trigger one it's

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.340 
so I'll trigger to trigger one it's
basically<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:19.070> little<00:03:19.220> throttle<00:03:19.550> buttons<00:03:20.350> on

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
basically a little throttle buttons on

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
basically a little throttle buttons on
the<00:03:21.560> joystick<00:03:22.360> trigger<00:03:23.360> one<00:03:23.600> here<00:03:23.990> hover

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
the joystick trigger one here hover

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.600 
the joystick trigger one here hover
again

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
again

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.650 
again
that<00:03:25.700> means<00:03:25.970> pulling<00:03:26.480> down<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:28.640> can<00:03:28.790> use<00:03:29.420> this

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
that means pulling down you can use this

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.720 
that means pulling down you can use this
if<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.530> don't<00:03:30.830> have<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.220> inverted

pretty<00:03:35.240> much<00:03:35.390> matching<00:03:35.959> with<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.850> helicopter

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850
