00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.560
 good afternoon, this is elena terehova 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:16.199
 Today a master class on making 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 earrings and bracelet earrings made of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.670
 bead wire and beads in order to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:31.430
 you need to take such an earring 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:36.230
 wire to make the center from such 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:42.059
 make 2 turns 1 2 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:48.899
 We cross over fasten and we 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:53.399
 it turns out such a circle 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:59.399
 circle and around this circle we start 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:05.869
 braid beads for this string on 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:11.659
 we take one bead and start braiding 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:15.180
 this circle is taken in total here 17 we 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:20.810
 beads and pass the first row here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:26.250
 this way just so loops chat them 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.920
 seam attach the first row he drove 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.439
 we are ready 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:41.040
 we pass the second row here we pass the second 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:46.380
 the row then we will have the third row the third 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:50.000
 we just pass a row 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.530
 empty loops 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.329
 cling to one bead and here 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.729
 that's when you look closer this 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.860
 diagram it will be clear that the third row is 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.000
 air goes and fourth row 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.340
 finish picking up 4 beads and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.319
 pass through the air 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.870
 from here so it turns out 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:22.290
 when we got there 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.690
 recruit 4 beads and go through this one 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.200
 step we have done and now we need to do 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:37.849
 center here center separately we take one 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:42.920
 big bead cling to the wire 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:49.579
 here and around this bead just dial 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:52.590
 8 8 stuff such flat beads and 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:55.319
 around them in the middle we are already starting 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.989
 braid on 4 beads so that 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:03.750
 It turned out such a tracery series and then 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.849
 this is ready this item we just 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.060
 attach 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:17.420
 here we fasten the center according to this principle 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:22.790
 these earrings and ultimate protections are made 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.639
 current means attaching our buckle 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.239
 here are attached 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:35.700
 convenient place turns out such here 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:38.130
 openwork earrings with bracelet past video 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.030
 I showed how to do it first 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.739
 the base 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.680
 this was taken for this 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:47.970
 potato is taken wire and and we 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.329
 do doubly 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.340
 overlapped intertwined like this double and 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:04:00.690
 affairs and intertwined and begin to reel 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:03.200
 on our base there in that form like me 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.169
 would be better shown in a circle we fix and 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.480
 we need to make such a foundation 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.840
 intertwined and then just take the wire 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:22.210
 and braid motors 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:24.190
 it turns out we have such a wire here 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.979
 we have major 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:33.220
 dependency rows what width do you have 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.590
 bracelet you want and then here you start 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:41.620
 like this just wire 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.660
 braid everything woke up when 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.810
 you fill it out. 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.720
 such a basis for this basis 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.680
 we are already important to fix our elements 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:58.419
 I have made some basic ones 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.780
 here are four of these elements first 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:07.229
 do the same thing as 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:12.400
 earrings are made like this center 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:15.360
 Basically, we are still just on edge. 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:23.349
 4 beads 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:26.260
 it turns out here and so on 4 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:30.840
 beads on 5 depending on what you have 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:34.810
 beads and it turns out such an edge 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.320
 the rest it all depends on your 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:44.020
 fantasies here I have typed beads here 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:47.530
 so large I took 5 beads and 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.490
 here is a wave of held fixed 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.770
 five things five things and then 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.669
 the rest add what you like 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:01.690
 You can add such flat beads 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:07.380
 you can tidy and fill all 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.380
 our bracelet space will be 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:16.240
 to draw such an openwork bracelet very much 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:22.550
 beautiful for the summer beautiful 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:28.460
 not heavy that's all goodbye 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.460
 all success create
