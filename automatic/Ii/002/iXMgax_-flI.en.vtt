quite do that man you know it's kind of

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.690

similar<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.450> any<00:03:31.630> new<00:03:31.930> boot<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.310> little

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
similar to any new boot it's a little

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.490 
similar to any new boot it's a little
bit<00:03:33.850> stiff<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.720> know<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:34.900> got<00:03:35.079> to<00:03:35.200> break<00:03:35.350> them

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
bit stiff you know you got to break them

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.680

I<00:03:37.720> think<00:03:38.110> all<00:03:38.500> racing<00:03:39.280> or<00:03:39.630> boots<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.900> this

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
I think all racing or boots like this

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.680 
I think all racing or boots like this
will<00:03:42.040> be<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> little<00:03:42.519> stiff<00:03:42.790> initially<00:03:43.480> but

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
will be a little stiff initially but

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.510 
will be a little stiff initially but
this<00:03:43.870> boot<00:03:44.079> was<00:03:44.200> quite<00:03:44.440> comfortable<00:03:44.920> when

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520

in<00:05:37.540> my<00:05:38.200> opinion<00:05:38.560> this<00:05:38.650> is<00:05:38.710> a<00:05:39.030> street

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
in my opinion this is a street

occasional<00:05:42.070> track<00:05:42.340> boot<00:05:42.640> right<00:05:42.880> here<00:05:43.890> it's

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
occasional track boot right here it's

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.460

very<00:05:44.950> easy<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:45.550> get<00:05:45.700> into<00:05:46.030> as

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
very easy to get into as

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.360 
very easy to get into as
detail<00:05:47.600> previously<00:05:48.710> very<00:05:49.710> easy<00:05:49.980> to<00:05:50.130> get<00:05:50.280> out

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
detail previously very easy to get out

00:05:50.370 --> 00:06:04.400 
detail previously very easy to get out
of<00:05:54.860> quite<00:05:55.860> easy<00:06:01.910> so<00:06:02.910> I<00:06:02.940> think<00:06:03.210> with<00:06:03.870> that<00:06:04.080> being

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
of quite easy so I think with that being

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.810 
of quite easy so I think with that being
said<00:06:04.500> this<00:06:04.890> is<00:06:04.950> a<00:06:05.630> decent<00:06:06.630> Street<00:06:07.140> movement

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
said this is a decent Street movement

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.930 
said this is a decent Street movement
and<00:06:08.820> for<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.120> price<00:06:10.460> it's<00:06:11.460> better<00:06:11.730> than

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
and for the price it's better than

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.810 
and for the price it's better than
wearing<00:06:12.150> sneakers<00:06:12.450> which<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.530> why<00:06:13.680> I<00:06:13.710> got<00:06:14.010> you
