with a name that was appropriate for our
fashion<00:00:58.500> sense<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.039> we're<00:00:59.219> so

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
fashion sense and that we're so

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
fashion sense and that we're so
different<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.660> she's<00:01:01.170> more<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:03.210> more<00:01:03.390> girly

you're<00:03:15.290> my<00:03:15.380> best<00:03:15.410> friend<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:16.010> didn't<00:03:16.250> say<00:03:16.400> yes

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220
