I<00:02:05.570> kind<00:02:05.900> of<00:02:05.930> like<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.140> I'm<00:02:06.650> just<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.010> little

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
I kind of like it I'm just a little

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.949 
I kind of like it I'm just a little
bummed<00:02:07.460> out<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> build<00:02:08.629> a<00:02:08.750> figure

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
bummed out that it is a build a figure

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.690 
bummed out that it is a build a figure
that's<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.440> only<00:02:09.709> thing<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.039> kind<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.369> sucks

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
that's the only thing that kind of sucks

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.190 
that's the only thing that kind of sucks
is<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.390> know<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.720> felt<00:02:11.959> like<00:02:12.049> he

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
is that you know that felt like he

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.330 
is that you know that felt like he
should<00:02:12.230> have<00:02:12.470> been<00:02:12.560> an<00:02:12.709> accessory<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.159> same

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
should have been an accessory the same

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.220 
should have been an accessory the same
feeling<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.180> with<00:02:14.390> all<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.750> other<00:02:14.900> mini

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
feeling I have with all the other mini

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.199 
feeling I have with all the other mini
build<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.709> figures<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.580> head<00:02:16.760> sculpt<00:02:17.120> and

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
build of figures so the head sculpt and

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.000 
build of figures so the head sculpt and
everything<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.720> same<00:02:18.049> as<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.709> Marvel

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
everything is the same as the Marvel

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.979 
everything is the same as the Marvel
Universe<00:02:19.040> puck<00:02:19.610> figure<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.269> think<00:02:20.629> this<00:02:20.780> came

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
Universe puck figure I think this came

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.059 
Universe puck figure I think this came
out<00:02:21.080> pretty<00:02:21.319> good<00:02:21.530> on<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.799> Marvel<00:02:22.040> Universe

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
out pretty good on the Marvel Universe

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.070 
out pretty good on the Marvel Universe
when<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.610> eyes<00:02:22.790> are<00:02:22.819> kind<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.299> screwed<00:02:23.720> up<00:02:23.870> I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
when the eyes are kind of screwed up I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.420 
when the eyes are kind of screwed up I
think<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.319> paint<00:02:24.560> applications<00:02:25.099> are<00:02:25.220> pretty

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
think the paint applications are pretty

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.160 
think the paint applications are pretty
good<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.269> like<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> flesh<00:02:26.750> tones<00:02:27.019> of

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
good on this you like the flesh tones of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.690 
good on this you like the flesh tones of
it<00:02:27.260> he<00:02:27.379> has<00:02:27.470> these<00:02:27.620> brown<00:02:27.980> eyes<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.489> their

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
it he has these brown eyes in their

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.580 
it he has these brown eyes in their
black<00:02:29.030> pupils<00:02:29.510> mustache<00:02:30.080> looks<00:02:30.260> clean

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
black pupils mustache looks clean

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.679 
black pupils mustache looks clean
especially<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.220> being<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.700> build<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.209> figure

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
especially this being a build a figure

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.290 
especially this being a build a figure
my<00:02:32.900> only<00:02:33.290> real<00:02:33.470> complaint<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.520> P<00:02:35.000> right

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
my only real complaint is this P right

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.780 
my only real complaint is this P right
here<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.020> mustard<00:02:36.560> yellow<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:36.980> prefer<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
here is this mustard yellow I prefer the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.890 
here is this mustard yellow I prefer the
gold<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.180> they<00:02:38.330> had<00:02:38.450> used

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
gold that they had used

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.539 
gold that they had used
on<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.230> Marvel<00:02:39.530> Universe<00:02:39.560> one<00:02:40.099> I<00:02:40.280> think

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
on the Marvel Universe one I think

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.550 
on the Marvel Universe one I think
that's<00:02:40.730> look<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.569> think<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.049> looks<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.349> little

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
that's look I think that looks a little

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.160 
that's look I think that looks a little
cooler<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.849> you<00:02:44.330> know<00:02:44.480> they<00:02:44.720> went<00:02:44.840> with<00:02:45.019> this

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
cooler but you know they went with this

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.530 
cooler but you know they went with this
instead<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:46.159> at<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.340> same<00:02:46.489> time<00:02:46.879> this<00:02:47.269> is<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
instead but at the same time this is the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.780 
instead but at the same time this is the
only<00:02:47.870> figure<00:02:48.709> from<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.129> whole<00:02:49.370> wave<00:02:49.549> that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
only figure from this whole wave that

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.820 
only figure from this whole wave that
actually<00:02:50.239> has<00:02:50.420> paint<00:02:50.780> shading<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.379> he<00:02:51.590> does

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
actually has paint shading so he does

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.680 
actually has paint shading so he does
have<00:02:51.980> some<00:02:52.250> gray<00:02:52.489> paint<00:02:52.790> shading<00:02:53.239> over<00:02:53.480> here

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
have some gray paint shading over here

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.930 
have some gray paint shading over here
on<00:02:53.810> his<00:02:53.959> arms<00:02:54.500> which<00:02:55.190> looks<00:02:55.400> pretty<00:02:55.489> good<00:02:55.909> I

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
on his arms which looks pretty good I

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.550 
on his arms which looks pretty good I
like<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.599> looks<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.870> little<00:02:56.959> dirty<00:02:57.230> he

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
like that it looks a little dirty he

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.229 
like that it looks a little dirty he
also<00:02:57.680> has<00:02:57.860> some<00:02:57.980> gray<00:02:58.220> paint<00:02:58.519> shading<00:02:58.909> on<00:02:59.030> his

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
also has some gray paint shading on his

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.580 
also has some gray paint shading on his
legs<00:02:59.480> over<00:02:59.659> here<00:02:59.870> I<00:02:59.900> guess<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.260> would<00:03:00.470> have

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
legs over here I guess it would have

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.589 
legs over here I guess it would have
been<00:03:00.739> nicer<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:01.459> they<00:03:01.579> had<00:03:01.730> filled<00:03:02.030> in<00:03:02.209> those<00:03:02.360> H

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
been nicer if they had filled in those H

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.589 
been nicer if they had filled in those H
in<00:03:03.140> lines<00:03:03.500> with<00:03:03.890> with<00:03:04.459> black<00:03:04.730> or<00:03:05.000> something<00:03:05.360> so

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
in lines with with black or something so

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.180 
in lines with with black or something so
it<00:03:05.720> looked<00:03:05.930> like<00:03:05.989> he<00:03:06.200> actually<00:03:06.560> had<00:03:06.739> hair<00:03:07.010> I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
it looked like he actually had hair I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.559 
it looked like he actually had hair I
know<00:03:07.579> what<00:03:07.760> they're<00:03:07.879> going<00:03:08.120> for<00:03:08.239> they're

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
know what they're going for they're

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.640 
know what they're going for they're
trying<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.750> make<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.930> look<00:03:09.049> like<00:03:09.170> it's<00:03:09.379> hair

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
trying to make it look like it's hair

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.740 
trying to make it look like it's hair
but<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.700> think<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.120> would<00:03:11.359> have<00:03:11.390> looked<00:03:11.660> a

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
but I think it just would have looked a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.390 
but I think it just would have looked a
little<00:03:11.959> better<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.410> know<00:03:12.739> but<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:12.980> scope<00:03:13.250> of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
little better you know but the scope of

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.740 
little better you know but the scope of
this<00:03:13.489> figure<00:03:13.819> is<00:03:13.879> pretty<00:03:14.239> good<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.480> can't

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
this figure is pretty good I can't

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.449 
this figure is pretty good I can't
really<00:03:14.959> complain<00:03:15.200> about<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.680> sculpt<00:03:16.099> overall

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
really complain about the sculpt overall

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.440 
really complain about the sculpt overall
it's<00:03:16.700> just<00:03:16.819> you<00:03:17.000> know<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.269> paint

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
it's just you know the paint

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.759 
it's just you know the paint
applications<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.230> think<00:03:18.440> they're<00:03:18.530> kind<00:03:18.709> of

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
applications I think they're kind of

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.530 
applications I think they're kind of
missing<00:03:19.069> here<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.250> there<00:03:19.370> here's<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.359> back

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
missing here and there here's the back

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.660 
missing here and there here's the back
of<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.810> figure<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.920> he's<00:03:22.069> got<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.370> twist

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
of the figure and he's got that twist

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.030 
of the figure and he's got that twist
going<00:03:23.000> on<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.840> yeah<00:03:24.200> not<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.590> whole<00:03:24.769> lot<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.010> say

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
going on so yeah not a whole lot to say

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.979 
going on so yeah not a whole lot to say
I<00:03:25.430> mean<00:03:25.760> sitting<00:03:25.970> side<00:03:26.269> by<00:03:26.299> side<00:03:26.659> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.840> back

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
I mean sitting side by side of the back

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.599 
I mean sitting side by side of the back
of<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.200> figures<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.560> could<00:03:27.920> see<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.310> same

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
of the figures you could see the same

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.759 
of the figures you could see the same
exact<00:03:29.239> figure<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:29.989> right<00:03:30.170> after<00:03:30.319> I'm<00:03:30.560> done

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
exact figure so right after I'm done

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.110 
exact figure so right after I'm done
saying<00:03:31.099> that<00:03:31.340> this<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.640> same<00:03:31.819> exact

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
saying that this is the same exact

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.490 
saying that this is the same exact
figure<00:03:32.329> as<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.569> Marvel<00:03:32.840> Universe<00:03:32.870> version

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
figure as the Marvel Universe version

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.890 
figure as the Marvel Universe version
there<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:34.040> improvement<00:03:34.489> in<00:03:34.909> the<00:03:35.060> articulation

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
there is improvement in the articulation

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.899 
there is improvement in the articulation
so<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.319> head<00:03:36.500> does<00:03:36.769> move<00:03:37.010> up<00:03:37.220> pretty<00:03:37.519> well<00:03:37.609> I

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
so the head does move up pretty well I

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.240 
so the head does move up pretty well I
like<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.299> his<00:03:39.019> head<00:03:39.349> moves<00:03:39.500> down<00:03:39.980> pretty

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
like that his head moves down pretty

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.069 
like that his head moves down pretty
well<00:03:40.370> in<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.730> moves<00:03:40.970> side<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.239> side<00:03:41.659> he<00:03:41.900> does

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
well in the moves side to side he does

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.690 
well in the moves side to side he does
have<00:03:42.260> arms<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.799> can<00:03:42.919> move<00:03:43.069> outward<00:03:43.519> at<00:03:43.669> the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
have arms that can move outward at the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.940 
have arms that can move outward at the
shoulder<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.180> they<00:03:44.569> can<00:03:44.810> rotate<00:03:45.049> forward<00:03:45.829> as

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
shoulder and they can rotate forward as

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.559 
shoulder and they can rotate forward as
well<00:03:46.160> he<00:03:46.400> does<00:03:46.549> have<00:03:46.700> elbows<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.239> bend<00:03:47.450> at

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
well he does have elbows that bend at

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.240 
well he does have elbows that bend at
almost<00:03:47.780> 90<00:03:48.109> degrees<00:03:48.139> not<00:03:48.590> quite<00:03:48.859> they<00:03:49.010> also

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
almost 90 degrees not quite they also

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.400 
almost 90 degrees not quite they also
rotate<00:03:49.760> at<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.000> elbows<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.569> MU<00:03:50.900> version<00:03:51.260> does

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
rotate at the elbows the MU version does

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.589 
rotate at the elbows the MU version does
not<00:03:51.440> have<00:03:51.829> that<00:03:51.859> his<00:03:52.519> wrists<00:03:52.970> do<00:03:53.120> move<00:03:53.329> side<00:03:53.569> to

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
not have that his wrists do move side to

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.979 
not have that his wrists do move side to
side

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989
