which<00:04:07.080> is<00:04:07.230> exactly<00:04:07.380> what<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:07.830> did<00:04:08.070> on<00:04:08.220> purpose

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
which is exactly what I did on purpose

which is exactly what I did on purpose
just<00:04:08.760> over<00:04:09.270> a<00:04:09.300> year<00:04:09.360> ago<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:10.020> we'll<00:04:10.140> have

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
just over a year ago so we'll have

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.320 
just over a year ago so we'll have
another<00:04:10.440> closer<00:04:10.740> look<00:04:11.010> at<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.250> watch<00:04:11.430> well

another closer look at that watch well
this<00:04:12.420> is<00:04:12.540> how<00:04:12.720> mine<00:04:13.020> turned<00:04:13.230> up<00:04:13.620> typically

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
this is how mine turned up typically

this is how mine turned up typically
you're<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.490> a<00:04:14.580> little<00:04:14.790> packet<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.660> inside

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
you're just a little packet and inside

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
as I say you know even though it's got

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.030 
as I say you know even though it's got
the<00:04:17.730> label<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.390> a<00:04:19.140> piece<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.470> like<00:04:19.620> bubble

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
the label just a piece of like bubble

the label just a piece of like bubble

wrap so that's a dead giveaway the
labels<00:04:22.710> fake<00:04:22.950> as<00:04:23.190> well<00:04:23.370> quite<00:04:23.910> clever<00:04:24.210> but

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
labels fake as well quite clever but

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.320 
labels fake as well quite clever but
fake<00:04:24.860> at<00:04:25.860> first<00:04:26.160> glance<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.910> watch<00:04:27.060> actually

fake at first glance the watch actually

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.430 
fake at first glance the watch actually
looks<00:04:27.630> quite<00:04:27.930> good

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
looks quite good

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.800 
looks quite good
but<00:04:29.070> this<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.400> really<00:04:29.580> how<00:04:29.850> an<00:04:30.000> original<00:04:30.390> Casio

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
but this is really how an original Casio

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.780 
but this is really how an original Casio
is<00:04:30.960> going<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.230> turn<00:04:31.440> up<00:04:31.650> as<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.430> said<00:04:32.640> before

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
is going to turn up as I said before

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.910 
is going to turn up as I said before
you're<00:04:33.300> going<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.480> get<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.600> box<00:04:33.930> I'm<00:04:34.500> need<00:04:34.830> to

I<00:04:48.000> mean<00:04:48.690> they've<00:04:49.380> really<00:04:49.410> done<00:04:50.040> this<00:04:50.190> well<00:04:50.460> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
I mean they've really done this well the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.900 
I mean they've really done this well the
actual<00:04:51.210> text<00:04:51.690> on<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.050> device<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.340> display

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.530 
actual text on the device and display
itself<00:04:55.160> it's<00:04:56.160> almost<00:04:56.460> impossible<00:04:56.850> just<00:04:57.330> while

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
itself it's almost impossible just while

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.540 
itself it's almost impossible just while
looking<00:04:57.780> at<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.320> actually<00:04:58.740> know<00:04:59.310> whether

this is a genuine watch you really have

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.070 
this is a genuine watch you really have
to<00:05:01.320> take<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.740> apart<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.160> find<00:05:02.430> out<00:05:02.840> even<00:05:03.840> the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
to take it apart to find out even the

to take it apart to find out even the
back<00:05:04.290> they've<00:05:04.590> even<00:05:04.740> done<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.460> actual

even put a protector over it I mean for
three<00:05:10.800> pound<00:05:11.070> fifty<00:05:11.490> it's<00:05:11.670> very<00:05:11.940> clever<00:05:12.680> with

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
three pound fifty it's very clever with

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.620 
three pound fifty it's very clever with
the<00:05:13.920> steel<00:05:14.280> bracelet<00:05:14.730> watch<00:05:15.000> probably<00:05:15.540> the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
the steel bracelet watch probably the

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.510 
the steel bracelet watch probably the
only<00:05:15.750> thing<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.080> gives<00:05:16.200> it<00:05:16.440> away<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:17.310> the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
only thing that gives it away is the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.240 
only thing that gives it away is the
actual<00:05:17.880> bracelet<00:05:18.270> itself<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:19.680> just<00:05:19.950> kind<00:05:20.160> of

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
actual bracelet itself it just kind of

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.730 
actual bracelet itself it just kind of
feels<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.760> little<00:05:21.270> bit<00:05:21.540> lie<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:22.200> just<00:05:22.410> doesn't

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
feels a little bit lie it just doesn't

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.520 
feels a little bit lie it just doesn't
feel<00:05:22.890> particularly<00:05:23.370> good<00:05:23.730> quality<00:05:24.270> and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
feel particularly good quality and

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.720 
feel particularly good quality and
especially<00:05:25.530> if<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.800> look<00:05:25.950> at<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.190> back<00:05:26.430> you

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
especially if you look at the back you

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.010 
especially if you look at the back you
can<00:05:26.850> see<00:05:27.030> there's<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.300> couple<00:05:27.480> of<00:05:27.690> rough<00:05:27.840> edges

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
can see there's a couple of rough edges

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.190 
can see there's a couple of rough edges
and<00:05:28.440> probably<00:05:29.430> also<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.540> side<00:05:30.840> of<00:05:31.080> the

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
and probably also on the side of the

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.170 
and probably also on the side of the
bracelet<00:05:31.440> it's<00:05:31.830> not<00:05:32.130> finished<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.000> sort

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
bracelet it's not finished to the sort

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.570 
bracelet it's not finished to the sort
of<00:05:33.270> standard<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:33.840> you<00:05:34.020> would<00:05:34.050> expect<00:05:34.590> it's<00:05:35.490> a

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
of standard that you would expect it's a

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.000 
of standard that you would expect it's a
slightly<00:05:36.000> it's<00:05:36.810> there<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.260> it's<00:05:37.320> just<00:05:37.500> not

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
slightly it's there but it's just not

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.140 
slightly it's there but it's just not
what<00:05:38.250> you'd<00:05:38.400> think<00:05:38.430> from<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.120> Casio<00:05:39.540> watch<00:05:41.150> also

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
what you'd think from a Casio watch also

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.320 
what you'd think from a Casio watch also
if<00:05:42.540> you<00:05:42.750> look<00:05:42.990> at<00:05:43.140> the<00:05:43.230> text<00:05:43.620> on<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:43.830> class<00:05:44.330> and

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
if you look at the text on the class and

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.390 
if you look at the text on the class and
get<00:05:45.510> yet<00:05:45.660> again<00:05:45.930> it's<00:05:46.140> a<00:05:46.320> little<00:05:46.500> bit<00:05:46.680> chunky<00:05:47.100> a

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
get yet again it's a little bit chunky a

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.050 
get yet again it's a little bit chunky a
little<00:05:47.669> bit<00:05:47.760> clunky<00:05:48.030> it's<00:05:48.840> not<00:05:49.410> as<00:05:49.640> good<00:05:50.640> as<00:05:50.700> a

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
little bit clunky it's not as good as a

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.000 
little bit clunky it's not as good as a
genuine<00:05:51.600> Casio<00:05:52.050> but<00:05:52.260> of<00:05:52.350> course<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:52.770> need<00:05:52.950> a

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
genuine Casio but of course you need a

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.580 
genuine Casio but of course you need a
genuine<00:05:53.610> Casio<00:05:54.120> next<00:05:54.450> to<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:55.200> be<00:05:55.320> able<00:05:55.410> to

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
genuine Casio next to it to be able to

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.470 
genuine Casio next to it to be able to
compare<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:56.730> you're<00:05:56.880> probably<00:05:57.090> not<00:05:57.270> going<00:05:57.419> to

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
compare and you're probably not going to

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.110 
compare and you're probably not going to
have<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:57.930> so<00:05:58.740> it's<00:05:59.070> still<00:05:59.340> not<00:05:59.580> really<00:05:59.850> that

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
have that so it's still not really that

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.590 
have that so it's still not really that
easy<00:06:00.450> to<00:06:00.870> actually<00:06:01.020> identify<00:06:01.320> a<00:06:01.919> fake<00:06:02.600> another

way<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:03.870> can<00:06:04.140> tell<00:06:04.200> with<00:06:04.590> these<00:06:04.740> f90<00:06:05.400> ones<00:06:05.640> is

way you can tell with these f90 ones is

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.050 
way you can tell with these f90 ones is
the<00:06:06.210> backlight<00:06:06.770> genuine<00:06:07.770> casio<00:06:08.220> had<00:06:08.760> a<00:06:08.790> kind

of green blueish backlight that's what

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.890 
of green blueish backlight that's what
these<00:06:11.669> fake<00:06:12.000> ones<00:06:12.300> actually<00:06:12.570> have

on the right but a guy himself who is a
Casio<00:06:37.890> collector<00:06:38.460> admitted<00:06:38.940> it<00:06:39.030> was<00:06:39.150> really

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
Casio collector admitted it was really

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.480 
Casio collector admitted it was really
difficult<00:06:39.930> to<00:06:40.020> tell<00:06:40.200> until<00:06:40.530> he<00:06:41.100> actually<00:06:41.220> took

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
difficult to tell until he actually took

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.040 
difficult to tell until he actually took
the<00:06:41.610> backs<00:06:41.820> of

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
the backs of

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.529 
the backs of
watches<00:06:42.349> off<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:43.610> then<00:06:43.819> it<00:06:43.940> became<00:06:44.270> obvious

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
watches off and then it became obvious

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.020 
watches off and then it became obvious
that<00:06:45.080> the<00:06:45.229> genuine<00:06:45.710> watch<00:06:45.949> had<00:06:46.520> a<00:06:46.550> few<00:06:46.849> more

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
that the genuine watch had a few more

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.379 
that the genuine watch had a few more
screws<00:06:47.360> holding<00:06:48.110> down<00:06:48.259> a<00:06:48.319> module<00:06:48.940> but<00:06:49.940> even<00:06:50.210> so

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
screws holding down a module but even so

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.809 
screws holding down a module but even so
the<00:06:50.569> difference<00:06:50.900> is<00:06:51.050> a<00:06:51.080> really<00:06:51.500> slight<00:06:51.800> so<00:06:52.759> you

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
the difference is a really slight so you

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.790 
the difference is a really slight so you
might<00:06:53.060> say<00:06:53.330> well<00:06:53.360> hell<00:06:53.870> why<00:06:54.259> not<00:06:54.289> despite<00:06:54.770> a

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
might say well hell why not despite a

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.499 
might say well hell why not despite a
fake<00:06:55.129> because<00:06:55.430> it's<00:06:55.669> cheaper<00:06:56.090> and<00:06:56.120> it's<00:06:56.330> just

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
fake because it's cheaper and it's just

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.100 
fake because it's cheaper and it's just
the<00:06:56.629> same<00:06:56.870> in<00:06:57.740> actual<00:06:58.099> fact<00:06:58.280> it's<00:06:58.520> not<00:06:59.110> because

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
the same in actual fact it's not because

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.619 
the same in actual fact it's not because
my<00:07:00.259> fake<00:07:00.620> is<00:07:00.860> a<00:07:00.919> terrible<00:07:01.460> timekeeper<00:07:02.240> it

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:02.629 
my fake is a terrible timekeeper it

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:04.390 
my fake is a terrible timekeeper it
loses<00:07:03.080> almost<00:07:03.379> a<00:07:03.530> minute<00:07:03.710> a<00:07:03.860> day<00:07:04.039> which<00:07:04.280> is

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
loses almost a minute a day which is

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.969 
loses almost a minute a day which is
just<00:07:04.580> unacceptable<00:07:05.090> for<00:07:05.629> watch<00:07:05.870> so<00:07:06.650> although

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:06.979 
just unacceptable for watch so although

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.129 
just unacceptable for watch so although
they're<00:07:07.190> cheaper<00:07:07.669> they're<00:07:08.060> far<00:07:08.360> inferior<00:07:08.569> in

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
they're cheaper they're far inferior in

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.950 
they're cheaper they're far inferior in
quality<00:07:09.789> so<00:07:10.789> that's<00:07:10.970> about<00:07:11.090> it<00:07:11.419> that's<00:07:11.659> about

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
quality so that's about it that's about

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.260 
quality so that's about it that's about
the<00:07:12.080> best<00:07:12.199> I<00:07:12.440> can<00:07:12.500> do<00:07:12.800> I<00:07:13.069> wish<00:07:13.970> you<00:07:14.120> good
