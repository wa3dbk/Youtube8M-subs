microfiber pad on the bottom but look

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
microfiber pad on the bottom but look
how<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.400> swivels<00:01:32.909> isn't<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.450> amazing

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
how it also swivels isn't it amazing

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.149 
how it also swivels isn't it amazing
swivel<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.829> those<00:01:34.950> tight

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
swivel so you can get in those tight

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.800 
swivel so you can get in those tight
little<00:01:35.340> corners<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.270> much<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.659> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
want give it a little more solution

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
want give it a little more solution
whatever<00:01:38.909> solution<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.380> whatever

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
whatever solution I want to whatever

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.560 
whatever solution I want to whatever
strength<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.180> best<00:01:42.329> part<00:01:42.509> about

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
strength I want and the best part about

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
strength I want and the best part about
it<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.290> picking<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.100> there's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it is it's picking it up and there's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.219 
it is it's picking it up and there's
microfiber<00:01:44.939> pad<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:45.630> how<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> dirts

the solution I'm using the solution that
I<00:03:43.080> want<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.860> we're<00:03:43.980> getting<00:03:44.130> both<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.489> these

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
I want and we're getting both of these

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.430 
I want and we're getting both of these
so<00:03:45.239> again<00:03:45.420> say<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.840> want<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.110> use<00:03:46.200> something

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
so again say I want to use something

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.810 
so again say I want to use something
different<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.800> my<00:03:46.890> hardwood<00:03:47.100> floor<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.670> can

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
different on my hardwood floor I can

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.880 
different on my hardwood floor I can
easily<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.330> pull<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:48.690> out<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.080> put<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.739> just

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
easily just pull it out and put in just

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.440 
easily just pull it out and put in just
you<00:03:50.010> know<00:03:50.130> water<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.880> vinegar<00:03:50.970> if<00:03:51.270> that's

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
you know water and vinegar if that's

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.940 
you know water and vinegar if that's
what<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.600> want<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.930> use<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.350> two<00:03:52.560> bottles

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
what I want to use you get two bottles

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.110 
what I want to use you get two bottles
by<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.160> way<00:03:53.310> look<00:03:53.610> at<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.730> difference

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
by the way look at the difference

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.940 
by the way look at the difference
between<00:03:54.510> these<00:03:54.660> two<00:03:54.900> mops<00:03:55.110> okay<00:03:55.500> which<00:03:55.709> one

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
between these two mops okay which one

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.010 
between these two mops okay which one
would<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.160> rather<00:03:56.459> use<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.690> see<00:03:57.870> right

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
would you rather use you can see right

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.260 
would you rather use you can see right
away<00:03:58.200> I'm<00:03:58.800> gonna<00:03:59.040> take<00:03:59.250> twice<00:03:59.550> as<00:03:59.610> much<00:04:00.000> time

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
away I'm gonna take twice as much time

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.840 
away I'm gonna take twice as much time
to<00:04:00.660> play<00:04:00.840> with<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.320> mop<00:04:01.620> then<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> will<00:04:02.700> with

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
that and you know what this sponge I

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.340 
that and you know what this sponge I
fairly<00:04:05.880> sure<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.209> can't<00:04:06.510> unscrew<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.020> and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
fairly sure you can't unscrew that and

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.449 
fairly sure you can't unscrew that and
throw<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.830> wash<00:04:07.980> machine<00:04:08.010> you're

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
throw that in the wash machine you're

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.800 
throw that in the wash machine you're
supposed<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.700> don't<00:04:08.910> mean<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.209> as<00:04:09.360> you<00:04:09.570> go

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
supposed to don't mean that as you go

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.630 
supposed to don't mean that as you go
Plus<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.620> is<00:04:10.770> kind<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:10.980> back-breaking<00:04:11.190> cuz

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
Plus this is kind of back-breaking cuz

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
Plus this is kind of back-breaking cuz
you<00:04:11.700> got<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:11.910> keep<00:04:11.970> bringing<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:12.390> out<00:04:12.510> you

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
you got to keep bringing it out you

you got to keep bringing it out you
don't<00:04:12.750> need<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.050> put<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.230> much<00:04:13.410> liquid<00:04:14.010> on

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
don't need to put that much liquid on

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.130 
don't need to put that much liquid on
with<00:04:14.730> this<00:04:14.910> you've<00:04:15.120> got<00:04:15.300> your<00:04:15.510> material<00:04:15.959> it's

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
with this you've got your material it's

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.780 
with this you've got your material it's
built<00:04:16.380> right<00:04:16.650> into<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.250> mission<00:04:17.520> into<00:04:17.760> the

fifteen<00:04:23.750> 16<00:04:24.170> inches<00:04:24.470> of<00:04:24.650> cleaning<00:04:25.040> it's<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.400> 15

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
fifteen 16 inches of cleaning it's a 15

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.850 
fifteen 16 inches of cleaning it's a 15
inch<00:04:26.150> cleaning<00:04:26.420> app<00:04:26.660> which<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.020> way<00:04:27.290> down<00:04:27.560> and

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
inch cleaning app which is way down and

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.770 
inch cleaning app which is way down and
then<00:04:28.040> when<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.250> pivot<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.000> around<00:04:29.180> four

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
then when you pivot it around four

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.630 
then when you pivot it around four
inches<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.290> mean<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.770> can<00:04:30.890> get<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:31.160> between<00:04:31.400> the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
inches I mean you can get it between the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.920 
inches I mean you can get it between the
cabinets<00:04:32.060> in<00:04:32.120> between<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.600> toilets

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
cabinets in between the toilets

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.870 
cabinets in between the toilets
underneath<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.590> want<00:04:33.680> low<00:04:33.860> profile<00:04:34.280> look<00:04:34.730> how

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
underneath you want low profile look how

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.370 
underneath you want low profile look how
far<00:04:35.120> down<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.510> low<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:35.690> can<00:04:35.870> get<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.230> the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
far down and low you can get and the

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.780 
far down and low you can get and the
best<00:04:36.530> part<00:04:36.740> about<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:37.010> is<00:04:37.130> it's<00:04:37.520> from
