00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.040
 So first of all, this anime has 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.269
 really a very long name and the 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.070
 partie do is a car batteries 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.469
 I hope I have spoken I 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.659
 can not guarantee anything but you 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.909
 look that is already relatively long the 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.369
 story starts really fast 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:24.159
 many actions follow at the beginning 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.800
 the others and there you are with the 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.609
 not all so familiar yet 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.539
 It still takes a while 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.880
 conceited 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.769
 By and large I have to say 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.329
 all the first half is actually 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.969
 well done in full history 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.250
 the whole thing will be fine by a 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.460
 very clear and modern animation 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.280
 supports the characters bring everyone 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.629
 your own kind with you and steer 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.629
 thus also the genres super power action 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.449
 comedy will be a bit lg in a very 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.089
 nice whole package the whole has one 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.120
 fresh note with a pinch of joke easily 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.949
 Nutty in the donations musically 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.710
 This time I'm just on the opening and 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.450
 the ending left the europe and me 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.390
 personally beautified and also brings 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.799
 mood on it really makes you want to 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.880
 to watch anime 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:20.259
 the ending does not have its effect either 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.600
 because it's big modern somehow now 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.119
 or sung so well or otherwise 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.090
 It would be just the joke 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.950
 designed and especially the animation there 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.600
 in the background is really nice 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.049
 to watch because I can only 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.259
 recommend 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.229
 conclusion a good anime in between 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.850
 the characters are consistently sympathetic 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.310
 and the story itself is one too 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.200
 interesting idea fights with special 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.259
 rules so you do not get that is also 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 quite as common and everything has one too 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.899
 certain tension that was it in the big one 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.060
 and it's really groundbreaking 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.729
 this anime namely not the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.009
 characters are a bit europe has 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.869
 but I think you can do it on everyone 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.240
 case over it especially overlook 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.929
 but I found the main character 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.540
 really he is sympathetic and also 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.810
 shown quite cool even if the 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.959
 plot offers good elements 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.180
 so he is not quite told and round 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.190
 the end is just not acceptable 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.349
 change me and the way I occupy 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.060
 he probably will not hear 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.860
 second season appear what me 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.330
 Personally find a pity 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.239
 that means I would probably have to 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.980
 the manga manga me talked 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.090
 look at 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.400
 and yes it will make you 23 june queen 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.680
 Mary so that the end 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.790
 not really rounded that up 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.830
 It still means something open 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.170
 and really something big open 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.970
 and that bothers me already 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.709
 bit I find that once a 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.170
 a bit bad book which I personally 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.940
 even less understand how 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.010
 sum up at the anime really only ten 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.349
 has given follow because I deix my yes 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 anime is already around 12 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.160
 13 so why not because of that too 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.330
 but really better than so 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.430
 not the other narrow what I already 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.049
 has seen and as always money everything 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.459
 what I have said is and remains my opinion 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.900
 if you do not like the team 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.190
 but quite simply your own until the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.190
 next time your citigroup
