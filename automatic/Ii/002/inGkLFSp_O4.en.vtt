poly<00:03:25.030> bag<00:03:25.680> but<00:03:26.680> anyway<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.459> was<00:03:27.519> from<00:03:28.420> Europe

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
poly bag but anyway this was from Europe

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.110 
poly bag but anyway this was from Europe
that's<00:03:29.350> why<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.590> bag<00:03:30.010> has<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.370> no<00:03:30.579> piece<00:03:30.819> count

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
that's why the bag has a no piece count

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.590 
that's why the bag has a no piece count
on<00:03:31.389> it<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.400> forty<00:03:34.030> seven<00:03:34.359> piece<00:03:34.569> set

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
on it and it's a forty seven piece set

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.620
