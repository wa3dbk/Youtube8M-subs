 um so that sony xperia z with these 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.360
 smart tags here for short communicates that 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.440

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.269
 you just keep the device the gentlemen 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.410
 and as you will see then stop 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.170
 certain bodes for example office mode 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.250

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.860
 good surf both in landscape format as well 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.230
 in portrait format the whole thing turns completely 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.310
 fast thanks to the 1.5 gigahertz 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.379
 Processors then you can of course 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.720

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.549
 I'll pick this up 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:34.260

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.610
 very nice resolution 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.640
 Of course you can do that as well 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.940
 if you look at this device closer 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.080
 also to zoom in on the contents so 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.970
 Here is the high screen 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.510
 resolution in any case noticeable 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.980
 Of course you can do that as well 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.980
 start the camera that is about this 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.750
 button in the corner and a recording 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.450
 then you have to do this here 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:17.500
 I send my button to the right 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:19.949

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.389

 here you can get this one 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.310
 Double I'll do it this far 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.720
 It is possible with one hand 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.919

 to say 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.780
 what can be summed up to say 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.360
 sony xperia z is now reissued 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.510

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.550

 we have a device that is wonderfully thin 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.389
 with 79 mm depth of build only as you can see 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.430
 everything very flush with processed 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.880
 a 5 inch display with a very 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.220
 thin edge of a housing what protected 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.400
 against scratches against dust and against 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.130
 water according to the certification b 55 57 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.150
 definitely a very interesting one 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.090
 device 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.170
 what a league plays with the iphone 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.750
 5 and with the samsung galaxy note 2 the 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.450
 samsung galaxy note 2 has a display 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.980
 from 530 here we have five inches 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.510
 but also mean bigger here so is 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.490
 even small differences in any case 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.110
 a very interesting device that it is in 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.650
