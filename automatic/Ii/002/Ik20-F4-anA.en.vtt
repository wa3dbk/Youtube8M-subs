has<00:02:22.819> done<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.390> separated<00:02:23.780> our<00:02:23.930> sub

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
has done is it separated our sub

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.260 
has done is it separated our sub
services<00:02:24.620> into<00:02:25.069> faces<00:02:25.580> edges<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.030> vertices

services into faces edges and vertices

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.130 
services into faces edges and vertices
and<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:28.069> can<00:02:28.220> see<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.580> our<00:02:28.849> vertices<00:02:29.239> count

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
and you can see that our vertices count

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.710 
and you can see that our vertices count
is<00:02:30.380> at<00:02:30.590> 100<00:02:31.250> right<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.850> what<00:02:32.480> I'd<00:02:32.569> like<00:02:32.600> to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
is at 100 right now and what I'd like to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.830 
is at 100 right now and what I'd like to
do<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.260> organize<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.489> list<00:02:34.819> of<00:02:34.970> vertices<00:02:35.150> so

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
do is organize this list of vertices so

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.080 
do is organize this list of vertices so
that<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.350> use<00:02:37.130> 3<00:02:37.459> of<00:02:37.489> them<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.910> make<00:02:38.060> a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
that I can use 3 of them to make a

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.020 
that I can use 3 of them to make a
triangular<00:02:38.720> surface<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.530> three<00:02:40.459> other<00:02:40.610> to

logic tab the first that we'll grab is

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.380 
logic tab the first that we'll grab is
in<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.910> list<00:02:56.120> section<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.170> list<00:02:57.410> item

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
in the list section it's a list item

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.610 
in the list section it's a list item
component<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.510> we'll<00:02:59.810> also<00:02:59.959> grab<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.319> list

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
component and we'll also grab a list

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.620 
component and we'll also grab a list
length<00:03:00.920> component<00:03:01.610> from<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.060> list<00:03:02.330> section

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
length component from the list section

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.930 
length component from the list section
and<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.769> third<00:03:03.980> one<00:03:04.160> we'll<00:03:04.280> grab<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.670> from<00:03:04.819> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
and the third one we'll grab is from the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.900 
and the third one we'll grab is from the
sets<00:03:05.269> section<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.410> series<00:03:06.860> component

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.539 

the<00:03:10.910> first<00:03:11.150> step<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.989> take<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.549> vertices

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
the first step is to take the vertices

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.539 
the first step is to take the vertices
and<00:03:13.970> drag<00:03:14.810> them<00:03:15.019> into<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.650> list<00:03:16.280> length

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
and drag them into the list length

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.400 
and drag them into the list length
component<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:17.660> will<00:03:17.720> strip<00:03:18.170> all<00:03:18.290> the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
component this will strip all the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.990 
component this will strip all the
location<00:03:18.890> information<00:03:19.040> from<00:03:19.609> it<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:19.910> we'll

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
location information from it and we'll

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.030 
location information from it and we'll
just<00:03:20.030> be<00:03:20.299> dealing<00:03:20.480> with<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.930> number<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.590> 100

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
just be dealing with this number of 100

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.849 
just be dealing with this number of 100
vertices<00:03:22.780> well<00:03:23.780> then<00:03:23.959> take<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.650> bring

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
vertices well then take that and bring

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.819 
vertices well then take that and bring
that<00:03:24.980> into<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.730> series<00:03:26.239> component<00:03:26.829> because

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
that into the series component because

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.199 
that into the series component because
the<00:03:27.950> series<00:03:28.250> component<00:03:28.579> will<00:03:28.790> allow<00:03:29.000> us<00:03:29.180> to

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
the series component will allow us to

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.539 
the series component will allow us to
iterate<00:03:29.870> through<00:03:30.109> this<00:03:30.320> list<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.859> 100<00:03:31.400> values

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
iterate through this list of 100 values

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.300 
iterate through this list of 100 values
now<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.660> series<00:03:32.840> component<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.560> essentially

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
now the series component is essentially

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.390 
now the series component is essentially
made<00:03:34.489> up<00:03:34.640> of<00:03:34.850> these<00:03:35.180> two<00:03:36.140> inputs<00:03:36.920> there<00:03:37.280> will

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
made up of these two inputs there will

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.970 
made up of these two inputs there will
be<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.519> starting<00:03:38.090> series<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.620> number<00:03:39.859> that

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
be a starting series so the number that

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.770 
be a starting series so the number that
we<00:03:40.100> start<00:03:40.400> at<00:03:40.519> in<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.760> list<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.209> this<00:03:41.299> case<00:03:41.359> the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
we start at in the list in this case the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.630 
we start at in the list in this case the
default<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.230> 0<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:43.190> we<00:03:43.280> start<00:03:43.519> at<00:03:43.549> the

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
default is 0 so we start at the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.130 
default is 0 so we start at the
beginning<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.180> list<00:03:44.299> of<00:03:44.480> vertices<00:03:44.630> and

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
beginning of the list of vertices and

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.280 
beginning of the list of vertices and
then<00:03:45.380> n<00:03:45.590> which<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.609> step<00:03:47.180> size<00:03:47.450> through

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
then n which is the step size through

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.800 
then n which is the step size through
the<00:03:48.410> list<00:03:48.620> let's<00:03:49.459> right<00:03:49.760> click<00:03:49.790> over<00:03:50.209> N<00:03:50.390> and

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
the list let's right click over N and

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.650 
the list let's right click over N and
set<00:03:51.109> this<00:03:51.380> step<00:03:51.890> size<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.430> be<00:03:52.549> 4<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.480> we'll

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
set this step size to be 4 so we'll

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.020 
set this step size to be 4 so we'll
start<00:03:53.930> at<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.200> first<00:03:54.440> vertices<00:03:55.100> in<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.760> list

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
start at the first vertices in the list

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.759 
start at the first vertices in the list
and<00:03:56.299> then<00:03:57.200> we'll<00:03:57.350> count<00:03:57.650> every<00:03:58.100> 4<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:59.650> you<00:04:00.650> can

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
and then we'll count every 4 and you can

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.559 
and then we'll count every 4 and you can
see<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.220> mouse<00:04:01.400> over<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.760> S<00:04:01.880> output<00:04:02.450> that

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
see if you mouse over the S output that

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.780 
see if you mouse over the S output that
that<00:04:02.750> will<00:04:02.900> be<00:04:03.049> 0<00:04:03.470> than<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:03.950> fourth<00:04:04.280> then<00:04:04.609> the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
that will be 0 than the fourth then the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.650 
that will be 0 than the fourth then the
8th<00:04:04.940> then<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.510> 12th<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:06.319> on<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:06.739> forth

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
8th then the 12th and so on and so forth

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.809 
8th then the 12th and so on and so forth
now<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.720> list<00:04:08.959> item<00:04:09.380> component<00:04:09.890> will<00:04:10.370> utilize

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
now the list item component will utilize

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.020 
now the list item component will utilize
this<00:04:11.420> series<00:04:11.920> component<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.069> that<00:04:13.100> will<00:04:13.910> be

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
this series component and that will be

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.719 
this series component and that will be
the<00:04:14.209> item<00:04:14.450> index<00:04:14.930> for<00:04:15.590> retrieving<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.489> list

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
the item index for retrieving a list

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.840 
the item index for retrieving a list
item<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:18.650> base<00:04:18.799> list<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.519> will<00:04:19.669> be

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
item and the base list that will be

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.840 
item and the base list that will be
sorting<00:04:20.660> through<00:04:20.810> will<00:04:21.769> again<00:04:22.010> come<00:04:22.280> from<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
sorting through will again come from the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.630 
sorting through will again come from the
full<00:04:23.810> list<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.169> vertices<00:04:24.349> and<00:04:24.860> if<00:04:25.400> you<00:04:25.490> mouse

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
full list of vertices and if you mouse

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.810 
full list of vertices and if you mouse
over<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:26.030> e<00:04:26.140> output<00:04:27.140> for<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.830> just<00:04:28.400> genera

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
over the e output for the just genera

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.090 
over the e output for the just genera
data<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.210> this<00:04:29.510> list<00:04:29.780> item<00:04:30.110> component<00:04:30.590> you<00:04:31.040> can

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
data of this list item component you can

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.000 
data of this list item component you can
see<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.460> there<00:04:31.580> are<00:04:31.670> 25<00:04:32.150> values<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.780> find

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
see that there are 25 values to find

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.370 
see that there are 25 values to find
versus<00:04:34.010> our<00:04:34.250> starting<00:04:34.990> number<00:04:35.990> of<00:04:36.110> 100

versus our starting number of 100
vertices<00:04:37.310> now<00:04:38.210> that's<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.510> hard<00:04:38.690> part

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110

preview for the explode component and
now<00:05:36.500> we<00:05:36.560> have<00:05:37.000> 25<00:05:38.000> vertices<00:05:38.810> in<00:05:39.020> each<00:05:39.230> one<00:05:39.470> of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
now we have 25 vertices in each one of

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.160 
now we have 25 vertices in each one of
these<00:05:39.680> list<00:05:40.160> item<00:05:40.430> components<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.180> we<00:05:41.960> can

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
these list item components and we can

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.430 
these list item components and we can
use<00:05:42.410> these<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.950> define<00:05:43.340> our<00:05:44.260> triangles<00:05:45.260> and

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
use these to define our triangles and

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.280 
use these to define our triangles and
we'll<00:05:46.040> do<00:05:46.190> that<00:05:46.370> from<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.700> surface<00:05:47.060> tab<00:05:47.300> in

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
we'll do that from the surface tab in

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.710 
we'll do that from the surface tab in
the<00:05:48.800> freeform<00:05:49.190> section<00:05:49.640> choose<00:05:50.030> for<00:05:50.420> point

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
the freeform section choose for point

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.860 
the freeform section choose for point
surface<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:53.210> we're<00:05:53.330> actually<00:05:53.450> going<00:05:53.690> to<00:05:53.780> need

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
surface and we're actually going to need

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.420 
surface and we're actually going to need
two<00:05:54.050> of<00:05:54.080> these<00:05:54.290> so<00:05:54.830> I'll<00:05:54.890> grab<00:05:55.040> another<00:05:55.310> one

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
two of these so I'll grab another one

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.600 
two of these so I'll grab another one
and<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:57.350> four<00:05:57.530> point<00:05:57.740> surface<00:05:58.070> component

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
and the four point surface component

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.940 
and the four point surface component
will<00:05:58.880> actually<00:05:59.390> make<00:05:59.540> a<00:05:59.570> surface<00:06:00.050> with<00:06:00.470> just

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
will actually make a surface with just

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.480 
will actually make a surface with just
three<00:06:01.220> points<00:06:01.780> so<00:06:02.780> there's<00:06:03.080> one<00:06:03.860> half<00:06:04.130> of<00:06:04.370> our

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
three points so there's one half of our

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.830 
three points so there's one half of our
triangle<00:06:04.940> system<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.880> I'll<00:06:07.880> skip<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.420> second

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
triangle system and I'll skip the second

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.120 
triangle system and I'll skip the second
list<00:06:09.290> item<00:06:09.590> component<00:06:10.100> to<00:06:10.610> create<00:06:12.010> the<00:06:13.010> other

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
list item component to create the other

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.360 
list item component to create the other
half<00:06:13.400> of<00:06:13.490> our<00:06:13.580> triangle<00:06:13.940> system<00:06:15.310> now<00:06:16.310> the

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
half of our triangle system now the

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.790 
half of our triangle system now the
really<00:06:16.550> beautiful<00:06:16.760> part<00:06:17.210> about<00:06:17.270> this<00:06:17.600> is<00:06:17.810> that

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
really beautiful part about this is that

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.210 
really beautiful part about this is that
this<00:06:19.400> is<00:06:19.580> all<00:06:19.760> built<00:06:20.240> off<00:06:20.420> of<00:06:20.510> the<00:06:21.470> two<00:06:21.980> initial

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
this is all built off of the two initial

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.460 
this is all built off of the two initial
curves<00:06:22.670> that<00:06:22.850> we<00:06:22.910> drew<00:06:23.180> in<00:06:23.450> Rhino<00:06:23.720> so<00:06:24.350> any

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
curves that we drew in Rhino so any

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.790 
curves that we drew in Rhino so any
changes<00:06:25.010> to<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:25.580> control<00:06:26.030> points<00:06:26.450> or

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
changes to the control points or

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
position of these curves in Rhino will

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.100 
position of these curves in Rhino will
update<00:06:30.260> through<00:06:31.180> our<00:06:32.180> definition<00:06:32.990> and

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
update through our definition and

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.040 
update through our definition and
grasshopper<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:34.060> if<00:06:35.060> we<00:06:35.180> go<00:06:35.300> back<00:06:35.330> to<00:06:35.840> the

beginning of the grasshopper definition

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.690 
beginning of the grasshopper definition
we<00:06:38.840> can<00:06:39.020> also<00:06:39.140> change<00:06:39.560> the<00:06:39.980> number<00:06:40.669> of

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
we can also change the number of

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.890 
we can also change the number of
divisions<00:06:41.300> in<00:06:41.540> our<00:06:41.870> divide<00:06:42.200> interval<00:06:42.590> to

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
divisions in our divide interval to

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.920 
divisions in our divide interval to
component<00:06:43.490> to<00:06:44.490> make<00:06:44.669> more<00:06:44.910> triangles<00:06:45.449> on<00:06:45.630> our

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
component to make more triangles on our

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.800 
component to make more triangles on our
freeform<00:06:46.350> surface<00:06:47.000> and<00:06:48.000> you<00:06:48.270> could<00:06:48.389> save<00:06:48.630> this

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
freeform surface and you could save this

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.590 
freeform surface and you could save this
definition<00:06:49.380> out<00:06:49.530> and<00:06:49.740> reference<00:06:50.220> any<00:06:50.600> surface

definition out and reference any surface
in<00:06:51.840> Rhino<00:06:52.110> and<00:06:52.410> it<00:06:52.560> would<00:06:52.650> automatically

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
in Rhino and it would automatically

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.909 
in Rhino and it would automatically
create<00:06:54.090> the<00:06:54.300> triangular<00:06:54.960> panel<00:06:55.320> system<00:06:55.680> on
