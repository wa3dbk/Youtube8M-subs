when<00:00:18.960> you're<00:00:19.080> harvesting<00:00:19.260> your<00:00:19.680> plums<00:00:19.980> make

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
when you're harvesting your plums make

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.400 
when you're harvesting your plums make
sure<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.789> they're<00:00:21.000> fully<00:00:21.210> ripe<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:22.199> when

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
sure that they're fully ripe so when

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.230 
sure that they're fully ripe so when
they're<00:00:22.560> really<00:00:22.859> dark<00:00:23.130> purple<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.029> kind

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
they're really dark purple and they kind

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
they're really dark purple and they kind
of<00:00:24.269> are<00:00:24.570> soft<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> outside<00:00:25.800> they're<00:00:26.130> ready

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
of are soft on the outside they're ready

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.880 
of are soft on the outside they're ready
to<00:00:26.550> harvest<00:00:26.760> if<00:00:27.599> they're<00:00:27.810> still<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.439> hard

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
to harvest if they're still really hard

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.269 
to harvest if they're still really hard
or<00:00:29.250> green<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.480> sometimes<00:00:31.050> even<00:00:31.199> red<00:00:31.590> still<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
or green or sometimes even red still and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.549 
or green or sometimes even red still and
they're<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.300> feeling<00:00:33.630> soft<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> touch

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
they're not feeling soft to the touch

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.160 
they're not feeling soft to the touch
like<00:00:34.770> an<00:00:35.130> eraser<00:00:35.790> would<00:00:36.000> feel<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.989> they're

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
like an eraser would feel then they're

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
like an eraser would feel then they're
probably<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.590> ready<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.160> harvest<00:00:38.340> yet<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
probably not ready to harvest yet and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.850 
probably not ready to harvest yet and
you<00:00:39.840> don't<00:00:40.020> want<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.290> pick<00:00:40.469> them<00:00:40.620> when<00:00:40.649> they're

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you don't want to pick them when they're

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.680 
you don't want to pick them when they're
too<00:00:41.100> green<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> lot<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.239> times<00:00:42.450> they

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
too green because a lot of times they

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.100 
too green because a lot of times they
will<00:00:42.930> never<00:00:43.260> totally<00:00:43.920> ripen<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.510> I've

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
will never totally ripen up that I've

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.889 
will never totally ripen up that I've
found<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.730> plums<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.270> kind<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.629> fruit

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
found that the plums are kind of a fruit

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
found that the plums are kind of a fruit
that<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.620> need<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.070> pick<00:00:50.309> when<00:00:50.579> they're<00:00:50.730> ripe

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that you need to pick when they're ripe

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
that you need to pick when they're ripe
you<00:00:51.149> can't<00:00:51.420> pick<00:00:51.690> them<00:00:51.840> too<00:00:52.079> early<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
you can't pick them too early and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
you can't pick them too early and
there's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.430> lot<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.760> tricks<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.660> use

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
there's a lot of tricks that you can use

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.290 
there's a lot of tricks that you can use
to<00:00:55.140> harvest<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.980> probably<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.820> easiest

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
to harvest them and probably the easiest

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
to harvest them and probably the easiest
trick<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.899> I've<00:00:58.079> used<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> actually<00:00:58.980> pull

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
trick that I've used is to actually pull

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.510 
trick that I've used is to actually pull
the<00:00:59.489> branches<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:02.100> don't<00:01:02.280> actually

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the branches down so you don't actually

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.579 
the branches down so you don't actually
have<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> ladder<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> bottom

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
have to get a ladder for the bottom

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
have to get a ladder for the bottom
branches<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.489> pull<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.820> down<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
branches you can just pull them down it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
branches you can just pull them down it
doesn't<00:01:06.479> hurt<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.260> tree<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> pull<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.250> branch

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
doesn't hurt the tree to pull the branch

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
doesn't hurt the tree to pull the branch
down<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.689> grab<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.930> fruit<00:01:10.409> off

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
down a bit and then grab the fruit off

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.370 
down a bit and then grab the fruit off
of<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> branches<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.360> makes<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.260> easy

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of the branches it makes it really easy

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
of the branches it makes it really easy
to<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.280> way<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> taller

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to do it that way and for the taller

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.310 
to do it that way and for the taller
fruit<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.340> grab<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> ladder<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.810> always

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
fruit you can grab a ladder and always

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
fruit you can grab a ladder and always
make<00:01:19.530> sure<00:01:19.560> someone's<00:01:20.100> holding<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> bottom

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
make sure someone's holding the bottom

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.039 
make sure someone's holding the bottom
of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> ladder<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:21.570> you're<00:01:21.720> trying<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
of the ladder when you're trying to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
of the ladder when you're trying to
harvest<00:01:22.500> them<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.640> fall<00:01:23.850> over

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
harvest them because it can fall over

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.600 
harvest them because it can fall over
easily<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.689> become<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.200> dangerous<00:01:25.580> but<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
easily and become very dangerous but a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
easily and become very dangerous but a
group<00:01:26.880> effort<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.479> always<00:01:27.659> best<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.200> you're

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
group effort is always best when you're

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.530 
group effort is always best when you're
harvesting<00:01:28.590> plums<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.119> person<00:01:30.270> can't

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
harvesting plums so if one person can't

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.270 
harvesting plums so if one person can't
hold<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> branch<00:01:31.079> down<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.740> another<00:01:31.890> person

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
hold the branch down and another person

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
hold the branch down and another person
can<00:01:32.430> grab<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:33.210> someone<00:01:33.630> holds<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> ladder

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
can grab it or someone holds the ladder

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.670 
can grab it or someone holds the ladder
for<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.210> pull<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.680> plums

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
for you and then you can pull the plums

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.219 
for you and then you can pull the plums
off<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> tree<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.299> best<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
off the tree it's the best way to do it

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.539 
off the tree it's the best way to do it
because<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.619> never<00:01:40.799> want<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.070> fall<00:01:41.250> off<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
because you never want to fall off the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.149 
because you never want to fall off the
ladder<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.049> hold<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> tree

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
ladder and they do hold on to the tree

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.999 
ladder and they do hold on to the tree
quite<00:01:44.430> tightly<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:46.020> sure<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
quite tightly so make sure and kind of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.620 
quite tightly so make sure and kind of
pull<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.460> quickly<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> found

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
pull them quickly that's what I found

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
pull them quickly that's what I found
works<00:01:48.810> better<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.380> slowly<00:01:50.009> because

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
works better and then slowly because

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.499 
works better and then slowly because
then<00:01:50.490> they'll<00:01:50.610> pop<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.270> because

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
then they'll pop right out because

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.819 
then they'll pop right out because
sometimes<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> grab<00:01:52.470> onto<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
sometimes they kind of grab onto the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.249 
sometimes they kind of grab onto the
tree<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.159> they<00:01:53.250> won't<00:01:53.430> let<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.259> saying

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
tree and they won't let go so saying

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.770 
tree and they won't let go so saying
that<00:01:55.290> they're<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.369> easy<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.000> harvest<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that they're really easy to harvest and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.230 
that they're really easy to harvest and
they'll<00:01:58.469> last<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.189> quite<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> while<00:01:59.790> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
they'll last for quite a while and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.560 
they'll last for quite a while and
they're<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> great<00:02:00.990> fruit
