get one at a time so I can get the
correct<00:01:12.659> bolts<00:01:13.659> back<00:01:13.869> in<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.140> correct<00:01:14.350> place

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.749 

these<00:01:35.520> came<00:01:35.789> with<00:01:36.179> metal<00:01:37.020> gaskets<00:01:37.799> make<00:01:38.640> sure

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
these came with metal gaskets make sure

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.910 
these came with metal gaskets make sure
your<00:01:38.909> screw<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.179> one<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> spark<00:01:39.689> plug<00:01:39.920> now

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
your screw in one of the spark plug now

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
your screw in one of the spark plug now
we're<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.310> doing<00:01:41.670> anything<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> gap<00:01:42.569> we

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
we're not doing anything with the gap we

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.289 
we're not doing anything with the gap we
bought<00:01:43.229> these<00:01:43.409> plugs<00:01:43.770> specific<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.179> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
bought these plugs specific for this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.840 
bought these plugs specific for this
year<00:01:45.539> make<00:01:45.719> a<00:01:45.750> model<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.229> Saturn<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> gap

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
year make a model of Saturn so the gap

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.340 
year make a model of Saturn so the gap
should<00:01:48.149> already<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.390> preset<00:01:50.869> carefully<00:01:51.869> drop

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
should already be preset carefully drop

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:15.640 
should already be preset carefully drop
them<00:01:52.530> in

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.810 

now<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:17.100> clearly<00:02:17.280> codes<00:02:19.340> go<00:02:20.340> back<00:02:20.520> out<00:02:20.670> and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
now we can clearly codes go back out and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.180 
now we can clearly codes go back out and
drive<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> car<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.720> see<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.590> check<00:02:22.860> our<00:02:23.010> miss

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
drive the car and see and check our miss

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.680 
drive the car and see and check our miss
spot<00:02:23.400> counters<00:02:23.790> then<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.090> see<00:02:24.240> if<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.480> still

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
spot counters then to see if we still

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.450 
spot counters then to see if we still
have<00:02:24.810> any<00:02:24.990> misfires<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.710> then<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.310> can

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
have any misfires and then we can

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.400 
have any misfires and then we can
continue<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.910> diagnose<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.480> from<00:02:27.630> there<00:02:27.810> this

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
continue to diagnose it from there this

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.900 
continue to diagnose it from there this
is<00:02:28.590> something<00:02:28.710> we<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.310> needed<00:02:29.580> we<00:02:29.760> knew

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
is something we know it needed we knew

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.430 
is something we know it needed we knew
the<00:02:30.000> needed<00:02:30.330> plugs<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.080> valve<00:02:31.260> cover

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the needed plugs and the valve cover

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.320 
the needed plugs and the valve cover
gasket<00:02:31.950> once<00:02:32.100> again<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.370> was<00:02:32.460> allowing<00:02:32.940> oil<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
gasket once again it was allowing oil to

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.120 
gasket once again it was allowing oil to
link<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.600> top<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.050> plugs<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.770> took<00:02:34.950> care

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
link on top of the plugs so we took care

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.070 
link on top of the plugs so we took care
of<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> now<00:02:36.180> let's<00:02:36.360> see<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.570> we<00:02:36.630> didn't<00:02:36.960> fix

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
of that now let's see if we didn't fix

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.950 
of that now let's see if we didn't fix
the<00:02:37.170> problem<00:02:37.560> by<00:02:37.710> that
