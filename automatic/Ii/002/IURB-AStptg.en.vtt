00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello tankers models 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.359
 I want to share with you how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.990
 easy to make paper tracks 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.990
 armored models 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.880
 the way is suitable for those who make 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.560
 models according to the drawings proposed to be 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.520
 sin is not entirely accurate 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.370
 or out of paper so this is the case 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.450
 and on our own caterpillars we will 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:28.900
 make out thin cardboard this is a box for 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.240
 office paper would be in a box this cardboard we 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.030
 cut into strips the width of the strip should 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.070
 equal to the width of our future caterpillar 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.500
 it is important that the band passes 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.800
 perpendicular to the perforation of cardboard 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.150
 after which we master the top layer 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.400
 cardboard and we get 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.810
 Here is such an interesting imitating all tracks 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.070
 surface pieces of cardboard which are not 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.670
 very good from your 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.290
 when painting will imitate pieces 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.480
 take root what to add 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.310
 realism of our future 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.700
 will you come in 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:10.090
 using a binder glue T-shaped 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.280
 cardboard construction naturally her 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.690
 the length will be the length our future 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.830
 caterpillars wide 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 a little more when we are ready 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.110
 t-shaped design we fold it 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.110
 using scissors we cut the guides 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.800
 ridges 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.020
 then glue it all center 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.120
 guide mushroom picker in our center 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.730
 caterpillars cut off the excess wallpaper of the gods 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.530
 scissors 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.010
 ultimately we should succeed 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.560
 Here is such a wonderful caterpillar 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.340
 Naturally she will still not apologize 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.079
 will stick 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.620
 but general view you already 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.300
 estimate 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.580
 the top edge of the ridge guide i 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.260
 not specifically stained trying to achieve 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.880
 effect 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.160
 shiny metal from touching 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.990
 leading rinks sound do not know how much 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.990
 it turned out for the time being so leave 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.750
 future rink 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.800
 my future tank looks exactly 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.590
 that's how he did it 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.000
 such an adaptation by this 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.300
 fitting in stores 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.860
 electrical engineers screwed cartridges 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.770
 fixtures it consumables they care 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.370
 this is thrown away and for modeling very 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:39.450
 great thing is a steam skating rink 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.810
 billet but it can be made and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.460
 cappuccino lids 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.510
 now we 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.849
 this whole thing is compatible let's add it 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.519
 fantasy and see how beautiful it all 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:58.220
 will look after assembly and painting 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.220
 all good luck everyone
