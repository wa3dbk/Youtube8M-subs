00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.690
 hello i won't come stain or she 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.599
 subscribe to the channel 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.430
 I'm driving just three months the other day 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.860
 and could not park was afraid 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.310
 touch and take them with a picture 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.990
 please help in the picture can be seen 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.779
 how easy it is to imagine 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.570
 problems experienced drivers as an experienced 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.460
 chess player would say ruther easier here he is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.519
 the trouble but the ability to use 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.979
 like pedals driving feeling more or less 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.110
 dimensions of the car can not build 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.580
 chain of action 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.290
 program a novice driver like 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.900
 chess player a few steps forward 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.040
 turned first grader explain 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.860
 higher mathematics 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.710
 and if you start a female driver then 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.739
 there through the stars I personally parking 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.600
 car like a tag game we 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.119
 do some permutation movements 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.290
 back and forth third finally 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.290
 get on the spot in place 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.760
 and so before 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.650
 short stop to rate 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.930
 space is enough or not in place 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.030
 if you are approaching from behind or in front 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 cars then be warned 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.930
 turn on emergency gang 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.470
 certainly the point of movement on the rear bumper 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.900
 opposite the edge of the parking at curb level 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.380
 and also should pull over to a partner 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.660
 on right 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.860
 to leave on the left as possible 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.290
 more space 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.600
 when we drink back face goes 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.250
 precisely in this direction or as I usually 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.820
 telling my students 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.770
 the ability to be like a hooligan we do 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.020
 the first movement completely begged 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.240
 until we stop driving we do not aim 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.000
 call in from the first time she is against 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.220
 specially genius green car 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.910
 carefully not touching but close then on 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.700
 direct steering wheel 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.780
 from go ahead and here is the degeneration on 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.150
 direct steering wheel 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.000
 from driving forward but it is especially good 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.890
 remember all departures do direct 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.010
 steering wheel 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.110
 99 dc means it works correctly 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.180
 anyway worse from this never 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.430
 there will be now again back with 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.070
 turned off until it stops driving going to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 parallelism with a green car is not 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.600
 I will go into the ending in the end 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.050
 concurrency races since this 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.020
 there were previous lessons on my channel 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.090
 parking in reverse if click 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.300
 mentally given field then go to 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.530
 the lesson is not always granted GEL 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.990
 work the first time 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.580
 sometimes in particular every bush accounts 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.090
 perform more than one permutation 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.370
 or perhaps more and every time you need 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.530
 drive on coal and now 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.600
 many including my colleagues in one 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.060
 voice starts I need to correct 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.410
 go not with the direct wheel and unscrew 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.180
 I will allow two stops to the left 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.430
 twisted and left the wheel is not always there 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.260
 casting sometimes leads to bad 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.000
 the result 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.160
 see what happens in the car 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.400
 literally grinds to green 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.890
 because we have not settled the tail of the car from 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.680
 green we turn but a point 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.680
 tail and was near so remained in rows 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.819
 but driving off on a straight wheel ahead we 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.379
 we remove the tail from the green and we get 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.530
 quite reasonable result we don't 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.670
 stuck as they say learn geometry 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.670
 gentlemen instructors 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.420
 if we come from the other side then 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.930
 city actions are all the same 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.930
 mirror image 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.160
 but from such parks I would bring the hatch 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.230
 novice drivers but this is his particular 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.000
 hard-nosed in their area and persistent 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.160
 man then hello you take advantage 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.070
 the help of an experienced friend who is looking with 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.020
 parties will insure you not 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.590
 cares only to open the window 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.120
 and you ask him a friend's hint 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.950
 action who is such a dense affiliate you 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.800
 again must recognize all the same 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.300
 receptions 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.760
 as usual drove our rear 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.310
 bumper to the edge of our parking lot that is 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.110
 the side of someone else's car by the way last time 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.110
 we were guided by the curb 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.469
 and a little cottage ordinary go ahead 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.719
 since we will not be able in the next stage 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.759
 maximum work space for the wheel 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.710
 maneuver the muzzle of our car 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.069
 too little on the right 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.550
 a little wheel and that means for 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:18.370
 turning need more distance 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.819
 watch your left and right 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.770
 front corner of your car and then 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:28.389
 also behind other cars behind 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.910
 the assistant should help you with this 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.539
 further forward on the steering wheel and back 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.539
 its twisted 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.660
 maybe several times 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.770
 and if suddenly in the end you were in 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.979
 in such a situation, you will have to build a lesson 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.139
 parking and adjustment can be clicked 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.139
 mouse in this field and drag it 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:13.300
 and if this is so angled then the lesson 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:16.770
 reverse parking part 3 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.770
 click and go 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.879
 Well, something like that from the flesh important 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.669
 questions and put likes 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.030
 finger up yes those who do not know such 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.150
 gesture 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.740
 really helps the channel on this all i 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.900
 Sergey Maxim 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.900
 say goodbye take care of yourself
