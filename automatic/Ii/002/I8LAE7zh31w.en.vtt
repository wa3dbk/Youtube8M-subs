 can start easy running in place for 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.330
 order to raise our pulse and

 lunge forecast ki we can do them 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.190
 small amplitude at the beginning of the workout 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.770
 and if you want to increase the load at the end 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.230
 workout we increase the amplitude it 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.930

 load hands with gamma and remove hands with 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.930
 belt and start doing a deeper 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.520
 movement is called exercise 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.770
 drop out postings

 and all our affairs every time we jump all 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.880
 try to keep the angle in 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.850
 knee joint 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.100
 90 degrees our knee cannot 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.650
 this situation will come forward 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.040
 equally dangerous if you already do 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.980
 long 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.560
 you can go deeper but bring 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.970
 the amplitude of your knee joints we 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.549
 you go to the next exercise 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.590
 which is called step step 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.590
 diagonal lunge this exercise 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.890
 will allow us not only save increase 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.440
 pulse but also well strengthen the muscles of the legs 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.739
 inner thigh muscle 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.930
 belly and the whole body well, well we 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.360
 ready to try the same way starting 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.370
 this movement is in small amplitude 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.349
 move side step in one 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.540
 side take a step back 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.670
 stepwise the other way again 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.829
 take a step back and increase the pace 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.260
 increase the amplitude with mice and if you 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.489
 ready to load more adds 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.280
 diagonal you are padme 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.030
 bend the front leg in the knee distant 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.190
 set back diagonally to better 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.680
 engage your abdominal muscles we are 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.989
 lowering the hand and adding they said no 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.940
 such work in this from 20 seconds to 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.560
 minutes 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.389
 calculate your load level 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.460
 preparation 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.080
 the next exercise is called solid 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.000
 it came to us from the functional 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.639
 training called crossfit 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.120
 perfectly strengthens abdominal muscles 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:40.349
 press the muscles of the arms and legs start again 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.300
 more simple option we go down 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.880
 kneecap glass goose 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.580
 make a jump on gas goes out of position 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.419
 the strap on the cap wove over art not 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.150
 bends 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.270
 make sure that there is no deflection 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.840
 big crown from this position we 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.840
 again we tighten our legs with a leap and 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.840
 rise 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:10.740
 these movements together are two times three and become 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:13.169
 1 2 1 more to increase the load in 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.639
 this exercise we can raise our hands and 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:22.919
 add cotton and try plant 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:31.259
 up cotton down flank up also 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:33.930
 you can add a jump light from given 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.660
 exercise can be done on the back to 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.910
 20 reps if you are just starting

 train by yourself or in a club 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.810
 take the least amount 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.690
 repetitions 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.419
 5 of the consequences increase the amount 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.940
 reps and u feel how 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.139
 strengthened your muscles and cardiorespiratory 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.509
 systems 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.729
 the next exercise is called 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:59.550
 diagonal jumps she develops well 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.830
 obliques on the skins and the general 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.789
 hardy but not starting to work 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.580
 large amplitude 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.620
 the body is straight and the legs move in one and 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.849
 the other side and gradually we 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.009
 increase the amplitude 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.409
 hold the body straight figure out how 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.719
 contracted oblique muscles then to the right 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:18.419
 happy with this exercise we 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:19.199
 can perfectly increase our agility and 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.270
 endurance 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:24.030
 the next exercise is jumping to the side 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.340
 together with the hands very well develops 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.250
 arm muscles let's break it down first 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.050
 arm movements are straight arms directed to 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.630
 imagine what you are holding 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.849
 after flowing kilogram dumbbells in 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.219
 each arm has strong straight arms 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.560
 send up and back to the side 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:41.159
 add to this movement jumps from 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.360
 parties 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:46.310
 time for 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.969
 42 can also mobilize the amplitude 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.870
 capital 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:53.210
 sharing the syllables of the position and strengthen 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.789
 simultaneously the muscles of the legs and muscles 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:59.090
 it is important not to lay out the holder strong 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:01.180
 fog and today we sorted out 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.069
 complex of 5 small exercises 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.919
 which effectively develop all a 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:10.340
 major muscle groups of our body is 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:12.889
 leg muscles muscles of the muscles of the arms and muscles 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.169
