a<00:02:58.910> heavy<00:02:59.269> day<00:02:59.510> or<00:02:59.660> two<00:02:59.870> who<00:03:00.530> are<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:00.799> kind<00:03:01.069> of

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
a heavy day or two who are it's kind of

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.059 
a heavy day or two who are it's kind of
you<00:03:01.940> know<00:03:01.970> reset<00:03:02.660> confuse<00:03:03.230> your<00:03:03.380> body<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.890> get

you know reset confuse your body and get

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.509 
you know reset confuse your body and get
yourself<00:03:04.400> back<00:03:04.819> into<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.180> groove<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.510> things

yourself back into the groove of things

yourself back into the groove of things
so<00:03:07.519> more<00:03:08.480> towards<00:03:09.170> volume<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.799> arms<00:03:10.310> it's<00:03:10.549> this

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
so more towards volume on arms it's this

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.880 
so more towards volume on arms it's this
doesn't<00:03:11.239> mean<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.510> it's<00:03:11.930> fact<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.650> you

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
doesn't mean that it's fact that you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.949 
doesn't mean that it's fact that you
know<00:03:12.920> arms<00:03:13.459> need<00:03:13.640> volume<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.269> grow<00:03:14.540> some

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959

people<00:03:15.260> grow<00:03:15.500> great<00:03:15.890> by<00:03:16.130> doing<00:03:16.519> just<00:03:16.790> heavy

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
people grow great by doing just heavy

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.990 
people grow great by doing just heavy
work<00:03:17.870> um<00:03:18.170> if<00:03:19.100> they<00:03:19.220> don't<00:03:19.430> necessarily

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
work um if they don't necessarily

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.960 
work um if they don't necessarily
believe<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.329> volume<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.350> just<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.680> I

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
believe in volume it's just that I

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.370 
believe in volume it's just that I
personally<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.420> found<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:25.239> typically

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
personally have found that typically

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.860 
personally have found that typically
more<00:03:27.380> volume<00:03:27.920> leads<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.910> more<00:03:29.180> growth<00:03:29.540> in<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
more volume leads to more growth in the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.680 
more volume leads to more growth in the
arms<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:31.640> last<00:03:31.819> piece<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.000> advice<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.299> want<00:03:32.540> off

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
you guys is to stop training arms once a

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.129 
you guys is to stop training arms once a
week<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:38.780> know<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.019> need<00:03:39.470> more<00:03:40.280> stimulation

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
week you know you need more stimulation

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.509 
week you know you need more stimulation
for<00:03:42.139> a<00:03:42.200> body<00:03:42.440> part<00:03:42.709> if<00:03:42.889> you<00:03:42.950> want<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.370> grow

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
after training once a week maybe try

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.710 
after training once a week maybe try
training<00:03:48.530> them<00:03:48.650> twice<00:03:49.000> every<00:03:50.000> three<00:03:50.420> days<00:03:50.660> you

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
training them twice every three days you

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.650 
training them twice every three days you
know<00:03:51.139> I'll<00:03:51.920> tell<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.250> right<00:03:52.280> now<00:03:52.430> um<00:03:52.970> what<00:03:53.630> I

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
really pointed out arms is my weak point

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.879 
really pointed out arms is my weak point
about<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.000> year<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.930> half<00:03:57.170> ago<00:03:57.380> maybe<00:03:57.799> a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
that you don't like it and you go back

to your other style of training I cannot
emphasize<00:04:32.190> enough<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.940> smaller<00:04:33.480> muscle

guys only you know work once a week
maybe<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:43.050> reason<00:04:43.230> why<00:04:43.500> they're<00:04:43.650> not<00:04:43.800> growing

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
maybe the reason why they're not growing

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.560 
maybe the reason why they're not growing
why<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.430> see<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.670> lot<00:04:44.730> of<00:04:44.850> people<00:04:45.060> with<00:04:45.360> you

why you see a lot of people with you

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.720 
why you see a lot of people with you
know<00:04:45.660> maybe<00:04:45.930> big<00:04:46.320> quads<00:04:46.740> but<00:04:47.160> small<00:04:47.400> calves

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
these muscle groups need to be worked

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.020 
these muscle groups need to be worked
continuously<00:04:52.800> they're<00:04:53.610> not<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:54.000> same<00:04:54.030> as

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
continuously they're not the same as

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
hamstrings not to seem as you know back

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.650 
hamstrings not to seem as you know back
and<00:04:58.800> chest<00:04:59.160> but<00:04:59.430> you<00:04:59.520> need<00:04:59.850> longer<00:05:00.180> time<00:05:00.450> to

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
and chest but you need longer time to

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.950 
and chest but you need longer time to
recover<00:05:01.370> these<00:05:02.370> muscles<00:05:02.880> are<00:05:03.090> more<00:05:03.450> function

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
recover these muscles are more function

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.640 
recover these muscles are more function
muscles<00:05:04.320> where<00:05:04.470> they're<00:05:04.620> used<00:05:05.000> every<00:05:06.000> day<00:05:06.270> in

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
to wear these muscles were used every

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.159 
to wear these muscles were used every
day<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.340> they<00:05:17.340> will<00:05:17.550> grow<00:05:17.940> on<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.950> same<00:05:20.400> path

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
day and they will grow on that same path

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.750 
day and they will grow on that same path
typically<00:05:22.169> every<00:05:22.350> day<00:05:22.740> because<00:05:23.550> they<00:05:23.640> are

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
typically every day because they are

sustaining<00:05:33.600> balance<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.830> know<00:05:34.950> we<00:05:35.160> come<00:05:35.400> from

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
sustaining balance you know we come from

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.520 
sustaining balance you know we come from
cavemen<00:05:36.270> our<00:05:36.510> body<00:05:36.840> has<00:05:37.260> evolved<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.220> adapted

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
cavemen our body has evolved and adapted

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.130 
cavemen our body has evolved and adapted
from<00:05:40.530> our<00:05:40.770> ancestors<00:05:41.630> so<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.690> kind<00:05:42.960> of<00:05:43.080> have

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
from our ancestors so you kind of have

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.520 
from our ancestors so you kind of have
to<00:05:43.260> go<00:05:43.530> back<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:44.010> think<00:05:44.810> where<00:05:45.810> we<00:05:45.960> originated

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
to go back and think where we originated

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.710 
to go back and think where we originated
from<00:05:46.560> and<00:05:47.160> how<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.669> train<00:05:49.100> so<00:05:50.100> in<00:05:50.700> AD<00:05:51.060> stimulus

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
from and how to train so in AD stimulus

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.840 
from and how to train so in AD stimulus
to<00:05:52.020> where<00:05:52.440> your<00:05:53.370> body<00:05:53.640> will<00:05:54.710> evolve<00:05:55.850> once

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
to where your body will evolve once

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.300 
to where your body will evolve once
again<00:05:56.940> guys<00:05:57.210> these<00:05:57.690> are<00:05:57.750> just<00:05:57.990> ideas<00:05:58.250> just<00:05:59.250> a

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
couple of things that I've used to

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.670 
couple of things that I've used to
really<00:06:01.979> pack<00:06:02.190> on<00:06:02.400> some<00:06:02.610> arm<00:06:02.850> sighs<00:06:03.090> um<00:06:03.680> you

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
really pack on some arm sighs um you

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.790 
really pack on some arm sighs um you
know<00:06:04.800> it's<00:06:05.729> just<00:06:05.880> advice<00:06:06.560> just<00:06:07.560> thought<00:06:07.770> that

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
on how I grew my arms um because I think

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.010 
on how I grew my arms um because I think
I<00:06:13.080> may<00:06:13.380> even<00:06:13.440> go<00:06:13.740> finger<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:14.669> about<00:06:15.030> growing

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
I may even go finger to about growing

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.010 
I may even go finger to about growing
some<00:06:16.169> arm<00:06:16.410> so<00:06:16.860> that's<00:06:17.669> it<00:06:17.880> guys<00:06:17.910> thanks<00:06:18.840> again
