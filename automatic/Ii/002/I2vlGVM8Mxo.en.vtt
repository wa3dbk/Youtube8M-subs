00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
world is this so I googled it of course

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.790 
world is this so I googled it of course
a<00:00:26.699> YouTube<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.930> was<00:00:28.019> basically<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.560> had

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
a YouTube and it was basically I had

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.849 
a YouTube and it was basically I had
knowledge<00:00:28.980> pores<00:00:29.849> then<00:00:30.660> ports<00:00:31.349> are<00:00:31.470> basically

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
knowledge pores then ports are basically

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.850 
knowledge pores then ports are basically
because<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.930> dirt<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> oil

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
because there was a lot of dirt and oil

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920 
because there was a lot of dirt and oil
in<00:00:34.980> my<00:00:35.100> face<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.969> basically<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> get<00:00:36.719> large

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
in my face and basically you get large

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990 
in my face and basically you get large
pores<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.469> there's<00:00:37.620> an<00:00:37.770> over<00:00:38.070> load<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.820> oil

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
pores when there's an over load of oil

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.209 
pores when there's an over load of oil
and<00:00:39.480> your<00:00:39.600> pores<00:00:39.840> actually<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.440> expands<00:00:40.920> so

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and your pores actually just expands so

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.440 
and your pores actually just expands so
you<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.460> need<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.850> thoroughly<00:00:42.239> clean

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
you just need them I thoroughly clean

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.470 
you just need them I thoroughly clean
your<00:00:42.480> face<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.989> order<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.480> would

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
your face in order to get it all I would

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.790 
your face in order to get it all I would
have<00:00:45.750> bought<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> few<00:00:46.200> different<00:00:46.710> items

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
have bought a few different items

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
have bought a few different items
because<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.670> didn't<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> look<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
because I just didn't like the look of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.380 
because I just didn't like the look of
large<00:00:48.809> pores<00:00:49.110> they're<00:00:49.800> they're<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:50.789> too<00:00:51.090> bad

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
large pores they're they're not too bad

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.200 
large pores they're they're not too bad
I<00:00:51.809> mean<00:00:52.140> there's<00:00:52.350> basically<00:00:52.710> dirty<00:00:53.039> skin<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I mean there's basically dirty skin so I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
I mean there's basically dirty skin so I
I<00:00:54.920> didn't<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.160> keep<00:00:56.309> them<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> long

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
I didn't want to keep them for a long

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.069 
I didn't want to keep them for a long
time<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.120> they<00:00:57.270> said<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> don't

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
time because they said that if you don't

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
time because they said that if you don't
clean<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.350> face<00:00:58.620> thoroughly<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.190> minimize

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
clean your face thoroughly to minimize

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.459 
clean your face thoroughly to minimize
your<00:00:59.760> pores<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.480> will<00:01:00.690> continue<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> stay

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
your pores they will continue to stay

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.139 
your pores they will continue to stay
that<00:01:01.620> way<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.250> that's<00:01:02.760> how<00:01:02.910> when<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
that way and I think that's how when you

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
that way and I think that's how when you
get<00:01:03.300> older<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.840> those<00:01:04.229> big<00:01:04.470> pores<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
get older you have those big pores in

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.289 
get older you have those big pores in
your<00:01:05.100> face<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.119> weren't

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
your face and they just weren't

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.420 
your face and they just weren't
physically<00:01:06.780> appealing<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.740> did<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.310> the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
make sure you're not too dry that will

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.200

dry<00:04:38.680> your<00:04:38.830> skin<00:04:38.860> out<00:04:39.100> cause<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.970> peel

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
dry your skin out cause you to peel

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.020 
dry your skin out cause you to peel
especially<00:04:41.020> in<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.200> Sun<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:42.100> got<00:04:42.669> something

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
especially in the Sun I got something

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.880 
especially in the Sun I got something
that<00:04:43.120> has<00:04:43.270> SPF<00:04:43.479> 15<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:44.200> think<00:04:44.320> I<00:04:44.680> probably

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
that has SPF 15 I think I probably

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.710 
that has SPF 15 I think I probably
increase<00:04:45.370> this<00:04:45.550> because<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.060> is<00:04:46.210> getting

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
increase this because it is getting

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.750 
increase this because it is getting
hotter<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.590> Sun<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:47.979> out<00:04:48.100> longer<00:04:48.520> and

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
it's just a lot on my skin and I don't

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.640 
it's just a lot on my skin and I don't

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
want it to wear and tear but this is a

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.710 
want it to wear and tear but this is a
good<00:04:53.860> moisturizer<00:04:54.070> with<00:04:54.580> moisturizer<00:04:55.419> it's

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
good moisturizer with moisturizer it's

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.080

that cuz one day I actually went to make
my<00:06:46.500> nose<00:06:46.680> and<00:06:47.070> there<00:06:47.160> was<00:06:47.280> like<00:06:47.370> a<00:06:47.460> lot<00:06:47.610> of<00:06:47.670> oil

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
and from then on this whole section here

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.850 
and from then on this whole section here
was<00:06:50.310> just<00:06:50.490> like<00:06:50.720> large<00:06:51.720> it<00:06:52.170> was<00:06:52.290> still<00:06:52.560> very

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.980 
was just like large it was still very
very<00:06:53.070> ugly<00:06:53.550> I<00:06:53.820> didn't<00:06:54.120> like<00:06:54.270> it<00:06:54.420> at<00:06:54.510> all

know<00:06:56.250> that<00:06:56.550> this<00:06:56.700> is<00:06:56.880> something<00:06:57.030> now<00:06:57.300> probably

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
know that this is something now probably

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.330 
know that this is something now probably
beginning<00:06:58.170> just<00:06:58.440> because<00:06:58.680> I'm<00:06:58.800> getting<00:06:59.010> older

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
like once a week once every two weeks if

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.390 
like once a week once every two weeks if
I<00:07:10.050> notice<00:07:10.260> that<00:07:10.500> this<00:07:10.650> is<00:07:10.830> getting<00:07:11.070> more<00:07:11.190> any

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
I notice that this is getting more any

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.930 
I notice that this is getting more any
worse<00:07:11.670> but<00:07:12.650> again<00:07:13.650> google<00:07:13.950> it<00:07:14.100> you<00:07:14.760> can

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
worse but again google it you can

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.200 
worse but again google it you can
YouTube<00:07:15.270> it<00:07:15.510> but<00:07:16.080> pores<00:07:16.470> aren't<00:07:17.130> pretty<00:07:17.340> and

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
YouTube it but pores aren't pretty and

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.180 
YouTube it but pores aren't pretty and
this<00:07:18.540> I<00:07:18.780> actually<00:07:19.140> improved<00:07:19.710> then<00:07:19.860> it<00:07:19.980> did

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
this I actually improved then it did

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.800 
this I actually improved then it did
work<00:07:20.430> and<00:07:20.760> just<00:07:21.120> looks<00:07:21.360> just<00:07:21.450> like<00:07:21.570> a<00:07:21.690> whole

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
work and just looks just like a whole

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.270 
work and just looks just like a whole
bunch<00:07:22.020> of<00:07:22.110> trial<00:07:22.350> and<00:07:22.500> error<00:07:22.620> so<00:07:22.980> it<00:07:23.100> might<00:07:23.220> be

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 
bunch of trial and error so it might be

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.670 
bunch of trial and error so it might be
some<00:07:23.610> other<00:07:23.700> shortcut<00:07:24.690> ways<00:07:24.900> and<00:07:25.170> if<00:07:25.260> so<00:07:25.440> then

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
some other shortcut ways and if so then

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.150 
some other shortcut ways and if so then
