00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
as you can see he had a really good

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.380 
as you can see he had a really good
attacking<00:02:29.620> for<00:02:30.010> something<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.580> six<00:02:31.060> goals

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
attacking for something like six goals

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.180 
attacking for something like six goals
in<00:02:31.629> five<00:02:31.900> games<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.590> price<00:02:32.890> difference

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
in five games but the price difference

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.759 
in five games but the price difference
is<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.519> major<00:02:33.879> factor<00:02:34.299> with<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.840> card<00:02:35.110> even

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
is a major factor with this card even

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.440 
is a major factor with this card even
though<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:35.920> believe<00:02:36.220> all<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.819> this<00:02:36.940> stats<00:02:37.299> are

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
though I believe all of this stats are

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.059 
though I believe all of this stats are
going<00:02:37.569> up<00:02:37.629> my<00:02:37.750> main<00:02:37.930> mistake<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.650> naturally

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
going up my main mistake and naturally

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.650 
going up my main mistake and naturally
drawn<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.579> rolling<00:02:39.909> on<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> screen<00:02:40.390> but

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
drawn it rolling on the screen but

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.449 
drawn it rolling on the screen but
either<00:02:40.810> way<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.410> believe<00:02:41.829> that<00:02:42.069> these<00:02:42.129> stats

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
either way I believe that these stats

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.699 
either way I believe that these stats
may<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:43.030> gone<00:02:43.209> up<00:02:43.360> all<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.900> them<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:44.560> when

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
may have gone up all of them so when

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.110 
may have gone up all of them so when
against<00:02:44.950> them<00:02:45.160> gameplay<00:02:45.610> now<00:02:45.819> with<00:02:46.000> it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
against them gameplay now with it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.270 
against them gameplay now with it
obviously<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.660> see<00:02:46.930> he<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.379> clinical

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
obviously you can see he is a clinical

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.569 
obviously you can see he is a clinical
