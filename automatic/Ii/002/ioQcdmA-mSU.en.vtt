00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
unboxing because we already opened it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.380 
unboxing because we already opened it
and<00:00:30.200> activated<00:00:30.770> it<00:00:30.860> but<00:00:31.160> you<00:00:31.789> know<00:00:31.910> same

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390

iPhone so just give you a little example

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.030 
iPhone so just give you a little example
that<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.680> will<00:04:09.920> call<00:04:10.239> Apple<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:11.950> while<00:04:12.950> I'm

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
that I will call Apple and while I'm

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.680 
that I will call Apple and while I'm
doing<00:04:13.100> that<00:04:13.370> let's<00:04:14.060> see<00:04:14.270> go<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.690> web

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
doing that let's see go to the web

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.770 
doing that let's see go to the web
cellular<00:04:17.690> data<00:04:17.870> connections<00:04:19.450> are<00:04:20.450> not

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
cellular data connections are not

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.810 
cellular data connections are not
available<00:04:21.020> during<00:04:21.350> this<00:04:21.500> call<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:22.100> keep<00:04:22.730> that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
available during this call so keep that

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.550 
available during this call so keep that
in<00:04:22.880> mind<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.480> probably<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.320> one

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
in mind that is probably the one

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.760 
in mind that is probably the one
advantage<00:04:25.040> 18d<00:04:25.669> has<00:04:25.880> over<00:04:26.440> Verizon<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.590> that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
advantage 18d has over Verizon is that

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.000 
advantage 18d has over Verizon is that
sensitive<00:04:28.130> GSM<00:04:28.640> carrier<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.510> do

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
sensitive GSM carrier you can do

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.029 
sensitive GSM carrier you can do
simultaneous<00:04:31.010> voice<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.430> data

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
simultaneous voice and data

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.200 
simultaneous voice and data
okay<00:04:32.309> now<00:04:32.460> probably<00:04:32.789> one<00:04:32.909> of<00:04:32.939> the<00:04:33.089> reasons

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
okay now probably one of the reasons

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.879 
okay now probably one of the reasons
this<00:04:33.539> Verizon<00:04:34.020> iPhone<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.439> still<00:04:34.589> highly

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
this Verizon iPhone is still highly

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.129 
this Verizon iPhone is still highly
anticipated<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:36.479> redesign<00:04:36.839> of<00:04:36.990> the

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
anticipated is the redesign of the

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.420 
anticipated is the redesign of the
antenna<00:04:37.439> system<00:04:37.860> which<00:04:38.009> should<00:04:38.189> hopefully

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
antenna system which should hopefully

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.609 
antenna system which should hopefully
help<00:04:38.849> with<00:04:39.029> the<00:04:39.119> death<00:04:39.300> grip<00:04:39.479> issue<00:04:39.719> so<00:04:40.379> just

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:40.619 
help with the death grip issue so just

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:42.739 
help with the death grip issue so just
to<00:04:40.740> give<00:04:41.520> an<00:04:41.610> example<00:04:41.909> of<00:04:42.119> what<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.719> I

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:42.749 
to give an example of what that is I

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:50.869 
to give an example of what that is I
will<00:04:43.229> call<00:04:44.509> Apple<00:04:46.849> and<00:04:49.189> we'll<00:04:50.189> see<00:04:50.430> if<00:04:50.520> we<00:04:50.669> can

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
will call Apple and we'll see if we can

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.730 
will call Apple and we'll see if we can
get<00:04:51.439> my<00:04:52.439> phone<00:04:53.159> to<00:04:53.430> drop<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:53.879> call<00:04:54.680> now<00:04:55.680> you

get my phone to drop the call now you
you<00:04:56.189> initiate<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.639> death<00:04:56.849> grip<00:04:57.029> by<00:04:57.240> covering

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
you initiate the death grip by covering

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.049 
you initiate the death grip by covering
up<00:04:57.779> the<00:04:57.960> bottom<00:04:58.379> left<00:04:58.680> corner<00:04:58.979> where<00:04:59.909> the

antenna strip is okay well it seems to
be<00:05:03.449> holding<00:05:03.599> onto<00:05:03.839> the<00:05:03.990> call<00:05:04.169> which<00:05:04.439> is<00:05:04.620> good

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
of the bottom left corner the signal

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.689 
of the bottom left corner the signal
starts<00:05:20.669> to<00:05:20.759> come<00:05:20.939> back<00:05:23.479> there<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:25.580> let's<00:05:26.580> do

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
starts to come back there and let's do

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:36.820 
starts to come back there and let's do
the<00:05:26.819> same<00:05:26.999> on<00:05:27.209> the<00:05:27.360> Verizon<00:05:27.959> iPhone

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.800 

callin<00:05:37.830> up<00:05:37.980> will<00:05:38.250> cover<00:05:39.150> up<00:05:39.300> this<00:05:39.450> bottom

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
callin up will cover up this bottom

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:50.269 
callin up will cover up this bottom
left-hand<00:05:40.110> corner

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.369 

now<00:05:51.209> we<00:05:51.269> do<00:05:51.509> have<00:05:51.719> a<00:05:51.749> little<00:05:52.109> bit<00:05:52.199> of<00:05:52.289> a

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
now we do have a little bit of a

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.829 
now we do have a little bit of a
depletion<00:05:52.829> of<00:05:52.889> signal<00:05:53.339> but<00:05:54.239> it<00:05:54.419> doesn't<00:05:54.719> seem

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839 
depletion of signal but it doesn't seem

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:58.939 
depletion of signal but it doesn't seem
to<00:05:54.959> be<00:05:55.049> as<00:05:55.229> bad<00:05:55.619> as<00:05:55.889> the<00:05:56.239> AT&amp;T<00:05:57.239> iPhone<00:05:57.809> and<00:05:58.109> it

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
to be as bad as the AT&amp;T iPhone and it

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.289 
to be as bad as the AT&amp;T iPhone and it
is<00:05:59.099> definitely<00:05:59.309> holding<00:05:59.699> on<00:05:59.879> to<00:05:59.999> the<00:06:00.089> call

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:00.299 
is definitely holding on to the call

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:03.529 
is definitely holding on to the call
which<00:06:00.959> is<00:06:01.199> definitely<00:06:01.919> a<00:06:02.249> plus<00:06:02.429> if<00:06:03.119> any<00:06:03.329> of<00:06:03.449> you

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
which is definitely a plus if any of you

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.879 
which is definitely a plus if any of you
guys<00:06:03.719> were<00:06:03.869> lucky<00:06:04.139> enough<00:06:04.169> to<00:06:04.319> get<00:06:04.589> your
