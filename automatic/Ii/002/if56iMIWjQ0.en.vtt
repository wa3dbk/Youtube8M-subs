chain if you don't want the engines to
be<00:05:21.120> open<00:05:21.780> like<00:05:22.580> if<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:24.330> don't<00:05:24.450> want<00:05:24.570> it<00:05:24.870> anyone

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
be open like if you don't want it anyone

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.380 
be open like if you don't want it anyone
just<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:26.040> get<00:05:26.220> in<00:05:26.460> it<00:05:26.640> you're<00:05:26.880> gonna<00:05:27.060> have<00:05:27.240> to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
just to get in it you're gonna have to

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.380 
just to get in it you're gonna have to
block<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.840> up<00:05:28.280> I'm<00:05:29.280> not<00:05:29.640> gonna<00:05:29.880> want<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.210> right

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.280 
block it up I'm not gonna want the right
pieces<00:05:30.750> like<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:31.830> can<00:05:32.010> hang<00:05:32.310> off<00:05:32.490> like<00:05:32.730> this<00:05:33.290> or

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
pieces like it can hang off like this or

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.080 
pieces like it can hang off like this or
I<00:05:34.350> can<00:05:34.560> just<00:05:34.590> glue<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:34.950> on<00:05:35.130> I'm<00:05:35.730> just<00:05:35.850> quickly

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
I can just glue it on I'm just quickly

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.320 
I can just glue it on I'm just quickly
doing<00:05:36.630> it

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
doing it

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:47.480 
doing it
see<00:05:39.330> you<00:05:39.450> adding<00:05:39.870> a<00:05:39.990> little<00:05:40.530> chain<00:05:41.100> here<00:05:46.490> then

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
see you adding a little chain here then

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.430 
see you adding a little chain here then
you're<00:05:47.700> going<00:05:47.850> to<00:05:47.910> add<00:05:48.090> some<00:05:48.540> blocks<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:49.410> make

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
you're going to add some blocks to make

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.400 
you're going to add some blocks to make
it<00:05:49.770> higher<00:05:50.130> and<00:05:51.020> maybe<00:05:52.040> try<00:05:53.040> to<00:05:53.070> stick<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:53.640> in

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
it higher and maybe try to stick it in

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.550 
it higher and maybe try to stick it in
that<00:05:56.030> so<00:05:57.030> that<00:05:57.240> can<00:05:57.480> work

some heavy weapons onto your base all

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.570 
some heavy weapons onto your base all
chains<00:06:44.160> here<00:06:44.490> I<00:06:44.759> managed<00:06:45.509> I<00:06:45.919> can<00:06:46.919> put<00:06:47.280> it<00:06:47.430> in

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
chains here I managed I can put it in

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:55.909 
chains here I managed I can put it in
probably<00:06:51.289> least<00:06:52.289> I'm<00:06:52.410> going<00:06:52.590> to<00:06:52.650> try<00:06:53.900> so<00:06:54.919> Omaha

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
probably least I'm going to try so Omaha

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.710 
probably least I'm going to try so Omaha
good<00:06:56.160> this<00:06:56.880> is<00:06:57.060> going<00:06:57.270> to<00:06:57.330> work<00:06:57.539> for<00:06:59.720> maybe

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
good this is going to work for maybe

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.439 
good this is going to work for maybe
like<00:07:00.870> that<00:07:01.320> Casas<00:07:02.250> Grandes<00:07:02.849> and<00:07:03.090> like<00:07:03.210> heavy

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
like that Casas Grandes and like heavy

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:08.899 
like that Casas Grandes and like heavy
whacks<00:07:03.750> there<00:07:06.080> mark<00:07:07.080> make<00:07:07.590> probably<00:07:08.039> apart<00:07:08.669> to

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:08.909 
whacks there mark make probably apart to

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:11.719 
whacks there mark make probably apart to
to<00:07:09.120> make<00:07:09.270> it<00:07:09.419> better<00:07:09.630> but<00:07:09.990> this<00:07:10.650> is<00:07:10.710> one<00:07:11.190> simple

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
to make it better but this is one simple

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:14.570 
to make it better but this is one simple
way<00:07:12.210> for<00:07:12.240> all<00:07:12.750> the<00:07:12.960> people<00:07:13.380> who<00:07:14.250> don't<00:07:14.310> have

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
way for all the people who don't have

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:20.810 
way for all the people who don't have
much<00:07:14.760> like<00:07:15.090> us<00:07:15.330> to<00:07:15.659> make<00:07:15.930> a<00:07:16.110> lego<00:07:17.810> watching
