00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.639
 good and as you can see then some of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.869
 the things that have been taught is that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.480
 has all the applications that 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.560
 we could expect from a device a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.910
 smartphone 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.770
 social networks twitter facebook etcetera 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.739
 let's find absolutely everything 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.110
 what to expect in a terminal of these 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.540
 characteristics that as commented 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.880
 it's a low-end terminal in this case 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.950
 a zte but that in turn allows us 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.660
 have the skills of a smartphone 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.540
 medium-high average range 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 Well, all the applications that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 normally we see in a phone we 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.329
 we will be able to have and all are 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.340
 based on html5 all are based on 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.160
 ways 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.590
 the good thing about this is that the applications 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.510
 not only can they be found in the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.670
 marketplace of firefox but also 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.320
 but you can also find 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.199
 doing a search on the web os 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.240
 I will teach now the marketplace is the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.340
 place to categorize and find these 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.100
 applications that propose mozilla but 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.210
 as I say it is not the only good way 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.190
 Well, here we have all kinds of 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.960
 applications of ciper and soundcloud o 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.270
 people I liked me 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.979
 personally of this is that here to the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.470
 left we have a kind of 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.420
 search for applications that are not in 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520
 this margin but they are on the web and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.830
 that their own creators publish them 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.780
 lina then and for example let's go here 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.780
 we like to put some 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 really we are not looking 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.289
 a unique application that we want is 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.760
 information or content or something 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.820
 related to a 2 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.720
 we see all kinds of applications 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.870
 that are related to some for example 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.110
 Youtube 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.850
 we want to open we open youtube and we 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.550
 content related to 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.220
 youtube youtube is a web application 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.080
 that is in in html5 we can see the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.400
 means of html5 and that is the good thing about 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.410
 this if we really want 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.880
 keep the application we have the option 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.840
 adding to our homepage or 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.710
 discard it and continue otherwise 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.850
 we can look for games 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.260
 directly here and not have to 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.120
 install all the games that we test 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.120
 but if we do not like it we add 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.680
 the apps well because that's just 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.530
 free but they are also box 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.170
 this what allows us is that the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.260
 developers can monetize everything 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.150
 kinds of applications can teach here 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.130
 an example of what the process of 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.590
 Acquire the application that is paid 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.810
 For example, we are in the marketplace 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.260
 we are going to fill the road is a game 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.540
 that many of us know we would give to 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.960
 to buy 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.470
 we would enter our pine 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.990
 tells us the price 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.450
 installed and would no longer have the we can 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.710
 monetize our applications 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.519
 even if we advance them we have 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.389
 worked up 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:10.870
 teach the applications can be time 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.730
 out that can teach us very easily 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.359
 the applications do not have to 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.359
 be online 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.290
 this means that if we 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.090
 we are looking for a restaurant 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.840
 we could look for him without connection to 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.370
 Internet 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.440
 it can be time out or for example if 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:34.870
 we have installed a new one that has been 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:37.290
 dead has to access it with the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.150
 device 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.430
 Also, as mentioned in the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.680
 conference 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.150
 this is very important for mozilla is 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.540
 a non-profit organization 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.000
 have the massive support we have for 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.590
 the industry is no longer just having the 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.209
 support from developers who are 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.040
 delighted to be able to develop 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.290
 easily now solved but that 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.480
 we also have the support of the industry 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.099
 can be in Spain better than in the 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.139
 Latin American is the even and very 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.010
 big when developing and 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.959
 implement these phones apart that 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.810
 You can fully customize the 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.689
 very simple phone for example the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.470
 telephone people wanted to have a 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.870
 application that would allow us to control 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.870
 the expense that we have 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:30.270
 telephone and they have developed a 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.270
 system application 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:40.140
 what we have up to two types of data 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.790
 more is tried and tells us the 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.770
 information directly integrated in the 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.290
 operating system although it is a 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.330
 need for a treaty also achieved 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.890
 as I say the local markets are very 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.800
 important and when distributing 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.900
 Web applications 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.289
 It is very important to be able to give 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.790
 opportunity to people 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.560
 after all 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.830
 explain to users applications that 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.980
 they are relevant to their old age 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:09.900
 for example Spain to be able to highlight and 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.870
 all operators are going to be able to 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.870
 customize this kind of hope 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.170
 can dream a little about the applications of 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.750
 messages the calling applications 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.850
 as you can see this is a telephone with a hundred 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.900
 very fast because because there 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.490
 functions is a very light system 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.490
 what allows us to be talking 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:44.990
 from jarama the president very well have 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.990
 the device 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.759
 well I do not know if you want to teach them something 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.030
 specifically, the camera can be 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.030
 favor 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.090
 we would not do it 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.240
 and we could 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.580
 to imitate it etc the image and we could 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.510
 choose the different ones, that's all 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.510
 instagram times 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.490
 also came to teach the application 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.130
 especially this much is the 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.110
 music application which really 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.030
 looks good and shows very little 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.370
 power that you have at the time of 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.169
 meet on the web to do things 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.919
 in the music application you see the 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.919
 really good 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.090
 when you give to live
