 Thank you Yanagawa's only since I already 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:47.960
 Though it may be one scene of the final round , it is 9 words that I was worried about after all that was dead 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:55.699
 It Hey what fellow Once you jailbreak together 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:58.500
 Ueda onset Oezil of Shoun moment it and also to buy or not to Ryunosuke or Masaki Suda wind Kawashima play Takashi Tsukamoto 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.800
 Of Takimoto Koo Yada 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:10.310
 It was opening Tteyuu this really 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:15.799
 If this happens , I will be wondering who will die where ? 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:19.579
 But I well is 108 minutes special that considerable tempo for the first time 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:27.409
 And you can enjoy it with enough attractions 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:28.369
 Especially in the hot guy who is as fast as Ichihara of the leading role played particularly hit up until now 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.300
 Like 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.350
 There is a place where you hold it 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:40.410
 It's not a part to say 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.820
 It's pure or pure, so rookies's another reason 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.280
 Yes 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:53.420
 Then it shows off the other three members of jailbreak pretty much 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.100
 Takashi Tsukamoto First, even the smell of crack was transformed from hundreds of primary school teachers of the previous school 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.500
 Yamato Suko Florist 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.740
 And Ueda Tatsuya is just the opposite of the stoic image in kat-tun 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.740
 Which 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:20.830
 Boo Boo really squeezed away Sati swearing for those who do not want to hit people or just a padu car 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.600
 It is the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:32.610
 Technology age is 18 years old, but this time is the office of 20 years old 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:38.340
 That voice is good, but I'm addicted to this cool and intelligent role 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.300
 All that Anochotto important for the previous month 9 Kansai dialect of high school students than you told me 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.520
 I played 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:50.120
 It is said that the range of performance is wide although it is really still young 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:53.269
 I'm further'm also Fu, such expectation that if Kurere to show the performance on one stage 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.409
 And Well bureaucracy had become concerned about 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:02.000
 If Mr. Ryu Raita is in the egg and prison 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:08.930
 Tell me how to jailbreak yes 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:17.540
 But in the end it's a bad foot and you're going to get your own hands, so it looks like you've dug me 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:20.810
 And Kusuda Shibata is not in the middle of a prison , but the opposite police side 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.020
 Detective to chase hits etc. as necessary 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.310
 Well to 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.690
 Purged with the established is to say swapped two of the government office 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.070
 It momentum is enough okay 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:40.520
 Anyway, this time hey is originally justice 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:47.150
 If you look at the police, it will be a bit disturbing to you 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:55.850
 It is so old, it's old work pitta, so it 's really going to come to the end of hell . 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:04:00.540
 It 's all right from the end of the day It 's the same as showing the acting of Pikaichi among the cool actors 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.860
 To accompany us hits from strange occasions it and gave me the egg 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.890
 Saku Kumada playing the cherry blossoms 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:16.700
 It is postponed that waterfall , and then it is wonderfully named after that person play 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:23.240
 Kumada Seia himself in the interview of the official site regarding the role of this time Sakura is elementary school 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.850
 I am a first grader, but I actually want to play a small and cute cherry blossoms in the fourth grade of elementary school etc. 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.710
 Was 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.460
 However , not only the cute but also the gap between men and strong words 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.660
 There is 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.870
 We take care to be played well there 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:41.390
 Do it from the felt reading the first it is because it is the most 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.920
 It will surely be the work ahead with a diode script that is as emotional as you can imagine while calling 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.980
 I thought it would be 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.080
 Anyway shooting was a pleasure from reading the script 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.680
 It would be a great fun to meet everyone and shoot with everyone at the time of meeting 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.770
 I think corn further 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:03.930
 At the time of filming in Kyushu really , all the performers eat food and play games 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.460
 It was fun to play with Shiritori It was really fun when Share came to the director at that time 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.410
 The scene has become brighter 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.160
 Was the was happy can say was relieved to come grandmother from it was full of man before 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.670
 is 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:19.690
 The shooting site is so great now 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:23.710
 It's fun Well, it's a production that says you're going to hit a one-story show, I just say production 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:31.480
 Do not to be issued this with a + error of serif 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:34.249
 Overlook this jailbreak prisoners to convince the policeman heard it if it were Well 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:40.339
 It will end up 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:42.100
 Decision it how good luck is casting a Well Maybe Oh over there serif 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:46.330
 I think it was 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:50.800
 So I'm setting that first grade primary school 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.040
 I have no choice but to bring in the 4th grade elementary school student Masada Kumada 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.170
 I'm a bastard 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:05.370
 By the way, it is the first audience rating to be worried about 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:06.840
 12.5 Doctors behind the show 13 points Now the fight between these two dramas 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.050
 It is said 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.060
 It is a place to be worried about quite 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.169

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:21.450
