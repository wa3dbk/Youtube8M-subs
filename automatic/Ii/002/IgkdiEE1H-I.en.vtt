00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hey i am jonas and after i am in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.720
 last video already on the top five 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.059
 Positive things the apple watch talked about 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.429
 had it comes time today at the top of the 5 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.860
 negative things so the things which 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.139
 I noticed the same negative 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.090
 besides, after the last video too 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.220
 I was trying a little longer 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.769
 this time a bit shorter and shorter 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 keep father so it goes on as always 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:34.170
 the intro a lot of black and number one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.640
 is you needed on iphone and though 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 not just any iphone 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.260
 at least one iphone 5 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.690
 and i know many people which too 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.510
 even an iphone 4 or fans have 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.250
 and before they use an apple word 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.430
 they might have to be one too 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.760
 buy new iphone and thereby becomes the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.860
 Apple will be for several people 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.050
 uninteresting as well comes with android 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.239
 you are not far and far from here either 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.940
 after from windows phone and blackberry 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.619
 then we do not even have to talk about it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.869
 the second reason is so close 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.390
 A little bit of the first reason to us 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.740
 the apple watch is not really 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.100
 independently she is more such a one 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.720
 extension for your iphone 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.729
 Although you can do some things like that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.840
 fitness partner and so by itself 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.100
 record 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.200
 but as soon as it comes to communication with 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.869
 the internet must go to the devices 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 wetting at least in the same wlan and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.049
 even better is if you also per 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 Bluetooth are connected 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.530
 Say we are not allowed to go too far 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.299
 his 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.250
 that means you have to have the iphone 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.310
 almost always have with it 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.810
 and do not forget then you can 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.020
 you see the time and statues 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.259
 and you can somehow know something 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.369
 I do the fitness data from tekken but 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.860
 you can really do more with it 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.930
 Do not make the third reason is like it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.270
 many smartphones are like that 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770
 still needs a smartphone for 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.049
 many interactions 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.719
 that is if you have a notification 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.390
 or something like that gets clean then can 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.330
 one clearly in the apple work 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.300
 interact more than it was in android 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.890
 However, the case is for many things must 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.760
 you still get the phone out of the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.910
 get a bag 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.739
 and before you look at the clock 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.020
 but i need snb or not now 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.730
 Let's face it, it's easier in the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.569
 Compare the phone from the bag too 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.000
 take and therefore I see the benefit 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.239
 from the apple watch there not really 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.519
 because it is not a problem which only 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.010
 the apple watch has it on mine 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.900
 opinion to fight all smartphones 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.000
 the fourth point is personal to me 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.849
 not so relevant but for some others 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.980
 mother may be relevant and indeed 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.599
 I can have so many people at all 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.459
 do not want to endure watches 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:58.620
 They are happy if they do not wear a watch 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.480
 no unnecessary trees on the frame and man 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.440
 yes his smartphone because you can also 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.810
 look at the clock 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.450
 that's what most people think and do 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.500
 yes for many jokes on susan the otto 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.230
 normal consumer 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.690
 I think that will be with his cellphone 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.300
 also be so happy and for a gag 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.700
 Of course, his smart watch is on 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.010
 great to polka and nice to have but 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.970
 even I realize I do not need her 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.489
 really but i find extension and 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.440
 because many people do not like it at all 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.680
 why should they look this clock 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.870
 long crazy buy a watch 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.599
 wear and that will cost you too 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.489
 some and the added value is easy 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.620
 not really obvious 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.960
 the last point is for me 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.090
 on 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.380
 huge argument against the apple 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.810
 Watch and the price 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.260
 I now have the cheapest model and 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:54.640
 Although the apple boxsport with a 38 mm 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.040
 housing and this starts at 400 euro 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.780
 and let's face it, what can you do 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.820
 with 400 euro to make velvet 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.030
 You can certainly meet for a few days 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.920
 go on vacation and this clock is after 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.940
 a year probably also for 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.770
 outdated and sell after a year 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.520
 and I mean 400 euro is only the first 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.950
 beginning it's all up to 18,000 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.720
 euro who gives so much for a smart 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.900
 watch out for one year 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.340
 Again, it was a bit heavy and where to go after one 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.470
 probably only buy new ones 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.120
 because he is currently too bad 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.360
 has become because the successor more 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.190
 functions has etc 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.390
 the added value shrinks for me 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.360
 just keep going 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.330
 The device is a great accessory but it 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.150
 is damn expensive for what it is 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.670
 can because even the clock can not 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.510
 really much but only in combination 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.770
 with an iphone, this clock may become one 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.510
 acquire great accessories 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.120
 but that was it with this one too 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.250
 video of her the video of the top5 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.350
 positive things have not seen 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.150
 then look there too 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.490
 Of course the link is also in 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.890
 the video description as well as that 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.330
 unboxing the apple 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.490
 I hope you look anyway 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.170
 the next time over and then 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.120
 I would like the video I would like 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.610
 me, of course, about a positive 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.500
 rating very happy if you do not 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.360
 miss more videos from my channel 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.410
 want then you can also like 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.180
 leave abo there 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:26.700
 I hope see you next time 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.700
 Look again then bite
