00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.519
 well let's put it 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.870
 the cleaning of the screen is 70 per 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.559
 hundred when putting a protector 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.269
 screen a speck of dust can 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.309
 make 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.720
 I can take everything to the bottom and what I 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.060
 I do is clean the screen very well 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.610
 just before applying it will look like a 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.289
 foolish but with a pot of cologne 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.200
 after cold 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.630
 the ampa a little and let him settle 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.790
 this one of the things that it causes is that 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.220
 the dust in suspension that has 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.420
 above the area is to settle 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:46.170
 well it does not do miracles but it helps 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.519
 so let's go there 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.519
 we have the clean screen 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.510
 we have to make sure that there is no 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.510
 not a single speck of dust 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.580
 good 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.440
 they have been a couple of bubbles 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.230
 big 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.810
 but there does not seem to be any dust 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.170
 only be bubbles we can 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.170
 take 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.310
 little by little 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.620
 OK 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.890
 it would be necessary to clean it a little but 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.250
 we have put first of all it is 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.840
 true 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.840
 how the terminal responds 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.340
 the touch is good 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.390
 It seems like it does not have anything 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.340
 Well let's see if we put the cover and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.340
 and see how it fits
