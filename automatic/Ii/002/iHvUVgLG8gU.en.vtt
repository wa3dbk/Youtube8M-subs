 let's do pilan boxing i say quick 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.950
 because the box is a sales equation 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.900
 the shape is that but you see that it is not there 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.400
 a little drawing 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.720
 even in the packaging are not the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.000
 headphones in this case so much 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.830
 micro usb 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.840
 but in short, time is that 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.820
 the important 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.350

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.840

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.100

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.630

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.590

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:00.520

 megapixel with led flash and autofocus logo 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.320
 roots at the front and the three soft keys 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.440
 touch the common of the interior of the display 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.210
 12 megapixel front camera e 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.060
 double front stereo case which is a 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.490
 po what distinguishes the hd there 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.690
 we go from saved nothing but sorry 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:27.310
 good life asking for settings 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:29.440
 training we have android 4.4.2 kitkat 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 therefore practically the latest version o 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.060
 almost 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.470
 excuse a moment maximum fine network 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.770
 we have some top and my notice frames 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.110
 either laterally or to you some in 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.010
 height anyway with the father but that 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.570
 in the review 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.340
 design does not convince me at 100 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.689
 beating him, tell him a little big truth 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.240
 because we talk about 9.7 mm and the weight 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.060
 of 144 g a post makes one feel why 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.820
 anyway a the phone then not so 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.729
 large is the add on 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.249
 in short, the usual processors 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.939
 quad core snapdragon 400 1.2 gigahertz 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.160
 with a gigabyte of ram more than at least 300 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.860
 58 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.930
 ebadi in an internal and just display 4 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.000
 17 inches qhd then 50 x 960 lcd sees 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.140

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.930

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.850
