00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 now the other reality already exploded win 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.259
 at home project friendship that well its 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.330
 dynamic then a nice but sometimes a 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 little inexplicable life creates me because 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.389
 this is not how the fair friendship of 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.460
 fact that you share them truthfully if it is not 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.890
 a little different and this one built channel 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 who is the expert of the house of the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.960
 strange things 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.600
 a pleasure to greet you or like you 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.359
 comentas is a project that started 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.920
 mid - 50s where a race 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.840
 of extraterrestrial came to our 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.540
 world to implement a new order 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.210
 world since the love of the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.379
 peace and contacted for this project to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.579
 150 that was from the political-cultural sphere 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 sporting religious to the most 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.920
 important characters at that time 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.170
 there is in pescara italy where they arrived 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 these beings and good before all this that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.440
 I 'm mentioning the improvement people 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.170
 he says do not go he's already hallucinating johan 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.039
 the clear staff that not because there is this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.449
 photographs there are filming that yes that 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.640
 we are already seeing them in these moments 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.830
 these are photographs from the 50s 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.510
 we are talking about that of the mid 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.970
 from the 50s until the middle of the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.640
 years 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.480
 in italy one of the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.150
 sunny most important of about the 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.680
 unidentified subject this is 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.810
 certainly attracts a lot of attention 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.450
 because the researchers at that time 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.360
 they never thought what was happening 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.330
 this is given is published until 2007 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.870
 between 2007 and 2009 it is published in a 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.820
 book by professor stefano gap and 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.950
 the professor, well, what he does 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.930
 public the whole story a person of 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.490
 more than 80 years and it's good I 'm already going 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.440
 no longer have to do here but I'm going to 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.479
 leave the legacy of these objects 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.850
 unidentified fliers that arrived 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.220
 of this extraterrestrial race and that since 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.890
 then this gives us the parameter to 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.690
 know that in reality beings that arrive 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.520
 from other parts of the universe to our 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.560
 world that are leaving this kind of 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.450
 evidences are photographs that have been 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.030
 analyzed by image specialists 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.880
 digital and good because it has not been found 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.310
 no manipulation there is no alteration 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.350
 in the pixels and these are pictures 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.050
 photographs of that one of those times 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.880
 and my big question is how was it made for 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.470
 contact these characters 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.470
 they tell the anecdotes 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.320
 how was the contact good they 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.700
 describe and in fact we have images 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.290
 of these extra beings maybe it's because 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.940
 photographs are very similar to us 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.450
 the only difference is that they 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.120
 They measure two and a half meters two meters 80 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.440
 Well then they expected themselves are 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.440
 very similar to us 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.730
 but this is important because as well as 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.880
 it registered one of the most 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.890
 of the UFO phenomenon in Italy 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.750
 that at that moment we are talking about 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.490
 the 50s from 50's to 50's 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.170
 means of the 70 researchers 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.850
 they thought ah well it's a wave more there 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.020
 have to register the means of 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.300
 communication at that time 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.100
 mainly the newspapers at first 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.950
 flat published everything I had to 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.830
 see about this about these sightings 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.050
 but afterwards they gave themselves over time 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.220
 account that everything was due to this matter 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.220
 of the project friendship 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.680
 there is a later comes and we see yesterday 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.810
 these beings are photographs that were 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.490
 taken by this a very small group of 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.750
 people who said good well if it is 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.090
 Real all this that they are doing to us 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.300
 we have to leave it documented and here 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.670
 we see these filming of the 50s and 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.730
 we see this object above and of course 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.490
 it looks like that because they're remember it was 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.110
 filming was not video was not videna 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.090
 it was unthinkable still the matter of the 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.500
 life of these are filmations that were 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.819
 researched by the researcher 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.590
 Piergiorgio wanted 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.989
 that after this is published 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.090
 mass contact book that was where 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.010
 the boom is given, he started to give it 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.389
 follow up on all this contact to the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.489
 people that were mentioned in the 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.170
 books and said gentlemen then this 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.569
 it sounds very nice a fascinating story 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.099
 but what can you validate this 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.109
 that they are mentioning us and that's when 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.639
 begin to give you here we see some of 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.680
 the newspaper clippings of that 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.500
 era and it was when they began to give 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.939
 He photographs and filming 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.409
 there are also audios of these beings 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.209
 extraterrestrials that already in the future 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.030
 I'm going to bring it here they're in 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.099
 Italian and you have to do the translation 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.280
 of the degree that these beings said that 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:25.650
 they came to our planet this happened 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.530
 in italy in fishing if you assure that these 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.229
 beings lived in a kind as of 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.820
 holes in the ground that according to these 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.759
 gentlemen the witnesses who lived 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.630
 this experience was 400 kilometers 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.759
 long by 300 meters high if it was 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.470
 a whole city down there that they 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.690
 used for the purposes they had 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.400
 here that came to our planet and 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.110
 Well, there was everything was the area 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.759
 to fish we're all talking nothing 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.660
 over the fishing area then here 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.040
 we see 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.860
 cuts of those moments we are 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.820
 talking about the 50 60 70 we're 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.380
 talking about that the means of 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.000
 communication did not know what it was that 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.310
 was happening right now in 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.800
 the fishing sky and well that's 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.140
 start in italy but itself in everything 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.760
 which is the European continent was given 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.170
 registered a lot of 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.570
 sightings of flying objects not 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:17.370
 identified now you have to remember that 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.230
 in the 50s the classic model of these 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.360
 UFOs be the flying saucer the classic 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.770
 flying saucer then we see now 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.810
 who present us these filming 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.400
 these pictures and we see the saucer 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.650
 flying there we are looking at him wow 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.990
 and if the firm ones obviously date from 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.940
 some yesterdays 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.009
 you commented on how good that information 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:42.130
 it's going to be known just a few 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:45.199
 some years there is as such an agency 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.389
 or is it exactly a police group 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.160
 who prevents you from all that information 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.070
 go out to whom those who are the managers 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.229
 look, you've heard about the movie 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.970
 net men yes clear since mid 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.160
 of the years since the end of the 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.930
 forty mainly in states 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.330
 together this group of characters appeared 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.940
 that really existed 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.630
 they existed were very tall people 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.310
 pale they talked very monotonous as 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.810
 if they were robots is what they insure in 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.389
 its time to the people who 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.520
 they were there and these individuals the 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.970
 purpose was precisely that if you 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.320
 you had a picture a film them 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.340
 they came and they take it from you and they told you 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.590
 you do not have to say absolutely 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.210
 nothing was already 17 margins here we are 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.250
 seeing these are the beings that 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.720
 supposedly they came to italy we are 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.830
 seeing there that he was a kind more or less 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.830
 about three and a half meters 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.200
 tangible like us there is like a 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.700
 species like smoke is a kind like 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.140
 Well, I do not know what to call it 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.940
 some say it's a kind 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.010
 exact but just like there is this guy 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.570
 they assure that if they present themselves 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.680
 directly with us, imagine seeing 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.970
 to a guy on the street to the best of 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.710
 four meters four and a half meters 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.990
 it would be very complicated complicated 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.180
 then they what they claimed was 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.920
 that do not show contract with 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.860
 us precisely because of that 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.150
 can cause among us a 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.770
 now we are looking at those of 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.440
 antonio yes we have already played here 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.240
 but how important is this case 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.370
 of antonio if after all that 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.770
 it happened in pescara and that antonio ur if 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.780
 he's in italy milan then he 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.120
 is again capturing these objects 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.160
 that the classic flying saucer in the 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.570
 sure you have a contact with these 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.030
 beings that come from other parts of the 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.660
 universe you appear there in italy that 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.350
 it happened there 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:36.150
 from the mid-70s this same 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:38.130
 civilization was known until 1985 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.080
 but south of chile 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.060
 now the individuals who lived there 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.900
 in fishing and thai they assured that they had 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.700
 they were based in chile in argentina 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.620
 had bases in germany and in many 

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.220
