00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
surprised me it's an incredibly fast

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.989 
surprised me it's an incredibly fast
board<00:01:33.920> just<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.159> soon<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.429> you<00:01:35.490> went<00:01:35.609> to<00:01:35.789> put<00:01:35.969> my

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
board just as soon as you went to put my

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:37.519 
board just as soon as you went to put my
I<00:01:36.119> put<00:01:36.329> my<00:01:36.420> feet<00:01:36.599> in<00:01:36.749> on<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.959> first<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.349> I

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:37.529 
I put my feet in on the first time I

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:38.989 
I put my feet in on the first time I
just<00:01:37.889> came<00:01:38.039> flying<00:01:38.219> off<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.459> back<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
just came flying off the back because it

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.690 
just came flying off the back because it
is<00:01:39.179> the<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.539> much<00:01:39.659> speed<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> take<00:01:40.469> off

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
is the so much speed on the take off

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.769 
is the so much speed on the take off
second<00:01:41.700> wave<00:01:41.819> I<00:01:41.909> took<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.209> did<00:01:42.359> a<00:01:42.389> bit<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.569> an<00:01:42.630> air

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:42.779 
second wave I took I did a bit of an air

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:45.349 
second wave I took I did a bit of an air
drop<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> reef<00:01:44.009> break<00:01:44.279> about<00:01:44.609> a<00:01:44.939> little<00:01:45.270> bit

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
drop on a reef break about a little bit

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.809 
drop on a reef break about a little bit
overhead<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:45.990> me<00:01:46.139> and<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.549> felt

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
overhead for me and it just felt

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.879 
overhead for me and it just felt
straight<00:01:48.029> down<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> face<00:01:48.599> the<00:01:49.229> fin<00:01:49.499> gripped

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
straight down the face the fin gripped

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:51.739 
straight down the face the fin gripped
the<00:01:50.189> board<00:01:50.429> whipped<00:01:50.669> around<00:01:50.819> and<00:01:51.209> before<00:01:51.569> I

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
the board whipped around and before I

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.089 
the board whipped around and before I
knew<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.929> I<00:01:52.109> was<00:01:52.139> on<00:01:52.349> a<00:01:52.409> great<00:01:52.590> wave<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.099 
knew it I was on a great wave and

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:54.589 
knew it I was on a great wave and
they're<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.310> incredible<00:01:53.999> amounts<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.329> speed

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
they're just incredible amounts of speed

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.289 
they're just incredible amounts of speed
really<00:01:55.439> fun<00:01:55.859> to<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.069> top<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.459> bottom<00:01:56.579> excellent

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
really fun to go top to bottom excellent

for doing like large big like carving
turns<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.289> not<00:02:01.499> going<00:02:01.679> to<00:02:01.739> be<00:02:02.099> the<00:02:02.310> board<00:02:02.520> you

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639 
turns it's not going to be the board you

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.479 
turns it's not going to be the board you
want<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.880> flick<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.239> and<00:02:03.419> down<00:02:04.159> around<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
want to flick up and down around the

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:06.709 
want to flick up and down around the
face<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.999> the<00:02:06.119> wave<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.299> know<00:02:06.509> you're<00:02:06.630> not

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
face of the wave you know you're not

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.849 
face of the wave you know you're not
going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:06.989> going<00:02:07.109> critical<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.709> this

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
going to be going critical with this

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.139 
going to be going critical with this
kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.069> board<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.759> you're<00:02:08.880> looking<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.210 
kind of board but if you're looking to
do<00:02:09.270> some<00:02:09.450> more<00:02:09.569> bits<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.989> soulful<00:02:10.560> arches<00:02:11.040> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
do some more bits of soulful arches and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.020 
do some more bits of soulful arches and
big<00:02:11.340> carves<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.420> great<00:02:12.630> board<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:12.960> that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
big carves it's a great board for that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.910 
big carves it's a great board for that
as<00:02:15.660> far<00:02:15.900> as<00:02:15.930> build<00:02:16.140> while<00:02:16.260> he<00:02:16.380> goes<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.710> far

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
as far as build while he goes so far

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.230 
as far as build while he goes so far
it's<00:02:17.040> looking<00:02:17.100> pretty<00:02:17.430> good<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.760> mean<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.150> a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
it's looking pretty good I mean it's a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.180 
it's looking pretty good I mean it's a
quite<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> budget<00:02:18.840> board<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.680> noticed<00:02:20.040> a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
quite a budget board I have noticed a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.970 
quite a budget board I have noticed a
couple<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.670> little<00:02:20.850> cracks<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.540> rail<00:02:21.980> here

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
couple of little cracks in the rail here

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.170 
couple of little cracks in the rail here
and<00:02:23.070> there<00:02:23.190> but<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.430> think<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.820> was<00:02:24.060> in

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and there but I think that was in

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.350 
and there but I think that was in
transit<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:25.560> haven't<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.460> seen<00:02:26.640> any<00:02:26.850> any

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
transit I haven't really seen any any

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.660 
transit I haven't really seen any any
major<00:02:27.540> depressions<00:02:28.350> from<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> surface<00:02:29.550> I've

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
major depressions from the surface I've

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.010 
major depressions from the surface I've
done<00:02:29.850> I'm<00:02:29.970> with<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.180> bit<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.480> heavier<00:02:30.750> dude

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
done I'm with a bit of a heavier dude

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.860 
done I'm with a bit of a heavier dude
and<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:32.700> yeah<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.330> definitely<00:02:33.480> it's

definitely<00:02:33.920> well<00:02:34.920> made<00:02:36.170> quite<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.230> heavy<00:02:37.410> board

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
definitely well made quite a heavy board

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.140 
definitely well made quite a heavy board
it<00:02:38.010> seems<00:02:38.100> like<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.490> quite<00:02:38.640> solid

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
it seems like it's got quite solid

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.580 
it seems like it's got quite solid
glassing<00:02:39.570> done<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.960> now<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.410> was

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
glassing done on it now this was

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.900 
glassing done on it now this was
straight<00:02:40.800> off<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> wreck<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.520> don't<00:02:41.760> know
