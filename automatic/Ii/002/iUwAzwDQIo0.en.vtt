 in his program he would look 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.550
 hopefully 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.189
 I do not try to turn that apple into 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 orange but from the south it 's pretty 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 disturbing if you think about it well 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.320
 this silly cloud is so heavy that it makes 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.179
 fog 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.219
 I want to flatten this thing so it comes back 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:45.199
 to float like that not like that clouds work 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.940
 but I'm arguing with horses 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.379
 speakers 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.379
 I need to leave more 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.450
 and I'll take you 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.600
 how quickly I do not think that neither 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.060
 flash the range of that speed 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.870
 Latin dubbing I can promise not to 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.590
 do nothing fun if that helps you 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.600
 principal is a manipulator 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.310
 and my family will raise a barn this 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.179
 late in your volley age your family 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.189
 he is always raising barns atoyac 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.030
 it does not matter what the ibex is for me 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.030
 well and for me 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.040
 pink and I think you have problems of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.040
 organization 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.900
 and pinche is dead I hope to remember 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.720
 well the rhymes of my nanny's story 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.370
 where the forces express there 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.860
 you'll find 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.040
 the pineapple nanny very specific with her 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.040
 rhymes 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.340
 I can not see this coming out badly of any 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.049
 mode 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.759
 room join with me here for 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.260
 tell me everything about everything as if I 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.510
 same 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.510
 I was there because I am you and you are me 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.780
 I have a feeling that this is 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 will become the fastest prestige of 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.119
 what I would like 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.119
 Water 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.690
 and ping the water tends to be wet 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.060
 for bimbo 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.070
 at least we have a lot of alfalfa game 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.780
 and jelly to share the bear is a 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.130
 visual representation of the fans 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.130
 adults of myler point 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.860
 do not break the fourth wall just give more 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.860
 excuses to crossover hide pool 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.400
 I'm sure Prince sold him 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.030
 your soul to the gods of chaos to be able 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.030
 do this alone 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.880
 he invited me to do something that was also 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.880
 funny 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:07.990
 and then he had an aneurysm 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.990
 to a double double double double 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.900
 to know who is responsible for 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.900
 ruin our granaries 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.270
 It would not have been more fun if that 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.540
 fucking would have died demons is fine 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.540
 sick people made our picnic 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.070
 when I'm the town governor 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.310
 know before becoming a princess and 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.310
 that 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.220
 bookcase xxi machine 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.910
 in the original 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.800
 I'm almost sure there was an episode 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.800
 of the simpsons with this same premise 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.390
 maybe the one that does not act like a 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.390
 complete practice 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.269
 very bad time to have a crisis of 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.129
 big identity I have to put a sin 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.450
 because it's because he's the only character 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:19.609
 with a hint of common sense in the 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:21.919
 land to supposedly be the 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.949
 Smarter character can sometimes 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:29.540
 be very far that is a very nice play 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:31.730
 for non-thinking animals maybe 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.370
 I found this stirring the earth with 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.310
 the helmet drawing sad faces and 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.630
 none of you ballots thought that 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.630
 this could be the original 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.900
 oh my god those disgusting 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.800
 nobody has the right to remember the 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.800
 dark times 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.400
 it is impossible for the head of twilight 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.719
 It would not have been so heated and 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.460
 Turn your eyes away and provide a proof 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.080
 the only pinky who kept looking at the 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.060
 wall had to do it 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.520
 I had to do it I could not leave my 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.680
 friends could not 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.349
 but I guess sometimes I'll have to 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.940
 choose among them 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.590
 my imagination or the characters are 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.169
 they become more stupid when they get 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.780
 an excuse dedicated to them is as if 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.789
 it's like they want to teach things to 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.560
 children from easy characters 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.440
 to understand and with those that can be 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.949
 relate easily 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.949
 how stupid
