a<00:00:44.050> really<00:00:44.350> nice<00:00:44.469> flow<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.829> traffic<00:00:45.039> has<00:00:45.399> now

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
a really nice flow of traffic has now

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.369 
a really nice flow of traffic has now
become<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.910> gigantic<00:00:46.450> lineup<00:00:46.750> of<00:00:46.870> cars<00:00:47.079> as<00:00:47.260> you

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
become a gigantic lineup of cars as you

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.160 
become a gigantic lineup of cars as you
can<00:00:47.530> see<00:00:47.710> over<00:00:47.890> on<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.129> left<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:49.000> behind<00:00:49.870> me

can see over on the left and behind me
they're<00:00:50.320> starting<00:00:50.649> to<00:00:50.680> pile<00:00:50.920> up<00:00:50.949> a<00:00:51.190> bit<00:00:51.340> as

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
they're starting to pile up a bit as

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.930 
they're starting to pile up a bit as
well<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.410> that's<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.739> first<00:00:53.920> light

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.779 

and<00:00:59.120> usually<00:00:59.989> end<00:01:00.469> up<00:01:00.559> getting<00:01:00.859> stopped<00:01:01.190> at

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
and usually end up getting stopped at

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.340 
and usually end up getting stopped at
least<00:01:02.000> two<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.420> these<00:01:02.570> lights<00:01:02.840> if<00:01:03.019> not<00:01:03.170> all

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
least two of these lights if not all

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.920 
least two of these lights if not all
three<00:01:05.380> we'll<00:01:06.380> see<00:01:06.530> what<00:01:06.680> happens<00:01:06.799> here

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 

next<00:01:10.680> lights<00:01:10.890> already<00:01:11.070> read<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.700> waiting

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
next lights already read just waiting

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200 
next lights already read just waiting
for<00:01:12.270> us<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:14.160> turn<00:01:14.370> to<00:01:14.490> Greenland<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.090> we

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
for us and turn to Greenland see if we

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.149 
for us and turn to Greenland see if we
make<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.420> through<00:01:15.690> in<00:01:15.870> time

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.179 

no<00:01:19.810> some<00:01:20.810> I<00:01:20.840> got<00:01:21.109> stuck<00:01:21.409> there<00:01:21.439> behind<00:01:21.859> the<00:01:22.009> red

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
no some I got stuck there behind the red

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.999 
no some I got stuck there behind the red
light<00:01:22.399> so<00:01:23.049> now<00:01:24.049> we<00:01:24.109> have<00:01:24.289> to<00:01:24.469> get<00:01:24.590> stuck<00:01:24.829> behind

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
light so now we have to get stuck behind

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:33.470 
light so now we have to get stuck behind
him<00:01:26.679> normally<00:01:27.679> he'd<00:01:27.829> already<00:01:28.009> be<00:01:28.250> true

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.420 

compiled<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> wonderful<00:01:35.310> weather

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
compiled that with the wonderful weather

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.130 
compiled that with the wonderful weather
that<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:35.940> here<00:01:36.120> in<00:01:36.210> Michigan<00:01:36.660> he's<00:01:36.810> going

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
that we have here in Michigan he's going

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.820 
that we have here in Michigan he's going
really<00:01:37.320> slow<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> start<00:01:39.110> which<00:01:40.110> backs<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.590> all

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
really slow to start which backs up all

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.950 
really slow to start which backs up all
up

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960

so<00:01:50.590> far<00:01:50.860> we're<00:01:51.100> at<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.880> minute<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.659> 52<00:01:52.960> seconds

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
so far we're at a minute and 52 seconds

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.050 
so far we're at a minute and 52 seconds
into<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:53.890> drive<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:55.770> normally<00:01:56.770> after<00:01:57.670> about

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
into this drive and normally after about

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.090 
into this drive and normally after about
two<00:01:58.270> minutes<00:01:58.510> you<00:01:58.720> would<00:01:58.930> Rab<00:01:59.560> all<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.010> way

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
two minutes you would Rab all the way

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.380 
two minutes you would Rab all the way
through<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.460> end<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.820> road<00:02:01.000> getting

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
through to the end of the road getting

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.390 
through to the end of the road getting
under<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.750> expressway<00:02:02.430> right<00:02:03.430> now<00:02:05.400> we're

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
under the expressway right now we're

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.500 
under the expressway right now we're
only<00:02:06.490> about<00:02:06.640> halfway<00:02:06.940> there

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.420 

very<00:02:13.170> hard<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.409> see<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.799> camera<00:02:13.980> we<00:02:14.250> can

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
very hard to see on the camera we can

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.860 
very hard to see on the camera we can
serve<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.000> third<00:02:15.209> leg<00:02:15.450> coming<00:02:15.780> up

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
serve to see the third leg coming up

serve to see the third leg coming up
it's<00:02:16.080> currently<00:02:16.709> green<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.480> see<00:02:18.659> if<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:18.840> make

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
it's currently green and see if we make

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:27.920 
it's currently green and see if we make
it<00:02:19.049> through<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.470> one

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.660 

Oh<00:02:29.599> too<00:02:30.599> bad<00:02:32.180> almost<00:02:33.180> made<00:02:33.359> it<00:02:33.390> through<00:02:34.670> of

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
Oh too bad almost made it through of

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.119 
Oh too bad almost made it through of
course<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:36.450> all<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.810> traffic<00:02:37.620> coming<00:02:37.950> in

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
the other direction I can see why this

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.839 
the other direction I can see why this
light<00:02:40.109> exists<00:02:42.859> not<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.890> lot<00:02:44.129> of<00:02:44.250> traffic<00:02:44.489> in<00:02:44.760> the

light exists not a lot of traffic in the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.690 
light exists not a lot of traffic in the
other<00:02:45.000> direction<00:02:46.159> but<00:02:47.159> we're<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.549> go

minutes and 55 seconds into the drive

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.670 
minutes and 55 seconds into the drive
now<00:02:56.569> we<00:02:57.569> easily<00:02:57.810> would<00:02:58.139> have<00:02:58.260> been<00:02:58.379> on<00:02:58.530> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
now we easily would have been on the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.140 
now we easily would have been on the
expressway<00:02:59.159> at<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.430> point<00:02:59.670> before<00:02:59.849> these

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
expressway at this point before these

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.850 
expressway at this point before these
light<00:03:00.389> came<00:03:00.689> into<00:03:00.720> existence

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.920 

now<00:03:10.430> we<00:03:10.490> find<00:03:10.910> we<00:03:11.240> get<00:03:11.390> through<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.720> third

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
now we find we get through the third

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.400 
now we find we get through the third
light<00:03:12.200> everyone<00:03:12.860> has<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.070> start<00:03:13.610> up<00:03:13.790> again<00:03:14.410> and

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
light everyone has a start up again and

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.600 
light everyone has a start up again and
if<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.250> look<00:03:16.430> behind<00:03:16.610> me<00:03:16.880> there's<00:03:17.210> a<00:03:18.610> fairly

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
if you look behind me there's a fairly

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.640 
if you look behind me there's a fairly
big<00:03:19.880> line<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.240> traffic<00:03:20.420> behind<00:03:20.720> me<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.230> then<00:03:21.410> a

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
big line of traffic behind me and then a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.740 
big line of traffic behind me and then a
big<00:03:21.950> line<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.280> traffic<00:03:22.460> people<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.480> just<00:03:23.570> got

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
big line of traffic people that just got

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.530 
big line of traffic people that just got
stuck<00:03:24.020> at<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.230> preview<00:03:24.590> light<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:25.730> that's<00:03:26.360> why

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
stuck at the preview light so that's why

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.120 
stuck at the preview light so that's why
these<00:03:26.600> lights<00:03:26.990> should<00:03:27.260> make<00:03:27.470> this<00:03:27.680> because

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
these lights should make this because

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.710 
these lights should make this because
they<00:03:28.310> create<00:03:28.520> traffic<00:03:28.910> problems<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.660> they

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
they create traffic problems and they

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.630 
they create traffic problems and they
don't<00:03:29.840> solve<00:03:30.170> traffic<00:03:30.530> problems<00:03:31.040> that's

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
don't solve traffic problems that's

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.280 
don't solve traffic problems that's
three<00:03:31.940> minutes<00:03:32.210> and<00:03:32.330> 30<00:03:32.540> seconds<00:03:32.990> into<00:03:33.140> the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
three minutes and 30 seconds into the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.530
