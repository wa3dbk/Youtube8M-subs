00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the opportunity to start adding some

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.869 
the opportunity to start adding some
variation<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.660> don't<00:00:42.870> feel<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:44.100> need<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.640> as

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
variation I don't feel the need to be as

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.420 
variation I don't feel the need to be as
specific<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.690> training<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.399> actually<00:00:47.399> a

to see that and to be honest I wasn't
not<00:00:55.649> filming<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.250> before<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.969> wasn't

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
not filming them before I just wasn't

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
not filming them before I just wasn't
doing<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:57.899> before<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.770> get

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
doing them before because as I get

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.709 
doing them before because as I get
closer<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> meet<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.879> generally<00:01:00.270> take<00:01:00.420> more

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
closer to a meet I generally take more

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.380 
closer to a meet I generally take more
accessory<00:01:01.170> work<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.850> panel<00:01:03.210> goes

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
accessory work out and it panel goes

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.939 
accessory work out and it panel goes
from<00:01:03.600> order<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.989> importance<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.619> take<00:01:04.799> out

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
from order of importance you take out

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.530 
from order of importance you take out
the<00:01:05.100> volume<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> accessories<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.450> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the volume from the accessories then you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.000 
the volume from the accessories then you
take<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> volume<00:01:07.080> from<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> variations

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
take out the volume from the variations

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.469 
take out the volume from the variations
and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.700> stick<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> lips

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and then you just stick with the lips

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.570 
and then you just stick with the lips
themselves<00:01:10.229> trained<00:01:10.560> specifically<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.430> get

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
themselves trained specifically to get

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.850 
themselves trained specifically to get
you<00:01:11.700> ready<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.540> only<00:01:12.810> being<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.560> strong

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you ready for not only being as strong

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240 
you ready for not only being as strong
and<00:01:14.280> capable<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.890> can<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and capable as you can on can be on a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.789 
and capable as you can on can be on a
meet<00:01:17.490> day<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.330> also<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.630> used<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.470> lifting

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
meet day but also just used to lifting

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.710 
meet day but also just used to lifting
in<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.100> fat<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.299> training<00:01:21.600> gets

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
in that fat and so the training gets

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.460 
in that fat and so the training gets
more<00:01:21.900> specific<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> event<00:01:23.070> gets<00:01:23.610> closer

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
more specific as the event gets closer

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.539 
more specific as the event gets closer
right<00:01:25.470> now<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.890> quite<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.430> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
right now I have quite a bit of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.039 
right now I have quite a bit of
weaknesses<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.360> work<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.750> picked

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
weaknesses that I can work on I picked

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.910 
weaknesses that I can work on I picked
out<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> lot<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.500> stuff<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> meat<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.900> I

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
out a lot of stuff from the meat and I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
out a lot of stuff from the meat and I
think<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.130> conventional<00:01:32.880> deadlifts<00:01:33.390> will

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
think that conventional deadlifts will

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.330 
think that conventional deadlifts will
help<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.140> improve<00:01:34.439> some<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> those<00:01:35.100> weaknesses

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
help to improve some of those weaknesses

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.300 
help to improve some of those weaknesses
on<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.420> day<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> worked<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> 605<00:01:37.710> before

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
on this day I worked up to a 605 before

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.969 
on this day I worked up to a 605 before
I<00:01:38.780> started<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.869> pull<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> fifth<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I started to pull on the fifth but I

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.560 
I started to pull on the fifth but I
waited<00:01:41.340> too<00:01:41.369> long<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.970> actually<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
waited too long and actually on the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.710 
waited too long and actually on the
earlier<00:01:42.960> 405<00:01:43.500> said<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> had<00:01:44.070> opened<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:45.149> won't

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
earlier 405 said I had opened I won't

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.969 
earlier 405 said I had opened I won't
even<00:01:45.810> call<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.140> callus<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.680> more<00:01:46.829> like

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
even call it a callus it's more like

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.149 
even call it a callus it's more like
just<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.250> little<00:01:47.460> hole<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.000> my<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.540> hand<00:01:49.159> from

just a little hole in my in my hand from

this<00:01:55.740> cycle<00:01:55.979> by<00:01:57.680> transitioning<00:01:58.680> back<00:01:59.189> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
this cycle by transitioning back and

this cycle by transitioning back and
forth<00:01:59.670> i<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> texas<00:02:00.509> dead<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> far<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.200> my

forth i use the texas dead the far on my

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.429 
forth i use the texas dead the far on my
primary<00:02:01.770> death<00:02:01.979> day<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.610> then<00:02:03.119> i<00:02:03.210> use<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:04.020> is

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
primary death day and then i use this is

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.819 
primary death day and then i use this is
just<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.399> regular<00:02:05.759> texas<00:02:06.180> power<00:02:06.450> bar<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:07.560> my

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
just the regular texas power bar for my

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.559 
just the regular texas power bar for my
other<00:02:07.979> day<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> lot<00:02:08.580> easier<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> hands

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
other day it's a lot easier on the hands

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.880 
other day it's a lot easier on the hands
it's<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.810> lot<00:02:09.959> less<00:02:10.110> whippy<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.709> lot

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it's a lot less whippy it's a lot

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.250 
it's a lot less whippy it's a lot
stiffer<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.569> so

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
stiffer and so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.080 
stiffer and so
and<00:02:13.830> all<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.159> together<00:02:14.340> sounds<00:02:14.879> really

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and all that together sounds really

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.949 
and all that together sounds really
interesting<00:02:15.239> but<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.939> decided<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.420> call<00:02:18.780> it

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
interesting but I decided to call it

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.740 
interesting but I decided to call it
after<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.530> fourth<00:02:19.769> rep<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.250> then<00:02:20.760> instead<00:02:21.689> of

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
after the fourth rep and then instead of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.569 
after the fourth rep and then instead of
doing<00:02:22.079> my<00:02:22.110> paws<00:02:22.470> sumos<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.189> had<00:02:23.310> planned

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
doing my paws sumos like I had planned

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.899 
doing my paws sumos like I had planned
to<00:02:23.730> do<00:02:24.049> because<00:02:25.049> of<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:25.470> hand<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:26.099> figured<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
to do because of my hand I figured the

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.780 
to do because of my hand I figured the
only<00:02:27.030> exercise<00:02:27.829> that<00:02:28.829> I<00:02:28.950> could<00:02:29.159> really<00:02:29.310> add<00:02:29.549> in

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
only exercise that I could really add in

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.819 
only exercise that I could really add in
and<00:02:29.970> not<00:02:30.120> feel<00:02:30.480> completely<00:02:31.049> weird<00:02:31.409> about<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
and not feel completely weird about the

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.550 
and not feel completely weird about the
straps<00:02:32.129> which<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.489> still<00:02:32.790> did<00:02:33.000> was<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.349> some

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
straps which I still did was to do some

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.750 
straps which I still did was to do some
snatch<00:02:34.769> grip<00:02:34.950> dead<00:02:35.220> lips<00:02:35.400> because<00:02:35.730> I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
snatch grip dead lips because I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.819 
snatch grip dead lips because I
generally<00:02:36.299> can't<00:02:36.599> do<00:02:36.870> those<00:02:37.049> without<00:02:37.260> straps

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
generally can't do those without straps

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.559 
generally can't do those without straps
anyway<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> way<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
anyway just because of the way that the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.819 
anyway just because of the way that the
hands<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.319> has<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.500> be<00:02:40.560> double

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
hands go and it has to be double

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.270 
hands go and it has to be double
overhand<00:02:41.159> for<00:02:41.819> me<00:02:42.209> anyway<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.709> didn't<00:02:44.159> want

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
to hook grip that so I put on the straps

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.250 
to hook grip that so I put on the straps
felt<00:02:46.200> kind<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.709> weird<00:02:46.829> but<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:48.450> think<00:02:49.109> it'll
