00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.240
 hi all guys today i'm up here 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 this worse 2008 e 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.450
 we are the only one in a confessional 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.500
 a linz in austria as you see we have 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.390
 volvo peugeot and suzuki on the floor 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.090
 superior we are here on this 2008 the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.000
 novelty of peugeot which consists in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.859
 practice in the suv version of course 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.300
 changes with respect to 208 of 208 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.830
 then part immediately the position of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.140
 guide I 'll show you a little the interior 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.180
 then it's really a position 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 particularly because it's all about 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 steering wheel adjustment because how 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.960
 you know how on 208 we have the dashboard 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.629
 which place on the instrument panel he has 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 placed above the dashboard in place 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.690
 high so we have as you see 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 in this position maybe we can 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.110
 be a little behind the wheel I see it 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.020
 very well you have to look at the races 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.180
 of the steering wheel you can see anyway 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.670
 quite less and very very flying 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.220
 small 34 in diameter or so much 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.360
 with commands for the infotainment we say 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.619
 to control on-board computer is 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.380
 really nice especially with this 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.140
 peugeot insert that we have here the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 we pay the fast infotainment system 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.209
 ndaw peugeot is 7 inch touchscreen 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.780
 however, this is not equipped with a navigator 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:38.819
 in the somewhat non-optional version 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.580
 let's say then as you see then we have 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.979
 the whole instrument panel 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.539
 we pay radio photo music as readers 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.000
 as an exception because in German 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.920
 We have bluetooth contacts when 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590
 we synchronize bluetooth in long stand 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.640
 we have various systems for what 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.039
 concerns various settings and here 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.170
 we can go on with the radios 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.380
 memory we set e 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.590
 whatever 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.230
 we have the vents that are 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.360
 crossed by this beautiful 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.030
 dashboard not soft touch effect type 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.970
 punto evo precisely 2012 but in this 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.950
 effect just a little rough but a lot 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.660
 very nice it gave an effect 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.269
 particular after we love this 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.970
 gray painted extending over the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.950
 dashboard behind as you see on the display 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.290
 from the infotainment vents 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.290
 manual air conditioning of course 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.160
 the automatic bison is also available 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.880
 rome the four arrows close below 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.049
 we have connections for 12 volt socket and 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.830
 usb socket and aux leverage holder of 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:55.760
 change is not as good as usual 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.160
 peugeot a rather non-tradition 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.140
 happy let's say leave a hand a lot 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.989
 detail perhaps a little copied from panda 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.560
 from fiat because even the panda has it 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:10.090
 so a mouse is a very compartment 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.920
 deep in the seats are good comfortable 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.540
 they hold back well we say all the latest 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.359
 peugeot citroen have this type of 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.310
 very restrained showcase seats te ci 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.720
 are front to regulation of the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.819
 rear-view mirrors and family and now you 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.799
 let's move on to the back seats 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.310
 I could be able to live the auxiliary keys 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:37.000
 parking sensors mode here 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:40.510
 can be deactivated and can also be deactivated 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.510
 as suu kyi 3 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.080
 we have all this citroen range 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.830
 drawer that very sunken then 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.540
 we can enjoy a great space for 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.040
 the legs even when we open it then 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.560
 don't change with your legs when we have it 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.310
 as you can see we have a lot of cash 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.810
 also the locking for the airbag we say 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.100
 of the passenger 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.670
 let's move on to the seats now 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.670
 rear 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.840
 here we are in the rear seats of 2008 not 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.280
 we are very comfortable we hear the 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.870
 all set back but on the other hand 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.430
 we have much more room for it 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.770
 head because as you saw it was one 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.740
 aesthetic thing a little ugly but we have the 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.130
 raising of the ceiling of the ceiling 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.470
 when when we get to the riser here 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.660
 the bang handle sorry if you don't first 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.460
 I came up here but we have a seat 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.580
 reclined for you to see like this 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:12.250
 floor is leveled and creates a good one 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.210
 load capacity here we have it on 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.810
 this story as I said not 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.000
 eyebrow fir manuals e 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.870
 speaker and these are the places 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.870
 back here 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.120
 here is the trunk of regular shape with 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.060
 the very low load threshold therefore 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.510
 very convenient as you see here we have 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:07.590
 various compartments with retention 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.130
 let's say different lights and load plan 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:14.460
 for an absurd sum of this kind 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:17.690
 equal to juke and captura of nissan e 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.690
 lenola respectively 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.990
 this is the back line of this one 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:35.740
 2008 with the particular crowning that 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:38.410
 we have that flows into the headlights that are 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.850
 precisely delimited in the outline to this 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.900
 camber point that is also taken up 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.900
 on a new 308 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:58.770
 iron hoops for this light night 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:07:02.870
 front and from this worst 2008 is 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.870
 all thermal a greeting to all
