with dragon and George's what we've done
is<00:01:13.090> we've<00:01:13.240> taken<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.600> best<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:14.050> high<00:01:14.260> fantasy

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
is we've taken the best of high fantasy

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.160 
is we've taken the best of high fantasy
and<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.160> best<00:01:15.400> of<00:01:15.580> darker<00:01:16.210> lower<00:01:16.510> fantasy<00:01:17.050> and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and the best of darker lower fantasy and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.110 
and the best of darker lower fantasy and
combined<00:01:17.470> them<00:01:17.500> into<00:01:17.710> one<00:01:17.860> game<00:01:18.370> so<00:01:19.000> you're

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
combined them into one game so you're

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.090 
combined them into one game so you're
taking<00:01:19.300> like<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.930> Tolkien<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.560> overarching

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
taking like the Tolkien the overarching

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.220 
taking like the Tolkien the overarching

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
good versus evil metaphor that drawed

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.780 
good versus evil metaphor that drawed
you<00:01:23.350> through<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.530> high<00:01:23.710> fantasy<00:01:23.890> game<00:01:24.250> but<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
you through a high fantasy game but the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.480 
you through a high fantasy game but the
darker<00:01:25.270> grey<00:01:25.660> or<00:01:25.720> choice<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.650> consequence<00:01:27.220> of

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
darker grey or choice and consequence of

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.400 
darker grey or choice and consequence of
something<00:01:27.880> like<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.060> george<00:01:28.450> RR<00:01:28.570> martin<00:01:28.960> or<00:01:29.350> a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
something like a george RR martin or a

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.560 
something like a george RR martin or a
conan<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.220> we<00:01:30.550> combine<00:01:30.910> them<00:01:31.150> so<00:01:31.180> you're

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
conan and we combine them so you're

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.880 
conan and we combine them so you're
playing<00:01:31.780> as<00:01:31.870> a<00:01:31.900> Grey<00:01:32.110> Warden<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.680> have<00:01:32.800> to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
playing as a Grey Warden you have to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.100 
playing as a Grey Warden you have to
save<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.340> world<00:01:33.369> but<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.300> way<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.510> do<00:01:34.900> that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
save the world but the way you do that

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.510 
save the world but the way you do that
sometimes<00:01:35.740> means<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.100> have<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.280> make<00:01:36.400> some

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
sometimes means you have to make some

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.859 
sometimes means you have to make some
pretty<00:01:36.850> tough<00:01:37.119> choices<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:40.630> with

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
pretty tough choices I think with

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.510 
pretty tough choices I think with
origins<00:01:41.320> what<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.650> managed<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.890> hit<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> note

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
origins what we managed to hit is a note

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.170 
origins what we managed to hit is a note
of<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:43.270> familiar<00:01:43.510> and<00:01:44.080> yet<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.740> uncanny<00:01:45.180> it's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
of the familiar and yet the uncanny it's

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.090 
of the familiar and yet the uncanny it's
certainly<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.259> game<00:01:47.560> that's<00:01:47.710> going<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:47.979> have

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
certainly a game that's going to have

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.040 
certainly a game that's going to have
elves<00:01:48.430> for<00:01:48.580> pointy<00:01:48.880> ears<00:01:49.090> yeah<00:01:49.450> we're<00:01:49.720> not
