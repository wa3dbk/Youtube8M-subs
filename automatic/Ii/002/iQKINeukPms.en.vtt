 and he showed that I know if I know the similarity ramiro with roland garros because they are 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:17.199
 advancing both the colt and facundo gonzález so be it in paris 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.300
 different places of the picture in this case you can face to continue with 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.419
 the breakthrough before the match is clear that both noted moment two are 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.829
 the strongest representatives of the Latin American legion 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.179
 in this case 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.270
 in new york where it would be after this triumph before it reflects 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.060
 would equal its best production the big apple died in 2002 born in 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.610
 that occasion in five sets against the center 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.500
 big who then lost with pistol pete sampras in semifinals and we'll see a 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.190
 solar that questions his destiny will go sadeq al ahmar 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.070
 and talking 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.350
 trying to play short points before a queen bomber that came from a 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.250
 duel 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.650
 with very solid victory against tomas berdych in three sets the own zelaya and 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.430
 that was the party would be the property of his property and fundamentally 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.770
 feeling very good and good serve roddick n 5 of the tournament and with that backhand 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.840
 parallel 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.860
 flaño with which goes from the conduction of martín Rodríguez 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.040
 grown a lot for gonzález one of the keys to a very good season that is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 association 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.040
 today since it made it difficult for children to be modest 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.950
 its 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.760
 activity on the circuit remembered that the pri had debuted with a victory without 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.120
 problems since it came to an end 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.040
 I would knock out 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.140
 as if it were reference to the winning right 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.320
 the queen bomber 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.350
 who knows what to do or partially shock against espanyol and tennis 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.140
 avoid the reverse 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.720
 to not be so defensive 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.190
 sometime 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.550
 that hit what is the incidence a lot of revenue especially support for the final 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.210
 of the open of australia 2007 now the variants allow him to fernando 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.230
 gonzález 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.230
 he signed p but for more than his ranch 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.510
 fiat to the next instance the queen bomber
