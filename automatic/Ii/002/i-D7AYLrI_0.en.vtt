00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:10.019
 grand am trend then rand 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.969
 there there there there there there there there there there 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.940
 there tadam there 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.740
 on air the most Jedi among military and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.460
 most military among Jedi headings 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.270
 enemies galio 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.600
 which refers to our experiments as 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.220
 it says yes will come with us strength and power 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 have no mind 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 it's all about us friends today we 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.650
 tell you how to deal with such 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.770
 here are the Jedi 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.140
 what's the main jedi power that's what he is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.390
 time convinced that he sticks out 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.809
 and of course I don't mean it 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.680
 the sword and this sword consisting of a ray of light 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.660
 do not bend as our illiterate thinks 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.950
 Jedi dear friends today we will show 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.739
 how to deal with these 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.270
 illiterate jedi every jedi 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.399
 can kill one simple 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.699
 the aquarium in which is typed green 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.780
 liquid is not yellow I do not know I'm color blind 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.699
 so I do not understand 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.010
 in order to understand friends like 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.540
 works the sword of the Jedi or rather how it 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.520
 overcome how to bend 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.820
 him a glowing beam for this we 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.150
 use a small probe of a jedi sword 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.060
 ordinary laser pointer 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.610
 This pointer also see shining direct 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.189
 beam this beam does not bend in any way but 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.340
 if we use our wonderful aquarium 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.570
 with a yellow tirah green liquid let's 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.330
 see what happens so ray 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.659
 straight line is absolutely a beam 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.420
 shines right just right he shines and 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.640
 passing through our water into this water 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.530
 added fluorescent which makes 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.250
 the beam shines brighter when it passes 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.740
 through this water and now attention 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.720
 gently lower the beam down our 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:01.580
 aquarium and see what happens 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:04.700
 happen with our ray we lower it 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.360
 not only that he bent he fell to the bottom 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.140
 aquarium bounced 1 aquarium and again 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.450
 went up as well, the spacecraft even lower once again became 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.450
 direct what is happening see it seemed 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.700
 would a straight beam lift up lift up 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.920
 raise opa opa opa 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.180
 bends look bends straight arms a 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.970
 if i try here 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.820
 direct up and direct the beam 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.310
 up but he doesn't want to go up 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.550
 look something does not give him and here 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.610
 last moment breaks breaks 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.220
 well come on ah breaks and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:44.120
 spreads again straightforwardly 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.450
 why is this so simple 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.360
 friends 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.450
 the beam behaves like that because it hit 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.510
 on the border of two different environments this is not 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.110
 just green water top water green 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.239
 but not salty but from below and it shows on 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.570
 actually if you look carefully 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.500
 there is a certain border below the water with 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.459
 by adding a large amount of salt 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.829
 supersaturated brine 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.959
 salty water is denser than fresh water 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.120
 that is why it is so easy to swim in 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.160
 dead sea so here are friends down water 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.680
 dense top it is less dense and on 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.200
 the interface is refracted 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.320
 ray of light why because speed 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.660
 beam propagation in this medium and in 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.060
 this environment is different therefore on the border 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.030
 there is actually scrapped that 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.450
 happens when i try out salty 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.209
 water 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.329
 ray go out into the water fresh occurs 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.280
 so-called internal reflection 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.670
 see the full internal reflection ray 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.530
 at one angle fits the border section 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.920
 a and from a different angle from this border 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.950
 leaves if we change the angle to 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.810
 critical then the beam won't come out at all 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.120
 another frontier he will be completely 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.620
 bounce off the inner border it's 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.330
 called total internal reflection 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.040
 ray 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.350
 precisely due to the complete inner 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.040
 reflection we sometimes see mirages 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.350
 during warm hot weather you are traveling 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.040
 on hot asphalt and suddenly you see 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.920
 puddle 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.230
 something glitters you think probably puddle 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.720
 brake drive and no puddle there 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.609
 no why because the sun's rays 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.240
 This case is not reflected from 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.250
 water surface and from the boundary of media 2 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.169
 as a matter of fact 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.630
 air masses of warm air and 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.250
 cold air from this here borders 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.680
 reflected light and you have a feeling 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.460
 it's actually a puddle can no 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.580
 there is no well, now it is clear how 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.950
 fight the Jedi suits you Jedi 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.430
 and says in my opinion you are from dark force 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.370
 you say hear you with a stick come here 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.340
 with a glowing what do you think I'm your 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.600
 stick do not bend that you take a Jedi 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.720
 together with a stick thrust here in these 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.060
 Wednesday 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.850
 which have a border between themselves and on 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.100
 this border he breaks his sword except 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.360
 take his head and dip it in 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.270
 this salt water three times 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.479
 no jedi against such means 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.180
 stand therefore my dear dark forces 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.320
 fight the Jedi with the help of light 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.320
 science physics
