tension<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.780> then<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> rear

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
tension on it and then you have a rear

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.270 
tension on it and then you have a rear
drag<00:01:47.570> which<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.020> bait<00:01:49.470> runner<00:01:49.710> style<00:01:50.009> rail

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
right here and this just flips back and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.520 
right here and this just flips back and
forth<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.899> flipped<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> back

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
forth so right now I flipped it back

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920 
forth so right now I flipped it back
that<00:01:56.189> turns<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.670> front<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.240> free<00:01:57.689> spool

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that turns the front in this free spool

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.410 
that turns the front in this free spool
mode<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.860> fish<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.850> pull<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.090> line

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
mode that fish can just pull out line

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.330 
mode that fish can just pull out line
and<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.290> adjust<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> tension<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.130> there

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and to adjust the tension on there

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
and to adjust the tension on there
there's<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.030> drag<00:02:03.329> back<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> can

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
there's a drag back here that you can

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.109 
there's a drag back here that you can
just<00:02:04.229> turn<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.740> tightening

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
just turn the tightening

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.980 
just turn the tightening
so<00:02:08.119> let's<00:02:08.300> say<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.420> want<00:02:08.540> to<00:02:08.600> tighten<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:08.930> up

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
so let's say I want to tighten that up

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.210 
so let's say I want to tighten that up
good<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.990> now<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.230> free<00:02:12.620> spool<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.040> lot

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
good so now that free spool is a lot

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.880 
good so now that free spool is a lot
tighter<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.730> pullout<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:15.110> what<00:02:15.440> happens<00:02:15.830> here

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
tighter the pullout so what happens here

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.560 
tighter the pullout so what happens here
let's<00:02:16.250> say<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.940> know<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.090> got<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.300> fish<00:02:17.540> running

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
let's say you know I got a fish running

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:28.900 
let's say you know I got a fish running
late<00:02:20.570> trying<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> big<00:02:21.050> rotor<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.410> here<00:02:27.790> fix<00:02:28.790> this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
late trying a big rotor on here fix this

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.450 
late trying a big rotor on here fix this
real<00:02:29.120> quick<00:02:29.620> okay<00:02:30.620> let's<00:02:30.890> say<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.070> have<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.190> fish

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
real quick okay let's say I have a fish

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.970 
real quick okay let's say I have a fish
run<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.850> here<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.590> pilling

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
run in here and it's just pilling

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.860 
run in here and it's just pilling
outline<00:02:34.370> as<00:02:34.880> soon<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.210> lift<00:02:35.360> up<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:35.720> your

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
outline as soon as you lift up on your

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.310 
outline as soon as you lift up on your
rod<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.590> turn<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> half<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.250> turn<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:39.080> heard

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
rod you turn a half a turn and you heard

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.020 
rod you turn a half a turn and you heard
that<00:02:39.470> click<00:02:39.740> actually<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> quarter<00:02:40.850> turn

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
that click actually is a quarter turn

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.060 
that click actually is a quarter turn
your<00:02:41.690> heard<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.990> click<00:02:42.260> what<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.650> did<00:02:42.890> is

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
your heard that click what that did is

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.100 
your heard that click what that did is
and<00:02:43.280> engage<00:02:43.910> your<00:02:44.120> front<00:02:44.390> drag<00:02:44.630> there<00:02:44.900> and

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
and engage your front drag there and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.270 
and engage your front drag there and
then<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.280> know<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.490> fish<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.850> fighting<00:02:47.270> you

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
then you know the fish is fighting you

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.620 
then you know the fish is fighting you
just<00:02:49.280> pulling<00:02:49.550> on<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> line<00:02:49.910> like<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.480> can

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
just pulling on a line like that you can

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.540 
just pulling on a line like that you can
adjust<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.110> as<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.440> fight<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.800> fish<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
adjust this as you fight the fish the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.980 
adjust this as you fight the fish the
way<00:02:52.670> if<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.880> have<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.090> loosen<00:02:53.270> or<00:02:53.570> tighten<00:02:53.600> it

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
way if you have to loosen or tighten it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.010 
way if you have to loosen or tighten it
but<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.770> got<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.040> do<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.220> lot<00:02:55.550> more<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.180> you

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
but you got to do a lot more of that you

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.410 
but you got to do a lot more of that you
know<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.200> really<00:02:57.500> tighten<00:02:57.740> it<00:02:57.890> down<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.850> that's

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
know to really tighten it down so that's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.760 
know to really tighten it down so that's
basically<00:02:59.750> what<00:02:59.959> a<00:02:59.990> big<00:03:00.200> runner<00:03:00.470> will<00:03:00.650> do

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
basically what a big runner will do

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.949 
basically what a big runner will do
compared<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:02.180> know<00:03:02.270> a<00:03:02.330> conventional

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
compared to you know a conventional

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.140 
compared to you know a conventional
really<00:03:03.320> you'd<00:03:03.470> find<00:03:03.709> in<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.950> store<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:05.090> I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
really you'd find in the store like I

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.290 
really you'd find in the store like I
said<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.630> just<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.580> rear<00:03:07.580> drag<00:03:07.850> system

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
said you just have that rear drag system

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.840 
said you just have that rear drag system
there<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:09.440> can<00:03:09.560> pull<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.920> out<00:03:10.010> as<00:03:10.430> soon<00:03:10.610> as<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
there you can pull it out as soon as it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.310 
there you can pull it out as soon as it
turns<00:03:12.700> flips<00:03:13.700> forward<00:03:14.030> you're<00:03:14.959> just<00:03:15.110> going<00:03:15.260> to

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
turns flips forward you're just going to

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.800 
turns flips forward you're just going to
have<00:03:15.470> your<00:03:15.650> ya<00:03:16.489> front<00:03:16.820> drag<00:03:17.030> system<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.660> way

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
have your ya front drag system that way

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.260 
have your ya front drag system that way
it's<00:03:17.989> nice<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.590> tight<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:19.580> that's<00:03:19.970> basically

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
it's nice and tight so that's basically

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.880 
it's nice and tight so that's basically
what<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.480> bait<00:03:20.690> runner<00:03:20.930> style<00:03:21.200> room<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:23.890> okay

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
what a bait runner style room is okay

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.680 
what a bait runner style room is okay
time<00:03:25.190> for<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.430> other<00:03:25.580> reel<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.269> sonic

time for the other reel this is a sonic
torn<00:03:26.959> is<00:03:27.080> eight<00:03:27.320> thousand<00:03:27.800> as<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.550> can<00:03:28.700> see

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
torn is eight thousand as you can see

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.759 
torn is eight thousand as you can see
here<00:03:29.150> there<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.390> no<00:03:29.630> bait<00:03:29.840> runner<00:03:30.140> on<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.500> it's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.710 
cast it out you know there's no give on
that<00:03:49.040> way<00:03:49.160> good<00:03:49.370> good<00:03:49.730> solid<00:03:50.120> cast<00:03:50.390> and

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
that way good good solid cast and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.780 
that way good good solid cast and
accurate<00:03:51.019> cast<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:52.070> then<00:03:52.160> what<00:03:52.310> happened<00:03:52.700> is

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
accurate cast and then what happened is

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.570 
accurate cast and then what happened is
you<00:03:53.360> set<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.810> down<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:54.080> your<00:03:54.200> pod<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.400> do<00:03:55.550> a

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
you set it down to your pod and you do a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.910 
you set it down to your pod and you do a
half<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.940> turn<00:03:56.150> so<00:03:57.140> at<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:57.380> point<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.800> can

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
half a turn so at that point you can

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.009 
half a turn so at that point you can
