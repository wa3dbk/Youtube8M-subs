00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.410
 simple hairstyles 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.279
 so good 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.279
 let's get first hairstyle 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.370
 first I'll split the hair in two 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.150
 the upper part of which shall be 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.610
 bigger 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.340
 more or less at ear level o 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.520
 hold and pass the remainder on one side 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.260
 Now I'm going to start a braid, but it's 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.260
 important that it is on the side 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.010
 now it's time for the little secrets I'm going 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.480
 loosen the braid thus making the effect 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.480
 more beautiful bigger 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.670
 now just release the rest of the hair and 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:17.810
 to a centralized low tail and to 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.650
 to finish 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.330
 just wrap the braid around the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.050
 elastic hair 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.050
 simple, right? 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.440
 If you do not have fringe the hairstyle already 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.530
 It's over but if you just like it 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.170
 I have a fringe and she gets loose 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.000
 I decided to give it one day I got the fringe and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.000
 Hold her high so 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.939
 it is obvious that we are going to the second 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.369
 stepson 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.770
 This is the fastest and most simple of all. 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.810
 and I think it looks even better for 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.759
 who does not have fringe what is not mine 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.710
 case but let's go 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.670
 first I'll separate the part of the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.299
 front of hair and I'll learn from it 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.299
 the chiquinho 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.519
 then it 's only you to pull both of them 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.519
 sides 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:37.709
 I think this is the easiest hairstyle to 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:40.160
 We all go to the third hairstyle and the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.160
 my favorite 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.890
 with split hair on the side 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.900
 I'll separate the front of the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:59.980
 hair and the rest I 'll learn to 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.980
 do not disrupt the process 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.900
 now just start making a braid 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.180
 very simple built-in people, I just go 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.120
 start a normal child and then I 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.970
 I add the wick out of the middle and 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.250
 this only on one side the side of the face and 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.019
 that the fringe will only be embedded 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.019
 side the other does not 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.799
 and I'll even do some as far as I can 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.799
 required 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.940
 Now I'm going to give you the one that's closed. 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:47.970
 more cute and loosen your hair 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.970
 Lift your hair up and so on 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.819
 then it's just the scandal of the staple and ready 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.670
 Let's go to the hairstyle room. 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:14.260
 with hair divided on the side or more 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.500
 or less on the side consumption is my 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.720
 In case I'm going to get the front of my hair and 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.720
 I'm going to twist like this. 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.590
 then only learn with great effort 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.380
 and if it could be another hairstyle like that 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.289
 in Asia, although it is an 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:56.830
 I'm going to do a good braid with the owner. 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:05:01.180
 rest of the children cry out 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.900
 I want to and now our fifth 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.900
 hairstyle 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:16.509
 I'm going to brush my hair all over one side and 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:19.150
 I will divide among them the first 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:21.990
 Part I'm going to part here not to 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.990
 to disturb people 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:30.699
 You deserve this second part and it will 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.750
 the third part so as not to disturb the 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:50.110
 people now I'm going to do a good braid 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:54.210
 tight then I'll drop the 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:57.219
 hair and make a side tail 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.530
 now I'm going to make a space and hold 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.990
 one more I think it 's silicone and 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.780
 Your new hair is bigger, you can do it. 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:11.610
 more times here I'm going to give a forced 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.960
 between one rubber band and another 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.870
 Let's go to our sixth and last 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.900
 hairstyle you stop here a wick in the 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.060
 middle on the whole head 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.860
 We'll use the rest I 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.099
 learn not to disturb 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.289
 now I'm going to start a braid 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:32.080
 normalzinho super simple people look at me 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.360
 I make the braid first 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.270
 I'll take a wick from the side and then 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.240
 together in the middle takes a wick from the other 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:43.210
 lateral and addition in the middle and thus the 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.300
 making simple fast and easy after 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.460
 I'm going to make a ponytail 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.490

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.130
