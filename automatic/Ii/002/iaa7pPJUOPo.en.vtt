00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
cadillac style once we started using the

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.710 
cadillac style once we started using the
truck<00:05:35.160> ativan<00:05:35.550> tight<00:05:35.760> these<00:05:36.330> were<00:05:36.540> designed

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
truck ativan tight these were designed

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.870 
truck ativan tight these were designed
to<00:05:36.960> carry<00:05:37.140> more<00:05:37.380> equipment<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:38.370> paramedic

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
to carry more equipment the paramedic

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.430 
to carry more equipment the paramedic
drug<00:05:39.090> box<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.690> heart<00:05:39.900> monitor<00:05:40.020> to

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
drug box the heart monitor to

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.710 
drug box the heart monitor to
defibrillator<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.610> very<00:05:42.360> sophisticated

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
defibrillator the very sophisticated

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.080 
defibrillator the very sophisticated
equipment<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.530> was<00:05:43.650> used<00:05:43.950> starting<00:05:44.400> in<00:05:44.490> 1969

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
equipment that was used starting in 1969

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.840 
equipment that was used starting in 1969
so<00:05:45.480> this<00:05:45.960> shows<00:05:46.290> really<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.770> transition<00:05:46.950> from

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
so this shows really the transition from

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.580 
so this shows really the transition from
basic<00:05:48.150> medical<00:05:48.450> transportation<00:05:48.810> to<00:05:49.260> modern

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
basic medical transportation to modern

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.310 
basic medical transportation to modern
EMS<00:05:50.120> this<00:05:51.120> one<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.390> the<00:05:51.480> first<00:05:51.690> time<00:05:51.900> that<00:05:52.170> you

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
can actually do something along the way

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.870 
can actually do something along the way
this<00:05:54.570> represents<00:05:55.290> 1969<00:05:56.160> when<00:05:56.400> we<00:05:56.490> started<00:05:56.790> to

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
this represents 1969 when we started to

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.790 
this represents 1969 when we started to
go<00:05:57.000> from<00:05:57.240> basic<00:05:57.600> ambulance<00:05:58.020> transportation
