what I'm going to do is I'm going to
avoid<00:00:52.090> my<00:00:52.360> teammates<00:00:52.810> like<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.410> plague<00:00:53.650> like

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
avoid my teammates like the plague like

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.310 
avoid my teammates like the plague like
they're<00:00:54.460> carrying<00:00:54.850> some<00:00:55.180> airborne<00:00:55.690> venereal

they're carrying some airborne venereal

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.600 
they're carrying some airborne venereal
disease<00:00:56.650> that's<00:00:56.890> going<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.190> make<00:00:57.280> me<00:00:57.340> really

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
disease that's going to make me really

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.810 
disease that's going to make me really
itchy<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:59.170> as<00:00:59.410> you<00:00:59.470> can<00:00:59.860> see<00:01:00.070> I'm<00:01:00.310> going<00:01:00.640> on<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
itchy so as you can see I'm going on the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.160 
itchy so as you can see I'm going on the
other<00:01:01.000> side<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.390> reason<00:01:01.600> why<00:01:01.720> I'm<00:01:01.810> doing<00:01:01.840> that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
other side the reason why I'm doing that

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.289 
other side the reason why I'm doing that
is<00:01:02.410> because<00:01:02.620> if<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.130> want<00:01:03.310> kills<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:04.030> must

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
is because if you want kills you must

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.230 
is because if you want kills you must
avoid<00:01:04.750> your<00:01:05.640> teammates<00:01:06.640> like<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.000> plague

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
silencer on so there's always someone

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.359 
silencer on so there's always someone
drawing<00:01:22.270> attention<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.929> then<00:01:23.319> once<00:01:24.130> the

enemy engages it engages sir to that

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.709 
enemy engages it engages sir to that
area<00:01:27.039> they're<00:01:27.909> going<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.090> be<00:01:28.210> attracted<00:01:28.299> to

that<00:01:28.869> largely<00:01:29.700> now<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.939> and<00:01:31.090> that's<00:01:31.240> why<00:01:31.420> I

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
that largely now that and that's why I

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.450 
that largely now that and that's why I
do<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.929> I<00:01:32.109> do<00:01:32.499> it<00:01:32.770> because<00:01:32.799> they're<00:01:33.219> going<00:01:33.399> to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
do that I do it because they're going to

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.149 
do that I do it because they're going to
attract<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.880> enemy<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.270> enemy's<00:01:34.630> eyes<00:01:34.810> are

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
attract the enemy the enemy's eyes are

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.199 
attract the enemy the enemy's eyes are
predominantly<00:01:36.159> going<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.579> be<00:01:36.670> focused<00:01:37.119> on

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
predominantly going to be focused on

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.539 
predominantly going to be focused on

your your teammates and the other reason

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.789 
your your teammates and the other reason
is<00:01:42.729> because<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.450> spawn<00:01:43.959> area<00:01:44.229> even<00:01:44.530> if<00:01:44.679> you're

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
is because the spawn area even if you're

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.580 
is because the spawn area even if you're
one<00:01:45.009> person<00:01:45.219> deep<00:01:45.609> in<00:01:45.819> the<00:01:45.939> spawn<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:47.289> enemy
