basis of a gun a damage output is basic

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.670 
basis of a gun a damage output is basic
and<00:00:50.399> everything<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> base<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.500> first

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and everything is of the base so first

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.200 
and everything is of the base so first
off<00:00:52.860> let's<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.340> straight<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.940> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
