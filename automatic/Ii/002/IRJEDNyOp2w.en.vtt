00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.969
 welcome to my new tutorials today 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.599
 let's do a photomontage of how 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.530
 ride a portrait our other girlfriend 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.120
 friend Brother 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.730
 comrades whatever it is that we 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.240
 we want and make an exception like that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.960
 this girl has been taken from has taken out that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.890
 picture with one is clear and it's fine 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.820
 tell them that this image I have removed 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 from a bank of images 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 in this same and with the truth we can already 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.770
 go down 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.430
 all power photographs 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.430
 with use with free use to be able to do 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.650
 in photomontages or whatever we want there 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.880
 certain photographs that can not be used 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.350
 for 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.350
 for for example 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.210
 Let's say to work with her and win 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.079
 money with her 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.960
 having said that 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:20.299
 let's start our our assembly 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.570
 for this we are going to use the tool 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.900
 this one that is here we were not going to make a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.020
 selection of the black zone 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.630
 of photography game 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.649
 let's bring the image a little closer to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.450
 to be able to see well the contours of the black 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.600
 go with the pen tool we start to 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.040
 make the solution 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.300
 already a lot of style 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.300
 to the other 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.950
 now next 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.950
 let say 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.140
 and what to do 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.720
 this will be our selection 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.940
 Right we spoke the 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.950
 checklists and we're going to tell you that 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.140
 accepted selection 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.690
 the draft radius that we're going to be 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.600
 between the pixels 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.670
 and we already have our selection 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.930
 old 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.600
 now it would not be the photo we want 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.210
 even in 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.950
 me in this case in this appointment that 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.770
 came to make a cut with the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.100
 rectangle tool like the frame 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.100
 rectangular 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.940
 you if you want to make a cut to 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.820
 the time to arrange how that is already 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.080
 to our liking I will do better 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.319
 quiet 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.590
 with the tool is not thing is hard 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.900
 well I came to leave here this I like 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.629
 this encounter and now we are going to copy 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.739
 this selection and now we go to the key 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:02.840
 center and drier we have already copied this 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.730
 selection may involve association 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.720
 well now live 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.730
 when we're going to embed inside that 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.800
 selection the photograph of the girl 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.280
 let's go to edition and let's say that 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.610
 keep stuck people 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.910
 as it has already hit us inside the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.760
 selection that we had and created us 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.760
 a layer and a layer mask 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.380
 well now we can do two things one 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.590
 leave it as it is 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.610
 resize this image for it what 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.220
 let's go edition 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.220
 in scale form 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.250
 we have the shooters here and we start 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.720
 arrive 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.720
 making it smaller 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.470
 and when we like it 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.470
 how is it 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.480
 A) Yes 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:14.520
 I like it like that, we double click on it and 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.370
 we have done our 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.730
 our effect on test tube and rather 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.320
 all 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.170
 good if you want to do some retouching 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.140
 you are always about to do it now 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.190
 with this layer indicated and without eyes like that 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.020
 how is it 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.600
 Well, that's all I hope you have 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.530
 liked and are the physicists a greeting and 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.530
 thanks to everyone
