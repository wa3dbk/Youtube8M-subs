00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
an easy trick on top of identified first

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:40.050 
an easy trick on top of identified first
of<00:00:28.679> all<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> used<00:00:29.250> some<00:00:29.460> guy<00:00:29.670> code

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:58.520 

this<00:00:40.540> is<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:40.720> metal<00:00:41.110> file<00:00:41.350> what<00:00:42.280> this<00:00:42.430> does

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.690 

those<00:00:59.530> guys<00:00:59.770> aren't<00:00:59.980> gonna<00:01:00.070> have<00:01:00.340> a<00:01:00.370> metal

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
those guys aren't gonna have a metal

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.300 
those guys aren't gonna have a metal
file<00:01:00.940> so<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.360> can<00:01:01.720> take<00:01:01.900> a<00:01:02.230> sanding<00:01:02.830> block<00:01:02.860> and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
file so you can take a sanding block and

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.400 
file so you can take a sanding block and
some<00:01:03.400> coarse<00:01:03.670> paper<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.870> can<00:01:05.020> do<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.230> same

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
some coarse paper you can do the same

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.480 
some coarse paper you can do the same
thing<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:10.750> highlight<00:01:11.020> just<00:01:11.800> trouble<00:01:12.070> area

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
thing gonna highlight just trouble area

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.440 
thing gonna highlight just trouble area
at<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.570> same<00:01:13.810> time<00:01:14.080> I<00:01:14.350> put<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.800> couple<00:01:15.040> events

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
at the same time I put a couple events

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.960 
at the same time I put a couple events
from<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.600> backside<00:01:17.110> out<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.860> show<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.610> shrink

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
from the backside out to show to shrink

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:31.410 
from the backside out to show to shrink
up<00:01:19.090> panel<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.350> highs<00:01:30.210> we're<00:01:31.210> going<00:01:31.360> to

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
up panel see the highs we're going to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.810 
up panel see the highs we're going to
start<00:01:31.600> out<00:01:31.750> by<00:01:31.780> actually<00:01:32.619> shrinking<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.640> two

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
start out by actually shrinking the two

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.690 
start out by actually shrinking the two
highs<00:01:34.060> down

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.520 

a<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:39.000> baseline<00:01:39.509> number<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.380> machine

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
a good baseline number for this machine

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.410 
a good baseline number for this machine
is

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.810 
is
for<00:01:41.810> shrinking<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.890> obviously<00:01:43.310> depending

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
for shrinking that obviously depending

00:01:43.820 --> 00:02:01.850 
for shrinking that obviously depending
on<00:01:43.970> how<00:01:44.570> thick<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.020> sheet<00:01:45.229> metal<00:01:45.409> is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.130 

you<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:02.130> air<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.490> cool<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.780> once<00:02:03.990> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you use air to cool it so once I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.759 
you use air to cool it so once I
strengthing<00:02:05.040> area<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:06.540> always<00:02:06.900> an<00:02:07.080> idea

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.270 

flat-panel<00:02:12.909> I'm<00:02:13.909> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.150> shrink<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.629> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
flat-panel I'm going to shrink the the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.720 
flat-panel I'm going to shrink the the
contact<00:02:16.280> point<00:02:17.620> around<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.920> then<00:02:19.219> satin

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
contact point around and then satin

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.729 
contact point around and then satin
Center<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.599> then<00:02:20.719> instantly<00:02:21.079> cool<00:02:21.530> over

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
Center and then instantly cool over

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.830 
Center and then instantly cool over
there<00:02:21.769> they<00:02:22.579> can<00:02:22.609> do<00:02:22.819> this<00:02:22.969> with<00:02:23.120> water<00:02:23.329> or<00:02:23.599> air

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
there they can do this with water or air

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:58.039 
there they can do this with water or air
either<00:02:24.709> way

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.449 

after<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.200> first<00:02:59.379> hit<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.980> feels<00:03:00.190> like<00:03:00.340> it

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
after that first hit it feels like it

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.460 
after that first hit it feels like it
needs<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.700> little<00:03:00.879> more<00:03:01.060> heat<00:03:01.299> I'm<00:03:01.989> not<00:03:02.170> used<00:03:02.379> to

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
needs a little more heat I'm not used to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:13.440 
needs a little more heat I'm not used to
this<00:03:02.620> machine

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:31.900 

sporting<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.480> backside

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.130 

one<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.060> used<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> timer

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
one that used to a timer

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.650 
one that used to a timer
this<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.830> use<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.130> Cadillac

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
this is to use the Cadillac

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.990 
this is to use the Cadillac
and<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.290> burn<00:03:37.530> through<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.980> name<00:03:38.220> what's

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
and that burn through this name what's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.650 
and that burn through this name what's
that<00:03:39.150> hold<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.510> down

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
that hold it down

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.420 
that hold it down
it'll<00:03:41.660> turn<00:03:41.810> off<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.230> tongue<00:03:42.410> yeah<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.160> did

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
it'll turn off the tongue yeah I did

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.059 
it'll turn off the tongue yeah I did
it's<00:03:43.550> finished<00:03:44.060> yeah<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.530> that's<00:03:45.709> why<00:03:45.860> if<00:03:45.920> you

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
it's finished yeah so that's why if you

00:03:46.069 --> 00:04:13.990 
it's finished yeah so that's why if you
turn<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.459> up<00:03:46.550> it's<00:03:46.760> time

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.580

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
then so once you've done your initial

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.390 
then so once you've done your initial

highlight to show you guys how big how
it<00:04:28.830> ends<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.730> or<00:04:30.120> isn't<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:34.290> sanding<00:04:34.710> block

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.030 

that's<00:04:40.030> pretty<00:04:40.330> good<00:04:40.870> she's<00:04:41.410> got<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.590> slight

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
that's pretty good she's got a slight

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.680 
that's pretty good she's got a slight
low<00:04:42.370> there<00:04:44.040> not<00:04:45.040> a<00:04:45.070> ton<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:46.210> can<00:04:46.420> get<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.600> the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
low there not a ton you can get to the

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.270 
low there not a ton you can get to the
backside<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.230> can<00:04:47.290> tap<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.740> with<00:04:47.830> it<00:04:48.010> with<00:04:48.250> a

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
backside you can tap it with it with a

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.210 
backside you can tap it with it with a
hammer<00:04:48.490> raise<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.030> back<00:04:49.120> up<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.510> little<00:04:49.630> bit<00:04:50.220> or

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
hammer raise it back up a little bit or

hammer raise it back up a little bit or
you<00:04:51.250> can<00:04:51.520> use<00:04:51.640> a<00:04:51.670> puller<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.420> actually<00:04:53.140> pull

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
you can use a puller and actually pull

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:02.580 
you can use a puller and actually pull
the<00:04:53.380> thing<00:04:53.650> back<00:04:53.860> out

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.740 

that's<00:05:03.010> actually<00:05:03.430> fairly<00:05:03.639> shallow<00:05:04.060> moving

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
that's actually fairly shallow moving

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.700 
that's actually fairly shallow moving
thus<00:05:04.870> within<00:05:05.200> tolerance<00:05:05.740> for<00:05:05.919> using<00:05:06.220> filler

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
thus within tolerance for using filler

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.820
