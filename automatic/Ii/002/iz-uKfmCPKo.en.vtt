next time you notice how stiff it is

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.740 
next time you notice how stiff it is
like<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.980> thing<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.550> budge<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.629> can

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
do anything to it make which makes me

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.229 
do anything to it make which makes me
think<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.620> d<00:00:49.860> head

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
think of it to be a really good d head

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.270 
think of it to be a really good d head
but<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.420> also<00:00:51.600> geared<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.860> offensive

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
but it's also geared for an offensive

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.330 
but it's also geared for an offensive
player<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.850> goes<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.890> forward

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
player just goes like the the forward

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.319 
player just goes like the the forward
can<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.760> see<00:00:59.940> right<00:00:59.969> there

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
can which is a you can see right there

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.429 
can which is a you can see right there
really<00:01:01.199> nice<00:01:01.399> pretty<00:01:02.399> aggressive<00:01:03.350> but<00:01:04.350> not

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
really nice pretty aggressive but not

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.560 
really nice pretty aggressive but not
too<00:01:04.619> aggressive<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.180> sidewall

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
too aggressive and then the sidewall

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.859 
too aggressive and then the sidewall
struts<00:01:06.869> right<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.400> they're<00:01:08.400> lined<00:01:08.780> kind<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
struts right here they're lined kind of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
struts right here they're lined kind of
and<00:01:10.200> well<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and well the way I like it it's just

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.770 
and well the way I like it it's just
simple<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.430> point<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.479> crazy

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
simple to the point not really crazy

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.520 
simple to the point not really crazy
like<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> reverse<00:01:16.619> them<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.450> then<00:01:18.470> up<00:01:19.470> here

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
like a reverse them and then up here

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.010 
like a reverse them and then up here
that<00:01:20.009> holds<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.210> top<00:01:21.390> straining<00:01:21.869> they're

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
that holds the top straining they're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.870 
that holds the top straining they're
pretty<00:01:22.229> big<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.100> probably<00:01:23.340> fit<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> those

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
pretty big you probably fit one of those

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.320

it<00:02:10.320> will<00:02:10.440> tie<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.710> Si<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.610> locked<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
it will tie in Si and then I locked the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.870 
it will tie in Si and then I locked the
first<00:02:12.540> SI<00:02:12.840> down<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.320> third<00:02:13.620> hole<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.340> then

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
first SI down to the third hole and then

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.540 
first SI down to the third hole and then
skip<00:02:15.300> SI<00:02:15.660> skip<00:02:16.080> SI<00:02:16.410> skip<00:02:16.800> si<00:02:17.510> si<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.960> si<00:02:19.550> si

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
skip SI skip SI skip si si one si si

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.110 
skip SI skip SI skip si si one si si
skip<00:02:21.270> thats<00:02:21.510> i<00:02:21.660> skip<00:02:21.990> SI<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.800> then<00:02:23.090> right<00:02:24.090> off

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
skip thats i skip SI and then right off

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.630 
skip thats i skip SI and then right off
that<00:02:24.360> SI<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.110> window<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.770> last<00:02:26.220> side<00:02:26.460> will

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
that SI I just window the last side will

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.000 
that SI I just window the last side will
hold<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.910> tied<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.060> off<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.810> then<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.500> nine

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
hold and tied it off and then just nine

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.270 
hold and tied it off and then just nine
diamond<00:02:29.220> bottom<00:02:29.640> string<00:02:31.040> didn't<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.130> my<00:02:32.220> usual

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
diamond bottom string didn't do my usual

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.580 
diamond bottom string didn't do my usual
just<00:02:32.910> do<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.450> two<00:02:33.930> loops<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.440> two

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
just do like the two loops with two

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.900 
just do like the two loops with two
different<00:02:34.740> strings<00:02:37.550> giving<00:02:38.550> back<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
different strings giving back to the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.960 
different strings giving back to the
head<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:40.500> really<00:02:40.950> good<00:02:41.070> styling<00:02:41.520> on<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.910> not

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
head a really good styling on it's not

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.820 
head a really good styling on it's not
like<00:02:42.090> I'm<00:02:42.300> at<00:02:42.510> plastic<00:02:42.540> if<00:02:43.500> anyone's

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.160 
like I'm at plastic if anyone's
wondering<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.150> regular<00:02:45.510> kind<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.959> shiny

wondering just the regular kind of shiny

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.770 
wondering just the regular kind of shiny
gloss<00:02:46.500> plastic<00:02:47.450> really<00:02:48.450> nice<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.750> looks

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
gloss plastic really nice that looks

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.130 
gloss plastic really nice that looks
really<00:02:48.989> futuristic<00:02:49.290> kind<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.190> Spacey<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:51.140> like

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
really futuristic kind of Spacey I like

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.910 
really futuristic kind of Spacey I like
that<00:02:52.170> um<00:02:52.910> like<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.000> jewel<00:02:54.300> here<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:55.739> mavs

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
that um like the jewel here the mavs

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.460 
that um like the jewel here the mavs
ones<00:02:56.220> crohns-like<00:02:56.930> inventive<00:02:57.930> thought<00:02:58.290> was

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
ones crohns-like inventive thought was

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.020 
ones crohns-like inventive thought was
nice<00:02:59.090> and<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.300> really<00:03:00.540> clean<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.290> just

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
nice and it's really clean like it just

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.500 
nice and it's really clean like it just
all<00:03:03.030> it's<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.570> streamlined<00:03:04.290> nice<00:03:04.680> design

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
all it's really streamlined nice design

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.300 
all it's really streamlined nice design
and<00:03:06.800> yeah<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.980> scoop<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.750> rounded<00:03:09.750> up<00:03:09.870> top<00:03:10.310> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
and yeah the scoop is rounded up top and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.500 
and yeah the scoop is rounded up top and
then<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.489> can't<00:03:11.640> really<00:03:11.730> see<00:03:11.850> what<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.239> top

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
then you can't really see what the top

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.990 
then you can't really see what the top
string<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:12.959> but<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:13.320> also<00:03:13.440> pointed<00:03:14.040> which<00:03:14.850> I

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
string in but it's also pointed which I

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.259 
string in but it's also pointed which I
think<00:03:15.209> just<00:03:15.420> helped<00:03:15.630> with<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> channel<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.170> lot

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
think just helped with the channel a lot

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.970 
think just helped with the channel a lot
maybe<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.510> will<00:03:18.750> too<00:03:18.930> much<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> loosen

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
maybe it will too much I have to loosen

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.289 
maybe it will too much I have to loosen
up<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:21.680> still<00:03:22.680> good<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.340> then<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.820> guess

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
up but still good and then I guess

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.620 
up but still good and then I guess
stenting<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:24.959> says<00:03:25.080> universal<00:03:26.239> just<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.360> full

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
stenting it says universal just the full

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.910 
stenting it says universal just the full
universal<00:03:28.140> try<00:03:28.260> thought<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.530> kind<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.709> cool

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
universal try thought was kind of cool

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.850 
universal try thought was kind of cool
different<00:03:29.190> haven't<00:03:30.000> really<00:03:30.150> seen<00:03:30.390> them<00:03:30.860> too

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
different haven't really seen them too

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.470 
different haven't really seen them too
many<00:03:32.040> heads<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.790> usually<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.269> like<00:03:33.450> a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
many heads have that usually just like a

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.530 
many heads have that usually just like a
ex<00:03:34.110> or<00:03:34.709> something<00:03:34.980> small<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:35.880> they<00:03:36.239> wrote<00:03:36.420> it

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
ex or something small but they wrote it

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.050 
ex or something small but they wrote it
all<00:03:36.630> inside<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.170> then<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:38.160> here<00:03:39.080> says<00:03:40.080> metric

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
all inside and then in here says metric

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.470 
all inside and then in here says metric
and<00:03:43.850> what<00:03:44.850> else<00:03:46.070> just<00:03:47.070> one<00:03:47.220> screw<00:03:47.580> hole<00:03:47.790> which

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
and what else just one screw hole which

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.090 
and what else just one screw hole which
is<00:03:48.630> fine<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.170> if<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.010> have<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.190> screw<00:03:50.670> like

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
is fine like if you have a screw like

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.979 
is fine like if you have a screw like
I'm<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.760> screwdriver<00:03:54.180> thing<00:03:54.600> in<00:03:54.720> your<00:03:54.840> house

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
I'm a screwdriver thing in your house

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.530 
I'm a screwdriver thing in your house
then<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:55.860> just<00:03:56.430> put<00:03:56.850> holes<00:03:57.030> or<00:03:57.209> everyone

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
then you can just put holes or everyone

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.850 
then you can just put holes or everyone
in<00:03:57.660> your<00:03:57.690> shaft<00:03:57.989> which<00:03:58.260> doesn't<00:03:58.500> really<00:03:58.590> bug

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
in your shaft which doesn't really bug

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.759 
in your shaft which doesn't really bug
me<00:03:58.890> might<00:03:59.610> bug<00:03:59.760> other<00:03:59.940> people<00:04:00.360> but<00:04:00.620> it's<00:04:01.620> not

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
me might bug other people but it's not

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.800 
me might bug other people but it's not
too<00:04:01.920> bad<00:04:02.040> for<00:04:02.100> me<00:04:02.340> um<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:05.280> pocket<00:04:05.910> took<00:04:06.360> me<00:04:06.540> a

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
too bad for me um the pocket took me a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.750 
too bad for me um the pocket took me a
little<00:04:06.989> while<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.440> get<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:08.010> it's<00:04:08.220> pretty<00:04:08.489> easy

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
little while to get but it's pretty easy

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.400 
little while to get but it's pretty easy
the<00:04:09.329> head<00:04:09.480> comes<00:04:09.630> with<00:04:09.810> all<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.930> sidewall

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
the head comes with all the sidewall

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.920 
the head comes with all the sidewall
holes<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.739> can<00:04:10.769> see<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.010> think<00:04:11.130> they're<00:04:11.280> just<00:04:11.930> 18

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
holes I can see I think they're just 18

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.969 
holes I can see I think they're just 18
or<00:04:13.140> something<00:04:13.530> which<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.130> nice<00:04:14.989> mm<00:04:15.989> which

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
or something which is nice mm which

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.680 
or something which is nice mm which
really<00:04:17.190> helps<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.640> also<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.000> mattress<00:04:18.510> you

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
really helps and also the mattress you

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.259 
really helps and also the mattress you
know<00:04:18.810> there

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269
