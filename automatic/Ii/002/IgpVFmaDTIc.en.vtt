00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
over and then I got a nestabilities and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.359 
over and then I got a nestabilities and
i<00:00:19.039> put<00:00:19.279> it<00:00:19.400> with<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:19.550> grooved<00:00:19.939> side<00:00:20.240> down<00:00:20.630> and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
just some white card stock I've already

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.010 
just some white card stock I've already
started<00:01:13.189> coloring<00:01:13.670> these<00:01:14.119> just<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.749> save<00:01:14.990> a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
started coloring these just to save a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.980 
started coloring these just to save a
little<00:01:15.229> bit<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.469> time<00:01:15.679> but<00:01:16.039> what<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:16.880> used<00:01:17.210> was<00:01:17.630> a

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
little bit of time but what I used was a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.819 
little bit of time but what I used was a
prismacolor<00:01:19.060> pencil<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:21.109> odorless

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
prismacolor pencil and the odorless

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.219 
prismacolor pencil and the odorless
paint<00:01:22.130> thinner<00:01:22.399> and<00:01:23.240> what<00:01:23.569> you<00:01:23.659> do<00:01:23.810> with<00:01:23.990> these

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
paint thinner and what you do with these

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.999 
paint thinner and what you do with these
is<00:01:24.499> you<00:01:24.799> just<00:01:25.100> draw<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.789> line<00:01:26.439> with<00:01:27.439> your<00:01:27.649> pencil

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
is you just draw a line with your pencil

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.550 
is you just draw a line with your pencil
and<00:01:28.490> then<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.179> get<00:01:29.359> your<00:01:29.390> stump<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.079> your

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
and then you get your stump and your

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.279 
and then you get your stump and your
odorless<00:01:31.069> thinner<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.939> you<00:01:32.659> can<00:01:32.840> see<00:01:33.109> you

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
odorless thinner and you can see you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.249 
odorless thinner and you can see you
just<00:01:33.460> rub<00:01:34.460> them<00:01:34.609> in<00:01:34.700> circles<00:01:34.999> and<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:35.810> thins

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
just rub them in circles and it thins

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.120 
just rub them in circles and it thins
out<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.569> pencil<00:01:38.569> so<00:01:38.869> it's<00:01:39.079> a<00:01:39.200> smooth<00:01:39.590> instead

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
out the pencil so it's a smooth instead

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.480 
out the pencil so it's a smooth instead
of<00:01:40.219> a<00:01:40.420> bold<00:01:41.420> line<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.829> can<00:01:42.979> do<00:01:43.159> them<00:01:43.369> at

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
of a bold line and you can do them at

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.849 
of a bold line and you can do them at
any<00:01:44.200> intensity<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.439> you<00:01:45.499> kind<00:01:45.679> of<00:01:45.710> have<00:01:45.770> a

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
any intensity so you kind of have a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.800 
any intensity so you kind of have a
little<00:01:45.979> light<00:01:46.340> then<00:01:47.240> I'm<00:01:47.359> going<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.539> take<00:01:47.749> a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
little light then I'm going to take a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.940 
little light then I'm going to take a
green<00:01:48.259> pencil<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:50.049> do<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.200> inside<00:01:51.709> of<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
green pencil and do the inside of the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.090 
green pencil and do the inside of the
flower<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:53.439> normally<00:01:54.439> i<00:01:54.469> would<00:01:54.679> get<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.829> little

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
flower and normally i would get a little

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.940 
flower and normally i would get a little
buffing<00:01:55.490> block<00:01:55.609> and<00:01:56.030> buff<00:01:56.689> that<00:01:56.719> off<00:01:57.049> but<00:01:57.709> it's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
buffing block and buff that off but it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.679 
buffing block and buff that off but it's
okay<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.579> shows<00:01:58.789> a<00:01:58.819> little<00:01:59.209> because<00:01:59.359> it's

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
okay if it shows a little because it's

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.769 
okay if it shows a little because it's
going<00:01:59.779> to<00:01:59.869> be<00:01:59.959> covered<00:02:00.770> anyhow<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.600> then<00:02:02.600> I'm

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
going to be covered anyhow and then I'm

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.629 
going to be covered anyhow and then I'm
going<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.990> do<00:02:03.079> it<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.289> this<00:02:03.499> one<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:04.520> you

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
going to do it on this one just so you

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:12.400 
going to do it on this one just so you
can<00:02:04.789> see<00:02:04.850> but<00:02:05.389> I<00:02:05.600> did<00:02:06.109> this<00:02:06.259> on<00:02:06.469> both<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:06.709> them

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.260 

and<00:02:13.410> then<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.130> do<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.600> glue

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and then what we do is we get the glue

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.160 
and then what we do is we get the glue
or<00:02:18.270> any<00:02:18.900> kind<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.200> adhesive<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.960> oh<00:02:21.960> actually

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
before I do that we're going to use the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.510 
before I do that we're going to use the
color<00:02:24.270> box<00:02:25.520> fluid<00:02:26.520> chalk<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:28.010> we're<00:02:29.010> going<00:02:29.250> to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
color box fluid chalk and we're going to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.120 
color box fluid chalk and we're going to
just<00:02:30.030> ink<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.510> edges<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:33.800> just<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.920> make

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
just ink the edges of this just to make

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:44.420 
just ink the edges of this just to make
it<00:02:35.250> stand<00:02:35.580> out<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.820> little<00:02:36.000> okay<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:44.010> then

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
it stand out a little okay and then

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.040 
it stand out a little okay and then
we're<00:02:44.640> going<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.970> go<00:02:45.150> ahead<00:02:45.510> now<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:47.900> put<00:02:48.900> some

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
we're going to go ahead now and put some

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.550 
we're going to go ahead now and put some
adhesive<00:02:49.200> on<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:54.110> we're<00:02:55.110> going<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.260> put

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
adhesive on this and we're going to put

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.430 
adhesive on this and we're going to put
it<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.220> center<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.090> onto<00:02:57.540> our<00:02:57.570> card

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.070 

ok<00:03:01.440> now<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.790> another<00:03:03.120> little<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:04.050> really

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
ok now it's another little not really

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.330 
ok now it's another little not really
centered<00:03:04.770> there<00:03:04.980> we<00:03:05.100> go<00:03:06.320> ok<00:03:07.320> then<00:03:08.070> we're<00:03:08.220> going

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
centered there we go ok then we're going

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.550 
centered there we go ok then we're going
to<00:03:08.430> take<00:03:08.640> our<00:03:08.880> other<00:03:09.300> flower<00:03:09.990> which<00:03:10.380> my

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
to take our other flower which my

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.060 
to take our other flower which my
daughter<00:03:10.830> cut<00:03:11.220> out<00:03:11.370> for<00:03:11.670> me<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.800> we're<00:03:13.800> going

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
daughter cut out for me and we're going

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.930 
daughter cut out for me and we're going
to<00:03:14.100> get<00:03:14.490> some<00:03:14.640> adhesive<00:03:15.500> dimensionals<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
to get some adhesive dimensionals and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.640 
to get some adhesive dimensionals and
you<00:03:17.940> can<00:03:18.090> do<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.300> at<00:03:18.420> any<00:03:18.540> thickness<00:03:18.990> on<00:03:19.440> these

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
you can do it at any thickness on these

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.010 
you can do it at any thickness on these
ones<00:03:19.950> i<00:03:20.070> did<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> thin<00:03:20.550> one<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.090> then<00:03:21.570> i<00:03:21.660> curled

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
ones i did a thin one and then i curled

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.140 
ones i did a thin one and then i curled
up<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.200> edges<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:23.400> one<00:03:23.580> I'm<00:03:23.670> doing<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.940> little

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
up the edges this one I'm doing a little

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.530 
up the edges this one I'm doing a little
bit<00:03:24.300> thicker<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:25.490> little<00:03:26.490> fatter<00:03:26.760> dimensional

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
bit thicker a little fatter dimensional

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.990 
bit thicker a little fatter dimensional
so<00:03:27.750> it'll<00:03:27.959> stick<00:03:28.260> out<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> little<00:03:28.590> bit<00:03:28.890> more<00:03:29.100> and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
so it'll stick out a little bit more and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000 
so it'll stick out a little bit more and
then<00:03:30.060> take<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.930> adhesive<00:03:31.380> off<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:31.800> line

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
then take the adhesive off and then line

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.210 
then take the adhesive off and then line
it<00:03:32.040> up<00:03:32.280> with<00:03:32.340> your<00:03:32.640> other<00:03:32.790> stamp<00:03:33.920> clips<00:03:34.920> right

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
it up with your other stamp clips right

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.050 
it up with your other stamp clips right
here<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.040> kind<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.340> makes<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.850> three

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
here so it kind of makes it three

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.900 
here so it kind of makes it three
dimensional<00:03:39.630> looking<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.140> way<00:03:40.430> then<00:03:41.430> we're

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
dimensional looking that way then we're

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.070 
dimensional looking that way then we're
going<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.120> get<00:03:42.330> some<00:03:44.300> stickles<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.930> can

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
going to get some stickles and you can

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.740 
going to get some stickles and you can
use<00:03:46.200> any<00:03:46.350> color<00:03:46.680> I'm<00:03:46.860> just<00:03:47.040> doing<00:03:47.310> some

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
I'm sure we could go a little shorter

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.980 
I'm sure we could go a little shorter
even<00:04:48.190> okay<00:04:49.150> then<00:04:49.390> we're<00:04:49.570> going<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.750> get<00:04:49.870> our

Diamond<00:04:50.410> glaze<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:51.840> we're<00:04:52.840> going<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.050> just

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
Diamond glaze and we're going to just

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.380 
Diamond glaze and we're going to just
put<00:04:53.500> a<00:04:53.530> little<00:04:53.590> bit<00:04:53.890> of<00:04:53.950> glaze<00:04:54.220> on<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.820> flower

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
put a little bit of glaze on the flower

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.240 
put a little bit of glaze on the flower
and<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.940> could<00:04:58.120> curl<00:04:58.480> up<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.780> edges<00:04:59.250> before

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
and you could curl up the edges before

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.520 
and you could curl up the edges before
you<00:05:00.640> do<00:05:00.820> this<00:05:01.000> like<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.480> did<00:05:01.720> on<00:05:01.750> my<00:05:01.870> other<00:05:02.200> ones

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
you do this like I did on my other ones
