outside edge of the dent and his hammer
taps<00:02:12.450> about<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> quarter-inch<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:14.099> little

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
taps about a quarter-inch in a little

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.180 
taps about a quarter-inch in a little
bit<00:02:14.520> higher<00:02:15.209> approximately<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.620> he<00:02:16.800> hears

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
bit higher approximately and so he hears

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.920 
bit higher approximately and so he hears
the<00:02:17.370> hammer<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.790> here's<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> dolly<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.660> he

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the hammer and here's the dolly and he

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.770 
the hammer and here's the dolly and he
follows<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> around<00:02:19.920> working<00:02:20.730> himself<00:02:20.940> into

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
follows it around working himself into

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.570 
follows it around working himself into
the<00:02:21.900> middle<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.920> course<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.400> see

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
the middle and of course you can see

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.309 
the middle and of course you can see
that's<00:02:23.730> almost<00:02:24.300> completely<00:02:24.660> gone<00:02:24.780> and

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
that's almost completely gone and

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.320 
that's almost completely gone and
they'll<00:02:25.470> take<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.769> file<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:26.700> not<00:02:26.880> filed<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
they'll take a file it's not filed to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.850 
they'll take a file it's not filed to
finish<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.750> up<00:02:27.870> when<00:02:28.110> they're<00:02:28.230> real<00:02:28.380> deep<00:02:28.650> at

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
finish it up when they're real deep at

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.509 
finish it up when they're real deep at
about<00:02:29.099> Oh<00:02:29.360> quarter<00:02:30.360> inch<00:02:30.739> or<00:02:31.739> more<00:02:32.160> eighth

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
about Oh quarter inch or more eighth

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.460 
about Oh quarter inch or more eighth
inch<00:02:32.819> or<00:02:33.030> more<00:02:33.209> somewhere<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:33.930> distance

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
inch or more somewhere in this distance

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.140 
inch or more somewhere in this distance
you<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.160> use<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> hammer<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.730> get<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you have to use a hammer to get it out a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.880 
you have to use a hammer to get it out a
little<00:02:36.299> bit<00:02:36.450> but<00:02:37.049> if<00:02:37.230> they're<00:02:37.410> less<00:02:37.620> than<00:02:37.799> that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
little bit but if they're less than that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.190 
little bit but if they're less than that
you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.160> use<00:02:38.310> strictly<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.150> shrinking<00:02:39.930> file

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
you can use strictly the shrinking file

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.310 
you can use strictly the shrinking file
and<00:02:40.470> we'll<00:02:40.590> grab<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.860> tool
