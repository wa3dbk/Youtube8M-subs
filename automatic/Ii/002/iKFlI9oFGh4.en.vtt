 of course it simply doesn't say anything else 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.159
 less attention paid to it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.799
 I must honestly admit to the previous one 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.710
 publisher okay who had it down with 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.330

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.350
 the story we can already of you short 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.409
 Break-up file Stanford ate the fight 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 against doctor maybe and maria dollars 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.369
 used to put the world in it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.270
 unhappy 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.159
 yes vote Korea it is not even so 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.250

 ok no i don't have it man i have it 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.590
 1968 made yes it is I know 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.730
 that was the year that 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.860
 francis chichester sir francis 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.020
 chichester 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.680
 for the first time alone the world 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.910
 had sailed around and that's why we were here 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.400
 So 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.720
 come across franciscus tietjerkstradeel 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.480
 yes exactly the world on his own 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.970
 around his mouth d often actually 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.000
 and topicality use entire agent 327 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.860
 very often could 10 if I am now 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.820
 reread thing to god what was it 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.680
 again 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.360
 that hat is not that one 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.040
 problem if you have albums from the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.600
 oblivion because we would say there 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.340
 again running out on that very much 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.130
 references have been lost in what 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.570
 i always try it is fun anyway 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.260
 let it stay for the people who do it 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.750
 do not understand 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.440
 ok so there are so many things in it 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.300
 I myself have forgotten that I am watching 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.950
 here you will be referred to the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.540
 television buses 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.390
 yes to living that is of course not 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.330
 bussum no i need that whole family 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.549
 when it was still 327 plus your agent 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.400
 of course started as a fur parody 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.680
 yes it has started the magazine prep 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.080
 make a spoof my early 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.100
 story four pages with a parody 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.970
 on james bond 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.110
 and yes I did, and the following month 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.530
 want to have another one 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.239
 and yes, but then another forty 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.519
 fifteen years later I am still making 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.019
 what is the fun of drawing for you? 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.530
 today and three bottles 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.269
 After all these years it still never 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.239
 unfortunately but it never did 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:31.970
 becomes a real routine always works 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.320
 you never really have to learn it every time 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.590
 you start again 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.360
 ok but it also keeps you fresh that me 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.820
 hope so too 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.580
 friesland you also see that he does that 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.720
 He also changed over the years 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:50.410
 have feel enthusiastic and squared 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.850
 and he now draw the curve for it 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.530
 but I already had it once 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.550
 because to first course of approximately 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.380
 same situation 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.180
 but then he had none on the only menu 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.190
 got very big feet 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.360
 get the core of i got it from one 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.100
 moment at the other moment I have them 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.830
 feet small easy again crazy yes 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.620
 then that will give you a certain form like 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.950
 a war becomes too big or they level 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.070
 you notice, when you need yourself 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.260
 correct and there is also a thick file 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.440

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.240

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.790

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.480
 of the agent 327 are natural 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.260
