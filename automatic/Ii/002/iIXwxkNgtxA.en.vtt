okay<00:02:49.819> there's<00:02:50.269> our<00:02:50.390> arrow<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:51.859> we're<00:02:52.069> just

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
okay there's our arrow and we're just

00:02:52.189 --> 00:03:10.020 
okay there's our arrow and we're just
going<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.430> tape<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.939> onto<00:02:53.739> our<00:02:54.739> thing

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.180 

this<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.210> like<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.840> best<00:03:12.020> thing<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.260> do<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.860> a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
this is like the best thing to do in a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.540 
this is like the best thing to do in a
hurry

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
hurry

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.570 
hurry
um<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.510> think<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.900> looks<00:03:15.020> pretty<00:03:15.170> nice<00:03:15.580> myself

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
um I think it looks pretty nice myself

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.059 
um I think it looks pretty nice myself
and<00:03:17.480> something<00:03:17.870> you'll<00:03:17.990> notice<00:03:18.319> these<00:03:19.010> are

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
and something you'll notice these are

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.730 
and something you'll notice these are
angles<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:19.910> you'll<00:03:20.660> do<00:03:20.840> better<00:03:21.140> if<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.560> can

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
angles so you'll do better if you can

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.520 
angles so you'll do better if you can
get<00:03:21.920> people<00:03:22.069> to<00:03:22.280> spin<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.959> side<00:03:24.230> over

get people to spin it on this side over

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.990 
get people to spin it on this side over
here<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.780> there<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.020> go<00:03:27.370> do<00:03:28.370> your<00:03:28.459> drawing<00:03:28.790> and
