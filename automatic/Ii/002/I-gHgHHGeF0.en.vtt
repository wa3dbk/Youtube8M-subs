reminders in iOS and you can add items
to<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.510> easily<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.290> before<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:57.770> even<00:00:57.890> get<00:00:58.250> to

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
to it easily but before you even get to

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.580 
to it easily but before you even get to
adding<00:00:58.790> items<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.300> think<00:00:59.660> you<00:00:59.720> take<00:00:59.960> a<00:00:59.989> look<00:01:00.380> at

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
adding items I think you take a look at

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.410 
adding items I think you take a look at
the<00:01:00.920> accounts<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:01.700> you're<00:01:01.850> going<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.120> use

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
for reminders and when you run accounts

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.830 
for reminders and when you run accounts

you could use potentially say Yahoo or
something<00:02:13.159> and<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:14.030> those<00:02:14.629> things<00:02:14.930> link

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
something and have those things link

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.490 
something and have those things link
across<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.489> use<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.270> device<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:17.630> also<00:02:18.230> has

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
across and use the device that also has

you can do that by using natural

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.290 
you can do that by using natural
language<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.160> i<00:03:10.490> could<00:03:10.970> say<00:03:11.120> something<00:03:11.180> like

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
language so i could say something like

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.620 
language so i could say something like
and<00:03:15.010> say<00:03:16.010> at<00:03:16.900> let's<00:03:17.900> say<00:03:18.140> four<00:03:18.740> pm<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:20.480> can

and say at let's say four pm and you can

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.500 
and say at let's say four pm and you can
see<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.110> translated<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:22.100> 4pm<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.730> actual<00:03:23.270> time

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
see it translated the 4pm to actual time

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.260 
see it translated the 4pm to actual time
stuck<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.020> underneath<00:03:24.470> there<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.340> i<00:03:26.120> can

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
stuck it underneath there and i can

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.870 
stuck it underneath there and i can
actually<00:03:26.390> get<00:03:26.630> info<00:03:27.080> on<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.770> then<00:03:28.520> see

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
actually get info on this and then see

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.480 
actually get info on this and then see
that<00:03:29.120> it's<00:03:29.390> going<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.720> remind<00:03:30.050> me<00:03:30.320> at<00:03:31.190> that

certain times and also set priorities

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.180 
certain times and also set priorities
for<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.540> notes<00:03:39.200> if<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:39.860> isn't<00:03:40.160> enough

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190
