almost<00:01:25.890> read<00:01:26.700> about<00:01:26.880> where<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.179> the<00:01:27.780> outside

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
almost read about where this the outside

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.400 
almost read about where this the outside
rim<00:01:28.590> strip<00:01:28.830> here<00:01:29.039> starts<00:01:29.989> start<00:01:30.989> letting<00:01:31.319> out

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
rim strip here starts start letting out

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the wheel or the early controller slowly

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609 
the wheel or the early controller slowly
because<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:36.360> car<00:01:36.569> begins<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.050> fishtail<00:01:37.560> a

little with it left a little bit right

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.320 
little with it left a little bit right
and<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:01.739> pour<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.209> way

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
and you just pour it in all the way
