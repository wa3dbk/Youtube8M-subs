glass to read autolink but there's a7
stamp<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.410> finished<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.010> at<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> 100

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
stamp on it and I finished it at a 100

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
stamp on it and I finished it at a 100
tip<00:00:28.070> it's<00:00:29.070> good<00:00:29.310> quality<00:00:29.460> hard<00:00:29.880> rubber<00:00:30.380> but<00:00:31.380> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
tip it's good quality hard rubber but I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
tip it's good quality hard rubber but I
finished<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.030> much<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.719> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
finished it in a way that's much more I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.750 
finished it in a way that's much more I
found<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> plays<00:00:35.160> much<00:00:35.399> more<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
found that it plays much more like a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.119 
found that it plays much more like a
virginal<00:00:36.480> slant<00:00:36.780> signature<00:00:37.170> link<00:00:37.380> because

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
virginal slant signature link because

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.400 
virginal slant signature link because
the<00:00:38.250> battle<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.640> very<00:00:38.820> low<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.270> long<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the battle is very low and long and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.190 
the battle is very low and long and
subtle<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:42.149> has<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.600> what<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> would

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
subtle so it has kind of what I would

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.020 
subtle so it has kind of what I would
say<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.620> slightly<00:00:44.129> less<00:00:44.370> aggressive<00:00:44.850> sound

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
say is a slightly less aggressive sound

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.750 
say is a slightly less aggressive sound
and<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> lot<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> early<00:00:46.559> babbling<00:00:47.129> said<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.430> just

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and a lot of early babbling said it just

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.310 
and a lot of early babbling said it just
seems<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> play<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> lot<00:00:48.690> more<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> slant

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
seems to play a lot more like a slant

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.790 
seems to play a lot more like a slant
I'm<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> demonstrate<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800
