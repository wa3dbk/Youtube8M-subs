00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello my name is stefan winter in 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.839
 a managing director of limbic 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.990
 entertainment area development studio 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:17.250
 take off 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:19.619
 and you guys watch in ubisoft with 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.900
 might magic heroes 7 go the adventures 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.000
 in shaan in the next round and it 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.880
 a lot has happened 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 at the gamescom 2014 the game became 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 first presented and we were allowed 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.289
 of course, already a first look 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.719
 throw on it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.550
 the gameplay oriented you 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.350
 this time strongly on the classics 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 the best elements of the past 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.640
 parts have been united the whole thing is new 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.410
 supported by the at real 3 engine 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 with the game in a new one 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.760
 glorious appearance shines the use 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.320
 This engine does not only allow about 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.239
 a better graphic but affects itself 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 also on the whole story telling and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.870
 on the atmosphere within the game 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.180
 from what we imagine 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.579
 we have an interview with stefan 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.660
 winter the ceo of limbic entertainment 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.820
 found out 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.710
 So that's what we saw today 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.010
 is basically good examples 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.140
 for the idea that we are storytelling 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.540
 within the campaigns and 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.799
 within the individual scenarios 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.450
 really much more 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.350
 also want to try on the adventure 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.939
 to bring web 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 that is what we have seen there 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.860
 then the bridge breaks the titans 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.410
 attack 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.180
 I see the catapult defending and 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.040
 you get the feeling of a story 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.140
 something happens it has everything in it 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.180
 context and it just will not 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.520
 via speaker or via a textbox 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.260
 solved but I just experience it 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.420
 a little bit more of this adventure 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.040
 web world the mets have to be packed 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420
 there must be a lot going on there are many things 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.340
 To visit many places and things 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.720
 to take control 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.430
 but it is also part of it you want 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.930
 create a little bit of life you want that 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.840
 a little something is animated is 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 really what we live so lively 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.610
 and of course that will happen 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.710
 weather effects also particle effects 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.140
 those that this transition between 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.810
 we have his motifs green setting 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.479
 seen today then into the new mountain 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.610
 setting to the arabia night 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.220
 inspired setting so we try 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.170
 easy to pick up on the atmosphere and 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.340
 then synonymous with effects with which one 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.930
 to tell a story 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 then it can be one 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.930
 give avalanche and then it is gone 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.060
 blocked and you have to think about something 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.070
 as you get further next to the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.930
 Events on the adventure nap are allowed 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.620
 Of course we are not the fighting system either 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.390
 to forget 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.420
 here too, there is a lot of new things to do 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.310
 Report everything that is fighting 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.190
 ultimately on the completely mez instead 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.080
 that is the tactical element of all 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.150
 heroes have always been playing around 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.070
 just concerns the construction of the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.540
 maps to be a bit more flexible 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.580
 we can be completely maps in 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.930
 different sizes but also from the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.670
 layout partly you have there 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.799
 little labyrinth structure my name is 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.720
 I have to decide which way 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.280
 because with my units 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.380
 it is also in the direction to go more 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.519
 in this cover system we will be there 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.380
 do a little more 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.780
 actually planking is actually 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.260
 new new video on the discussed 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.180
 has been 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.739
 there it will be interesting then I manage 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.590
 it maybe a detour behind 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.450
 an opposing group to come so jesus 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.489
 always been a bay principle 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.140
 the smart and think about what you do 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.850
 and we think we have another one 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.970
 few nice things on the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.799
 completely web just brought in 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.690
 might and magic heroes 7 will be six 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.209
 However, fractions do not give any of them 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.590
 Four established refuge academy 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.239
 bastion and metropolis 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.220
 her the community now has the 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.590
 possibility over the fifth faction and 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.290
 vote later on the sixth applies 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.420
 for that on mmh seven point com and true 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.849
 for your favorite silvaner or 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.019
 mountain fortress over the sixth and last 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.379
 The faction will become a later one 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.480
 time matched with the magic uas7 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.060
 all fans of the series come again 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.920
 it seems full at its cost in 2015 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.150
 for the pc and as soon as it's something new too 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.200
 report tells her that of course 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.200
 here with us
