because<00:02:45.850> as<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.510> advance<00:02:46.780> through<00:02:47.170> the

because as you advance through the

because as you advance through the
stages<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.280> speed<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.730> which<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.030> missiles

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
stages the speed of which the missiles

stages the speed of which the missiles
fall<00:02:49.720> gradually<00:02:50.320> increases<00:02:51.220> as<00:02:51.489> does<00:02:51.940> the

fall gradually increases as does the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.229 
fall gradually increases as does the
quantity<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:53.010> later<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.250> you'll<00:02:54.730> even<00:02:55.000> find

kind of sucks but overall this is a

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.229 
kind of sucks but overall this is a
great<00:03:52.989> port<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.530> an<00:03:53.620> arcade<00:03:53.739> classic<00:03:54.519> the

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
great port of an arcade classic the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
arcade feel I especially like the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.550 
arcade feel I especially like the
artwork<00:04:00.310> on<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.670> label<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.569> kind<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.110> reminds

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
artwork on the label it kind of reminds

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.729 
artwork on the label it kind of reminds
me<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.739> Star<00:04:03.129> Wars<00:04:03.870> speaking<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:04.989> which<00:04:05.170> guess

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
me of Star Wars speaking of which guess

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.500 
me of Star Wars speaking of which guess
what<00:04:06.010> I'll<00:04:06.190> be<00:04:06.430> reviewing<00:04:06.940> next<00:04:08.730> go<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:09.940> have<00:04:10.480> a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
what I'll be reviewing next go on have a

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.229 
what I'll be reviewing next go on have a
guess<00:04:12.269> that's<00:04:13.269> right<00:04:13.569> so<00:04:14.500> till<00:04:14.709> next<00:04:14.920> time<00:04:15.280> may

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
guess that's right so till next time may

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.260 
guess that's right so till next time may
the<00:04:16.269> force<00:04:16.450> be<00:04:16.780> with<00:04:16.900> you
