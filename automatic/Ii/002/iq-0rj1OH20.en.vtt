which<00:03:35.830> is<00:03:35.950> actually<00:03:36.220> really<00:03:36.489> convenient

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
which is actually really convenient

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:46.990 
which is actually really convenient
I<00:03:37.739> see<00:03:38.739> why

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.700 

all<00:03:48.000> right

so<00:04:19.220> here<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:21.209> C<00:04:21.450> chart<00:04:21.980> this<00:04:22.980> is<00:04:23.040> actually

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
so here is the C chart this is actually

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.580 
so here is the C chart this is actually
really<00:04:23.790> cool<00:04:24.000> because<00:04:24.260> hmm<00:04:25.310> it's<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.400> a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
really cool because hmm it's like a

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.010 
really cool because hmm it's like a
little<00:04:28.590> wolves<00:04:29.010> in<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.250> world<00:04:29.780> they<00:04:30.780> try

little wolves in the world they try
something<00:04:31.080> this<00:04:31.680> actually<00:04:32.010> paid<00:04:32.280> off<00:04:32.310> pretty

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
something this actually paid off pretty

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.870 
something this actually paid off pretty

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
you want to head towards the X that's

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.490 
you want to head towards the X that's
the<00:04:45.000> first<00:04:45.270> thing<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.720> do<00:04:47.540> here

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
the first thing that I do here

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.790 
the first thing that I do here
and<00:04:50.040> as<00:04:50.250> Bentley<00:04:50.550> was<00:04:50.700> saying<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:52.290> wind<00:04:52.500> blows

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.430 
and as Bentley was saying the wind blows
from<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.580> south<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.810> means<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.200> have<00:04:55.320> to

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
it's not as accurate most the time these

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.699 
it's not as accurate most the time these
cans<00:06:16.999> will<00:06:17.209> walk<00:06:17.360> on<00:06:17.629> to<00:06:17.839> it<00:06:17.959> automatically<00:06:18.499> as

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:18.709 
cans will walk on to it automatically as

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:24.360 
cans will walk on to it automatically as
long<00:06:18.860> as<00:06:18.949> you<00:06:19.069> a<00:06:19.309> my<00:06:19.669> right<00:06:19.899> so

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:33.210 

let's<00:06:25.500> make<00:06:26.500> our<00:06:26.650> way<00:06:26.680> this<00:06:27.010> way<00:06:30.720> and<00:06:32.070> come<00:06:33.070> on

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
let's make our way this way and come on

00:06:33.220 --> 00:07:01.940 
let's make our way this way and come on
turn<00:06:35.580> move<00:06:52.830> that's<00:06:53.830> the<00:06:54.100> two<00:06:54.310> options<00:06:54.669> you<00:06:54.760> get

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.460 

so<00:07:02.950> just<00:07:03.760> go<00:07:03.970> after<00:07:04.120> the<00:07:04.390> captain<00:07:04.600> don't<00:07:05.140> worry

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
so just go after the captain don't worry

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:14.790 
so just go after the captain don't worry
about<00:07:05.590> the<00:07:05.800> other<00:07:05.950> guys<00:07:06.100> too<00:07:06.310> much<00:07:08.910> to<00:07:09.910> do
