00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 radio Komsomolskaya truth, well, finally 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.830
 today received an official response 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.219
 on the request of soldiers' mothers and the availability 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.509
 Russian military in Ukraine 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.540
 the answer is they hanged on their website 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 scanned posted by Viktor Kupchyshyn 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.670
 deputy commander input and output 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.810
 as if to quote it you indicate 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.119
 according to the information does not match 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.769
 Really your conjectures are based 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.630
 on information promoted in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.980
 controlled pro-western hostile 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.859
 tuned to the Russian 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.290
 federation channels media says notes 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.879
 military official they asked their 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.600
 the request of the military personnel of part 71 211 of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.739
 Kostroma were allegedly moved to in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.860
 places of temporary deployment on 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.100
 the territory of the Russian region and then with 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.360
 they terminated the contract and they 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 appeared on the territory of Ukraine 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.469
 advancing towards mariupole but 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.660
 this response to the request was received 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.460
 official response 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.559
 but we will not comment on his answer 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.580
 answer received received before official 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.960
 I understand so well but away 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.110
 continues so not even easy 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.240
 scandal such a childish surprise 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.150
 European officials turned out that Russia in 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.159
 the answer also led after a member 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.170
 Federation Council and State Duma Deputy 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.990
 some Russian was denied entry 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.880
 to the European Union of Russia also kept a list but 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.759
 This form of surprise is already 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.829
 the entrance to Russia, the euro official know that 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.939
 he is an unwanted person on the territory 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.479
 russian federation 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.400
 it's terribly offended because you can 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.350
 submit this list would be announced 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.840
 officially the russian federation which 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 there would be howls how many 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.399
 comments from European officials 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.780
 included in this list but there was a whole 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.320
 to information war so like all 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.640
 quiet 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.290
 sewn and covered but how answered 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 commented on this list maria 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.530
 zakharov 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.670
 deputy director deportation 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.770
 Department of Information and Press mid a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.899
 our western colleagues who 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.570
 feel they might be in it 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.310
 list I recommend them to recheck before 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.090
 whether in Russia they are in this 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.190
 list 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.869
 or not and make according to maria 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.730
 zakharov it can be no problem 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.490
 diplomatic channels yes that is it 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.060
 you can at least know about 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.040
 what we do not publish we somehow still 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.080
 then simply not decided on a list we 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.970
 as we arrive, we need to understand 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.340
 this person is in our territory or not 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.710
 I think such a funny form of shit here 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.620
 how much shit has Russia done for 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.280
 the last time but i think that we 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.520
 have the right 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.250
 somehow give such an answer 7 exactly then 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.010
 we also have sanctions and who are we 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.490
 do not tell you to learn to watch yourself 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.950
 see for yourself what you said about 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.750
 Russia from the stands of the European Parliament 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.400
 imagine a person is going to Russia 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.210
 not for him such a lottery now I 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.600
 call and ask on the list whether or not i 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.170
 tell me can I come to Russia for 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.450
 Matryoshka expect answers and come 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.960
 Beethoven tomorrow and spend the way and and 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.970
 beethoven play yes all operators are busy 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.430
 call the nearest operator in 6 minutes 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.100
 your call is very big for us 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.600
 yes, well, yes, yes, you can do well 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.280
 international travel back here 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.550
 I carefully watch what happens 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.170
 Now in Hong Kong gamma yes yes yes minister 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.000
 Chinese people's foreign affairs 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.830
 republic van and during washington 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.720
 Washington visit said what it means 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.030
 The situation in Hong Kong is domestic 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.460
 China's business cautioned America against 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.380
 intervention attempts and this one 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.240
 the umbrella revolution does not yet name and 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.280
 generally hold some analogies with 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.170
 some interest after all 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.300
 america's instability in china here 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.160
 as far as these rumors are all under them 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.590
 grounds well my house in china was held by 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.240
 Maidan them all canons yes even with 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.840
 the girl who said she needed 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.880
 help and covenants chose the symbol it 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.490
 umbrella 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.780
 an alternative was created selected 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:06.170
 more precisely alternative communication system 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.140
 which is not bugged is something 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.790
 sort of internet radio here's how on 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.950
 Ukraine enjoyed during 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.770
 riots Internet radio business 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.450
 here the same system works by 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.370
 which the protesters are bound between 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.799
 via bluetooth i.e. cellular 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.389
 operators can be blocked but communication 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.659
 will still work for them 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.710
 through there say their personal transmitters 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:31.580
 cell phones 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.719
 well, and while there the situation is frozen the day before 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.340
 student demonstration leaders 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.569
 promised to start taking over 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.229
 government buildings that too 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:41.330
 reminds us a lot of recent events 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.529
 At times, the demand for the resignation of an official 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.229
 put forward one of the leaders of the movement 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.060
 protest vice chairman hong kong 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.090
 trade union federations 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:56.360
 lester students noise is completely not 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:00.949
 the chinese name lester these four different 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:05.419
 there is simply no human 11 lister noise so 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:08.750
 OK, but we will wait whether China decides 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.009
 on the repetition of the events of the 80th year it 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.639
 first and second 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:16.009
 events in hong kong are now called in 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.839
 In general, Chinese Maidan seems or 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:22.550
 does not look like it seems I have noted that 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:23.900
 never appear maidan and on empty 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.900
 the place for this requires a whole complex 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.580
 contradictions within society do not come 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.759
 told he communicates with the Chinese 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.319
 businessmen there his friend is a businessman 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.659
 very rich man eats it 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.310
 tells you to flash listen and you're in 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.000
 Chinese Communist Party 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.360
 gould 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.539
 and immediately took out of his pocket party membership card 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.759
 what a rip and cognitive dissonance in 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.310
 a society that lives by the official 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.379
 the communist covenants which are not 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.189
 provides for enrichment there for 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.620
 making money 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.149
 financial with regulation so on and on 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.069
 this is the flagship of the world 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:00.020
 capitalism is heard but really now 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.310
 some kind of instability in china me 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.050
 it seemed all the same they control 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.099
 process but so a minute left us 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.199
 really undermine 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.639
 tuk you are a little hard to say 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.919
 I think only China can 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.259
 calculate the level of instability and 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.490
 how much have enough situation of china 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.770
 we will wait 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.839
 how events dim will evolve 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.180
 thank you very much, Dmitry Steshin our 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:24.520
 political commentator was with us in 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.520
 Komsomol truth on the air
