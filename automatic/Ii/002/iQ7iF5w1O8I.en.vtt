that<00:03:18.580> her<00:03:19.580> heroic<00:03:20.620> challenge<00:03:21.620> we've<00:03:22.340> already

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
that her heroic challenge we've already

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.470 
that her heroic challenge we've already
done<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.940> one<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:25.060> what<00:03:26.060> was<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.300> Royal

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
done that one on what was it Royal

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.699 
done that one on what was it Royal
double<00:03:26.780> trouble<00:03:27.050> so<00:03:27.140> I'll<00:03:27.230> go<00:03:27.380> ahead<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.680> I'll

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
double trouble so I'll go ahead and I'll

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.550 
double trouble so I'll go ahead and I'll
link<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.100> off<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.790> one<00:03:29.290> it's<00:03:30.290> when<00:03:30.440> we

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
link you off to that one it's when we

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.840 
link you off to that one it's when we
have<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.769> run<00:03:30.890> through<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.400> watch<00:03:31.489> up<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
have to run through and watch up to the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.580 
have to run through and watch up to the
mines<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.300> think<00:03:32.450> it's<00:03:32.570> pretty<00:03:32.840> early<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.320> this

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
mines I think it's pretty early in this
