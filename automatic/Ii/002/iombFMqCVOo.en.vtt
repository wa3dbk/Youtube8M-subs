sense at one 1/8 scale 150 amps ask
first<00:00:13.559> let's<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> put<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:16.940> an<00:00:17.940> easy

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
first let's see what I put it in an easy

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
first let's see what I put it in an easy
life<00:00:19.640> which<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.880> right<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:22.820> as<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.000> see

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
life which is right here as you can see

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
life which is right here as you can see
it's<00:00:25.019> quite<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> large<00:00:26.250> engine<00:00:26.789> motor<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:28.619> have

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
it's quite a large engine motor you have

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.299 
it's quite a large engine motor you have
to<00:00:28.890> grind<00:00:29.160> away<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.760> piece<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.599> frame<00:00:31.309> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to grind away a piece of the frame to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.470 
to grind away a piece of the frame to
make<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.610> fit<00:00:34.309> tiptoe<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.820> might<00:00:36.090> want<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
make it fit tiptoe you might want to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.160 
make it fit tiptoe you might want to
shift<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:38.149> unscrew<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.180> put<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.930> backwards

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
shift this unscrew it put it backwards

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.740 
shift this unscrew it put it backwards
so<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.460> fit<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.820> between<00:00:42.210> when<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> put

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
