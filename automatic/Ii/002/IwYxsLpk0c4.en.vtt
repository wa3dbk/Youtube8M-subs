00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.109
 for the noodle soup we are going to use 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.689
 almost the same as you use for rice 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.730
 which is the video before this one 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.969
 a few things change is a 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.720
 super simple surface so no 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.330
 We carry the best ingredients or the 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.789
 great thing to say so here I have a 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.210
 chili that is of these yellow already 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.000
 remove the to the tail and remove the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.310
 We are going to put everything in the seeds 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.740
 blender here I have the blender is 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.310
 a quarter of onion I have the onion 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.890
 Whole a quarter what will take away 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.079
 let's put three split tomatoes 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.969
 by half everything is washed 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.900
 we are also going to put a little bit of 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:53.610
 coriander 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:58.050
 I have a picture of nor noriza a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.900
 tomato concentrate square 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.280
 tomato that is this chicken broth 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.720
 this tomato little garlic I have 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.110
 dry oregano and we're going to put a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.180
 handful of salt and with water so that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.060
 liquefy everything we have in the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.770
 blender we are going to put our house of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 the pan I'm going to what we 're going to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.300
 use with a little oil here and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.320
 I have the soup is good soup 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.350
 vermicelli noodles and super skinny that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.170
 I have liquefied 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.340
 and we are going to put on low fire so that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 start to warm up then we're going to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.110
 sautÃ© a moment just like I do 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.890
 with rice we only do with any 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.070
 pasta because it gives another flavor 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.170
 the ingredients that we liquefy for 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.000
 any pasta is giving the same is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.450
 what he used to do either 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.970
 ham hammered lettuce soup landmark 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.110
 what are these like for children not 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.880
 they are nothing spicy 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.880
 so it's going very well for everyone 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.080
 put the pasta that we are going to fry the very 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.050
 well remember that it is coming to design 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.090
 so that we are not going to burn 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.550
 and since they are ready we are going to empty 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.530
 the time it is golden, the opas that 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:25.069
 have put as coffee 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.069
 now we miss the blender 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.520
 and we have more water 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.710
 and the soup is almost ready it takes 20 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:49.650
 minutes at low heat and covered so 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:53.880
 about 10 more minutes and we can serve it and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.730
 ready so that's how the soup is left 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.840
 accompany it with chopped onion with 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.840
 avocado and lemon 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.360
 and then nothing on my part would be everything 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.650
 I hope the implement and and 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.769
 come next 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.769
 bye
