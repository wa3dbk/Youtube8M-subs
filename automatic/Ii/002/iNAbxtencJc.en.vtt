00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
variations of it I don't really have a

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.830 
variations of it I don't really have a
preference<00:00:53.680> one<00:00:54.040> over<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.310> other<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:58.660> can<00:00:58.780> be

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
quite deceiving because you might be

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.900

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
we do the same thing over and over for

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.010 
we do the same thing over and over for
years<00:01:10.050> it<00:01:10.740> sounds<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.070> boring<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.930> sort<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
years it sounds very boring so sort of

since I don't train them as often when I

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.469 
since I don't train them as often when I
do<00:01:41.860> train<00:01:42.130> them<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.310> want<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.549> get<00:01:42.670> maximum<00:01:42.940> you

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479

ah

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.310 

doing<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:59.390> know<00:01:59.509> three<00:01:59.750> cents<00:02:00.049> within<00:02:00.290> a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
doing it you know three cents within a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.859 
doing it you know three cents within a
set<00:02:00.649> of<00:02:00.920> ten<00:02:01.399> rats<00:02:01.640> doing<00:02:02.119> 30<00:02:02.329> reps<00:02:02.570> it's<00:02:02.720> going

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
set of ten rats doing 30 reps it's going

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.030

and<00:02:04.250> as<00:02:04.430> I'm<00:02:04.579> incrementing<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.210> way<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.840> is

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
and as I'm incrementing the way it is

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.109 
and as I'm incrementing the way it is
putting<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:07.070> know<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.460> muscles<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.820> attend
