00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.899 

okay<00:00:01.079> here<00:00:01.230> we<00:00:01.260> have<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.469> tippy-top<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.760> it's

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay here we have the tippy-top and it's

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.309 
okay here we have the tippy-top and it's
a<00:00:03.000> spinning<00:00:03.360> top<00:00:03.389> that<00:00:03.629> will<00:00:03.720> invert<00:00:03.929> during

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
a spinning top that will invert during

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.050 
a spinning top that will invert during
its<00:00:04.470> spin<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.069> being<00:00:05.220> made<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.609> metal

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
its spin this is being made of metal

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.730 
its spin this is being made of metal
being<00:00:06.330> milled<00:00:06.569> very<00:00:06.870> act<00:00:07.049> out<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.290> metal<00:00:07.529> but

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
being milled very act out of metal but

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.830 
being milled very act out of metal but
it's<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.580> it's<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.940> chrome<00:00:09.240> kind<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.719> aluminium

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
it's a it's a chrome kind of aluminium

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.930 
it's a it's a chrome kind of aluminium
metal<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.590> here's<00:00:10.769> some<00:00:10.920> bar<00:00:11.099> magnets<00:00:11.460> to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
metal so here's some bar magnets to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.459 
metal so here's some bar magnets to
bring<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.360> sharp<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.230> see

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
bring in to sharp just so you can see

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.350 
bring in to sharp just so you can see
that<00:00:13.620> they<00:00:13.710> are<00:00:13.799> magnetic<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:15.000> plate<00:00:15.240> is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
that they are magnetic the plate is

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.480 
that they are magnetic the plate is
actually<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.780> pewter<00:00:16.320> pipe<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.890> nothing

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
actually a pewter pipe so nothing

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.099 
actually a pewter pipe so nothing
ferrous<00:00:18.000> about<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.539> no<00:00:18.630> magnets<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.080> can

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
ferrous about it and no magnets you can

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.950 
ferrous about it and no magnets you can
affect<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.590> nor<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.939> spinning<00:00:21.270> top<00:00:21.449> so

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
affect this nor the spinning top so

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.060 
affect this nor the spinning top so
that's<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> show<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.949> that

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's just really to show you that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.590 
that's just really to show you that
there's<00:00:23.220> nothing<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:23.910> under<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> table

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
there's nothing going on under the table

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.290 
there's nothing going on under the table
or<00:00:25.199> nothing<00:00:25.529> ever<00:00:25.980> false<00:00:26.340> wise<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.060> just

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
or nothing ever false wise and it's just

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.599 
or nothing ever false wise and it's just
on<00:00:27.420> my<00:00:27.689> wooden<00:00:27.930> dining<00:00:28.349> table<00:00:28.740> okay<00:00:29.429> I've

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
on my wooden dining table okay I've

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.519 
on my wooden dining table okay I've
actually<00:00:29.789> drawn<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.689> black<00:00:30.840> marker<00:00:31.170> pen<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
actually drawn with a black marker pen a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
actually drawn with a black marker pen a
single<00:00:32.430> airing<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.120> that's<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:33.780> I'm

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
single airing so that's because I'm

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.900 
single airing so that's because I'm
going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> spin<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> clockwise<00:00:34.680> motion<00:00:35.010> so

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
going to spin in a clockwise motion so

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639 
going to spin in a clockwise motion so
I'm<00:00:36.360> holding<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.780> damn<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.440> old

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
I'm holding this damn it's got an old

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.950 
I'm holding this damn it's got an old
metal<00:00:38.219> top<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.640> give<00:00:38.790> me<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> grip<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.780> when<00:00:39.870> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
metal top just give me a grip and when I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.840 
metal top just give me a grip and when I
spin<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.530> minute<00:00:40.800> clockwise<00:00:41.250> I'm

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
spin it on this minute clockwise I'm

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
spin it on this minute clockwise I'm
just<00:00:42.090> being<00:00:42.329> very<00:00:42.360> slowly<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> moment

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
just being very slowly the moment

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
just being very slowly the moment
because<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.250> quite<00:00:44.460> quickly

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
because as you can see it quite quickly

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.670 
because as you can see it quite quickly
goes<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> little<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.899> eccentric<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
goes a little bit eccentric and as a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
goes a little bit eccentric and as a
wobble<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.390> tippy<00:00:48.690> tops

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
wobble and that's because the tippy tops

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
wobble and that's because the tippy tops
characteristic<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.010> weights<00:00:50.160> been<00:00:50.309> built<00:00:50.520> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
characteristic the weights been built is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
characteristic the weights been built is
at<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> center<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.449> its<00:00:52.320> mass<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> this

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
at the center of its mass and this

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.850 
at the center of its mass and this
geometrical<00:00:54.270> center<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.110> coincide<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
geometrical center do not coincide and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.819 
geometrical center do not coincide and
that<00:00:56.489> actually<00:00:57.030> slightly<00:00:57.930> erratic<00:00:58.469> motion

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that actually slightly erratic motion

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.470 
that actually slightly erratic motion
when<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> much<00:00:59.520> faster<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.210> again<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
when I do it much faster and again this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
when I do it much faster and again this
isn't<00:01:00.690> particularly<00:01:01.109> fast<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.129> see

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
isn't particularly fast but you can see

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.680 
isn't particularly fast but you can see
that<00:01:02.430> kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.670> wobble<00:01:02.910> already<00:01:03.180> occurring

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that kind of wobble already occurring

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.130 
that kind of wobble already occurring
that<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:05.460> allows<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.299> spinning<00:01:06.780> top<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that is what allows this spinning top to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.780 
that is what allows this spinning top to
invert<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> properly<00:01:08.340> fast<00:01:08.549> now

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
invert I'm going to it properly fast now

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.609 
invert I'm going to it properly fast now
so<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.510> happens<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.470> you'll

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so you can see what happens and you'll

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.320 
so you can see what happens and you'll
see<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.869> very<00:01:12.869> very<00:01:13.140> fast<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:15.150> can

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
see that actually very very fast you can

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.820 
see that actually very very fast you can
see<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> actual<00:01:15.840> tippy<00:01:16.439> top<00:01:16.590> Bing

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
see there the actual tippy top Bing

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.859 
see there the actual tippy top Bing
sliding<00:01:17.549> all<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.850> surface<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.299> its<00:01:18.420> circle

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
sliding all of the surface in its circle

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
sliding all of the surface in its circle
around<00:01:18.960> its<00:01:19.229> rotational<00:01:19.590> axes<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.070> actually

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
around its rotational axes is actually

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.370 
around its rotational axes is actually
where<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> gets<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> friction<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.049> drive

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
where it gets the friction to then drive

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.249 
where it gets the friction to then drive
the<00:01:23.310> top<00:01:23.880> around<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> gives<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the top around and it gives it the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
the top around and it gives it the
actual<00:01:25.590> talk<00:01:26.460> force<00:01:26.790> needed<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.299> actually

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
actual talk force needed to actually

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
actual talk force needed to actually
vert<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.930> top<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.770> eventually<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
vert the top and eventually and of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.510 
vert the top and eventually and of
course<00:01:29.670> run<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.950> running<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
of the top itself notice a few times

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
of the top itself notice a few times
I've<00:01:45.270> tried<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.479> zoomed<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.350> I've<00:01:46.619> gotten

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
I've tried a zoomed in so I've gotten

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.590 
I've tried a zoomed in so I've gotten
the<00:01:46.860> camera<00:01:47.100> running<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> higher<00:01:48.299> rate

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the camera running at a higher rate

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.359 
the camera running at a higher rate
frame<00:01:49.140> per<00:01:49.320> second<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:49.829> running<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.040> 50

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
frame per second so it's running at 50

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.499 
frame per second so it's running at 50
frames<00:01:50.520> per<00:01:50.700> second<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.090> hopefully<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.479> can

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
frames per second so hopefully you can

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
frames per second so hopefully you can
also<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> error<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> spin<00:01:52.799> take

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
also see the error and the spin take

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.469 
also see the error and the spin take
place<00:01:54.470> let's<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.890> good<00:01:56.070> one

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
place let's see if I get a good one

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.310 
place let's see if I get a good one
let's<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> camera<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.290> focus

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
let's see I can get the camera to focus

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.609 
let's see I can get the camera to focus
and<00:01:58.860> wasn't<00:01:58.979> too<00:01:59.250> bad<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.930> that's<00:02:01.049> quite<00:02:01.380> neat

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
and wasn't too bad so that's quite neat

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.639 
and wasn't too bad so that's quite neat
and<00:02:01.740> tidy<00:02:02.000> we<00:02:03.000> did<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.360> more<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.750> course<00:02:04.020> just

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and tidy we did one more of course just

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.700 
and tidy we did one more of course just
to<00:02:04.920> make<00:02:05.790> sure<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.360> all<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.560> order

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
to make sure that all that's in order

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.400 
to make sure that all that's in order
and<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.099> see<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> actual<00:02:08.959> invert<00:02:09.959> motion

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and you can see the actual invert motion

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.640 
and you can see the actual invert motion
going<00:02:10.709> on

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
going on

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.020 
going on
doesn't<00:02:11.890> matter<00:02:12.040> whether<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.400> hits<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.849> side

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
doesn't matter whether it hits the side

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
of purely God on this dish it's a pewter

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.970 
of purely God on this dish it's a pewter
dish<00:02:15.220> both<00:02:16.030> because<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.540> metal<00:02:17.409> but<00:02:17.950> not

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
dish both because it's metal but not

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.460 
dish both because it's metal but not
magnetic<00:02:18.909> so<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.659> you<00:02:19.720> can<00:02:19.870> tell<00:02:20.110> from<00:02:20.349> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
magnetic so that you can tell from the

magnetic so that you can tell from the
magnet<00:02:20.799> there's<00:02:21.040> nothing<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:22.019> and

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
magnet there's nothing going on and

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.949 
magnet there's nothing going on and
because<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:23.890> size<00:02:24.129> is<00:02:24.209> reasonable<00:02:25.209> sized<00:02:25.599> for

surface as long as the Sun grip and it's
reasonably<00:02:33.760> hard<00:02:34.000> then<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.049> works<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:35.739> you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
reasonably hard then this works and you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.770 
reasonably hard then this works and you
can<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.459> these<00:02:36.579> in<00:02:36.819> plastic<00:02:37.030> as<00:02:37.390> well<00:02:37.420> as<00:02:37.569> it's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
can get these in plastic as well as it's

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.589 
can get these in plastic as well as it's
like<00:02:37.989> more<00:02:38.260> fancy<00:02:38.829> metal<00:02:39.700> chrome<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.450> we've

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
like more fancy metal chrome that we've

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.809 
like more fancy metal chrome that we've
got<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.200> on<00:02:41.349> there<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.400> hopefully

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
got here going on there so hopefully

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.759

looking at this tippy top and it's

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.180 
looking at this tippy top and it's
inverting<00:02:46.870> spin<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.829> we've<00:02:47.920> got<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.069> lot<00:02:48.159> of
