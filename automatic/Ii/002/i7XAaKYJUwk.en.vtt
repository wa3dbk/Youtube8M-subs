00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
more definition so here I'm going to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
more definition so here I'm going to
line<00:01:15.270> my<00:01:15.299> lower<00:01:15.689> lash<00:01:16.049> line<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.530> also<00:01:16.680> my

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
line my lower lash line and also my

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130 
line my lower lash line and also my
waterline<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.880> black<00:01:17.909> gel<00:01:18.750> liner

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
waterline with a black gel liner

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
waterline with a black gel liner
I<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.409> prefer<00:01:19.619> using<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.580> gel<00:01:20.850> liner

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
I just prefer using the gel liner

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.969 
I just prefer using the gel liner
because<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.689> creamier

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.410 

so<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.520> smudge<00:01:29.880> too<00:01:30.150> gentle

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
so here I'm going to smudge too gentle

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.210 
so here I'm going to smudge too gentle
