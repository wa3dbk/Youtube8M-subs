entire<00:01:58.759> game<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.090> it's<00:01:59.210> 52<00:01:59.539> minutes<00:01:59.689> that's

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
entire game so it's 52 minutes that's

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.999 
entire game so it's 52 minutes that's
why<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.020> take<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.289> took<00:02:00.470> longer<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.829> download

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
why I take it took longer to download

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.109 
why I take it took longer to download
all<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.319> now<00:02:03.319> that<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.549> is<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.700> fire<00:02:04.909> truck

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
all right now that that is a fire truck

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.910 
all right now that that is a fire truck
behind<00:02:05.330> me<00:02:05.509> if<00:02:05.569> you<00:02:05.630> guys<00:02:05.750> did<00:02:05.959> hear<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.319> but

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
behind me if you guys did hear that but

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.289 
behind me if you guys did hear that but
anyways<00:02:07.159> as<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.399> can<00:02:07.580> see<00:02:07.759> what<00:02:07.939> we<00:02:08.060> want<00:02:08.239> to

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
anyways as you can see what we want to

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.479 
anyways as you can see what we want to
focus<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> tick<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.069> longer<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.459> go

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
focus on is the tick so the longer we go

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.080 
focus on is the tick so the longer we go
in<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.789> game<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:12.530> bigger<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.830> tix<00:02:13.040> get<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.970> if

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
in the game the bigger the tix get so if

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.150 
in the game the bigger the tix get so if
let's<00:02:14.390> say<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.930> was<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.470> part<00:02:15.769> 2<00:02:15.980> where<00:02:16.130> I

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
let's say this was the part 2 where I

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.430 
let's say this was the part 2 where I
like<00:02:16.610> at<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:17.060> certain<00:02:17.480> amount<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.870> Texas<00:02:18.230> just

like at a certain amount of Texas just

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.500 
like at a certain amount of Texas just
19<00:02:18.890> k<00:02:19.190> ticks<00:02:19.519> or<00:02:20.620> 20<00:02:21.620> k<00:02:21.769> tix<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.430> when<00:02:22.760> i<00:02:22.790> hit<00:02:23.209> a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
19 k ticks or 20 k tix is when i hit a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.780 
19 k ticks or 20 k tix is when i hit a
crazy<00:02:24.290> no<00:02:24.560> scope<00:02:24.860> out<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:26.209> 200<00:02:27.200> k<00:02:27.380> tix<00:02:27.680> as<00:02:28.519> long

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
crazy no scope out of 200 k tix as long
