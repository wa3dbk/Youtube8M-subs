liquid facelift and laser center
Northern<00:00:09.580> Virginia<00:00:10.120> we're<00:00:10.750> here<00:00:11.020> today<00:00:11.230> with

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
Northern Virginia we're here today with

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.640 
Northern Virginia we're here today with
our<00:00:11.619> patients<00:00:11.920> whom<00:00:12.820> we<00:00:13.000> earlier<00:00:13.900> treated<00:00:14.469> the

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
our patients whom we earlier treated the

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.700 
our patients whom we earlier treated the
tear<00:00:14.949> trough<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:16.059> the<00:00:16.420> using<00:00:16.990> Restylane

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
tear trough with the using Restylane

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.280 
tear trough with the using Restylane
with<00:00:18.039> a<00:00:18.070> cannula<00:00:18.789> so<00:00:19.390> as<00:00:19.480> you<00:00:19.540> can<00:00:19.750> see<00:00:19.990> there's

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
with a cannula so as you can see there's

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.610 
with a cannula so as you can see there's
one<00:00:20.620> entry<00:00:21.190> point<00:00:21.550> here<00:00:22.060> and<00:00:22.240> one<00:00:22.900> entry<00:00:23.320> point

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
one entry point here and one entry point

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.710 
one entry point here and one entry point
here<00:00:24.010> so<00:00:24.520> it's<00:00:24.760> a<00:00:24.850> very<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:25.270> traumatic

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
here so it's a very a traumatic

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.250 
here so it's a very a traumatic
procedure<00:00:26.380> we<00:00:26.710> just<00:00:27.090> finished<00:00:28.090> next<00:00:28.930> we're

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
procedure we just finished next we're

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.470 
procedure we just finished next we're
going<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.470> address<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:30.039> nasolabial<00:00:30.550> fold<00:00:31.090> and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
going to address the nasolabial fold and

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.110 
going to address the nasolabial fold and
as<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:31.869> can<00:00:32.050> see<00:00:32.219> she<00:00:33.219> has<00:00:33.250> some<00:00:33.640> asymmetry

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
as you can see she has some asymmetry

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.180 
as you can see she has some asymmetry
it's<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:34.989> little<00:00:35.110> more<00:00:35.350> pronounced<00:00:35.770> on<00:00:36.070> the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
it's a little more pronounced on the

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.520 
it's a little more pronounced on the
left<00:00:36.400> side<00:00:36.640> I<00:00:37.000> would<00:00:37.510> venture<00:00:37.690> she<00:00:38.140> might

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
left side I would venture she might

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.360 
left side I would venture she might
sleep<00:00:38.829> on<00:00:39.010> that<00:00:39.040> side<00:00:39.400> um<00:00:39.790> and<00:00:40.780> then<00:00:41.260> um<00:00:41.620> win

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
sleep on that side um and then um win

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.950 
sleep on that side um and then um win
smile<00:00:42.790> we<00:00:43.329> can<00:00:43.510> see<00:00:43.780> she<00:00:44.079> has<00:00:44.110> a<00:00:44.260> little<00:00:44.649> bit<00:00:45.010> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
smile we can see she has a little bit of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.310 
smile we can see she has a little bit of
volume<00:00:46.960> loss<00:00:47.500> here<00:00:48.370> that<00:00:49.140> eventually<00:00:50.140> will

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
volume loss here that eventually will

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.940 
volume loss here that eventually will
form<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:51.130> marionette<00:00:51.700> lines<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:52.720> today<00:00:53.649> we're

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
form to marionette lines so today we're

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.380 
form to marionette lines so today we're
going<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.190> use<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.520> product<00:00:54.969> called<00:00:55.300> radius<00:00:56.140> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
going to use a product called radius and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.630 
going to use a product called radius and
it's<00:00:58.390> calcium<00:00:58.930> hydroxyapatite<00:00:59.530> in<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.370> gel

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
it's calcium hydroxyapatite in a gel

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.880 
it's calcium hydroxyapatite in a gel
matrix<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:01.300> it's<00:01:01.420> little<00:01:01.719> beads<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.649> gel

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
matrix so it's little beads in a gel

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.969 
matrix so it's little beads in a gel
matrix<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.719> gets<00:01:04.719> injected<00:01:05.079> deep<00:01:05.500> into<00:01:05.829> the

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
matrix it gets injected deep into the

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.340 
matrix it gets injected deep into the
skin<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:06.880> product<00:01:07.329> is<00:01:07.479> very<00:01:07.659> thick<00:01:08.109> very

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
skin this product is very thick very

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.300 
skin this product is very thick very
viscous<00:01:08.859> and<00:01:09.719> over<00:01:10.719> time<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.289> gel<00:01:11.590> dissolves

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
viscous and over time the gel dissolves

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.309 
viscous and over time the gel dissolves
leaving<00:01:12.639> behind<00:01:12.819> the<00:01:13.270> muddle<00:01:13.600> calcium<00:01:14.079> needs

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:14.319 
leaving behind the muddle calcium needs

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:19.230 
leaving behind the muddle calcium needs
and<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:17.590> will<00:01:17.740> stimulate<00:01:18.069> the<00:01:18.549> body<00:01:18.789> to

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
and your it will stimulate the body to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.230 
and your it will stimulate the body to
grow<00:01:19.539> collagen<00:01:20.469> so<00:01:21.009> this<00:01:21.249> product<00:01:21.579> is<00:01:21.999> very

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
grow collagen so this product is very

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.330 
grow collagen so this product is very
long-lasting<00:01:23.429> and<00:01:24.429> it<00:01:24.700> creates<00:01:25.259> collagen<00:01:26.340> by

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
long-lasting and it creates collagen by

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.940 
long-lasting and it creates collagen by
the<00:01:27.399> body<00:01:27.850> itself<00:01:28.179> so<00:01:29.170> we're<00:01:29.709> going<00:01:29.859> to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
the body itself so we're going to

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.120 
the body itself so we're going to
correct<00:01:30.369> this<00:01:31.090> nasolabial<00:01:31.840> fold<00:01:32.409> here<00:01:32.889> and

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
correct this nasolabial fold here and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.949 
correct this nasolabial fold here and
then<00:01:33.670> we're<00:01:33.880> going<00:01:33.999> to<00:01:34.090> turn<00:01:34.359> around<00:01:34.509> and

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
then we're going to turn around and

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.469 
then we're going to turn around and
correct<00:01:35.859> a<00:01:36.099> little<00:01:36.399> bit<00:01:36.579> of<00:01:36.700> filling<00:01:37.149> here

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
correct a little bit of filling here

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.870 
correct a little bit of filling here
which<00:01:37.719> is<00:01:37.929> starting<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:39.060> break<00:01:40.060> here<00:01:41.880> where

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
which is starting to break here where

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.999 
which is starting to break here where
again<00:01:43.179> today<00:01:43.749> we're<00:01:44.109> going<00:01:44.139> to<00:01:44.289> show<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.619> new

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
again today we're going to show a new

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.649 
again today we're going to show a new
technique<00:01:45.609> using<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.889> cannula<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:49.149> once

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
technique using a cannula that's once

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.499 
technique using a cannula that's once
ended<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.529> doesn't<00:01:51.099> cut<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.789> it<00:01:52.179> flows

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
ended it doesn't cut and it flows

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.849 
ended it doesn't cut and it flows
readily<00:01:53.349> over<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.889> structures<00:01:55.859> minimizing

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
readily over the structures minimizing

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.760 
readily over the structures minimizing
the<00:01:57.099> risk<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.490> bruising
