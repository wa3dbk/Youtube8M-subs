out<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.520> important<00:01:47.970> part<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.450> story<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
out a really important part of a story I

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.090 
out a really important part of a story I
think<00:01:49.020> which<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> parents<00:01:49.979> were

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
think which is that the parents were

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160 
think which is that the parents were
absent<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.030> parents<00:01:51.390> had<00:01:51.509> gone<00:01:51.689> back<00:01:51.930> to

Russia and this 19 year old kid was able

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.859 
Russia and this 19 year old kid was able
