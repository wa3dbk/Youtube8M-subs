00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.969
 I've done 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:22.869
 and I thought I had a word 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:22.869
 About what I thought 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.060
 hello youtube friends this good this 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.410
 tutorial 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.270
 dedicated especially people referred 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.550
 Guitar 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.930
 true tear with a music like the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.630
 as the one who speaks to them does not 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.880
 this command tells the dance in my game 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.430
 to sing this part a lot of verses 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.920
 from the song to the heart of paw 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.760
 yellow 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760
 a Peruvian group 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.749
 it's easy to simple rhythm to play 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.749
 with friends 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:17.509
 to start accompanying with the song 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 in the following way we do not go down 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.909
 all the fingers help the blow 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.909
 with the yolk to export 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.770
 and down 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.280
 down below they can do it 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:57.460
 you can also do it with blow and that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.560
 depends on the criteria and taste with the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.869
 which you are mostly want to enter 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.470
 in action but before in the song in the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.470
 that can even part faster 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.250
 and I say it depends on the taste of 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.070
 you now to continue I'm going to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.640
 start playing the chords of the stanza 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.100
 of the pre corones and choir 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.840
 in the stanza of the song is going to 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 repeat the stanza 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.310
 higher 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.540
 of the greatest 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.829
 Sun 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.829
 and again if minor 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.800
 point so they can hit relationship 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.520
 let's start like to stay 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.690
 tell the rhythm of the song and we will 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.210
 sing it good I'm a little bad with the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.620
 voice but like to accompany the guitar 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.120
 and not feel notes we have to change 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.120
 I'm going to drop some 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.390
 you say it 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.390
 existing 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.270
 state 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.319
 and what I thought let's think that another 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.319
 time 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.870
 I thought 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:45.629
 after this moment of coming that 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.920
 always with whose notes are simple 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.920
 again we make a minor beat 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.780
 we change well 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.829
 and then we continue with the greatest 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.690
 and again if this is going to repeat two 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.170
 times 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.170
 in this way 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.030
 the biggest 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.200
 each other 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.039
 my heart 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.440
 for the color of the song 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.760
 watching me the chords and I hope that 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.220
 you follow as not all things 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.970
 They are very simple 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.970
 and we started 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.180
 Sun 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.180
 we continue like kings 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.470
 then we have the largest 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.169
 yes 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:22.930
 and again we start with the biggest 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.930
 the 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.630
 sotomayor 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.160
 end up with 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.160
 then we would have it this way 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.660
 to the heart 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:16.449
 at a basic level guitar and that is 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.849
 pretty beautiful now what is the 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:24.039
 introduction I would like to explain it but 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:27.090
 it's a bit defined so I would ask 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.090
 make another video 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.879
 this Friday I ask for chau
