rubber very pliable rolls up now this is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.560 
rubber very pliable rolls up now this is
quite<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.020> good<00:00:19.230> advantage<00:00:19.970> for<00:00:20.970> any<00:00:21.119> rate<00:00:21.359> in

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
quite a good advantage for any rate in

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.800 
quite a good advantage for any rate in
the<00:00:21.660> field<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:23.760> would<00:00:23.880> touch<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.539> close

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the field you would touch it you close

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.200 
the field you would touch it you close
in<00:00:25.050> either<00:00:25.320> by<00:00:25.470> perhaps<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.460> pin<00:00:26.730> through<00:00:27.000> the

through<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> hole<00:00:35.390> then<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.719> hang<00:00:36.899> this

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
through the hole then you can hang this

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.720 
through the hole then you can hang this
around<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.620> neck<00:00:38.239> being<00:00:39.239> soft<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.750> pliable

around your neck being soft and pliable
well<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:42.030> thought<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:43.100> when<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> change

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
well my thought is when you change

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.090 
well my thought is when you change
position<00:00:45.500> you<00:00:46.500> krej<00:00:46.800> down<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.700> stoop<00:00:49.100> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
position you krej down your stoop you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
position you krej down your stoop you
move<00:00:50.340> along<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:51.000> hands<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.420> knees<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
move along on your hands and knees you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.389 
move along on your hands and knees you
stand<00:00:52.829> upright<00:00:54.320> perhaps<00:00:55.320> even<00:00:55.559> snagging<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
stand upright perhaps even snagging a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.580 
stand upright perhaps even snagging a
bush<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:56.789> something<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.840> some

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
bush or something like that or some

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.860 
bush or something like that or some
other<00:00:58.649> undergrowth<00:00:59.629> with<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> flexibility

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
other undergrowth with the flexibility

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
other undergrowth with the flexibility
it<00:01:03.870> doesn't<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.320> annoying<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.220> was

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it doesn't get annoying as if it was

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.500 
it doesn't get annoying as if it was
stiff<00:01:06.210> hard<00:01:06.450> piece<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.280> say<00:01:08.280> card<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:09.000> plastic

stiff hard piece of say card or plastic

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.090 
stiff hard piece of say card or plastic
or<00:01:09.659> boards<00:01:10.549> could<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.760> snagged<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.750> this

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
or boards could get snagged up but this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.109 
or boards could get snagged up but this
allows<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.159> bit<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> freedom<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> movement

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
allows a bit of freedom of movement

allows a bit of freedom of movement
somehow<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.810> only<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.200> small

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
somehow it's only a very small

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.730 
somehow it's only a very small
unimportant<00:01:17.369> points<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.470> it's<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
unimportant points but it's one to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.760 
unimportant points but it's one to
consider<00:01:21.200> after<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.530> like

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
consider after all you don't like

Bisley<00:01:45.810> magnums<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.670> 177<00:01:51.479> seemed

Bisley magnums there and the 177 seemed

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.740 
Bisley magnums there and the 177 seemed
to<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.140> easy<00:01:52.350> enough<00:01:53.390> not<00:01:54.390> much<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
to go in easy enough not much of a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.580 
to go in easy enough not much of a
problem<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> Hungary

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
problem with that and if this is Hungary

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.870 
problem with that and if this is Hungary
my<00:01:58.770> neck<00:01:59.210> just<00:02:00.210> feel<00:02:00.540> down<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:02.630> out<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.869> comes

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
my neck just feel down and out it comes

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.730 
my neck just feel down and out it comes
and<00:02:08.430> if<00:02:09.430> I<00:02:09.610> just<00:02:09.640> press<00:02:10.450> down<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.140> top

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
and if I just press down on the top

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.470 
and if I just press down on the top
I<00:02:13.740> suppose<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.890> could<00:02:14.950> pop<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.490> out<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.390> it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
I suppose I could pop it out but it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.260 
I suppose I could pop it out but it
takes<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.840> little<00:02:16.990> bit<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.260> effort<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.270> push

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
takes a little bit of effort but push

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.050 
takes a little bit of effort but push
through<00:02:19.600> on<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.900> skirt<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:24.130> does<00:02:24.520> seem

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
through on the skirt and that does seem

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.330 
through on the skirt and that does seem
to<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:26.250> almost<00:02:27.250> through<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.830> there's<00:02:30.010> no<00:02:30.160> way

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
to be almost through that there's no way

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.830 
to be almost through that there's no way
I<00:02:30.370> could<00:02:30.670> say<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.240> would<00:02:31.450> actually

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I could say that this would actually

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.960 
I could say that this would actually
drop<00:02:32.020> out<00:02:34.650> yeah<00:02:35.650> it's<00:02:35.830> holding<00:02:36.160> them<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.370> 7/7

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
drop out yeah it's holding them on 7/7

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.140 
drop out yeah it's holding them on 7/7
quite<00:02:37.209> well<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:40.450> out<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.660> curiosity<00:02:42.150> again

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
quite well just out of curiosity again

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.940 
quite well just out of curiosity again

firmer grip and I can fiddle around poke
at<00:03:07.060> them<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:08.820> they<00:03:09.820> have<00:03:09.970> them<00:03:10.060> dropped<00:03:10.330> out

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
at them and they have them dropped out

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.729 
at them and they have them dropped out
become<00:03:11.890> dislodged<00:03:12.900> if<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.019> mate<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.410> field

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
become dislodged if I mate in the field

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.860 
become dislodged if I mate in the field
and<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.340> would<00:03:15.519> don't<00:03:15.790> want<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.030> take<00:03:16.239> my<00:03:16.480> eye

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
and I would don't want to take my eye

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.699 
and I would don't want to take my eye
off<00:03:17.769> what<00:03:18.550> I'm<00:03:18.670> shooting<00:03:18.880> at<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.600> can<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:20.560> feel

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
off what I'm shooting at I can just feel

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.660 
off what I'm shooting at I can just feel
down<00:03:21.720> feel<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.870> pellets<00:03:24.239> pull<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.390> out<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:27.550> it

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
down feel the pellets pull it out and it

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.009 
down feel the pellets pull it out and it
doesn't<00:03:27.880> really<00:03:28.120> matter<00:03:28.390> which<00:03:28.600> way<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.900> put

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
doesn't really matter which way you put

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.690 
doesn't really matter which way you put
it<00:03:29.230> in<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:30.900> pushed<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.110> from<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.560> front<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:35.700> I

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
strongly suspect if I put it through

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.320 
strongly suspect if I put it through
from<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.580> back<00:03:39.790> but<00:03:40.600> hold<00:03:40.780> just<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.230> same
