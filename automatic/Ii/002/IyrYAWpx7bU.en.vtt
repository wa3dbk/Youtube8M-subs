00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.850
 hello everyone how good I am for 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.610
 here I go to make you a hairstyle is 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.590
 Inspired by Adriana Lima, surpassed like this 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.630
 very big waves very loose very 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.150
 easy to make I've also made a 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.830
 It shows on a doll so you can see 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.350
 how is also with the hair more 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.510
 short so you can see the effect in a 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.890
 shortest way I do not know I like it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 a lot this kind of where he has opened so 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.350
 big what I used to do is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.930
 hector has already been this iron people 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.510
 k wave s wave 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.960
 what is good if you notice it would come to be 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.630
 as a kind of curler but if you 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.850
 you notice is not completely round that 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.250
 next to I use the outside part 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.770
 to do it 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.450
 is not a normal conversationalist no curl 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.879
 It comes completely round but it comes out 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.010
 just as a kind of zig zag 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.740
 when you do it is a bit special 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.300
 also used lacquer 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.270
 of ecological 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.110
 and second too 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.450
 I leave you by the step by step 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.710
 start doing it to her so that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.580
 see how a hair is like that more 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.690
 Cortito also receives the result of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.610
 start as always I'll start in 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.650
 two sections and then I'm going to do it 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 myself so you can see how I'm going to give 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.860
 in a longer hair 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.860
 makes a very large curls are pretty 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.030
 I have placed iron to 190 we do 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.180
 here the turn and waited a second be 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.960
 that is hot made me a good and 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.960
 then we let go 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.010
 the curl is huge is super big 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.960
 I will be careful not to touch 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.020
 the outside because it is heated 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.360
 as always a pair of tongs has 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.330
 a lot of practice, better what I say 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.950
 to get legal 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.760
 but we leave we will not touch it until 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.890
 to cool down now I will do it to myself 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.630
 now without being the result of the two 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.560
 so you can compare it well I'm going to 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.560
 start at the bottom 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.890
 both actions like this 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.390
 it passes half forward and I go 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.730
 taking first from the back 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.080
 How is it going 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.830
 as well and roll my hair 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.380
 about 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.380
 the barrel because it's my favor but 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.510
 something every day seconds or less 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.650
 it's a very big wave 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.980
 you can go for this fact something like that happened and 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.980
 the roll 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.520
 I tell him 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.990
 I do not know what I'm going to throw myself 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.430
 a little bit by the mold the form 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.780
 and do not lose me while I'm 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.780
 doing on the dog's face 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.390
 and I put the box back 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.500
 and this what I'm going to continue doing 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.910
 for the rest of the hair go doing 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.760
 sections I will be performing as 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.110
 you have seen 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.900
 what I do the top part is 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.590
 example more slowly as a result of 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.590
 mexico so much with the press to the root 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.980
 as 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.980
 one down 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.569
 Y 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.569
 loop the loop 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.950
 and I do the same thing in another side 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.630
 Once in fried hair can do it 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.630
 is to move to the fingers to undo 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.760
 the second one I'm going to have a little serum 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.760
 to get rid of it I made it a little droplet 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.659
 reported everything between the fingers also 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.659
 and I'm going to undo logical 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.670
 two 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.760
 You can see how all the hair is going 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.760
 I'm going to throw some lacquer 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.580
 You see the effect 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.439
 being very very very very loose 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.849
 I'm going to do the same thing the other side is going to 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.849
 go opening I'm going to release everything 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.070
 the subjects and a little bit up and you 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.070
 put a little more lacquer 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.529
 there 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.560
 respect here on this cover I do 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.979
 the same thing I held a bit to the hair and I 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.979
 echo lacquer 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.630
 and held until it dries 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.630
 loose 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.720
 You see, it's a very, very big wave, 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.070
 very loose open they taught us to 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.650
 what are you also like 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.650
 so you see it in a shorter hair 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.300
 as well as the hair more like more shot 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.840
 with a lot of volume 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.840
 you see 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.620
 and good progress here tutorial I hope that 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.419
 I liked you to serve and you see 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.979
 which is very easy to do was one thing 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.930
 that I had not quite arrived at the post office 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.419
 this kind of waves so big too 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.130
 We could use a diameter curling iron 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.680
 big enough what happens is that 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.930
 keep in mind that it is not round but 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.419
 which is oval then the curl we 're not going 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.300
 to go exactly the same as like here if 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:34.580
 you notice is like a half wave zig curl 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.780
 zag is different in agreement is not no 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.820
 let's say a perfect wave looks like a 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.770
 bit of zig zag and this is the grace that 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.850
 has precisely this iron like 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.410
 I always tell you any doubt that 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.130
 have one left here written down or 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.060
 on my website I leave you here my 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.490
 sites so you can add me if 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.050
 you want and nothing but many 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.490
 thanks for watching me and we are doing 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.490
 make a merry videos
