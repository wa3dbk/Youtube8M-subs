we're<00:00:00.359> probably<00:00:00.630> talking<00:00:00.900> about<00:00:01.199> meals<00:00:01.680> here

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
we're probably talking about meals here

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.849 
we're probably talking about meals here
which<00:00:03.060> are<00:00:04.370> 97%<00:00:05.370> or<00:00:05.549> greater<00:00:06.000> water<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.649> these

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
which are 97% or greater water so these

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.129 
which are 97% or greater water so these
are<00:00:08.010> like<00:00:08.130> edible<00:00:08.730> drinks<00:00:09.179> really<00:00:09.330> they

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
are like edible drinks really they

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.930 
are like edible drinks really they
certainly<00:00:10.830> have<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.130> functionality<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
certainly have the functionality of a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.150 
certainly have the functionality of a
drink<00:00:12.259> but<00:00:13.259> they<00:00:13.380> would<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.679> something<00:00:14.040> that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
drink but they would be something that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.270 
drink but they would be something that
you<00:00:14.219> would<00:00:14.309> eat<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> spoon

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
quickly hydrate elite athletes now we're

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.570 
quickly hydrate elite athletes now we're
not<00:00:31.410> necessarily<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.430> with

not necessarily going to do that with

what happens in the stomach in terms of
hydration<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:36.989> we've<00:00:37.320> tried<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> marry<00:00:37.860> those

the acknowledgement is that they do
however<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.110> you<00:01:01.260> hydrate<00:01:01.769> through<00:01:02.040> water

small bowel and hormonal feedback means

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
small bowel and hormonal feedback means
that<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:12.990> rid<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that you want to get rid of it and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
that you want to get rid of it and
therefore<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> toilet<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
therefore go to the toilet so one of the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.990 
therefore go to the toilet so one of the
problems<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:16.050> having<00:01:16.620> children<00:01:17.070> optimally

problems about having children optimally
hydrated<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.690> that<00:01:18.960> they're<00:01:19.170> always

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
hydrated is that they're always

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990 
hydrated is that they're always

and<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> half<00:01:43.890> hours<00:01:44.280> later<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.000> food

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and a half hours later and the food

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.990 
and a half hours later and the food
structure<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.859> meal<00:01:47.070> has<00:01:47.310> been<00:01:47.549> designed

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
structure in the meal has been designed

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.719 
structure in the meal has been designed
such<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.719> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:48.990> stomach<00:01:49.770> environment

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
such that in the stomach environment

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.560 
such that in the stomach environment
it<00:01:50.850> actually<00:01:51.060> gels<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:53.100> structure<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it actually gels so the structure in the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.139 
it actually gels so the structure in the
water<00:01:54.840> thickens<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.130> becomes<00:01:56.340> jelly<00:01:56.909> like

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
water thickens and becomes jelly like

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.300 
water thickens and becomes jelly like
and<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.439> we're<00:01:58.590> seeing<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and I think what we're seeing on the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.910 
and I think what we're seeing on the
darker<00:01:59.939> area<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> outside<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.560> image

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920

things<00:03:55.210> that<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.450> think<00:03:55.690> we're<00:03:55.840> doing<00:03:55.990> in<00:03:56.260> this

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
things that I think we're doing in this

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.560 
things that I think we're doing in this
technology<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.040> locking<00:03:57.580> that<00:03:57.730> water<00:03:58.000> into<00:03:58.330> a

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
technology is locking that water into a

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.930 
technology is locking that water into a
gel<00:03:58.870> structure<00:03:59.230> now<00:03:59.920> watermelon<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.790> would

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
gel structure now watermelon you would

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.780 
gel structure now watermelon you would
chew<00:04:01.240> in<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.960> whole<00:04:02.290> process<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.980> chewing<00:04:03.400> is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
chew in the whole process of chewing is

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.780 
chew in the whole process of chewing is
going<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.300> break<00:04:05.050> open<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.800> cellular

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
going to break open the cellular

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.060 
going to break open the cellular
contents<00:04:07.720> within<00:04:07.960> that<00:04:08.230> watermelon<00:04:08.890> which

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
contents within that watermelon which

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.670 
contents within that watermelon which
will<00:04:09.280> release<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.880> water<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:11.050> water<00:04:11.350> then

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
will release the water that water then

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.280 
will release the water that water then
is<00:04:11.830> no<00:04:12.100> different<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:13.060> taking<00:04:13.570> glass<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:14.050> water

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
is no different to taking glass of water

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.470 
is no different to taking glass of water
and<00:04:14.620> therefore<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.520> water<00:04:15.760> is<00:04:16.030> unstructured

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
and therefore that water is unstructured

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.870 
and therefore that water is unstructured
what<00:04:17.380> we're<00:04:17.560> doing<00:04:17.799> in<00:04:17.920> this<00:04:18.040> technology<00:04:18.640> is

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
what we're doing in this technology is

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.230 
what we're doing in this technology is
to<00:04:19.239> lock<00:04:19.900> up<00:04:20.140> large<00:04:20.950> amounts<00:04:21.010> of<00:04:21.400> water<00:04:21.640> in<00:04:22.000> a

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
to lock up large amounts of water in a

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.820 
to lock up large amounts of water in a
gel<00:04:22.450> structure<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.140> then<00:04:23.260> that<00:04:23.380> water<00:04:23.530> is

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
gel structure and then that water is

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.010 
gel structure and then that water is
released<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:25.000> moisture<00:04:25.390> content<00:04:25.810> in<00:04:25.990> the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
released the moisture content in the

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.710 
released the moisture content in the
piece<00:04:26.290> of<00:04:26.470> bread<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.860> much<00:04:27.160> much<00:04:27.370> reduced<00:04:27.850> so

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
piece of bread is much much reduced so

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.190 
piece of bread is much much reduced so
for<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.170> volume<00:04:29.770> per<00:04:30.280> volume<00:04:30.670> basis<00:04:31.240> we're

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
for a volume per volume basis we're

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.740 
for a volume per volume basis we're
providing<00:04:32.500> here<00:04:33.270> significantly<00:04:34.270> more<00:04:34.510> what

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
providing here significantly more what

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.530 
providing here significantly more what
more<00:04:35.050> water<00:04:35.550> than<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.640> would<00:04:36.850> for<00:04:37.270> just

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
more water than you would for just

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.900 
more water than you would for just
having<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.930> cookie<00:04:38.320> or<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:39.280> piece<00:04:39.669> of<00:04:39.700> bread

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
having a cookie or a piece of bread

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.540 
having a cookie or a piece of bread
before<00:04:40.150> bed
