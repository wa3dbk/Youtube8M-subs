 the world's most important news here 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.960
 It was a long time since they saw me 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.330
 they listened but being locked in a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.490
 cupboard is not so nice do not you think 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.980

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.500
 It turns out that there are more details regarding 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.419
 to the brand-new ribbon of batman versus 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.159
 superman diane of justice 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.899
 however we warn that they are rumors 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.239
 so you have to take this 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.699
 information with tweezers to start 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.249
 it turns out that the wonder woman costume or 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.679
 the wonder woman ' would be pretty faithful 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.019
 to classic comics consisting of the 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:50.299
 famous golden tiara the bracelets that 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.459
 usually charge and the skirt that accompanies the 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.799
 attire that would highlight your status as 

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:57.229
 amazon princess being that people 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:00.440
 who have already seen the suit have had a 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.479
 good opinion of this one is unknown if 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 I would call her wonderwoman as such in the 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.259
 movie what is believed is that the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 character would run by the name of 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.760
 Diana and after a brief introduction 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.710
 along the whole tape would join 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.600
 superman and batman for confrontation 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.300
 final against the villain of the movie 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.030
 it is unknown if it would be luton law or 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.310
 some henchman of his also affirms that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.320
 its origin would not be counted as such and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.870
 that its introduction would only serve to 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.260
 make it clear that there is a universe of dizzy 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.320
 bigger another point that is mentioned is 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.090
 the dynamic between superman and batman 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.160
 being that the latter would be a veteran 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.500
 to fight crime while the 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.479
 last being of krypton would be more a boy 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.790
 scout or a person who follows more 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.160
 the rules causing in this way that 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.140
 their ideals collide constantly 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.960
 finally talk about the aspect 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.479
 of the former mourning as well as their motivations 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.450
 it is said that the character initially did not 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.970
 would be bald but rather a redhead or 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.800
 very dark chestnut in addition to the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.830
 personality of the villain would be like the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.259
 from a false messiah who will want everyone 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.290
 see superman as a big mistake for 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.330
 metropolis there are rumors that point to 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.950
 that we could have the first footage or 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.020
 trailer in the comic san diego 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.750
 the same applies to the avengers 2 the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.340
 it was from the throne that they think guys are 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.440
 eager to see what will happen in this 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.840
 movie they think these rumors are 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.440
 some let me know in the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.880
 comments
