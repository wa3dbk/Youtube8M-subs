00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello and welcome to the world of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 Puerto Rican salsa 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.680
 Puerto Rican salsa is different from 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.230
 Cuban salsa in several points in 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.759
 Puerto Rican salsa the dancer is going 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.230
 evolve on what is commonly 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:33.570
 called a dance line 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.930
 practically the dancer will go from one point 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.790
 to another of this line while 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.030
 running the figures suggested by his 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.820
 partner this is of course a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.309
 imaginary line but its reality is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.260
 quite different since the figures are 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.300
 built on respect for this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.340
 dance line then the salsa 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.059
 Puerto Rican offers a medium-term 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.789
 infinity of figure combinations finally 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.820
 the Puerto Rican salsa comes to enrich 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.440
 by the introduction of real shine 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 footwork more or less 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.399
 sophisticated made as a rule 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.649
 one in front of the other 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.170
 each figure is presented as a couple 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.950
 like these here a 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.950
 check presentation 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:38.950
 Then come separately the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:46.150
 explanations of the dancer's step then 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 the dancer and then the explanation in 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.810
 couple 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.869
 here shines in this case 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.850
 crossed cucaracha we'll see how 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.509
 introduce them into the dance and then 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.520
 in what way 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.520
 to follow on other figures
