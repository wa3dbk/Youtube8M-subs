you<00:03:39.250> ever<00:03:39.370> played<00:03:39.909> on<00:03:39.939> the<00:03:40.180> Pro<00:03:40.329> Tour<00:03:40.540> or<00:03:40.930> even

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
you ever played on the Pro Tour or even

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.759 
you ever played on the Pro Tour or even
pursued<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.459> area<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.269> play<00:03:43.509> I've<00:03:44.199> played<00:03:44.650> in

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
pursued that area of play I've played in

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.550 
pursued that area of play I've played in
a<00:03:44.829> couple<00:03:45.180> PT<00:03:46.180> cues<00:03:46.479> a<00:03:46.900> Grand<00:03:47.259> Prix<00:03:47.500> once<00:03:47.759> no

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
a couple PT cues a Grand Prix once no

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.289 
a couple PT cues a Grand Prix once no
nothing<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.620> would<00:03:50.769> even<00:03:50.889> admit<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.430> as<00:03:51.879> far<00:03:52.209> as

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
nothing I would even admit to as far as

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.149 
nothing I would even admit to as far as
finishes<00:03:52.720> go<00:03:52.870> but<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:53.859> but<00:03:54.009> it's<00:03:54.129> very

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
finishes go but it but it's very

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.149 
finishes go but it but it's very
interesting<00:03:54.340> as<00:03:55.269> someone<00:03:56.049> who's<00:03:56.229> an<00:03:56.530> observer

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
interesting as someone who's an observer

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.710 
interesting as someone who's an observer
of<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.459> game<00:03:57.639> you<00:03:58.120> would<00:03:58.239> see<00:03:58.419> people

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
of the game you would see people

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.409 
of the game you would see people
certainly<00:03:59.049> with<00:03:59.199> that<00:03:59.349> background<00:04:00.419> stepping

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
certainly with that background stepping

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.960 
certainly with that background stepping
into<00:04:01.540> positions<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.139> you're<00:04:02.290> stepping<00:04:02.500> into

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
into positions that you're stepping into

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.610 
into positions that you're stepping into
so<00:04:03.970> how<00:04:04.060> does<00:04:04.359> it<00:04:04.540> feel<00:04:04.689> to<00:04:04.900> see<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.500> know<00:04:05.590> a

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
so how does it feel to see you know a

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.550 
so how does it feel to see you know a
different<00:04:06.689> play<00:04:07.689> experience<00:04:08.349> being

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
different play experience being

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.159 
different play experience being
represented<00:04:09.250> in<00:04:09.569> an<00:04:10.569> RD<00:04:11.220> well<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.900> think<00:04:13.900> I

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
represented in an RD well I I think I

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.259 
represented in an RD well I I think I
think<00:04:14.199> it's<00:04:14.470> it's<00:04:14.650> great<00:04:14.859> that<00:04:15.129> they<00:04:15.280> are

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
think it's it's great that they are

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.759 
think it's it's great that they are
pulling<00:04:16.570> talent<00:04:17.079> from<00:04:17.169> more<00:04:17.409> than<00:04:17.440> one

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
pulling talent from more than one

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.129 
pulling talent from more than one
perspective<00:04:18.759> I<00:04:18.789> mean<00:04:18.849> the<00:04:19.419> pro<00:04:19.630> players<00:04:19.840> are

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
perspective I mean the pro players are

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.589 
perspective I mean the pro players are
great<00:04:20.349> in<00:04:20.620> many<00:04:21.159> ways<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.609> they<00:04:22.300> they<00:04:22.539> are

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
great in many ways I they they are

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.300 
great in many ways I they they are
they're<00:04:23.320> perfect<00:04:23.650> for<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.830> development

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
they're perfect for the development

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.840 
they're perfect for the development
position

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
position

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.340 
position
they<00:04:25.000> really<00:04:25.240> know<00:04:25.420> what<00:04:25.690> really<00:04:25.960> makes<00:04:26.200> the

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
they really know what really makes the

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.840 
they really know what really makes the
game<00:04:26.470> tick<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.860> what<00:04:26.890> makes<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.310> balance<00:04:27.700> and

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
game tick and what makes it balance and

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.940 
game tick and what makes it balance and
that<00:04:27.940> sort<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.180> thing<00:04:28.360> but<00:04:28.560> as<00:04:29.560> they've<00:04:29.770> said

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
that sort of thing but as they've said

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.170 
that sort of thing but as they've said
they've<00:04:30.100> never<00:04:30.130> really<00:04:30.430> had<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.610> good<00:04:30.940> way<00:04:31.120> to

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
they've never really had a good way to

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.460 
they've never really had a good way to
get<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.390> designer<00:04:31.840> somebody<00:04:32.260> who<00:04:32.320> has<00:04:32.440> just

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
get a designer somebody who has just

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.360 
get a designer somebody who has just
great<00:04:32.890> ideas<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.760> can<00:04:34.140> can<00:04:35.140> make<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.130> sets

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
great ideas and can can make the sets

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.090 
great ideas and can can make the sets
work<00:04:36.580> from<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.120> ground<00:04:37.360> up<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:37.840> so<00:04:38.320> they<00:04:38.470> this

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
work from the ground up and so they this

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.000 
work from the ground up and so they this
was<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.310> great<00:04:39.550> idea<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:41.200> really<00:04:41.440> it's

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
was a great idea and you really it's

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.800 
was a great idea and you really it's
really<00:04:42.250> great<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.430> they<00:04:42.640> figured<00:04:42.790> out<00:04:42.970> an

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
really great that they figured out an

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.390 
really great that they figured out an
efficient<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.530> don't<00:04:44.890> say<00:04:45.010> efficient<00:04:45.310> it

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
efficient I don't say efficient it

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.550 
efficient I don't say efficient it
because<00:04:45.640> it<00:04:45.760> did<00:04:46.030> take<00:04:46.210> four<00:04:46.420> months<00:04:46.750> but

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.390 

ultimately<00:04:50.560> though<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.800> was<00:04:50.890> a<00:04:50.920> good<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.190> good

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
ultimately though it was a good a good

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.230 
ultimately though it was a good a good
result<00:04:52.740> well<00:04:53.740> congratulations<00:04:54.250> again<00:04:54.460> good

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
result well congratulations again good
