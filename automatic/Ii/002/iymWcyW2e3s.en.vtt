 many will say why in the summer to repent at all 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 In principle, I agree with you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.469
 do at least mascara and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.870
 lip gloss 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.519
 but it is not interesting to watch and we are here 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 It is makeup and how to make up your eyes 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.020
 ink I think you already know those 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.060

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.260
 Feel free to note them not all 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.269

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.369
 actually act brought my makeup 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.950
 changing day to day sometimes i'm not at all 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 I paint but most often I like to do myself 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.100
 just such makeup 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.829
 well then let's start starting my 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 make up with applying bronzer ad rms drink 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.280
 and consists entirely of natural 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.500
 ingredients that can not but rejoice 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.050
 and its creamy texture creates effect 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.120
 invisibility on the version. will you nothing 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.430
 not however your face gets much 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.289
 more prominent and in a few 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 these seconds I really like this 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.180
 bronzer feathering it with a brush ooo 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 Trial greenhouses I think she went to some 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 recruitment and I ordered this site offer 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.630
 tassel by the way I just want to notice 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.729
 Great for applying prontera like 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.619
 about friend and creamy also i think 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.619
 on perfect for highlighter 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.170
 our next step yo no makeup this 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.870
 applying delicate pink blush and me 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.270
 This lobster shades of pink peony is very 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.400
 gentle cream blush of 5 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.270
 only from natural ingredients 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.270
 perfect for summer 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.310
 Of course, I put on mascara with me 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.170
 side is perfect right there years 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.660
 because it is washed off only warm 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.940
 water so no rain and swimming in 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.450
 pool sea or pond does not hurt 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.790
 you will not leave the water like a panda all 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.650
 will be in place and your eyelashes will be 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.100
 you look great as long as 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.330
 you yourself don't give in to mother too 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.040
 combing eyebrows and fixing them 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.040
 clear gel from mac 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.050
 our lips must be well groomed and 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.190
 moisturized so I apply a balm from 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.959
 ios at this stage you can complete the makeup 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.360
 then you get gentle and quite 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.319
 quietly and you can go ahead put 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.630
 eyeshadow 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.819
 then i use mac paint pot base 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.380
 a printer or it's hot now and so 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.030
 Of course, the substrate for the shadows to us 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.130
 it is useful to eat we want our 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.500
 make-up floated here is better to use 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.380
 what are the shadows that will act 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.690
 and as primary colors and colors 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.940
 fold i have this magician patina such 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.950
 shades are rare but if you 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.989
 find them and I am sure that you love them 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.569
 and also so I fell in love with magician patina because 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.239
 that he is extremely super today ? 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.160
 shadows and full makeup is ready at the same time 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.140
 it contains little blues glasses which 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.970
 initially not visible but in the sun they 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.970
 start sparkling beautifully 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.340
 under the brow and in the corner of the eye I put 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.330
 frosted light shadows i have is a magician steering wheel 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.990
 and again we can stop at this 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.000
 stage 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.280
 just add 7 video class 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.380
 who betrayed you to the brightness of the views and 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.660
 you can act there are some problems 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.640
 with amber eyes adjust them 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.980
 for example on the spot benefit about lari with 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.260
 using their reflective particles 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.750
 this thing serves as a highlighter under 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.640
 eyes she hides bruises bumps 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.520
 some good things domino example bags 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.709
 but if this is enough for you, then we 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.780
 Of course we apply concealer but do not take 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.340
 very dense mesh in the yard summer and 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.830
 need to use something easier i 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.080
 I use and music in cover-up 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.120
 unfortunately he does not completely hide my 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.930
 bruises no leg unfortunately it 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.480
 can do 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.650
 but he also corrects the situation with natures 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.600
 as well as bronzer 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.430
 so for Veda this is the best that 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.890
 maybe because he will not be negative 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.510
 affect the skin under the eyes but only 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.130
 moisten it as we make it 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.770
 there is a lot of oil 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.140
 but it is also a minus of this boiler room because 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:10.330
 that he needs to be powdered otherwise he 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.670
 sponsor as eye powder i 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.530
 I use mineral mother and skinfinish 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.160
 it fastens perfectly and does not weigh down 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.900
 our makeup 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.940
 if you have a serious skin problem or 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.620
 you are waiting for the evening exit, I would advise 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.860
 use mineral powder from me 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.930
 she is from the era minerals mirala himself breathing she 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.390
 format is exactly tonal basis it 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.370
 perfectly aligns the tone of the face makes 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.710
 plow it more out of there expensive 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.680
 Shiny in general, all wonderful 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.110
 epithets you can apply the street after this 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.360
 powders she certainly creates not very 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.430
 hard and cover but she still have me 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.280
 I think that mineral powder is the most 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.990
 the best you can think of and dinner 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.120
 in the summer I often like to add liquid and 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.280
 light of i underline the radiance of the face 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.280
 today i use n, b 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.660
 I also put it on the contour of my lips to 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.040
 they look more empty and mouthwatering 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.470
 principle, our makeup can be considered 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.640
 completed we have a correction basis 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.410
 eye makeup 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.840
 but I can't imagine my summer without 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.150
 bright lipstick participation and and our 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.580
 with all or just with mascara so you 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.750
 can add at any stage of makeup i 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.600
 and show at the end 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.780
 as a kind of addition that you can 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.850
 so my favorite lipstick for the summer is 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.250
 rimmel a thousand kisses unfortunately in 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.620
 Russia is not for sale just such a brand 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.390
 it can be ordered on the website and composition 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.490

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.220
 inexpensive and I like it very much 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.770
 so that he leaves the format of the marker, he is like 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.470
 would stay on your fell straight rushes and 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.330
