 a real child's play that

 what is needed of simple milk 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 pasteurized possibly skimmed or 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 also partially shielded and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.510
 rennet that you can buy at the pharmacy

 or at a dairy in liquid form 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.759
 then in voice or in powder like 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.500
 in my case, but how are i prepared? 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.870
 flakes of milk we will prepare one 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.820
 curd then we will coagulate the lat 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.700
 reaching of the rennet then we will do it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690
 rest for about an hour 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.120
 later we will go to break the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 then we will fall back into everything 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.820
 you will see that the cottage cheese will be 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.250
 already ready 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.649
 then clearly if you want to enhance the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.780
 flavor and make cottage cheese plus g 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.160
 You can also add some bread 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.750
 or even Greek yogurt 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.480
 let's see how it is prepared 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.850
 to the original cota is decided for 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.850
 prepare two portions of flakes of 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.280
 milk requires two liters of milk 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.350
 pasteurized I chose milk 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.119
 semi-skimmed if you want the clock 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.210
 and direct even more but Greek dispute of the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.220
 skim milk an ounce of rennet in 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.200
 dust you can also use 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.420
 liquid rennet then in voice but me 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.330
 I recommend always look at the so-called 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.310
 title behind the package 10 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.310
 milliliters of water where we will dissolve the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.250
 rennet if you also want a pair of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.869
 tablespoons of fresh cream and a pinch of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.930
 salt 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.009
 we have already noticed a liter of milk 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.930
 inside a large saucepan 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.350
 we also pour from the perfect drop as well 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.840
 we scan and bring up to 30 degrees 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.310
 so with a thermometer we calculate 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.650
 of temperature until we wait for the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.540
 reaching 30 degrees of art 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.200
 what do we do that we are prepared for? 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.299
 gram of rennet here we have 10 mm 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.289
 then half a glass of water 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.569
 lukewarm and we undergo the rennet a 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.569
 teaspoon we choose it for good so 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.330
 having reached 30 degrees of milk now 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:29.400
 we can pour our loose cai 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:31.230
 in the water it cooks like this and we mix for 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.700
 a couple of minutes so that you 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.700
 distribute evenly 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.200
 we have lost our rennet now 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.450
 we cuddle with a lid and leave 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.140
 rest the curd without ever touching it 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.820
 I recommend it for at least an hour 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.260
 here we are again after an hour enters e 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.870
 means of remembrance 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.020
 let's see how the has changed 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.390
 consistency of the curd taken on 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.340
 pudding texture now with a 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.070
 knife 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.020
 we make cuts in fact we propose you 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.020
 a three-dimensional lattice 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.650
 see that it looks like a pudding 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.340
 first we do some lettering and going 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.080
 well to the end and I recommend it 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.430
 let's also be pretty 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:33.770
 regular in size ok we do 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.490
 born here we make squares or gods 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.490
 diamonds in short 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.450
 perfect so now sees a new thesis 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.849
 a little you see that they are seen little i 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.370
 diamond we created in we go out 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.530
 so rest the curd so without 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.590
 warm up at this time for 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.799
 another 10 minutes to facilitate the detachment 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.190
 of the curd from the whey and to make it 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.260
 harden a little 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.420
 after ten minutes our curd is 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.670
 ready for the second break 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.890
 see what a beautiful thing it has become 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.289
 now what needs to be done 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:19.590
 let's light the fire and bring it all to 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.049
 temperature between 51 and 53 degrees 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.930
 always mixing however this time with 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.160
 the fort because we should get gods 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:35.990
 very small curd beans 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:40.440
 let's start praised what a nice ok 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.000
 we continue to mix first floor then 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.440
 even a little faster if we want to 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.620
 we arrived at 51 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.020
 we are still waiting for a perfect one 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.830
 we can also squeeze and be born 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.220
 another ten minutes our cut a 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.780
 rest after ten minutes you see that the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.729
 curd or rather the cottage cheese 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.450
 now they have settled on the bottom 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:09.870
 so you see only the serum we mix 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.500
 still a little with the fort to disconnect 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.500
 well the bows 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.229
 I put on my gloves for that 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.639
 eventually we will help each other after 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.479
 break the cottage cheese even with the 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.789
 hands 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.120
 but now we are all inside 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.639
 of a clean dishcloth put on one 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:35.780
 colander and clearly there is the under 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.780
 bowl that will meet the serum we pour 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:52.290
 you are that beautiful that are the flakes of 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:55.440
 reflex for we are in everything and we leave 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.780
 to drain also remove the residues of 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.250
 curds that are deposited on the 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.660
 bottom of the casserole is an operation 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.800
 rather fast so it does not require 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.800
 a lot of time 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.990
 here is all the serum 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.770
 as you see I have already removed all the 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.860
 serum because he had already arrived at 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.750
 limit of cottage cheese 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.590
 so it no longer dripped and with the 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.770
 fortino I'm breaking the flakes 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.200
 the Romans booty as you prefer 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.830
 let it drain for about half an hour e 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.570
 then you do not feel milk eyes are ready 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:44.530
 our flakes of milk are well 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.480
 drained from the evening and now the system on a 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.600
 nice dish also chosen a black base 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.350
 so we see our people are well seen 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.350
 flakes 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.110
 that's if you want as I told you during 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.870
 the presentation to make the cost is 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:06.570
 cheese is even creamier than you can 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.570
 add some cream 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.790
 or I also like it with it 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.790
 Greek yogurt for example 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:20.510
 then clearly it should also be added 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:23.900
 a little salt to taste not too much 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:26.130
 furthermore courses are ready 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.870
 nutritionally speaking the flakes of 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:31.170
 milk represents a lot of food 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.390
 very interesting light genuine OEDIPUS 

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.460
 calorie in fact unlike the 

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.740
 most of our cheeses 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.260
 power cheese can be considered in 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.900
 light cheese to all effects from 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.390
 protein point of view instead we find 

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.370
 a voucher a quantity in terms of 

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.800
 casein then the classic proteins of 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.420
 milk but we also find proteins 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.340
 of whey 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.190
 plus our low-fat cottage cheese 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.960
 sodium content fit the 

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:01.460
 realization of innumerable riches 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.460
 reason in more time valley
