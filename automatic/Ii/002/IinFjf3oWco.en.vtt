00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.490
 the peas are going to wash them and I'm going 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.909
 to boil with less water 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.150
 which can 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.790
 we will try to make it soft nothing more 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.310
 with the probation because they are going to go 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.140
 taking the ham as we are going to chop it 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.790
 we will apply the same garlic 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.270
 finely 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.789
 here this heated the oil 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.270
 Now what I'm going to do is add the 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.210
 chilies 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.640
 to fry them a little 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.640
 Here the chilies suffered a bit 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.140
 Now what we are going to do is add the 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.140

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.450

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.829
 today this smells good 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.840
 let's add the ham 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.440
 and the boys 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.100
 what are we going to leave here is that they are treated 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.640
 these two minutes 3 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.760
 and these are two for three minutes now 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.760
 We are going to add the chopped tomato here 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.850
 If the pan is full do not worry 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.390
 right now as far as is 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.390
 spend time will be decreasing the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.390

 we are going to add salt 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.620
 and we will leave it there 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.200
 10 minutes in what grabs the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.519
 the taste of salt and the rest the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.519
 tomato and cilantro 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.420

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.170
 the chicken 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.720
 If we want more broth, we can not 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.780
 add a little broth 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.319
 and if we prefer drier then what 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.750
 we leave as well as how this one stayed 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.900
 before putting the chicken 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.900
 now I'm going to classify it as flavor 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.620

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.470

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.470
 minutes and it will be ready that's how
