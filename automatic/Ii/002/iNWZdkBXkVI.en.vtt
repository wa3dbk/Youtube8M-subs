then<00:02:31.910> over<00:02:32.360> at<00:02:32.540> sleight<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.840> hand<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:34.280> switch

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
then over at sleight of hand this switch

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.660 
then over at sleight of hand this switch
is<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:36.260> wall<00:02:36.560> or<00:02:36.590> right<00:02:38.290> here<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.370> right<00:02:40.550> on

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
is on the wall or right here so right on

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.660 
is on the wall or right here so right on
this<00:02:40.790> wall<00:02:40.970> here<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.270> switch<00:02:41.510> will<00:02:41.630> be<00:02:42.670> you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
this wall here the switch will be you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.850 
this wall here the switch will be you
need<00:02:43.820> four<00:02:44.060> players<00:02:44.360> for<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:44.750> everyone<00:02:45.560> has

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
need four players for this everyone has

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.760 
need four players for this everyone has
to<00:02:46.160> click<00:02:46.340> x<00:02:46.580> at<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.820> same<00:02:47.090> time<00:02:47.560> it's<00:02:48.560> not

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
to click x at the same time it's not

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.870 
to click x at the same time it's not
that<00:02:48.980> big<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.760> deal<00:02:50.710> like<00:02:51.710> it<00:02:52.280> seems<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.730> lot

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
that big of a deal like it seems a lot

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.730 
that big of a deal like it seems a lot
worse<00:02:53.030> than<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.570> but<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:54.110> can<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:54.620> keep

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
worse than it is but you can just keep

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.190 
worse than it is but you can just keep
holding<00:02:54.980> acts<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.430> tapping<00:02:55.640> X<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.210> then<00:02:56.270> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
holding acts or tapping X and then the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.320 
holding acts or tapping X and then the
switch<00:02:57.410> goes<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.070> you've<00:02:58.940> done<00:02:59.180> the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
switch goes in and you've done the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.570 
switch goes in and you've done the
second<00:02:59.630> part<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.900> it<00:02:59.990> there's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.620> third<00:03:00.950> part<00:03:01.460> I

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
second part of it there's a third part I

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.690 
second part of it there's a third part I
guess<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:03.620> third<00:03:03.770> hardest<00:03:05.080> um<00:03:06.520> so<00:03:07.520> once

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
guess the third hardest um so once

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.250 
guess the third hardest um so once
you've<00:03:07.820> done<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:10.959> take<00:03:11.959> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.040 

you<00:03:15.260> got<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.560> go<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:16.610> rocket<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:17.930> have

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
you got to go to the rocket so you have

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.760 
you got to go to the rocket so you have
to<00:03:18.140> take<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.410> Landers<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:19.040> start<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:20.560> are<00:03:21.560> to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
to take the Landers to start the are to

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.430 
to take the Landers to start the are to
feel<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.180> rocket<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.300> then<00:03:23.660> when<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.140> rocket

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
feel the rocket and then when the rocket

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.729 
feel the rocket and then when the rocket
takes<00:03:24.620> off<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:25.130> can<00:03:25.280> go<00:03:25.489> inside<00:03:25.850> here<00:03:26.420> and

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
takes off you can go inside here and

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.960 
takes off you can go inside here and
then<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:27.950> will<00:03:28.070> notice<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:29.590> clock<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.860> wall

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
then you will notice a clock on the wall

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.770 
then you will notice a clock on the wall
um<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.890> do<00:03:34.070> not<00:03:34.280> need<00:03:34.610> ballistic<00:03:35.239> knifes<00:03:35.510> it

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
um you do not need ballistic knifes it

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.990 
um you do not need ballistic knifes it
is<00:03:35.930> rumored<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.830> need<00:03:37.100> them<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.610> you

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
is rumored that you need them but you

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
need to stay in still that is also false

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.990 
need to stay in still that is also false
um<00:03:43.730> you're<00:03:44.600> actually<00:03:44.810> standing<00:03:45.170> on<00:03:45.470> a

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
um you're actually standing on a

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.880 
um you're actually standing on a
pressure<00:03:47.000> plate<00:03:47.209> kind<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.810> thing<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.739> can

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
pressure plate kind of thing and you can

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.440 
pressure plate kind of thing and you can
run<00:03:49.040> around<00:03:49.959> under<00:03:51.850> like<00:03:52.850> where<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.120> rocket

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
run around under like where the rocket

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.630 
run around under like where the rocket
is<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.810> circle<00:03:54.230> part<00:03:54.739> I'm<00:03:54.890> on<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.489> can

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
is like the circle part I'm on you can

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.660 
is like the circle part I'm on you can
run<00:03:55.790> around<00:03:55.910> on<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:56.530> but<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.800> cannot<00:03:58.220> step

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
run around on that but you cannot step

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.490 
run around on that but you cannot step
off<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:58.910> if<00:03:59.270> you<00:03:59.420> do<00:03:59.570> step<00:03:59.840> off<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.050> then<00:04:00.380> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
off it if you do step off it then the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.420 
off it if you do step off it then the
time<00:04:00.709> restarts<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:03.590> do<00:04:03.860> have<00:04:04.070> to<00:04:04.280> wait<00:04:04.400> for

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
time restarts you do have to wait for

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.910 
time restarts you do have to wait for
two<00:04:04.730> minutes

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
two minutes

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.670 
two minutes
um<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:08.280> also<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.690> reason<00:04:10.870> people<00:04:11.260> believed

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
um and also the reason people believed

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.110 
um and also the reason people believed
it<00:04:11.860> was<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.010> ballistic<00:04:12.400> knife<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:12.819> needed

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
it was a ballistic knife that you needed

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.449 
it was a ballistic knife that you needed
was<00:04:13.300> because<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.980> second<00:04:14.980> hand<00:04:15.160> was<00:04:15.430> a

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
was because the second hand was a

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.500 
was because the second hand was a
ballistic<00:04:15.910> knife<00:04:16.060> going<00:04:16.389> backwards<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.230> yeah

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
ballistic knife going backwards so yeah

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.370 
ballistic knife going backwards so yeah
so<00:04:19.510> after<00:04:19.630> two<00:04:19.870> minutes<00:04:20.019> nuke<00:04:20.590> goes<00:04:20.620> off<00:04:21.040> and

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
so after two minutes nuke goes off and

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.900 
so after two minutes nuke goes off and
that's<00:04:23.380> when<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.919> go<00:04:24.220> back<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.580> wherever<00:04:24.760> you

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
that's when you go back to wherever you

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
that's when you go back to wherever you
want<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.419> go<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:27.610> camping<00:04:28.150> at<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.480> PhD

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
want to go we like camping at the PhD

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.870 
want to go we like camping at the PhD
flopper<00:04:30.120> called<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.270> comfort<00:04:31.720> zone<00:04:32.430> oh<00:04:33.430> yeah

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
flopper called the comfort zone oh yeah

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.219 
flopper called the comfort zone oh yeah
that's<00:04:34.060> where<00:04:34.240> we<00:04:34.360> camp<00:04:34.600> out<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:35.050> then<00:04:35.889> uh

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
that's where we camp out and then uh

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.090 
that's where we camp out and then uh
yeah<00:04:38.229> so<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.639> map<00:04:40.210> showing<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:41.740> where

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
yeah so this is a map showing you where

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.460 
yeah so this is a map showing you where
the<00:04:42.250> letters<00:04:42.580> are<00:04:42.729> in<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:43.120> sky<00:04:46.260> so<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:47.350> have

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
the letters are in the sky so you have

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.990 
the letters are in the sky so you have
to<00:04:47.590> take<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.800> Landers<00:04:48.570> in<00:04:49.570> that<00:04:50.139> direction<00:04:51.000> so

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
to take the Landers in that direction so

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.219 
to take the Landers in that direction so
what<00:04:52.389> you're<00:04:52.479> going<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.660> do<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:52.990> call<00:04:53.169> the

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
what you're going to do is call the

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.990 
what you're going to do is call the
lander<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.710> main<00:04:53.860> area<00:04:54.100> get<00:04:54.610> someone<00:04:54.940> to

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000
