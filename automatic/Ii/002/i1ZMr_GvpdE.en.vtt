longer and ultimately perform better in
damp<00:01:20.490> conditions<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.960> wear<00:01:22.110> this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
damp conditions so you can wear this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.810

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
jacket longer it's going to stand up to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
jacket longer it's going to stand up to
conditions<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.360> typically<00:01:27.900> either

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
