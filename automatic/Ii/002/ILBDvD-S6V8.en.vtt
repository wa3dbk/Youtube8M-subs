the mosaics they actually fertilized 8x

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.340 
the mosaics they actually fertilized 8x

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
 bird of the flaws appear on the top

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.690 
 bird of the flaws appear on the top
cages<00:00:28.500> they<00:00:29.429> brought<00:00:29.699> up<00:00:29.970> four<00:00:30.420> chicks

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
second round they actually produced

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.240 
second round they actually produced
another<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.420> five<00:00:39.750> young<00:00:40.250> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
another I think it was five young and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.860 
another I think it was five young and
then<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> other<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.969> don't<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.360> what<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> was

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
then the other I don't know what it was

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.810 
then the other I don't know what it was
we<00:00:43.230> had<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> change<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.980> weather<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
we had a change of weather now the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.190 
we had a change of weather now the
lovely<00:00:45.090> hot<00:00:45.360> week<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.430> they<00:00:47.430> let<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:48.200> five

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
lovely hot week and they let all five

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.170 
lovely hot week and they let all five
young<00:00:49.620> died<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.250> throw<00:00:50.610> them<00:00:50.700> out<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> nest

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
young died and throw them out the nest

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.740 
young died and throw them out the nest
so<00:00:52.160> if<00:00:53.160> they<00:00:53.309> knew<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> cause<00:00:54.420> was

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
so if they knew what the cause was

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.110 
so if they knew what the cause was
it'd<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.289> easy<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.649> put<00:00:55.829> right<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.969> just

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it'd be easy to put right but it's just

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.450 
it'd be easy to put right but it's just
something<00:00:57.420> birds<00:00:57.840> seem<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.309> on

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
something birds seem to do it on

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.760 
something birds seem to do it on
occasion<00:00:59.730> whether<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.809> weather<00:01:01.020> changes<00:01:01.739> or

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
occasion whether the weather changes or

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.520

eggs but the oh I think they're all
clear<00:03:40.329> because<00:03:40.540> they<00:03:40.810> should<00:03:40.989> have<00:03:41.079> acts<00:03:41.230> by

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
clear because they should have acts by

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.680 
clear because they should have acts by
now<00:03:41.680> but<00:03:42.340> I'll<00:03:42.760> she'll<00:03:43.239> leave<00:03:43.480> them

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
eventually if they don't actually know

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.900 
eventually if they don't actually know
cause<00:03:46.359> she<00:03:46.480> listens<00:03:46.870> for<00:03:47.340> sounds<00:03:48.340> inside<00:03:48.700> the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
see I've started to call a feed or the

young birds at the bottom and the older
 birds<00:04:12.540> because<00:04:13.540> they'll<00:04:13.690> start<00:04:13.989> while

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
 birds because they'll start while

the young birds are already starting to

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.159 
the young birds are already starting to
lose<00:04:16.450> feathers<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:18.609> you've<00:04:19.120> got<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.390> get<00:04:19.510> the

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
lose feathers so you've got to get the

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.860 
lose feathers so you've got to get the
of<00:04:20.319> food<00:04:20.499> into<00:04:20.829> their<00:04:20.979> system<00:04:21.719> before<00:04:22.719> they

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
of food into their system before they

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
start to molt so I've started giving it

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.290 
start to molt so I've started giving it
to<00:04:25.659> them<00:04:25.749> in<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.110> thin<00:04:26.499> soft<00:04:27.099> food<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.729> in<00:04:28.270> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
to them in the thin soft food and in the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.929 
to them in the thin soft food and in the
water<00:04:28.599> and<00:04:29.590> then<00:04:29.800> eventually<00:04:30.249> is<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.550> go<00:04:30.759> on<00:04:30.909> to

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 
water and then eventually is to go on to

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.170 
water and then eventually is to go on to
hard<00:04:31.240> seed<00:04:31.629> I<00:04:31.930> will<00:04:32.650> reduce<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.580> soft<00:04:33.909> food

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
hard seed I will reduce the soft food

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.330 
hard seed I will reduce the soft food
and<00:04:34.509> just<00:04:34.749> give<00:04:34.990> it<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.199> me<00:04:35.229> in<00:04:35.379> the<00:04:35.439> water<00:04:35.620> some

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
and just give it to me in the water some

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.309 
and just give it to me in the water some
people<00:04:36.699> give<00:04:36.849> it<00:04:36.999> only<00:04:37.210> in<00:04:37.509> soft<00:04:37.810> food<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.199> not

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
people give it only in soft food and not

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.659 
people give it only in soft food and not
in<00:04:38.469> the<00:04:38.560> water<00:04:38.770> because<00:04:39.129> it's<00:04:39.249> less<00:04:39.430> messy

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
in the water because it's less messy

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.839 
in the water because it's less messy
this<00:04:40.449> is<00:04:40.509> the<00:04:40.749> way<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.199> do<00:04:41.439> it<00:04:41.800> there's<00:04:42.310> no<00:04:42.400> right

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
this is the way I do it there's no right

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.600 
this is the way I do it there's no right
there's<00:04:43.180> no<00:04:43.509> wrong<00:04:43.810> way<00:04:43.840> it's<00:04:44.650> entirely<00:04:45.039> what

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
there's no wrong way it's entirely what

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.089 
there's no wrong way it's entirely what
suits<00:04:45.939> yourself<00:04:46.499> some<00:04:47.499> people<00:04:47.830> are<00:04:47.919> probably

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
suits yourself some people are probably
