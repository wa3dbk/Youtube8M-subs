make<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.370> 3d<00:00:06.029> video<00:00:06.299> in<00:00:06.720> iMovie<00:00:06.990> Oh<00:00:07.319> 9<00:00:07.649> or<00:00:07.919> iMovie

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
make a 3d video in iMovie Oh 9 or iMovie

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.660 
make a 3d video in iMovie Oh 9 or iMovie
11<00:00:08.670> I'm<00:00:09.420> gonna<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.870> using<00:00:10.110> iMovie<00:00:10.650> Oh<00:00:10.679> 9<00:00:10.980> but<00:00:11.490> it

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
11 I'm gonna be using iMovie Oh 9 but it

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.230 
11 I'm gonna be using iMovie Oh 9 but it
is<00:00:11.969> exactly<00:00:12.540> almost<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.620> same<00:00:13.830> as<00:00:14.099> iMovie<00:00:15.000> 11

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
is exactly almost the same as iMovie 11

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.990 
is exactly almost the same as iMovie 11
it<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.800> iMovie<00:00:16.800> 11<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.220> has<00:00:17.340> more<00:00:17.550> stuff<00:00:17.789> than

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
it is iMovie 11 just has more stuff than

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.750 
it is iMovie 11 just has more stuff than
this<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.869> will<00:00:19.050> still<00:00:19.289> work<00:00:19.760> but

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
this so this will still work but

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.330 
this so this will still work but
normally<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:22.140> our<00:00:22.289> tutorials<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.010> just

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
normally with our tutorials it's just

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.810 
normally with our tutorials it's just
completely<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:24.150> iMovie<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.519> one

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
completely in iMovie but for this one

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.169 
completely in iMovie but for this one
it's<00:00:27.090> also<00:00:27.269> gonna<00:00:27.599> require<00:00:27.990> some<00:00:28.529> other

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
it's also gonna require some other

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.900 
it's also gonna require some other
techniques<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.470> filming<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.309> itself

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
techniques for the filming of it itself

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.139 
techniques for the filming of it itself
so<00:00:33.329> we're<00:00:34.290> gonna<00:00:34.410> show<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.649> our<00:00:35.100> setup<00:00:35.790> right

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
have to go into iMovie preferences and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.530 
have to go into iMovie preferences and
like<00:02:04.619> all<00:02:04.799> my<00:02:04.920> other<00:02:04.950> tutorials<00:02:05.640> activate

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
like all my other tutorials activate

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.380 
like all my other tutorials activate
advanced<00:02:07.049> tools<00:02:07.759> you're<00:02:08.759> then<00:02:08.910> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> take

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
advanced tools you're then going to take

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
advanced tools you're then going to take
so<00:02:09.780> now<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.229> your<00:02:11.009> advanced<00:02:11.400> tools

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so now that you have your advanced tools

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.290 
so now that you have your advanced tools
you're<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.120> more<00:02:12.270> options

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
you're going to have more options

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.880 
you're going to have more options
for<00:02:13.480> editing<00:02:13.990> your<00:02:14.050> videos<00:02:14.530> which<00:02:14.740> is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
for editing your videos which is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.980 
for editing your videos which is
actually<00:02:15.160> nice<00:02:15.250> doing<00:02:16.060> whatever<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.600> do<00:02:16.720> it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so you're then gonna take your next clip

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.630 
so you're then gonna take your next clip
select<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.970> drag<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.120> over<00:02:22.270> top<00:02:23.250> at<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.430> very

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640

beginning and click cutaway now I
haven't<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:27.610> used<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.150> any<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.450> my

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
haven't really used this in any of my

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.030 
haven't really used this in any of my
tutorials<00:02:29.050> but<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.290> found<00:02:29.500> out<00:02:29.740> that<00:02:29.890> it's

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
tutorials but I found out that it's

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
tutorials but I found out that it's
actually<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:30.730> nice<00:02:31.200> okay<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.880> said

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
actually really nice okay so like I said

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.000 
actually really nice okay so like I said
you're<00:02:34.210> gonna<00:02:34.300> have<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.570> edit<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.980> make

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
you're gonna have to edit it to make

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.340 
you're gonna have to edit it to make
them<00:02:36.550> around<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.150> same<00:02:37.360> length<00:02:37.600> these<00:02:37.990> aren't

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
them around the same length these aren't

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.610 
them around the same length these aren't
exactly<00:02:39.600> but<00:02:40.600> when<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.170> first<00:02:41.320> put<00:02:41.590> on

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
exactly but when you first put on

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.220 
exactly but when you first put on
cutaway<00:02:42.160> it's<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.820> just<00:02:43.030> completely<00:02:43.600> goes<00:02:44.020> on

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
cutaway it's it just completely goes on

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.690 
cutaway it's it just completely goes on
top<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.590> clip<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.100> can't<00:02:45.310> see<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
top of the clip and you can't see the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.490 
top of the clip and you can't see the
other<00:02:45.850> clip<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.330> it's<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:47.110> other<00:02:47.260> clip

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
other clip so it's like the other clip

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.000 
other clip so it's like the other clip
wasn't<00:02:47.830> even<00:02:48.070> there<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.840> that's<00:02:50.440> obviously

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
wasn't even there but that's obviously

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.420 
wasn't even there but that's obviously
not<00:02:51.100> what<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:51.790> want<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.650> you've<00:02:53.920> seen<00:02:54.160> our

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
not what we want and if you've seen our

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.350 
not what we want and if you've seen our
3d<00:02:55.060> picture<00:02:55.480> tutorial<00:02:56.700> you'll<00:02:57.700> see<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.940> lot<00:02:58.210> of

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
3d picture tutorial you'll see a lot of

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.200 
3d picture tutorial you'll see a lot of
similarities<00:02:58.990> between<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.440> two<00:02:59.680> because

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
similarities between the two because

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.400 
similarities between the two because
essentially<00:03:01.210> it<00:03:01.300> works<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> exact<00:03:02.170> same

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
essentially it works on the exact same

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.460 
essentially it works on the exact same
principles<00:03:03.040> as<00:03:03.280> each<00:03:03.490> other<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.960> you're<00:03:05.320> gonna

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
principles as each other so you're gonna

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.830 
principles as each other so you're gonna
take<00:03:06.280> your<00:03:06.460> other<00:03:06.670> clip<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.240> you're<00:03:07.750> gonna

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
take your other clip and you're gonna

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.320 
take your other clip and you're gonna
double<00:03:08.650> click<00:03:08.770> on<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.310> put<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.150> around

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
double click on it and put it to around

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.410 
double click on it and put it to around
55<00:03:10.810> like<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.920> our<00:03:12.070> other<00:03:12.190> tutorial<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.880> as<00:03:13.270> you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
55 like in our other tutorial and as you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.350 
55 like in our other tutorial and as you
can<00:03:13.540> see<00:03:13.750> now<00:03:13.960> you<00:03:14.020> have<00:03:14.580> kind<00:03:15.580> of<00:03:15.700> your<00:03:15.880> it's

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
can see now you have kind of your it's

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.810 
can see now you have kind of your it's
like<00:03:16.570> seeing<00:03:16.840> doubles<00:03:17.350> because<00:03:17.890> our<00:03:18.400> eyes

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
like seeing doubles because our eyes

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.790 
like seeing doubles because our eyes
they<00:03:19.209> technically<00:03:19.660> see<00:03:19.900> doubles<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:20.500> our

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
they technically see doubles but our

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.330 
they technically see doubles but our
mind<00:03:21.130> combines<00:03:21.610> them<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.239> creates<00:03:22.870> one

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
mind combines them and creates one

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.500 
mind combines them and creates one
vision<00:03:24.340> with<00:03:24.840> perd<00:03:25.840> with<00:03:26.620> depth<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.610> stuff

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
vision with perd with depth and stuff

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.020 
vision with perd with depth and stuff
like<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:29.650> that's<00:03:29.770> what<00:03:30.040> 3d<00:03:30.520> is<00:03:30.760> doing

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
like that and so that's what 3d is doing

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.690 
like that and so that's what 3d is doing
is<00:03:31.180> it's<00:03:31.450> combining<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.140> two<00:03:32.290> colors<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:33.010> so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
is it's combining the two colors and so

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.850 
is it's combining the two colors and so
your<00:03:34.209> mind<00:03:34.239> thinks<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:34.930> seemed<00:03:35.200> depth<00:03:35.470> but<00:03:35.770> in

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
your mind thinks it seemed depth but in

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.310 
your mind thinks it seemed depth but in
reality<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.610> reality<00:03:37.420> it's<00:03:37.660> not<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.170> you're

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
reality in reality it's not so you're

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.930 
reality in reality it's not so you're
tricking<00:03:38.650> your<00:03:38.739> mind<00:03:38.920> but<00:03:39.550> what<00:03:39.730> you're<00:03:39.880> gonna

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
tricking your mind but what you're gonna

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.140 
tricking your mind but what you're gonna
do<00:03:40.150> you're<00:03:40.300> gonna<00:03:40.450> put<00:03:40.770> how<00:03:41.770> like<00:03:42.070> clear<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.000> is

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
do you're gonna put how like clear it is

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.660 
do you're gonna put how like clear it is
the<00:03:43.180> opacity<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.440> hundred<00:03:44.890> percent<00:03:45.010> because

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
the opacity to a hundred percent because

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.790 
the opacity to a hundred percent because
we're<00:03:45.970> gonna<00:03:46.120> be<00:03:46.270> changing<00:03:46.660> in<00:03:46.750> colors<00:03:47.050> now

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
we're gonna be changing in colors now

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.660 
we're gonna be changing in colors now
I'm<00:03:48.100> gonna<00:03:48.280> use<00:03:48.370> blue<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:50.070> yellow<00:03:51.070> for<00:03:51.520> this

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
I'm gonna use blue and yellow for this

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.630 
I'm gonna use blue and yellow for this
because<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:53.140> don't<00:03:53.200> have<00:03:53.470> any<00:03:53.680> blue<00:03:53.800> and<00:03:53.980> red<00:03:54.130> 3d

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
because I don't have any blue and red 3d

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.660 
because I don't have any blue and red 3d
glasses<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.380> actually<00:03:56.380> blue<00:03:56.800> and<00:03:57.070> yellow<00:03:57.220> is

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
glasses and actually blue and yellow is

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.270 
glasses and actually blue and yellow is
I<00:03:58.180> find<00:03:58.840> quite<00:03:59.020> a<00:03:59.110> bit<00:03:59.260> nicer<00:03:59.440> because<00:03:59.800> what<00:04:00.160> it

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
I find quite a bit nicer because what it

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.050 
I find quite a bit nicer because what it
actually<00:04:00.459> does<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.690> keeps<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.290> color<00:04:02.500> sort

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
actually does is it keeps the color sort

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.640 
actually does is it keeps the color sort
it<00:04:04.060> keeps<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.660> color<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:06.370> picture

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
it keeps the color of the picture

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.960 
it keeps the color of the picture
instead<00:04:08.650> because<00:04:09.160> with<00:04:09.370> blue<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:09.820> red

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
instead because with blue and red

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.670 
instead because with blue and red
sometimes<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.630> can<00:04:10.750> take<00:04:10.930> away<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.440> color

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
sometimes it can take away the color

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.860 
sometimes it can take away the color
kind<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.459> it'll<00:04:12.700> just<00:04:12.820> look<00:04:13.000> gray<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.720> it

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
kind of and it'll just look gray and it

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.810 
kind of and it'll just look gray and it
wouldn't<00:04:14.200> look<00:04:14.290> good<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.070> I'm<00:04:15.430> gonna<00:04:15.550> use

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
wouldn't look good so I'm gonna use

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.590 
wouldn't look good so I'm gonna use
yellow<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.239> blue<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.769> here<00:04:18.760> if<00:04:19.030> you're<00:04:19.269> gonna

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
yellow and blue so here if you're gonna

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.110 
yellow and blue so here if you're gonna
do<00:04:19.810> yellow<00:04:20.260> you're<00:04:21.130> gonna<00:04:21.250> put<00:04:21.520> it<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.850> around

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
do yellow you're gonna put it to around

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.870 
do yellow you're gonna put it to around
here<00:04:22.800> you're<00:04:23.800> then<00:04:23.979> going<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.220> take<00:04:24.370> away<00:04:24.640> all

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
here you're then going to take away all

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.790 
here you're then going to take away all
the<00:04:25.060> blue<00:04:25.740> take

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800

some<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.340> green<00:04:27.580> because<00:04:27.849> most<00:04:28.539> of<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
some of the green because most of the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.249 
some of the green because most of the
time<00:04:28.990> it's<00:04:29.860> kind<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.370> darker<00:04:30.789> yellow<00:04:31.259> and

it<00:05:40.750> is<00:05:40.900> again<00:05:41.259> you<00:05:41.380> can<00:05:41.500> play<00:05:41.650> with<00:05:41.800> con<00:05:42.009> play

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
it is again you can play with con play

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.399 
it is again you can play with con play
with<00:05:42.729> the<00:05:42.849> contrast<00:05:43.419> and<00:05:43.719> all<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.289> other

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
with the contrast and all the other

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.189 
with the contrast and all the other
options<00:05:44.830> there<00:05:45.449> so<00:05:46.449> now<00:05:46.599> you<00:05:46.659> have<00:05:46.810> your<00:05:46.960> blue

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
options there so now you have your blue

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.550 
options there so now you have your blue
and<00:05:47.560> your<00:05:48.039> yellow<00:05:48.219> clip<00:05:48.580> which<00:05:48.759> is<00:05:48.940> on<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.300> top

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
and your yellow clip which is on the top

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.420 
and your yellow clip which is on the top
you're<00:05:50.560> going<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.770> double<00:05:51.039> click<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.340> other

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
you're going to double click the other

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.959 
you're going to double click the other
one<00:05:51.699> and<00:05:51.940> you're<00:05:52.810> gonna<00:05:52.930> put<00:05:53.199> it<00:05:53.319> to<00:05:53.650> around<00:05:55.289> 56

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969 
one and you're gonna put it to around 56

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.600 
one and you're gonna put it to around 56
55%<00:05:57.969> so<00:05:58.539> now<00:05:58.659> you<00:05:58.719> have<00:05:58.990> your<00:05:59.020> two<00:05:59.710> clips<00:06:00.279> but

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
55% so now you have your two clips but

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.700 
55% so now you have your two clips but
they're<00:06:01.180> not<00:06:01.330> really<00:06:01.599> lined<00:06:01.990> up<00:06:02.229> as<00:06:02.440> you<00:06:02.590> can

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
they're not really lined up as you can

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.649 
they're not really lined up as you can
see<00:06:02.889> they're<00:06:03.219> above<00:06:04.000> each<00:06:04.150> other<00:06:04.360> you<00:06:04.539> don't

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
see they're above each other you don't

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:05.670 
see they're above each other you don't
want<00:06:04.870> that<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.139> want<00:06:05.289> them<00:06:05.409> side-by-side

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
want that you want them side-by-side

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.869 
want that you want them side-by-side
more<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:07.840> as<00:06:08.830> you<00:06:08.979> can<00:06:09.099> see<00:06:09.279> my<00:06:09.430> clips<00:06:09.699> are

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:09.879 
more and as you can see my clips are

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.119 
more and as you can see my clips are
exactly<00:06:10.569> adjusted<00:06:11.110> so<00:06:11.289> they're<00:06:11.440> synchronized

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
exactly adjusted so they're synchronized

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.969 
exactly adjusted so they're synchronized
so<00:06:12.460> it'll<00:06:12.759> work<00:06:12.940> so<00:06:13.810> you're<00:06:14.050> gonna<00:06:14.139> click<00:06:14.800> on

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
so it'll work so you're gonna click on

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.119 
so it'll work so you're gonna click on
one<00:06:15.219> just<00:06:15.460> click<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:15.819> C<00:06:16.090> key<00:06:16.330> to<00:06:16.389> crop<00:06:16.750> and<00:06:17.139> you

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
one just click the C key to crop and you

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.510 
one just click the C key to crop and you
can<00:06:18.279> move<00:06:18.400> it<00:06:18.550> up<00:06:18.729> or<00:06:18.909> down<00:06:19.830> this<00:06:20.830> one<00:06:21.039> it's<00:06:21.400> a

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
can move it up or down this one it's a

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.360 
can move it up or down this one it's a
little<00:06:21.639> closer<00:06:22.000> now<00:06:22.270> click<00:06:23.139> that<00:06:23.379> blue<00:06:24.129> it<00:06:24.219> up

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
little closer now click that blue it up

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.869 
little closer now click that blue it up
a<00:06:24.490> little<00:06:24.610> more<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:29.560> blue<00:06:29.830> one<00:06:30.099> is<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.430> one<00:06:30.759> on

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:30.879 
a little more the blue one is the one on

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.459 
a little more the blue one is the one on
top<00:06:31.090> so<00:06:31.449> I'm<00:06:31.599> gonna<00:06:31.719> have<00:06:31.960> to<00:06:32.050> actually<00:06:32.139> move

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:32.469 
top so I'm gonna have to actually move

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.029 
top so I'm gonna have to actually move
that<00:06:32.680> down<00:06:33.129> and<00:06:33.610> you<00:06:34.330> it's<00:06:34.870> easier<00:06:35.409> to<00:06:35.649> find

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
that down and you it's easier to find

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.150 
that down and you it's easier to find
something<00:06:36.520> that's<00:06:36.729> kind<00:06:37.570> of<00:06:37.719> like<00:06:37.930> a<00:06:38.139> point<00:06:38.560> of

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
something that's kind of like a point of

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.740 
something that's kind of like a point of
I<00:06:40.220> didn't<00:06:40.550> do<00:06:40.610> this<00:06:40.730> in<00:06:40.790> advance<00:06:41.120> so<00:06:41.300> it<00:06:41.570> will

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
I didn't do this in advance so it will

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.930 
I didn't do this in advance so it will
take<00:06:41.930> a<00:06:41.990> while<00:06:42.200> to<00:06:42.500> do<00:06:42.620> this<00:06:42.760> actually<00:06:43.760> right

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
take a while to do this actually right

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.100 
take a while to do this actually right
here<00:06:44.300> I<00:06:44.480> got<00:06:44.870> it

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
here I got it

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.640 
here I got it
that's<00:06:45.620> convenient<00:06:46.570> so<00:06:47.570> as<00:06:47.900> you<00:06:48.110> can<00:06:48.200> see<00:06:48.410> now

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
that's convenient so as you can see now

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.340 
that's convenient so as you can see now
there's<00:06:49.280> a<00:06:49.400> slight<00:06:50.030> difference<00:06:50.270> you<00:06:51.170> might

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
there's a slight difference you might

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.190 
there's a slight difference you might
have<00:06:51.590> to<00:06:51.800> move<00:06:52.760> it<00:06:52.970> to<00:06:53.000> the<00:06:53.390> side<00:06:53.690> and<00:06:53.990> crop

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
have to move it to the side and crop

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.290 
have to move it to the side and crop
that<00:06:54.380> but<00:06:55.130> like<00:06:55.340> I<00:06:55.460> said<00:06:55.520> this<00:06:55.820> is<00:06:56.000> just<00:06:56.180> her

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
that but like I said this is just her

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
have 3d glasses on this would look kind

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.920 
have 3d glasses on this would look kind
of<00:07:09.650> 3d<00:07:09.980> but<00:07:10.160> just<00:07:10.790> a<00:07:10.940> warning<00:07:11.180> of<00:07:11.570> when<00:07:11.780> you're

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
of 3d but just a warning of when you're

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.220 
of 3d but just a warning of when you're
doing<00:07:12.230> this<00:07:13.180> when<00:07:14.180> it<00:07:14.300> goes<00:07:14.420> really<00:07:14.690> close<00:07:15.080> to

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230 
doing this when it goes really close to

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.350 
doing this when it goes really close to
the<00:07:15.350> camera<00:07:15.560> like<00:07:16.070> this<00:07:16.250> tube<00:07:16.490> does<00:07:16.760> as<00:07:16.970> you

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
the camera like this tube does as you

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.320 
the camera like this tube does as you
can<00:07:17.660> see<00:07:18.050> here<00:07:18.680> it's<00:07:18.980> really<00:07:19.490> separated<00:07:20.180> the

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
can see here it's really separated the

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.260 
can see here it's really separated the
two<00:07:20.480> pictures<00:07:20.800> you<00:07:21.800> don't<00:07:22.010> want<00:07:22.310> that<00:07:22.550> so<00:07:22.940> just

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.270 
two pictures you don't want that so just

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.910 
two pictures you don't want that so just
try<00:07:23.480> to<00:07:23.540> avoid<00:07:23.780> going<00:07:24.140> too<00:07:24.440> close<00:07:24.680> to<00:07:24.830> the

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:24.920 
try to avoid going too close to the

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.370 
try to avoid going too close to the
camera<00:07:25.100> you<00:07:25.280> can<00:07:25.430> go<00:07:25.550> like<00:07:25.730> here<00:07:26.210> but<00:07:26.930> don't<00:07:27.170> go

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380 
camera you can go like here but don't go

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.560 
camera you can go like here but don't go
really<00:07:27.800> close<00:07:27.920> because<00:07:28.280> you<00:07:28.760> lose<00:07:29.030> the<00:07:29.240> 3d

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570 
really close because you lose the 3d

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.440 
really close because you lose the 3d
effect<00:07:29.930> and<00:07:30.080> won't<00:07:30.380> look<00:07:30.470> three<00:07:30.770> anymore<00:07:31.130> I

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:31.450 
effect and won't look three anymore I

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.290 
effect and won't look three anymore I
really<00:07:32.450> hope<00:07:32.630> that<00:07:32.690> this<00:07:32.990> tutorial<00:07:33.200> helped<00:07:34.300> if
