what I've done is I've taken an old home
light<00:00:09.540> weed<00:00:10.469> trimmer<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.389> married<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.540> up<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
light weed trimmer and married it up to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.129 
light weed trimmer and married it up to
one<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.139> those<00:00:13.309> back<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> car<00:00:15.139> old-school

tire<00:00:16.800> compressors<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.850> emergency

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
tire compressors with the emergency

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.230 
tire compressors with the emergency
light<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:19.560> I've<00:00:19.650> done<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.789> had<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.090> make

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
light so what I've done is I had to make

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.560 
light so what I've done is I had to make
a<00:00:21.270> small<00:00:21.660> custom<00:00:22.199> shaft<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:23.460> marry<00:00:23.699> up<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.390> two

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
a small custom shaft to marry up the two

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.330 
a small custom shaft to marry up the two
parts<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.470> basically<00:00:25.619> fits<00:00:26.010> into

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
parts and it just basically fits into

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.759 
parts and it just basically fits into
the<00:00:27.000> slot<00:00:27.210> opening<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.260> inside<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the slot opening on the inside of the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.939 
the slot opening on the inside of the
compressor<00:00:29.279> I've<00:00:29.519> used<00:00:30.330> rubber<00:00:30.869> washers<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
compressor I've used rubber washers to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.639 
compressor I've used rubber washers to
act<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.430> spacers<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.180> also<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.140> know<00:00:34.230> help

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
act as spacers and also to you know help

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.840 
act as spacers and also to you know help
with<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.829> little<00:00:35.100> bit<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> vibration

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
with a little bit of the vibration

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.049 
with a little bit of the vibration
that's<00:00:35.969> gonna<00:00:36.090> happen<00:00:36.329> we've<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.410> our

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
that's gonna happen we've got our

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.920 
that's gonna happen we've got our
pressure<00:00:39.059> gauge<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:40.100> our<00:00:41.100> outlet<00:00:41.489> nozzle<00:00:42.000> for

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
pressure gauge and our outlet nozzle for

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.590 
pressure gauge and our outlet nozzle for
our<00:00:43.170> bike<00:00:43.469> tires<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.360> change

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
our bike tires now I'm not I can change

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
our bike tires now I'm not I can change
this<00:00:45.719> later<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.020> actually<00:00:46.770> mount<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.280> an

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this later on actually mount it to an

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.110 
this later on actually mount it to an
air<00:00:47.640> tank<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.590> haven't<00:00:50.219> actually<00:00:50.610> run<00:00:50.850> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
air tank but I haven't actually run this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.670 
air tank but I haven't actually run this
yet<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> first<00:00:52.320> dry

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
yet so this is going to be the first dry

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.700 
yet so this is going to be the first dry
run<00:00:53.300> I've<00:00:54.300> done<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> without<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.170> spark<00:00:55.440> plug

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
run I've done it without the spark plug

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099 
run I've done it without the spark plug
taking<00:00:56.129> away<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> compression<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.870> see

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
taking away the compression just to see

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.920 
taking away the compression just to see
if<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.829> smooth<00:00:59.129> rotation<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.120> so

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
if I get a smooth rotation and I have so

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.390 
if I get a smooth rotation and I have so
this<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.370> first<00:01:02.719> trial<00:01:03.719> run

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
this is going to be the first trial run

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.190 
this is going to be the first trial run
let<00:01:05.400> me<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.880> lean<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.720> phone<00:01:06.990> up

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
let me see if I can lean my phone up

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.920 
let me see if I can lean my phone up
here<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:09.270> it'll<00:01:09.420> still<00:01:09.750> see

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
here in a way that it'll still see

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:20.880 
here in a way that it'll still see
what's<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:15.080> okay

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.139 

so<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:21.979> can<00:01:22.100> sort<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.430> see<00:01:22.579> what's<00:01:22.759> going<00:01:23.030> on

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
so you can sort of see what's going on

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.170 
so you can sort of see what's going on
from<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.540> angle<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:23.930> might<00:01:24.399> I<00:01:25.399> haven't<00:01:25.909> tried

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
from the angle I might I haven't tried

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.460 
from the angle I might I haven't tried
it<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.049> let's<00:01:27.320> give<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:27.619> pump<00:01:29.020> ready<00:01:30.020> pump<00:01:30.350> it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
it so let's give that pump ready pump it

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.039 
it so let's give that pump ready pump it
up<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.740> couple<00:01:30.890> times<00:01:31.329> and<00:01:32.329> I've<00:01:32.509> changed<00:01:32.930> out

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
up a couple times and I've changed out

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.600 
up a couple times and I've changed out
the<00:01:33.200> original<00:01:33.560> switch<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.070> original<00:01:34.369> switch

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
the original switch the original switch

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.800 
the original switch the original switch
was<00:01:34.789> a<00:01:34.820> little<00:01:35.030> different<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.509> actually

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
was a little different it actually

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.300 
was a little different it actually
grounded<00:01:36.170> against<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.619> casing<00:01:37.039> so<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.189> just

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
grounded against the casing so I just

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.950 
grounded against the casing so I just
threw<00:01:37.700> an<00:01:37.820> old<00:01:38.409> single<00:01:39.409> pull<00:01:39.860> switch<00:01:40.399> on<00:01:40.640> it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
threw an old single pull switch on it

00:01:40.960 --> 00:02:42.150 
threw an old single pull switch on it
off<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.259> on<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:42.710> is<00:01:42.890> off

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.580 

but<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.400> pumping<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:47.590> weed

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
but it is pumping so that is the weed

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.590 
but it is pumping so that is the weed
trimmer<00:02:48.980> air<00:02:49.310> compressor<00:02:50.150> now<00:02:50.300> I'm<00:02:50.390> going<00:02:50.540> to

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
trimmer air compressor now I'm going to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.210 
trimmer air compressor now I'm going to
have<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.960> little<00:02:51.140> bit<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.530> messing

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
have to do a little bit of messing

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.400 
have to do a little bit of messing
around<00:02:52.340> with<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.730> throttle<00:02:53.090> speed<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.720> just

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
around with the throttle speed and just

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.650 
around with the throttle speed and just
get<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.920> low<00:02:55.070> idle<00:02:55.460> to<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.060> good<00:02:56.360> speed

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
get the the low idle to a good speed

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.580 
get the the low idle to a good speed
that<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.020> going<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.170> pump<00:02:57.440> without

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
that it's going to pump without

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.320 
that it's going to pump without
exploding

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
exploding

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.180 
exploding
but<00:02:59.780> that's<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.230> first<00:03:00.440> run<00:03:00.650> seems<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.100> be

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
but that's the first run seems to be

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.640 
but that's the first run seems to be
working<00:03:01.430> pretty<00:03:01.520> good
