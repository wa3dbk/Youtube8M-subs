they were back there default launcher

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.530

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
up each launcher with their own

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.490 
up each launcher with their own
configurations<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> switch<00:02:24.960> between<00:02:25.110> them

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
configurations and switch between them

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.740 
configurations and switch between them
so<00:02:26.040> no<00:02:26.490> more<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.030> save<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.510> file

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
really neat so you can switch between

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.850 
really neat so you can switch between
the<00:02:41.520> different<00:02:42.260> launcher<00:02:43.260> applications<00:02:43.770> as

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the different launcher applications as

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.680 
the different launcher applications as
you<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.160> until<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.610> find<00:02:44.820> one<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.120> now

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
let's go ahead and jump into the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.310 
let's go ahead and jump into the
application<00:02:48.300> again<00:02:48.390> itself<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.110> we're<00:02:49.230> gonna

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
application again itself and we're gonna

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.140
