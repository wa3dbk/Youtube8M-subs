needs i guess there are a few things

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
needs i guess there are a few things
that<00:00:43.079> i<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.200> don't<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.160> this

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that i really don't like with this

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.650 
that i really don't like with this
application<00:00:44.430> straight<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.270> before<00:00:45.510> i<00:00:45.539> get

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
application straight up before i get

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
application straight up before i get
into<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> same<00:00:46.860> time<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.520> does

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
into it but in the same time it does

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
into it but in the same time it does
have<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.030> lot<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> potential<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> few

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
have a lot of potential with a few

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.860 
have a lot of potential with a few
updates<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> future<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.210> first<00:00:51.449> off<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
updates in the future so first off the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.420 
updates in the future so first off the
pistol<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.649> only<00:00:52.800> Gummer<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.309> can

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
pistol is the only Gummer you can

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.420 
pistol is the only Gummer you can
actually<00:00:53.550> engrave<00:00:54.710> signatures<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.010> stuff

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
actually engrave signatures and stuff

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.560 
actually engrave signatures and stuff
onto<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> usually<00:00:59.520> engrave<00:01:00.059> come<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.449> with

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
onto it so usually engrave come up with

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.399 
onto it so usually engrave come up with
little<00:01:00.750> keyboard<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.469> type<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.829> down

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
little keyboard so i just type in down

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.750 
little keyboard so i just type in down
and<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.010> engraved<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760

and there you go it's engraved on the
side<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.420> gun<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:07.590> first<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:09.560> there

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
side of the gun now I'm first up there

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
side of the gun now I'm first up there
should<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.159> lot<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> different<00:01:11.790> things<00:01:12.119> that

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
get into the app is just like it lacks

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.339 
get into the app is just like it lacks
in<00:02:31.390> actual<00:02:31.980> content<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.099> be<00:02:33.220> fair<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:35.200> with

in actual content to be fair so with

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:47.780 
in actual content to be fair so with
this<00:02:35.470> gun<00:02:35.790> I'll<00:02:36.790> go<00:02:37.000> through

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.929 

especially<00:02:48.510> see<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:49.430> few<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.610> guns<00:02:50.790> have

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
especially see the few of the guns have

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.119 
especially see the few of the guns have
got<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> few<00:02:51.299> options<00:02:51.560> like<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.769> one<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:52.980> think

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
got a few options like this one I think

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.369 
got a few options like this one I think
it's<00:02:53.459> got<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> most<00:02:53.879> options<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:55.109> then<00:02:55.230> this

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
it's got the most options but then this

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.660 
it's got the most options but then this
one<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.680> engrave<00:02:56.159> on<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:58.069> it<00:02:59.069> also<00:02:59.370> lacks

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
one you can engrave on to it also lacks

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.520 
one you can engrave on to it also lacks
in<00:03:00.000> camos<00:03:00.599> for<00:03:01.019> all<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.379> guns<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.260> it

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
in camos for all the guns and it just it

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.479 
in camos for all the guns and it just it
feels<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:05.819> really<00:03:06.510> quickly<00:03:06.840> done

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
feels like it was really quickly done

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.530 
feels like it was really quickly done
not<00:03:08.489> knocking<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.849> developers<00:03:09.329> at<00:03:09.420> all

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
not knocking the developers at all

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.640 
not knocking the developers at all
because<00:03:09.659> they're<00:03:09.840> great<00:03:10.079> for<00:03:10.230> send<00:03:10.439> me<00:03:10.530> at<00:03:10.620> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
because they're great for send me at a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.830 
because they're great for send me at a
promo<00:03:11.040> code<00:03:11.280> but<00:03:11.879> what<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.450> they<00:03:12.629> should

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
promo code but what I think they should

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.569 
promo code but what I think they should
do<00:03:12.989> honestly<00:03:13.349> is<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.920> think<00:03:13.980> they<00:03:14.280> should<00:03:14.549> have

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
do honestly is I think they should have

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.520 
do honestly is I think they should have
maybe<00:03:15.030> 3d<00:03:15.599> rendered<00:03:15.930> guns<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.409> could

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
maybe 3d rendered guns you could

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.990 
maybe 3d rendered guns you could
actually<00:03:16.650> look<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.280> full<00:03:17.519> way<00:03:17.670> around<00:03:17.909> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
actually look the full way around the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.750 
actually look the full way around the
gun<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.480> reckon<00:03:19.409> they<00:03:19.829> should<00:03:20.010> tweak<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
gun I reckon they should tweak the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.429 
gun I reckon they should tweak the
engraving<00:03:21.599> system<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.139> you<00:03:22.230> can<00:03:22.349> actually

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
engraving system so you can actually

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.490 
engraving system so you can actually
engrave<00:03:22.889> it<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.370> customize<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.750> like<00:03:25.379> for

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
engrave it and customize it so like for

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.649 
engrave it and customize it so like for
example<00:03:25.560> i<00:03:25.889> could<00:03:25.950> write<00:03:26.790> my<00:03:27.030> signature<00:03:27.540> with

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
example i could write my signature with

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.720 
example i could write my signature with
my<00:03:27.810> finger<00:03:28.200> then<00:03:28.650> maybe<00:03:28.889> position<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.549> down

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
my finger then maybe position it down

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.729 
my finger then maybe position it down
the<00:03:29.879> side<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.389> ammo<00:03:31.139> cartridge<00:03:31.379> right

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
the side of this ammo cartridge right

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.110 
the side of this ammo cartridge right
here<00:03:32.629> it'd<00:03:33.629> be<00:03:33.780> cool<00:03:33.959> if<00:03:34.409> they<00:03:35.099> had<00:03:35.250> more<00:03:35.459> camos

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
here it'd be cool if they had more camos

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.530 
here it'd be cool if they had more camos
and<00:03:36.599> more<00:03:37.579> weapons<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.849> choose<00:03:39.150> from<00:03:39.329> more

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
and more weapons to choose from more

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.780 
and more weapons to choose from more
pretty<00:03:39.780> selective<00:03:39.900> weapons<00:03:40.470> more

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
pretty selective weapons more

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.940 
pretty selective weapons more
accessories<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:42.030> add<00:03:42.150> on<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.450> them<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.769> that's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
accessories to add on to them and that's

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.500 
accessories to add on to them and that's
just<00:03:44.220> even<00:03:44.700> before<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:45.060> get<00:03:45.269> into<00:03:45.389> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
just even before you get into the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.610 
just even before you get into the
shooting<00:03:45.780> range<00:03:45.840> then<00:03:46.590> these<00:03:47.129> are<00:03:47.189> my<00:03:47.400> four

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
shooting range then these are my four

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.490 
shooting range then these are my four
pre-selected<00:03:49.620> comes<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:51.319> another<00:03:52.319> thing

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.129 
is you can only actually have four guns

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.750 

let<00:04:09.870> me<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:09.989> turn<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.349> up

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.729 

that's<00:04:17.760> another<00:04:18.030> thing<00:04:18.380> there's<00:04:19.380> no<00:04:19.560> real

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that's another thing there's no real

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.319 
that's another thing there's no real
animation<00:04:20.250> apart<00:04:20.519> from<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.760> muzzle<00:04:21.000> flash

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
animation apart from the muzzle flash

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.909 
animation apart from the muzzle flash
I'll<00:04:21.959> be<00:04:22.109> cool<00:04:22.290> if<00:04:22.440> there's<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.710> more

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
I'll be cool if there's a more

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.460 
I'll be cool if there's a more
interactive<00:04:23.870> kind<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.990> shooting<00:04:25.320> range

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
interactive kind of a shooting range

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.140 
interactive kind of a shooting range
where<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:25.889> actually<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.250> shooting<00:04:26.790> range<00:04:26.940> and

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
where is actually a shooting range and

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.790 
where is actually a shooting range and
you<00:04:27.270> got<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.630> kind<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:28.050> aim<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.620> shoot

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
you got to kind of aim and shoot

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.790 
you got to kind of aim and shoot
yourself<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:30.630> if<00:04:31.050> she<00:04:31.169> got<00:04:31.290> like<00:04:31.440> full-on

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800

proper animations and stuff like that

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.510 
proper animations and stuff like that
these<00:04:34.770> are<00:04:34.919> just<00:04:34.949> things<00:04:35.190> for<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.490> future

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
these are just things for the future

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.250 
these are just things for the future
that<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:35.940> would<00:04:36.300> really<00:04:36.630> like<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.990> see<00:04:37.020> in<00:04:37.199> this

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
that I would really like to see in this

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.480 
that I would really like to see in this
application<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.889> does<00:04:38.070> have<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.280> lot<00:04:38.460> of

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
application it does have a lot of

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.260 
application it does have a lot of
potential<00:04:40.370> this<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.520> also<00:04:41.790> be<00:04:41.880> called<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.180> can

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
potential this it also be called you can

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.700 
potential this it also be called you can
see<00:04:42.419> like<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.660> cartridge<00:04:43.080> fall<00:04:43.320> are<00:04:43.500> just

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
see like the cartridge fall are just

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.840 
see like the cartridge fall are just
small<00:04:43.919> things<00:04:44.130> like<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.400> they<00:04:44.550> need<00:04:44.729> to

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
small things like that they need to

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.210 
small things like that they need to
update<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.450> don't<00:04:45.840> think<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.139> actual<00:04:46.950> sound

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
update I don't think this actual sound

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.740 
update I don't think this actual sound
of<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.610> guns<00:04:47.850> are<00:04:48.060> really<00:04:48.479> all<00:04:48.630> that

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
of the guns are really all that

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.080 
of the guns are really all that
realistic<00:04:49.380> like<00:04:50.220> I've<00:04:50.370> an<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.639> a<00:04:50.700> shotgun

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
realistic like I've an to a shotgun

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.860 
realistic like I've an to a shotgun
which<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.360> really<00:04:51.600> high<00:04:51.810> caliber<00:04:52.200> weapon

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
which is a really high caliber weapon

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.890 
which is a really high caliber weapon
and<00:04:54.870> it's<00:04:55.229> a<00:04:55.320> kind<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.770> weird<00:04:56.220> sounding<00:04:56.900> echo

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
and it's a kind of a weird sounding echo

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.200 
and it's a kind of a weird sounding echo
to<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:58.200> I<00:05:01.070> would<00:05:02.070> honestly<00:05:02.280> like<00:05:02.639> to<00:05:02.790> see<00:05:02.940> just

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
to it I would honestly like to see just

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.690 
to it I would honestly like to see just
a<00:05:03.300> lot<00:05:03.479> more<00:05:03.660> with<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:03.900> application<00:05:04.490> it<00:05:05.490> does

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
a lot more with this application it does

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.040 
a lot more with this application it does
have<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.910> lot<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.150> potential<00:05:06.479> they<00:05:06.690> could<00:05:06.870> add

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
have a lot of potential they could add

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.300 
have a lot of potential they could add
all<00:05:07.200> these<00:05:07.380> different<00:05:07.620> features<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.100> it

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
all these different features and it

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.570 
all these different features and it
could<00:05:08.460> be<00:05:08.610> really<00:05:08.850> great<00:05:09.240> but<00:05:10.050> on<00:05:10.260> for<00:05:11.190> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
could be really great but on for the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.939 
could be really great but on for the
moment<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:12.030> way<00:05:12.120> it's<00:05:12.270> standing<00:05:12.780> there<00:05:13.770> are<00:05:13.889> a

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
moment the way it's standing there are a

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.040 
moment the way it's standing there are a
lot<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.160> issues<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.729> I<00:05:14.760> can<00:05:14.940> see<00:05:15.120> with<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.419> so

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
lot of issues that I can see with it so

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.210 
lot of issues that I can see with it so

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
I'm going to give this application for

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.000 
I'm going to give this application for
five<00:05:17.370> out<00:05:17.580> of<00:05:17.610> ten<00:05:17.850> guys<00:05:18.440> maybe<00:05:19.440> check<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.860> out
