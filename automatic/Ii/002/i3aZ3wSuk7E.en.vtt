however<00:01:41.030> mathematically<00:01:42.030> were<00:01:42.150> still<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.420> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
however mathematically were still in it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.310 
however mathematically were still in it
with<00:01:43.259> two<00:01:43.439> games<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:45.270> we've<00:01:46.079> reached

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
with two games to go and we've reached

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.810 
with two games to go and we've reached
the<00:01:46.470> semi<00:01:46.680> final<00:01:47.040> two<00:01:47.130> chambers<00:01:47.460> League<00:01:47.640> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the semi final two chambers League I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.569 
the semi final two chambers League I
think<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.329> we've<00:01:49.079> no<00:01:49.290> striker<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:50.040> think

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
think that's we've no striker I think

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.240 
think that's we've no striker I think
that's<00:01:50.700> pretty<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.649> especially

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that's pretty good you know especially

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.609 
that's pretty good you know especially
with<00:01:53.579> no<00:01:53.820> striker<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.720> had<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.140> clinical

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
with no striker if we had a clinical

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.410 
with no striker if we had a clinical
striker<00:01:56.869> then<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.170> would<00:01:58.439> maybe<00:01:58.710> maybe<00:01:59.490> have<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
striker then I would maybe maybe have a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.690 
striker then I would maybe maybe have a
few<00:02:00.719> issues<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.189> we<00:02:02.369> should<00:02:02.430> be

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
few issues and I think we should be

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.289 
few issues and I think we should be
doing<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.149> bit<00:02:03.329> better<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.729> we've<00:02:05.729> had<00:02:05.880> no<00:02:05.939> one

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
doing a bit better but we've had no one

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.219 
doing a bit better but we've had no one
to<00:02:06.450> rely<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:07.049> front<00:02:07.320> we've<00:02:08.220> had<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:09.450> few

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
to rely on up front we've had a few

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.830 
to rely on up front we've had a few
injuries<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:11.250> few<00:02:11.610> suspensions

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
injuries a few suspensions

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.320 
injuries a few suspensions
key<00:02:12.989> moments<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.680> yesterday<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:17.330> we've

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
key moments like yesterday and we've

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.270 
key moments like yesterday and we've
come<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:18.599> far<00:02:18.780> for<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.319> first<00:02:19.500> season<00:02:20.099> I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
come this far for the first season I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.869 
come this far for the first season I
think<00:02:20.610> that's<00:02:20.730> pretty<00:02:20.879> good<00:02:21.000> next<00:02:21.599> year<00:02:22.879> it's

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
think that's pretty good next year it's

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.070

accomplished<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.980> on<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.250> next<00:04:37.490> season<00:04:37.820> on<00:04:37.940> to

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
accomplished and on to next season on to

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.600 
accomplished and on to next season on to
next<00:04:38.480> season<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:38.840> where<00:04:39.170> I<00:04:39.200> think<00:04:39.770> we<00:04:40.430> will

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
next season it is where I think we will

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.960 
next season it is where I think we will
do<00:04:41.050> exceptionally<00:04:42.050> well<00:04:42.290> with<00:04:42.980> those<00:04:43.670> players

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
do exceptionally well with those players

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.230 
do exceptionally well with those players
coming<00:04:44.300> back<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.840> a<00:04:44.960> good<00:04:45.200> Strikeforce<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:46.240> can

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
coming back and a good Strikeforce I can

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.730 
coming back and a good Strikeforce I can
see<00:04:47.420> good<00:04:47.600> things<00:04:47.900> I<00:04:48.110> can<00:04:48.440> see<00:04:48.560> good<00:04:48.770> things

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
see good things I can see good things

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.200 
see good things I can see good things
obviously<00:04:51.740> it's<00:04:52.190> disappointing<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:53.060> that's

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
obviously it's disappointing and that's

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.240 
obviously it's disappointing and that's
the<00:04:53.330> reason<00:04:53.600> why<00:04:53.780> I<00:04:53.810> was<00:04:54.230> upset<00:04:54.470> yesterday<00:04:54.830> and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
the reason why I was upset yesterday and

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.300 
the reason why I was upset yesterday and
my<00:04:55.400> review<00:04:55.580> was<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.270> way<00:04:56.390> it<00:04:56.540> was<00:04:56.600> because<00:04:57.310> you

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
my review was the way it was because you

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.230 
my review was the way it was because you
get<00:04:58.580> so<00:04:58.820> close<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.980> you<00:05:00.980> go<00:05:01.190> one<00:05:01.460> Hill<00:05:01.640> up<00:05:01.820> and

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
get so close and you go one Hill up and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.380 
get so close and you go one Hill up and
you<00:05:02.450> have<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.810> advantage<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:03.680> then<00:05:03.980> with<00:05:04.070> one

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
you have the advantage and then with one

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.880 
you have the advantage and then with one
45-minute<00:05:05.390> second<00:05:05.690> half<00:05:05.900> just<00:05:06.260> blows<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.590> you

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
45-minute second half just blows it you

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.640 
45-minute second half just blows it you
know<00:05:07.010> it<00:05:07.730> blows<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:08.510> whole<00:05:08.810> season's<00:05:09.260> worth<00:05:09.410> of

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
know it blows a whole season's worth of

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.440 
know it blows a whole season's worth of
work<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.930> when<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:11.960> come<00:05:12.290> so<00:05:12.530> close<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:13.100> hurts

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
work and when you come so close it hurts

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.880 
work and when you come so close it hurts
yesterday<00:05:14.450> obviously<00:05:15.350> I<00:05:16.040> showed<00:05:16.760> that<00:05:17.890> but

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
yesterday obviously I showed that but

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.800 
yesterday obviously I showed that but
it's<00:05:19.550> said<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:19.970> done<00:05:20.030> now<00:05:20.330> we<00:05:20.390> can't<00:05:20.720> do

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
it's said and done now we can't do

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.330 
it's said and done now we can't do
anything<00:05:20.930> about<00:05:21.170> it<00:05:21.320> so<00:05:21.470> on<00:05:21.860> to<00:05:22.010> next<00:05:22.250> season

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
anything about it so on to next season

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.560 
anything about it so on to next season
and<00:05:23.350> hopefully<00:05:24.350> fingers<00:05:24.770> crossed<00:05:25.120> things<00:05:26.120> get

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
and hopefully fingers crossed things get

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.360 
and hopefully fingers crossed things get
much<00:05:26.780> better<00:05:27.110> which<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.590> think<00:05:27.830> they<00:05:27.980> will<00:05:28.160> I

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
much better which I think they will I

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.640 
much better which I think they will I
think<00:05:28.700> they<00:05:28.850> will<00:05:29.000> probably<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:30.350> few<00:05:30.500> more

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
think they will probably a few more

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.500 
think they will probably a few more
