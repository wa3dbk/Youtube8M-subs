00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.140
 or the same in kraft in this video we're going 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.770
 to see how to go back to 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.390
 version 1 point 3.2 of minecraft for 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.820
 what is good is that jealousy 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.110
 they always take a while to update the plugins 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.260
 to work with the version 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.100
 we had some installed and we still 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.890
 leaves for 1.42 or maybe we gave him 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.590
 click to update without wanting and now not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.650
 we can play in our preferred being 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 What we have to do is say 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.130
 to the link that left them in the description 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.559
 in the link they copy it in a browser in 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.220
 any browser mozilla chrome the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.220
 that you want 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.030
 we have to wait 5 seconds 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.640
 once we wait five seconds 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.570
 this appears that says jump advertising 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.790
 we click here 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.790
 and a file will start downloading 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.310
 which is called minecraft zip 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.070
 I already downloaded it twice because of that 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.200
 I see a 2 there 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.240
 once we download it we can 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.229
 bring to the desk to work better 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.580
 and we're going to go execute and write 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:32.740
 start key plus the r key and there if 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.680
 we wrote % app data percent and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.630
 we accept 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.390
 once we accept here is in the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.010
 minecraft folder this folder contains 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.070
 the version 1.4 points what we have to 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.830
 to do is eliminate it or if we have something 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.780
 maps something we've done we can 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.990
 save elsewhere in any other 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.290
 place we keep it and now if we open 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.010
 this file winrar this file point 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.050
 yes or very rare we open it or any 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.540
 another 7 yes but this one more like it and 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.970
 we select it and we pass it to this 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.920
 binder 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.420
 once we pass it to this folder 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.450
 What's going on 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 well let's start our minecraft 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.390
 and we will have version 1.3 points 2 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.620
 how to put here we have version 1.3 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.330
 minecraft points and well that was it 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.690
