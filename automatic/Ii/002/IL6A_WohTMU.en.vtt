00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.230 
however even now a little tough for them
they're<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> spring<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.829> summer<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:57.119> can

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
they're on the spring and summer you can

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.760 
they're on the spring and summer you can
still<00:01:57.540> eat<00:01:57.570> them

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
still eat them

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.789 
still eat them
of<00:02:00.430> course<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.720> large<00:02:02.049> collection<00:02:02.500> like<00:02:02.619> this

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
of course the large collection like this

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.289 
of course the large collection like this
you<00:02:03.009> could<00:02:03.130> actually<00:02:03.220> feed<00:02:03.579> several<00:02:03.850> people

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
you could actually feed several people

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.840 
you could actually feed several people
and<00:02:04.869> again<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:06.009> case<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.369> very<00:02:06.460> similar<00:02:06.729> to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
and again the case is very similar to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.120 
and again the case is very similar to
let<00:02:07.060> us<00:02:07.180> so<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.570> fact<00:02:07.810> there<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:08.830> go

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
let us so in fact there you go

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:18.360 
let us so in fact there you go
salad<00:02:09.520> out<00:02:09.640> in<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.789> woods<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.950> cook<00:02:18.220> them

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
salad out in the woods you can cook them

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.949 
salad out in the woods you can cook them
where<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.730> need<00:02:18.849> them<00:02:18.940> raw<00:02:19.150> either<00:02:19.780> way<00:02:19.900> it

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
where you need them raw either way it

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.690 
where you need them raw either way it
works<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.440> third<00:02:23.709> piece<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> bass

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
works this is a third piece of the bass

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.520 
works this is a third piece of the bass
work<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.269> in<00:02:25.989> that<00:02:26.140> sense<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.420> wood<00:02:29.349> for

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
work so in that sense we have wood for

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.490 
work so in that sense we have wood for
fire<00:02:29.819> wood<00:02:30.819> for<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.090> bow-drill<00:02:31.300> string<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.380> make

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
fire wood for a bow-drill string to make

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.590 
fire wood for a bow-drill string to make
the<00:02:32.650> bow<00:02:32.799> string<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.489> string<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.330> actually

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
the bow string and string to actually

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.390 
the bow string and string to actually
bind<00:02:34.870> our<00:02:35.080> bundles<00:02:35.440> together<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.040> fact<00:02:36.250> if

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
bind our bundles together so in fact if

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.309 
bind our bundles together so in fact if
we<00:02:36.489> have<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.670> make<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.850> meal<00:02:37.150> one<00:02:37.750> tree<00:02:38.019> can<00:02:38.200> get

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
we have to make a meal one tree can get

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.460 
we have to make a meal one tree can get
everything<00:02:38.500> we<00:02:38.709> need<00:02:38.739> we<00:02:39.549> can<00:02:39.670> start<00:02:39.940> our<00:02:40.060> fire

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
everything we need we can start our fire

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.320 
everything we need we can start our fire
lash<00:02:41.470> our<00:02:41.709> bundles<00:02:42.040> steam<00:02:42.730> cook<00:02:42.940> our<00:02:43.090> food

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
lash our bundles steam cook our food

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.870 
lash our bundles steam cook our food
inside<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.380> coals<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.010> fire<00:02:45.250> that's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
inside the coals of that fire that's

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.270 
inside the coals of that fire that's
been<00:02:46.090> made<00:02:46.239> from<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.450> very<00:02:46.660> same<00:02:46.840> tree<00:02:47.280> its

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
been made from that very same tree its

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.330 
been made from that very same tree its
own<00:02:48.430> sense<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.630> tree<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.080> tree<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.440> life<00:02:50.470> it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
own sense this tree is a tree of life it

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.250 
own sense this tree is a tree of life it
covers<00:02:51.730> almost<00:02:52.000> everything<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.660> need<00:02:52.870> just

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
covers almost everything you need just

look at these trees and say I wonder how

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.000 
look at these trees and say I wonder how
useful<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.910> are<00:03:01.260> that's<00:03:02.260> really<00:03:02.739> what<00:03:02.890> I'm

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
talking about in these video series very

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.870 
talking about in these video series very
few<00:03:05.440> people<00:03:05.620> look<00:03:06.010> at<00:03:06.130> these<00:03:06.250> trees<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.760> go

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
few people look at these trees and go

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.300 
few people look at these trees and go
wow<00:03:07.140> you're<00:03:08.140> really<00:03:08.290> useful<00:03:08.799> they<00:03:09.040> kind<00:03:09.280> of

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
ignored a lot of the small uses and the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.360 
ignored a lot of the small uses and the
reason<00:03:13.269> for<00:03:13.299> these<00:03:13.540> videos<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.950> for<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.280> to
