00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.040
 Y 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.040
 Y 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello to all that such a welcome one day 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 more to the channel today I bring you the first 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.669
 volume of this video is a video on the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.869
 I want to teach things that I have 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.039
 found that they look pretty 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.039
 although I think they are 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.189
 no clones because one color is difficult 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.430
 find for me a color are not the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.660
 products are totally the same and not 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.210
 I want to call it clones for that reason 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.649
 I still do not know what name I will give him but 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.750
 well you 'll see it up here 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.860
 when I decide but good is what 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.300
 I wanted to show the products that I have 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.160
 found that I think they have a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.120
 very similar finish 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.130
 this time I bring you the clone of 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.050
 copacabana of the I have it the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:55.410
 original of a sample 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.410
 he gave me a cardigan and he has this 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.790
 this aspect 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.710
 It is a very very beautiful illuminator but 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.000
 It is very expensive then I have found a 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.010
 illuminator that I think the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.380
 same cloth that can have a more effect 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.970
 or less similar and that is a brand 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.660
 much more economical is specifically 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.979
 of essence is this illuminator here from 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.240
 the collection or good collections of 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.610
 line the fixed but of those in the range 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.409
 ilove and this is concretely called my 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.329
 love the way you later 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.859
 the format is not the same because it is in 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.770
 would assure that it is the little boat 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.319
 crush and this is the format of those of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.600
 turn then the cellulose of each one 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.829
 so you can see a little how they are and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.380
 so that your hands can give your opinion 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.939
 some will think you think they are 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.119
 quite similar that look like what 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.890
 can give the hit and others consider 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.560
 that they do not look like anything and what 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.550
 Small shit video then good if 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.140
 you like our type of videos 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.479
 I would appreciate it if you told me jce down 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.540
 to keep looking for more clones or more 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.070
 similar things flowers in quotes and 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.110
 If you do not like it, you tell me 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.450
 Y 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.880
 and I do not do more because I'm going to teach the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.380
 guanches to see if you think 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.060
 the same as me I say they are not 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.450
 exactly the same but when to me 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.450
 It seems 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.160
 that have a fairly high likeness 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.569
 I'm not going to apply them either for 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.849
 that good deal means that 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.849
 you see it well are not these two 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.010
 this may be a tad more pink and be 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.010
 a tad whiter 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.970
 but I think they look a lot like 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.390
 above all, the two are illuminating 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.000
 depend how the light gives them they take like 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.290
 one tone or another like that seems more rosy there 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.960
 it seems like more of a handle then 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.980
 it seems more grade there is seems more pink 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.680
 then it depends how the light gives them 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.560
 first that they look pretty this 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.130
 here is the copacabana fill and this is 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.130
 the sets 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.200
 then good this is what I will 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.840
 I wanted to address eye, I do not say they're 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.410
 clones nor do I say they are the same because 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.230
 they are not the same 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.870
 I consider that the one who has them as 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.510
 some district more in silver than the other 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.240
 the other one has the little cocks a little 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.030
 more pulling to gold but I think it 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.890
 they seem pretty that then applied 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.890
 let's do a little test 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.069
 this is the copacabana of large and in this 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.530
 another side we're going to put the descent 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.719
 elegans it works easier than a 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.170
 more pleasant texture and the essence has 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:55.890
 like a little more glitter 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.890
 but if you look 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.319
 then you can appreciate the finish 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.319
 that they leave is quite similar 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.480
 today you see us 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.660
 and well this is all I wanted to do 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.090
 video so it was not very long I hope 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.470
