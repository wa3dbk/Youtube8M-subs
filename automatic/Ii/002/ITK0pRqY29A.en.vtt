00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.759
 I will teach to play the song words 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.170
 with the last night of nirvana mi 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.480
 sister they were asking me a lot in 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.940
 my facebook page and watching appear 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.670
 excellent songs since they are easy 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.160
 of playing are very good songs well 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.750
 let's start well let's start 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.880
 as a start we should know that the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.870
 guitar we're going to tune it half tone 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 down 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.290
 we must stay in this tone of all 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.770
 forms here I have a tuner in my 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.020
 channel so that the fine in totally the 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.870
 chords that we're going to use are going to be 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.370
 my minor 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.030
 the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.030
 Sun 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.010
 if seventh we're going to start with the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.629
 strum this we must dominate 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.109
 completely since it is the one that will lead 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.109
 the whole song 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.040
 that will be slower 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.070
 At the beginning we are going to make a small 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.070
 arrangement as they do 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.470
 ok if I 'm going to teach them little by little 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.110
 we come back in this strum we are going to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.280
 use in what would be the sixth string 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.280
 a hammer 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.530
 and then we pass it to the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.200
 ok it will not be again 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.460
 in part 17 the rational we do 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.060
 two kilos more down 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.060
 A) Yes 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.680
 i 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.780
 practically all the songs the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.860
 same circle I will do it once it 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.860
 repeat the whole song like this 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.860
 i 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.860
 such 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.790
 and well that 's the whole song really 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.849
 it's a very simple song but it's a 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.409
 classic and this song is great 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.810
 be that if they have doubts comment 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.939
