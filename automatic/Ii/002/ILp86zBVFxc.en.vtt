I think he's supposed to have a fist

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.190 
I think he's supposed to have a fist
hand<00:01:57.940> for<00:01:58.120> both<00:01:58.270> sides<00:01:58.540> but<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.900> person<00:01:59.170> that

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.340 
include it or he's not supposed to I I
don't<00:02:04.240> really<00:02:04.360> remember<00:02:04.480> I<00:02:04.720> checked<00:02:05.080> but<00:02:05.230> then

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
don't really remember I checked but then

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.050 
don't really remember I checked but then
I<00:02:05.410> forgot<00:02:05.800> so<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.130> think<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:06.550> supposed<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:06.910> be

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
I forgot so I think it's supposed to be

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.240 
I forgot so I think it's supposed to be
there<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.390> I'm<00:02:07.510> not<00:02:07.540> sure<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.019> then<00:02:08.830> we<00:02:09.069> have

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
there but I'm not sure and then we have

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.830 
there but I'm not sure and then we have
this<00:02:09.550> thing<00:02:09.849> which<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.239> some<00:02:10.360> kind<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.599> little

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
this thing which is some kind of little

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.869 
this thing which is some kind of little
amulet<00:02:11.379> medallion<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.400> don't<00:02:12.610> think<00:02:12.760> it's

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
amulet medallion I don't think it's

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.790 
amulet medallion I don't think it's
really<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> necklace<00:02:13.599> but<00:02:13.810> maybe<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.260> either

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
really a necklace but maybe it is either

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800 
really a necklace but maybe it is either
way<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.099> looks<00:02:15.280> really<00:02:15.610> cool<00:02:15.850> too<00:02:16.060> translucent

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
way it looks really cool too translucent

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.230 
way it looks really cool too translucent
plastic<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.710> that's<00:02:17.920> nice<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.820> reason<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.120> say

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
plastic so that's nice the reason I say

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.370 
plastic so that's nice the reason I say
I<00:02:19.270> don't<00:02:19.360> think<00:02:19.570> it's<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.750> necklace<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.260> just

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
I don't think it's a necklace is just

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.070 
I don't think it's a necklace is just
because<00:02:20.710> his

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
because his

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.080 
because his
Garf<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.500> fixed<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:22.580> can't<00:02:22.760> really<00:02:22.940> put

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
Garf is fixed and you can't really put

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.670 
Garf is fixed and you can't really put
it<00:02:23.120> under<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> scarf<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.410> don't<00:02:24.620> know

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
it under the scarf but I don't know

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.230 
it under the scarf but I don't know
maybe<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.130> then<00:02:25.820> we<00:02:25.910> have<00:02:25.940> my<00:02:26.210> favorite

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
maybe it is then we have my favorite

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.910 
maybe it is then we have my favorite
accessory<00:02:26.990> that<00:02:27.140> I've<00:02:27.230> seen<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.620> long<00:02:27.860> time

cool<00:03:18.860> little<00:03:19.490> piece<00:03:19.790> all<00:03:20.510> right<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:20.780> let's

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
cool little piece all right so let's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.390 
cool little piece all right so let's
look<00:03:21.020> at<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.410> figure<00:03:21.680> himself<00:03:21.830> let's<00:03:22.190> look<00:03:22.310> at

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
look at the figure himself let's look at

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.210 
look at the figure himself let's look at
the<00:03:22.990> articulation<00:03:23.990> the<00:03:24.200> neck<00:03:24.890> which<00:03:25.190> is

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
the articulation the neck which is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.160 
the articulation the neck which is
pretty<00:03:25.580> much<00:03:25.700> standard<00:03:25.970> for<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.570> Joe<00:03:26.959> Joe's

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
pretty much standard for the Joe Joe's

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.840 
pretty much standard for the Joe Joe's
figures<00:03:27.500> there's<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.769> hinged<00:03:28.100> ball<00:03:28.370> peg<00:03:28.640> so

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
figures there's a hinged ball peg so

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.070 
figures there's a hinged ball peg so
there's<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.030> ball<00:03:29.180> peg<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.540> goes<00:03:29.630> into<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
there's a ball peg that goes into the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.810 
there's a ball peg that goes into the
head<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.350> then<00:03:30.440> we<00:03:30.560> have<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.830> hinge<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.640> neck

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
head and then we have the hinge the neck

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.699 
head and then we have the hinge the neck
is<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.060> a<00:03:32.120> single<00:03:32.570> ball<00:03:32.690> peg<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.170> one's<00:03:33.380> stuck

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
is on a single ball peg this one's stuck

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.170 
is on a single ball peg this one's stuck
and<00:03:33.920> since<00:03:34.100> it's<00:03:34.220> not<00:03:34.280> my<00:03:34.519> figure<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.880> can't

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
and since it's not my figure I can't

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.150 
and since it's not my figure I can't
really<00:03:35.420> force<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:35.870> but<00:03:36.320> this<00:03:36.500> neck<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.950> on<00:03:37.100> a

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
really force it but this neck is on a

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.729 
really force it but this neck is on a
ball<00:03:37.400> peg<00:03:37.640> for<00:03:37.850> sure<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:39.170> shoulders<00:03:39.560> on<00:03:39.709> a

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
ball peg for sure the shoulders on a

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.729 
ball peg for sure the shoulders on a
butterfly<00:03:40.400> hinge<00:03:41.080> which<00:03:42.080> I<00:03:42.260> believe<00:03:42.530> that's

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
butterfly hinge which I believe that's

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.280 
butterfly hinge which I believe that's
the<00:03:42.860> same<00:03:43.100> one<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.519> same<00:03:44.290> sculpted

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
the same one that the same sculpted

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.199 
the same one that the same sculpted
butterfly<00:03:45.800> hinges<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:46.310> was<00:03:46.519> on<00:03:46.640> Jojo<00:03:47.030> but

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
butterfly hinges that was on Jojo but

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.270 
butterfly hinges that was on Jojo but
maybe<00:03:47.510> not<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:48.080> could<00:03:48.260> be<00:03:48.350> wrong<00:03:48.500> then<00:03:49.040> we<00:03:49.130> have

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
maybe not I could be wrong then we have

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.009 
maybe not I could be wrong then we have
the<00:03:49.430> standard<00:03:49.760> ball<00:03:49.970> hinge<00:03:50.269> for<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.570> shoulder

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
the standard ball hinge for the shoulder

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.890 
the standard ball hinge for the shoulder
built<00:03:51.739> into<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.340> bicep<00:03:52.730> swivel<00:03:53.300> right<00:03:53.510> here

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
built into a bicep swivel right here

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.960 
built into a bicep swivel right here
it's<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.830> little<00:03:54.950> bit<00:03:55.160> stuck<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:55.580> we<00:03:55.670> do<00:03:55.790> get<00:03:55.910> a

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
it's a little bit stuck but we do get a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.420 
it's a little bit stuck but we do get a
bicep<00:03:56.180> swivel<00:03:56.780> then<00:03:57.440> we<00:03:57.620> have<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.040> double

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
bicep swivel then we have the double

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.060 
bicep swivel then we have the double
ball<00:03:58.700> hinge<00:03:59.030> for<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.420> elbow<00:03:59.840> which<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.830> this

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
ball hinge for the elbow which on this

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.620 
ball hinge for the elbow which on this
guy<00:04:01.250> doesn't<00:04:01.610> have<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.880> best<00:04:02.209> range<00:04:02.510> of

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
guy doesn't have the best range of

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.880 
guy doesn't have the best range of
motion<00:04:02.900> but<00:04:02.989> as<00:04:03.140> you<00:04:03.230> can<00:04:03.350> see<00:04:03.410> it's<00:04:03.680> still

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
motion but as you can see it's still

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.650 
motion but as you can see it's still
really<00:04:04.220> good<00:04:04.340> we<00:04:04.670> have<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.880> elbow<00:04:05.030> cap<00:04:05.420> on

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
really good we have the elbow cap on

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.630 
really good we have the elbow cap on
there<00:04:05.989> technically<00:04:06.800> you<00:04:06.950> can<00:04:07.100> rotate<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
there technically you can rotate the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.430 
there technically you can rotate the
arms<00:04:07.910> at<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.120> top<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.570> bottom<00:04:08.959> ball<00:04:09.140> hinge

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
arms at the top and bottom ball hinge

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.949 
arms at the top and bottom ball hinge
the<00:04:10.070> wrists<00:04:10.430> are<00:04:10.550> on<00:04:10.700> ball<00:04:10.910> hinges<00:04:11.390> the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
the wrists are on ball hinges the

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.170 
the wrists are on ball hinges the
bracelet<00:04:12.800> here<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.220> separate<00:04:13.640> piece<00:04:13.820> so

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
bracelet here is a separate piece so

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.550 
bracelet here is a separate piece so
when<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.330> swap<00:04:14.540> out<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.780> hand<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.080> be<00:04:15.200> careful

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
when you swap out the hand to be careful

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.180 
when you swap out the hand to be careful
you<00:04:15.650> don't<00:04:15.709> lose<00:04:16.070> these<00:04:16.280> they<00:04:16.549> will<00:04:16.729> pop<00:04:17.030> off<00:04:17.239> a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
you don't lose these they will pop off a

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.289 
you don't lose these they will pop off a
single<00:04:19.190> ball<00:04:19.370> hinge<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:19.729> believe<00:04:20.030> for<00:04:20.209> the

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
single ball hinge I believe for the

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.300 
single ball hinge I believe for the
upper<00:04:20.570> torso<00:04:20.780> but<00:04:21.080> you<00:04:21.169> still<00:04:21.380> get<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.709> really

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
upper torso but you still get a really

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.159 
upper torso but you still get a really
good<00:04:22.460> range<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.760> motion<00:04:22.940> forward<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.840> back

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
good range of motion forward and back

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.770 
good range of motion forward and back
it's<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.710> little<00:04:24.919> stiff<00:04:25.190> but<00:04:25.220> that's<00:04:25.550> okay<00:04:25.910> the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
it's a little stiff but that's okay the

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.630 
it's a little stiff but that's okay the
jacket<00:04:26.930> is<00:04:27.169> not<00:04:27.320> soft<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.010> be<00:04:28.160> careful<00:04:28.550> when

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
jacket is not soft so be careful when

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.029 
jacket is not soft so be careful when
you're<00:04:28.760> posing<00:04:29.150> him<00:04:29.270> about<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:30.080> single<00:04:30.890> ball

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
you're posing him about that single ball

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.740 
you're posing him about that single ball
hinge<00:04:31.280> for<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.550> lower<00:04:31.700> torso<00:04:31.970> also<00:04:32.539> but

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
hinge for the lower torso also but

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.629 
hinge for the lower torso also but
really<00:04:33.050> good<00:04:33.229> range<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.590> motion

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
really good range of motion

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.920 
really good range of motion
for<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:34.819> hips<00:04:35.030> now<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.449> is<00:04:35.569> kind<00:04:35.840> of

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
for the hips now this is kind of

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.100 
for the hips now this is kind of
problematic<00:04:36.080> we<00:04:36.650> have<00:04:36.860> a<00:04:37.400> ball<00:04:37.849> peg<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.719> it's

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
problematic we have a ball peg and it's

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.719 
problematic we have a ball peg and it's
kind<00:04:39.289> of<00:04:39.349> thick<00:04:39.590> which<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:40.009> okay<00:04:40.340> but<00:04:40.580> then

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
kind of thick which is okay but then

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.309 
kind of thick which is okay but then
this<00:04:40.909> part<00:04:41.210> doesn't<00:04:41.449> have<00:04:41.689> that<00:04:41.810> much<00:04:42.080> range

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
this part doesn't have that much range

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.260 
this part doesn't have that much range
of<00:04:42.469> motion<00:04:42.530> so<00:04:43.009> this<00:04:43.189> is<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.460> socket<00:04:43.699> up<00:04:44.029> here

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
of motion so this is the socket up here

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.420 
of motion so this is the socket up here
that<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:44.990> move<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.289> leg<00:04:45.439> around<00:04:45.560> on<00:04:45.889> it's<00:04:46.159> ok

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
that you move the leg around on it's ok

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.330 
that you move the leg around on it's ok
forward<00:04:46.879> and<00:04:46.999> back<00:04:47.210> kind<00:04:47.900> of<00:04:48.139> that's<00:04:49.129> not

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
forward and back kind of that's not

that you can rotate it around for the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.149 
that you can rotate it around for the
ankle<00:05:13.849> rocker<00:05:14.090> or<00:05:14.509> basically<00:05:15.379> just<00:05:15.680> use<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:16.009> as

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
ankle rocker or basically just use it as
