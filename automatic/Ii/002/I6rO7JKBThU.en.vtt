00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
because on this river get high they all

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.950 
because on this river get high they all
floods<00:01:49.710> over<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.100> brings<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> debris<00:01:50.729> up

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.649 
and then it settles on this field but
there's<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:55.860> useful<00:01:56.130> find<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.509> great

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
