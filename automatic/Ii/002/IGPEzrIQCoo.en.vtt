stuffy in my opinion on the left back we
do<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> Maxwell<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> he<00:01:17.790> got<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.240> good

do have a Maxwell and he got some good

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
do have a Maxwell and he got some good
stats<00:01:18.689> maybe<00:01:19.140> his<00:01:19.470> pace<00:01:19.799> could<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> letdown

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
stats maybe his pace could be a letdown

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.980 
stats maybe his pace could be a letdown
at<00:01:20.759> times<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> come<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.630> against<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and it worked out quite alright

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.140 
and it worked out quite alright

but on the right side I did struggle a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.730 
but on the right side I did struggle a
bit<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.939> did<00:01:33.240> play<00:01:33.479> Danny<00:01:33.869> Alvis<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
bit because I did play Danny Alvis and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.770 
bit because I did play Danny Alvis and
with<00:01:35.130> his<00:01:35.460> high<00:01:35.640> low<00:01:35.850> work<00:01:36.060> weight<00:01:36.329> she's<00:01:36.630> an

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
with his high low work weight she's an

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.480 
with his high low work weight she's an
attacking<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.500> back<00:01:37.710> he<00:01:37.860> doesn't<00:01:38.130> track

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
attacking right back he doesn't track

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.990 
attacking right back he doesn't track
back<00:01:38.759> much<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.710> with<00:01:40.710> mustafi<00:01:41.250> having<00:01:41.520> 69

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
back much and with mustafi having 69

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.550 
back much and with mustafi having 69
pace<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.570> generally<00:01:43.020> ok<00:01:43.380> for

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
pace that is generally ok for

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
pace that is generally ok for
centre-back<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.310> when<00:01:44.460> he<00:01:44.579> got<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.210> come<00:01:45.420> up

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
centre-back but when he got to come up

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.050 
centre-back but when he got to come up
two<00:01:45.810> players<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.560> side<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:47.549> struggled

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
two players on that side he struggled

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.670 
two players on that side he struggled
quite<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.270> bit<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.750> opinion<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> think<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
quite a bit in my opinion and I think a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.469 
quite a bit in my opinion and I think a
different<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.460> back<00:01:50.670> maybe<00:01:50.850> color<00:01:51.180> yellow

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
different right back maybe color yellow

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.850 
different right back maybe color yellow
or<00:01:51.659> something<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.409> probably

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
or something like that would probably

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
or something like that would probably
been<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.430> bit<00:01:53.729> better<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.090> my<00:01:54.299> opinion

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
been a little bit better on my opinion

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.160 
been a little bit better on my opinion
but<00:01:55.500> moving<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.070> midfield<00:01:56.960> we<00:01:57.960> did

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
but moving on to the midfield we did

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.609 
but moving on to the midfield we did
play<00:01:58.700> first<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.060> played<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.259> know<00:02:01.320> I'm

the<00:03:30.690> fastest<00:03:31.170> player<00:03:31.410> out<00:03:31.710> on<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.190> wing<00:03:32.400> and

the fastest player out on the wing and

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.670 
the fastest player out on the wing and

a<00:04:57.290> set<00:04:57.650> he<00:04:58.040> is<00:04:58.160> kind<00:04:58.550> of<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.700> big<00:04:58.940> player<00:04:59.240> he's

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
a set he is kind of a big player he's

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.320 
a set he is kind of a big player he's
quite<00:05:00.290> tall<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.950> he's<00:05:01.310> tough<00:05:01.640> to<00:05:01.670> push<00:05:02.060> off

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
quite tall and he's tough to push off

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.030 
quite tall and he's tough to push off
the<00:05:02.360> ball<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.110> is<00:05:03.260> what<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.440> like<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.890> run

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
the ball and that is what I like to run

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.160 
the ball and that is what I like to run
him<00:05:04.220> because<00:05:04.880> he's<00:05:05.210> not<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.570> fastest<00:05:05.960> player

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
him because he's not the fastest player

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.300 
him because he's not the fastest player
you're<00:05:06.290> not<00:05:06.530> gonna<00:05:06.710> I'll<00:05:06.890> be<00:05:07.040> on<00:05:07.130> your

opponent's<00:05:07.760> fullbacks<00:05:08.150> with<00:05:08.420> him<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:08.690> I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
opponent's fullbacks with him and I

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.720 
opponent's fullbacks with him and I
think<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.230> sent<00:05:09.770> attacking<00:05:10.280> mid<00:05:10.400> center

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
think I sent attacking mid center

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.310 
think I sent attacking mid center
forward<00:05:11.030> spot<00:05:11.210> is<00:05:11.330> probably<00:05:11.720> better<00:05:11.930> for<00:05:12.050> him

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
forward spot is probably better for him

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.440 
forward spot is probably better for him
but<00:05:12.860> still<00:05:13.070> he<00:05:13.280> did<00:05:13.430> play<00:05:13.580> quite<00:05:13.910> well<00:05:14.120> out<00:05:14.300> on

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
but still he did play quite well out on

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.850 
but still he did play quite well out on
the<00:05:14.540> wing<00:05:14.660> and<00:05:14.810> look<00:05:15.110> at<00:05:15.290> that<00:05:15.320> finesse<00:05:15.830> shot

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
the wing and look at that finesse shot

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.250 
the wing and look at that finesse shot
he<00:05:16.220> schooled<00:05:16.520> there<00:05:16.760> like<00:05:17.000> he's<00:05:17.750> still<00:05:17.990> gotta

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
he schooled there like he's still gotta

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.680 
he schooled there like he's still gotta
finish<00:05:18.620> shot<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.610> still<00:05:19.820> pull<00:05:20.030> that<00:05:20.060> off<00:05:20.240> and

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
finish shot you still pull that off and

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
of curb on his food cakes and I thought

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.820 
of curb on his food cakes and I thought
of<00:05:43.940> shooting<00:05:44.330> but<00:05:44.510> my<00:05:45.110> opponent<00:05:45.440> just<00:05:45.560> moved

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
of shooting but my opponent just moved

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.740 
of shooting but my opponent just moved
the<00:05:46.010> wall<00:05:46.220> over<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.760> over<00:05:47.030> again<00:05:47.300> so<00:05:47.720> I

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
the wall over and over again so I

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.480 
the wall over and over again so I
decided<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.320> switch<00:05:48.740> it<00:05:48.890> up<00:05:48.950> a<00:05:49.100> little<00:05:49.250> bit

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
decided to switch it up a little bit

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.610 
decided to switch it up a little bit
pass<00:05:49.700> it<00:05:49.910> into<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.210> open<00:05:50.480> space<00:05:50.780> and<00:05:51.050> the

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
pass it into the open space and the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.170 
pass it into the open space and the
creaseman<00:05:52.010> would<00:05:52.160> have<00:05:52.250> flick<00:05:52.460> up<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:52.730> football

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
creaseman would have flick up a football

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.640 
creaseman would have flick up a football
and<00:05:53.210> a<00:05:53.420> first<00:05:53.660> time<00:05:53.900> volley<00:05:54.110> from<00:05:54.380> with
