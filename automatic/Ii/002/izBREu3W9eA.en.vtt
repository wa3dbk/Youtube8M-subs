00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.220
 it took almost seven years to do 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.319
 understand I would say to develop need for 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.090
 speed that attracts everyone especially 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.349
 old-time fans need brands 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.330
 invent it in the racing world 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.589
 clandestine is precisely here that yes 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.299
 will set the last need for speed 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.250
 because you will be with the last one 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.170
 asking why she has n't yet 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.490
 announced an official title and do 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.070
 they are already starting to call him 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.880
 underground 3 strategic move of the ea 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.870
 to increase live 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:36.640
 what can come out 10 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:38.500
 and he and haywood in spain during t7 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.350
 completely radiated with the engine 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.390
 of game or pre frostbite 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.550
 used by the same development team 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.770
 in the previous rivals released during 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.660
 the e3 conference immediately catches the eye 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.340
 how a graphic is defined and bun 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.280
 cured with particle effects 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.850
 very realistic and colors and shadows a lot 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.850
 marked 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.330
 after about five seconds it appears immediately 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.770
 the police hopefully this time 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.540
 we have more artificial intelligence 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:27.899
 evolved with respect to previous mismos 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:30.220
 children the gameplay released during 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.350
 begins by showing an envied box 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.119
 considered are highly good between 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.600
 this list is a mechanic with his 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.700
 colleague and introduce more or less to the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.800
 customization of a subaru brz di 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.550
 series presumably the first one will do so 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.770
 during the game 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.690
 the background trades accompany 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.399
 during this shy very similar to 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.710
 the one of the previous ones in spender cover is 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.179
 will go brown 10 but still it would seem 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.369
 be as vast and varied as it is 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.990
 never seen in almost impossible 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.490
 the selection of the changes takes place 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.259
 comfortably on the car that you can 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.450
 modify practically all the parts 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.189
 bodywork apart from some yes 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.290
 they will block with the progress of the game 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.390
 while for small details like ad 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.009
 example the color of the car now the glasses 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 or these change requests 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.090
 will be via a smartphone 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.490
 ended tuning unfortunately showing 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.020
 only to aesthetic changes it comes out 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.610
 in the street but what better files from 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.140
 offices is born and unites in the most 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.180
 I apply as possible give a race already in 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.010
 course this tool arises like the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.300
 claudia is purely identical colari 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.740
 other arranged feeds 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.110
 we must internet or recharge 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.180
 Automatically you can warm 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.190
 note the duration of the race type on 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.780
 earned money or the halo 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.460
 tadioli yielding 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.630
 moving on the map topic 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.430
 of environment games was 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.140
 affirmed plot passed twice as much 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.000
 that of rai bones roma settings 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.350
 You have been chosen california 2 bile 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.970
 evening to those few plaques and notables 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.530
 during the gameplay they bring 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.300
 written california resides during 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.280
 the beginning of the gameplay where it is written 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.040
 at the location of the bay ventura time 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.200
 lease from california hours to 130 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.730
 it would seem from the gameplay from the trailer that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.980
 all the game take place during the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.320
 night but it is not yet certain is that there is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.730
 the complete absence of the first-born are 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.040
 present some old mechanics of 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.540
 game as the facilitated drift ie 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.190
 just press the train during a curve 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.140
 and the author was by water automatically 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.090
 taken from previous need for speed 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.890
 while the only thing that was added 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.660
 this old system and dynamism e 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.430
 the camera that during the drift 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.350
 will go to the inside of the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.150
 curve moving from that side of the car 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.190
 but unfortunately lowering almost to the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.630
 level of mirrors thus preventing 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.030
 the vision of whatever it is 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.739
 outward of the curve is also 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.570
 present a system of levels similar to 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.410
 that of rivals can be increased through 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.480
 experience points 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.250
 this time changed to reputation 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.500
 which will serve to access more 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.970
 customizations and more cars the 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.070
 accumulable reputation following 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.780
 point-by-step skids and overtaking jump 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.220
 going in the wrong direction or at speed 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.380
 maximum making sure to be 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.880
 chased by the police and so on but 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.950
 if you will follow several of these 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.989
 actions consecutively you will get a 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.760
 reputation multiplier and will serve 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.500
 speed up the increase to this 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.239
 multiplier will gradually decrease e 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.069
 after passing a few seconds until 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.659
 return to 0 thus ending the combo 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.370
 a topic that links this 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.680
 speech that is not the reward at the end 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.150
 run in the gameplay shown as soon as it comes 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.579
 after the race, you are rewarded 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.229
 only with reputation coming 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.660
 obtained in different areas such as style 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.639
 bild crew outlawed and finally the 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.800
 amount of total reputation but not yes 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.360
 is at all rewarded in cash 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.550
 the only space where they come from 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.870
 shown quantity lines naro appears only 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.820
 when engaging in a pursuit with 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.650
 the police and increase as you go 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.199
 screw patrols today it moves away from 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.960
 you will see them at the end of this race 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.669
 also a user named 62 style 43 and yes 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.030
 congratulate you for winning on the social media 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.050
 network called nfs network 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.849
 originality is not lacking as it is worth 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.680
 most likely this social 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.660
 network will play a relatively small part 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.610
 certainly relevant in history 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.020
 his was a much more important part 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.229
 in the multiplayer sector 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.729
 hoping that bears develop it during 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.259
 the protagonist gameplay went to 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.910
 bang with you several friend and a handsome one 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.949
 Sometimes the car is not at all 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.349
 deformed or so it would seem 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.030
 it would be nice to have it implemented 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.770
 car damage system that 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.150
 it is not only aesthetic but also that you carry 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.800
 also a penalization of the 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.229
 vehicle performance a bit like 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.000
 it happened on the air some the game will be 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.070
 playable only with a conditionality 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.180
 unfortunately we know how to do multiple and even if 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.650
 the single trail 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.240
 this will allow all players to 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.159
 sometimes interacting during the 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.720
 campaign of the game this system will be 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.639
 supported by save on purpose 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.139
 dedicated will be present five different 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.599
 game modes confirmed so far 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.949
 speed, speed and connection 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.650
 that the driver exists among other things 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.180
 will be the detected speed it comes to 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.099
 keep your nerve and do not lift 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.870
 the gas is the adrenaline in the 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.550
 take a corner at high speed 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.070
 having faith that your car does not lose 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.849
 grip the fearless always pushed to the 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.740
 style limit the purely expressed style 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.180
 through the guide drive to yours 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.370
 car sideways in a corner with the 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.169
 maximum precision and the feeling of 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.000
 freedom for that fraction of a second 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.740
 just and the tires come off the ground 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.990
 when you are in a place where 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.560
 only you and your car exist for 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.509
 some style is all that with 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.280
 bild bild and where it brings its own 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.169
 cars to strangeness through modifications 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.039
 visual and is through modifications of the 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.659
 performance 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.310
 the constant need to improve e 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.689
 customize and shape by machine 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.580
 according to the forecast 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.610
 craftsmen built looking for the 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.319
 perfection crew drive with your 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.089
 more and do not take to the streets alone 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.219
 read your trust in others 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:31.589
 as bumpers one inch apart 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:34.009
 on the other this is the ability of a 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.419
 sect proximity to outlawed chaos 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.669
 becomes an outlaw making trouble with 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.809
 the police and running away from them look 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.729
 always raise the stakes 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:43.289
 through driving risk by overcoming i 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.569
 limits and looking over your shoulder 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.299
 live life to the limit as you crave the 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.009
 thrill of a failure was stopped 

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:51.689
 from the developers that this mini spot 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.589
 challenge will have an immersive plot e 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.119
 addictive 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.679
 I already have a deep one 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:57.899
 I will still note customization 

00:06:55.679 --> 00:07:00.509
 ancient automotive street culture 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:02.969
 one way a story is back open year 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:04.829
 engaging general attention is on 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:06.539
 more automotive culture levels 

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:09.509
 deeper than those without 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.459
 previous years staskin the appearance of the 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.739
 tone of the realistic world 

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:15.869
 game have been loved by the community 

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:18.389
 of the automotive culture behind the 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:20.099
 stockings fin hunters the collaboration 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.959
 regards the search for city and talent 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:23.639
 the development of the motorist culture 

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:26.899
 that blacklisted the title with the past 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.899
 present trend
