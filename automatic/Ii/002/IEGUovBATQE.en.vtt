00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.990
 well we started with the demonstration of 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:10.810
 because not only does it have danger 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.300
 buying some glasses online or a 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.460
 imitation because we really do not know what 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.140
 that we are buying this that I have 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.900
 here are some lenses 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.689
 photochromic that react to 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.730
 ultraviolet rays ie they are lenses 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.980
 that if I apply 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.390
 an ultraviolet radiation for example 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.390
 of this flashlight 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.309
 they will react and they will change 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:43.090
 color ok then yes I want 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.690
 warn of one thing and it is not by removing 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.210
 these radiations 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.520
 of this flashlight are reactions that 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.000
 impact directly on the area is 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.760
 to say is very difficult very difficult not to 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.129
 react as you would for example with the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.650
 but I want you to see what 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.020
 happens if I put this lens that is 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.010
 lens is the one that in principle from the 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.010
 imitation glasses 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:17.050
 and if I do an incidence of the lens 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.050
 directly through it 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.920
 you are going to give an account 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.530
 that the lens reacts and changes color 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.659
 that is, there is a step of radiation 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.920
 ultraviolet through the lens 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.920
 if we do this 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.950
 with an original lens 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.510
 and we do the same process 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.130
 the radiation that has happened in this case 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.469
 It's void 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.340
 and just in case you think that this lens does not 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.340
 it is chromatic photo 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.760
 yes it is photochromic ok with this I want 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.450
 explain to you that the imitations that 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.900
 they sell online not only 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.660
 they may look good on going out cheap but 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.520
 above all 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.230
 they do not absorb what they should solve 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.870
 ultraviolet 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.340
 Y 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.340
 the health of our eyes 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.950
 they may be in danger 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.950
 for saving money
