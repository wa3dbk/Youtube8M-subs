00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:08.840
 Yes Good evening Today I recommend it 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.600
 sdhc card ex area 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.320
 What did you say about this product name ? 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:22.619
 Withdrawal read out even a little bit the same 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.190
 If you bought a well-known maker of Kurden 's, it's a piped heart but it's 39 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.250
 major 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.720
 39 eyes read but 14 futures written 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.850
 Who's this guy 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.910
 As you wrote here 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.240
 Garbage is q q 90 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.650
 Reading or 95 people super-explosion-speed 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:48.160
 There is a reason for this is called I Why I recommend this 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.340
 Well I'm at all the difference at the time of writing speed has taken the fast I camera comes out 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.820
 So 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.360
 I am 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.310
 Hmmm 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:05.220
 Let's go, but for the first time in the mouth, a regular craft exhibition has entered 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:10.830
 Take a speed priority train with that fiber at the one who wrote the mare sd card 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 Then the speed at which the memory fills up with the first memory in it is remarkable 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.909
 fall 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:23.980
 I'm in a fallen state performance of this sd card Gibbon 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:26.250
 So how much speed will continue doing or will vary Te actual N' 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.250
 Gay 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.680
 Another this live report I touch 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.680
 f 1 string ago 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.070
 It will take quite 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:52.020
 Unevenness in Sone Anore its speed is Well 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 We will put floating Tene Peria + difference is N Ikima in the family 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.770
 Already 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.700
 It is completely different before the enemy 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.700
 Yes back until 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.750
 I'm already on standby 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.480
 This Ne write speed is more focused on this 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.800
 In the case of a camera 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.490
 Do not import after coming back to read Yamaya 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.750
 I think there is plenty of time around that, but I think it's okay if you attack it that way. 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.400
 It is this on the spot 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.069
 Feeling something 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.280
 I think it's the most annoying 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.860
 It is recommended 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.569
 It is n't him like that in the video soccer 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.940
 I'm entering at a certain alle 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.390
 Still there is a tower There are probably many numbers in this delay and insulting 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.300
 If it is a video picture, the train will be tongue-chest 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.850
 After all write Tonnobu fast guys 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.100
 10th place after 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.560
 I think there is a capacity for sd cards 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.670
 Well inside 86- 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.500
 3264 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:20.100
 There is, but I think that I have enough in order of three 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.420
 Why ward 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:29.480
 That's it d Cart 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.660
 Also it becomes rather have seen the foot is seen now because it was too much credibility I want There are unstable 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.660
 interesting 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.500
 MAY go after 100 years 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.730
 If it runs out, how many questions may not remain 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.330
 Because was real I do things such dangerous 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.400
 Big footpath if capacity is big 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:55.350
 I think there is a lot of data loss if that happens 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.740
 So go on a trip, for example, large capacity 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.180
 I put it in now 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.819
 If you come home and try to come back 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.450
 All seen 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:08.700
 Even though it was small, I never put it this way 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:12.510
 Only one of them 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.340
 So it's too big for 303 people at most 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.870
 Well I'm simple and good to be leaving the company separately 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.850
 So 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:27.300
 Also uses the small since the fine it is the important Mon whether Debs after 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:32.730
 I 'm using it with 8 or so now 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.060
 32 using such not in time and there are changing chocolate Do you want man even if I think 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.710
 I will 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.240
 Miserable 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.350
 Mystery Miff drinking water 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.650
 Hm 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.650
 No 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:53.870
 Bathing Uma syllabary lowest sound 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.070
 Or the world to live in low-level 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.590
 It also says that +10 is also another great of the cormorant in the class 10 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.610
 Headline of you 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.249
 10 people 10 people do Ya Naa per second 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.779
 Door and cladding also of both it good 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:14.189
 Let there just to see the amazing such a place himself 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.189
 After all Japan is 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:22.380
 Yes this time I bought this super item 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.270
 Because there are 2 points of caution and it is a parallel import 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.790
 The price is cheap though 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:33.289
 I can not receive support in Japan 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.620
 Usually just there all the previous Guarantee use in Japan attention point of 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.040
 Yes but 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.940
 Please stand in the foreground and the data will not come back 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.180
 Hmm 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:47.400
 I do n't think there's anything that matters to women 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:50.270
 And I By Tteyuu I thing that will not break like that immediately Ya maybe 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.510
 Kyosho was the number of times 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.750
 Yes 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:59.370
