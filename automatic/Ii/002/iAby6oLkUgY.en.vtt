00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
number one selling van in Europe it's

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.949 
number one selling van in Europe it's
been<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.550> third<00:02:29.850> generation<00:02:29.959> they

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
been this is the third generation they

built 4.5 million of these vans and it's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.490 
built 4.5 million of these vans and it's
just<00:02:35.819> so<00:02:36.000> really<00:02:36.450> well<00:02:36.630> established<00:02:37.290> it's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
just so really well established it's

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500 
just so really well established it's
very<00:02:37.800> fuel<00:02:38.160> efficient<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.360> a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
very fuel efficient and that's it's a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.979 
very fuel efficient and that's it's a
european-style<00:02:40.230> van<00:02:41.569> which<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
european-style van which is the

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.960 
european-style van which is the

really<00:02:45.660> are<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.350> European<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.489> fit

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
really are more European but they fit

traditional vans that are still in the
market<00:02:55.050> were<00:02:55.170> frankly<00:02:55.950> designed<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.550> 70s

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
market were frankly designed in the 70s

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.570 
market were frankly designed in the 70s
they<00:02:57.720> haven't<00:02:58.050> changed<00:02:58.380> much<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.860> when<00:02:59.489> you

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
they haven't changed much and when you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.580 
they haven't changed much and when you
drive<00:02:59.880> those<00:03:00.180> compared<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.230> realize

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
drive those compared to this you realize

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.130 
drive those compared to this you realize
how<00:03:01.800> much<00:03:01.920> lighter<00:03:02.340> more<00:03:02.730> nimble<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
how much lighter more nimble this is the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.080 
how much lighter more nimble this is the
power<00:03:04.380> trains<00:03:04.800> better<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.400> stronger<00:03:05.730> do

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
power trains better and stronger do

four-cylinder commercial diesel engine
built<00:03:23.430> by<00:03:23.489> Fiat<00:03:23.970> again<00:03:24.750> they<00:03:24.959> built<00:03:25.290> this

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
built by Fiat again they built this

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.229 
built by Fiat again they built this
motor<00:03:25.709> for<00:03:25.980> many<00:03:26.190> years<00:03:26.519> they<00:03:26.760> use<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.120> in

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
motor for many years they use it in

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.440 
motor for many years they use it in
class<00:03:27.420> two<00:03:27.900> three<00:03:28.200> four<00:03:28.880> chassis<00:03:29.880> cabs<00:03:30.150> in

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
class two three four chassis cabs in

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.740 
class two three four chassis cabs in
Europe<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:32.220> very<00:03:32.730> strong<00:03:33.209> durable

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
Europe so it's a very strong durable

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.920 
Europe so it's a very strong durable
motor<00:03:34.079> got<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.380> great<00:03:34.709> torque<00:03:35.010> curve<00:03:35.930> peak

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
motor got a great torque curve peak

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.440 
motor got a great torque curve peak
torque<00:03:37.290> at<00:03:37.440> 1,400<00:03:38.220> rpm<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.269> really

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
torque at 1,400 rpm so it's really

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.870 
torque at 1,400 rpm so it's really
designed<00:03:39.959> for<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.799> good<00:03:41.340> commercial

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
designed for a good commercial

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.610 
designed for a good commercial
commercial<00:03:42.299> work<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.109> what<00:03:43.290> do<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.410> think<00:03:43.530> is

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
commercial work so what do you think is

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.810 
commercial work so what do you think is
the<00:03:43.709> advantage<00:03:44.100> why<00:03:44.250> would<00:03:44.430> somebody<00:03:44.579> buy

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
the advantage why would somebody buy

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.710 
the advantage why would somebody buy
this<00:03:44.880> over<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.420> sprinter<00:03:46.549> cost<00:03:47.549> yeah<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.510> a

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
this over a sprinter cost yeah it's a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.229 
this over a sprinter cost yeah it's a
cost<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.709> lightweight<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.430> best-in-class
