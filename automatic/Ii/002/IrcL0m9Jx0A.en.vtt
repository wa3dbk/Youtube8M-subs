00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
this way so you want to start out like

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.370 
this way so you want to start out like
believe<00:00:26.720> it's<00:00:26.869> like<00:00:27.259> this<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:28.279> then<00:00:29.320> see<00:00:30.320> if

you put the water here and that's every

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.050 
you put the water here and that's every
-<00:00:33.040> yeah<00:00:34.040> I<00:00:34.310> am<00:00:34.490> man<00:00:35.330> I<00:00:35.360> have<00:00:35.630> such<00:00:35.900> a<00:00:35.930> short

- yeah I am man I have such a short

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.120 
- yeah I am man I have such a short
memory<00:00:38.060> span<00:00:38.380> thing<00:00:40.270> I'd<00:00:41.270> build<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.690> right<00:00:42.130> now

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
memory span thing I'd build it right now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.420 
memory span thing I'd build it right now
I<00:00:43.160> didn't<00:00:43.610> I'm<00:00:43.760> failed<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:45.800> probably<00:00:46.100> here

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
I didn't I'm failed that probably here

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.880 
I didn't I'm failed that probably here
out<00:00:46.790> there<00:00:48.400> and<00:00:49.400> then<00:00:49.670> they're<00:00:50.060> in<00:00:50.360> there<00:00:50.600> and

then put the house up there and there
and<00:00:58.450> that's<00:00:59.450> your<00:00:59.720> basic<00:01:00.080> base<00:01:00.560> for<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.040> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
and that's your basic base for it and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.800 
and that's your basic base for it and
then<00:01:01.610> just<00:01:01.820> add<00:01:02.120> some<00:01:02.540> wood<00:01:03.320> along<00:01:03.560> here<00:01:03.920> for

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:04.810 
then just add some wood along here for

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.639 
then just add some wood along here for
the<00:01:05.810> redstone<00:01:06.609> add<00:01:07.609> the<00:01:08.509> redstone<00:01:08.960> all<00:01:09.289> around

the redstone add the redstone all around

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.069 
the redstone add the redstone all around
the<00:01:10.070> perimeter<00:01:10.640> of<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.210> outside<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.869> the

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
the perimeter of the outside of the

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.419 
the perimeter of the outside of the
cannon<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:14.590> again<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:15.920> my<00:01:16.070> first

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
cannon and again this is my first

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.919 
cannon and again this is my first
tutorial<00:01:16.579> so<00:01:17.289> don't<00:01:18.289> like<00:01:18.710> scold<00:01:19.159> me<00:01:19.340> if<00:01:19.579> I

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
so I'm gonna go ahead and build top

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:39.219 
so I'm gonna go ahead and build top
parts<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:37.100> did<00:01:37.310> I've<00:01:37.969> recorded<00:01:38.719> this<00:01:39.020> like

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
parts and I did I've recorded this like

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.260 
parts and I did I've recorded this like
three<00:01:39.530> times<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:40.310> failed<00:01:40.759> each<00:01:41.000> time

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
three times and I failed each time

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.230 
three times and I failed each time

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
because I keep forgetting how to make it

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.330 
because I keep forgetting how to make it
good<00:01:44.299> I'm<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.049> I'm<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:45.590> stupid<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:48.259> then<00:01:49.100> put

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
good I'm so I'm so stupid and then put

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.819 
good I'm so I'm so stupid and then put
the<00:01:49.490> last<00:01:49.850> one<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.569> then<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.229> flip<00:01:51.439> to

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
the last one there and then you flip to

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.340 
the last one there and then you flip to
the<00:01:51.859> two<00:01:52.130> buttons<00:01:52.429> they're<00:01:52.789> in<00:01:52.969> there<00:01:53.209> and<00:01:53.420> the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
the two buttons they're in there and the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.779 
the two buttons they're in there and the
button<00:01:54.590> activates<00:01:55.159> all<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.429> writes<00:01:55.579> down

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
button activates all the writes down

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.749 
button activates all the writes down
Nats<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:58.569> and<00:02:00.069> this<00:02:01.069> button<00:02:01.340> will<00:02:01.610> activate

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
Nats and and this button will activate

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.760 
Nats and and this button will activate
the<00:02:02.209> redstone<00:02:02.689> on<00:02:03.170> here<00:02:04.539> so<00:02:05.539> I'm<00:02:06.530> just<00:02:06.679> gonna

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the redstone on here so I'm just gonna

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:17.059 
the redstone on here so I'm just gonna
load<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.369> up<00:02:07.459> now<00:02:11.709> whoops<00:02:13.629> for<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.750> neck

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.160 

and<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.730> reason<00:02:17.969> I<00:02:18.060> don't<00:02:18.120> have<00:02:18.299> ones<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.870> here

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and the reason I don't have ones in here

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.099 
and the reason I don't have ones in here
is<00:02:19.319> because<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.760> put<00:02:20.939> TNT<00:02:21.359> right<00:02:21.629> here

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
is because if I put TNT right here

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.740 
is because if I put TNT right here
then<00:02:22.950> when<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.819> redstone<00:02:24.269> activates<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.709> TNT

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
then when the redstone activates the TNT

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.309 
then when the redstone activates the TNT
put<00:02:27.750> online<00:02:27.870> mmm<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:30.269> block<00:02:30.599> will<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:30.930> be

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
put online mmm this block will not be

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.470 
put online mmm this block will not be
activated<00:02:31.799> by<00:02:32.159> this<00:02:32.219> redstone<00:02:32.989> because<00:02:35.480> as

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
activated by this redstone because as

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.039 
activated by this redstone because as
I'm<00:02:37.470> showing<00:02:37.829> right<00:02:38.069> here<00:02:38.510> -<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> redstone

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
I'm showing right here - a redstone

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.580 
I'm showing right here - a redstone
there<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> TNT<00:02:41.370> that's<00:02:42.150> not

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
there and like a TNT that's not

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.020 
there and like a TNT that's not
tiki-tiki<00:02:43.590> block<00:02:43.950> right<00:02:44.099> there<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.819> flip

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
tiki-tiki block right there if you flip

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.819 
tiki-tiki block right there if you flip
the<00:02:45.060> switch<00:02:45.389> the<00:02:45.720> redstone<00:02:46.439> will<00:02:46.620> not

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
the switch the redstone will not

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.250 
the switch the redstone will not
activate<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.579> TNT<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.400> turn<00:02:51.329> if<00:02:51.659> when

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
activate that TNT so in turn if when

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.690 
activate that TNT so in turn if when
this<00:02:52.409> redstone<00:02:52.799> turns<00:02:53.069> on<00:02:53.280> they<00:02:53.459> won't

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
this redstone turns on they won't

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.839 
this redstone turns on they won't
activate<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.420> T<00:02:54.720> same<00:02:55.319> as<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.560> redstone<00:02:55.849> so

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
activate this T same as that redstone so

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.869 
activate this T same as that redstone so
if<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.409> put<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:58.739> here<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.489> water<00:02:59.760> will

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
if if you put one here the water will

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.440 
if if you put one here the water will
not<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.299> able<00:03:00.419> to<00:03:00.569> go<00:03:00.780> underneath<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:02.450> TNT

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
not be able to go underneath the TNT

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.319 
not be able to go underneath the TNT
which<00:03:04.260> will<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.560> turn<00:03:04.590> explode<00:03:05.400> your<00:03:05.639> entire

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
which will in turn explode your entire

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.679 
which will in turn explode your entire
cannon<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.109> everything<00:03:07.919> around<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:09.450> yeah

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
cannon and everything around it so yeah

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.949 
cannon and everything around it so yeah
make<00:03:09.930> sure<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.230> not<00:03:10.379> put<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.599> TNT<00:03:12.599> there<00:03:12.810> I'll

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
make sure to not put the TNT there I'll

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.629 
make sure to not put the TNT there I'll
learn<00:03:13.139> that<00:03:13.290> from<00:03:13.439> experience<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:16.459> let's<00:03:17.459> just

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
learn that from experience so let's just

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.590 
learn that from experience so let's just
go<00:03:17.760> ahead<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.060> fire<00:03:18.269> it

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.360 

and<00:03:22.600> then<00:03:24.360> yeah<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.600> goes<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.740> half<00:03:27.040> slabs

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
and then yeah and it goes the half slabs

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.570 
and then yeah and it goes the half slabs
are<00:03:27.580> used<00:03:27.820> for<00:03:28.090> distance<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:32.580> fence

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
are used for distance and the fence

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.990 
are used for distance and the fence
posts<00:03:34.120> with<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:35.160> with<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.310> pressure<00:03:36.610> plates

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
posts with the with the pressure plates

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.280 
posts with the with the pressure plates
are<00:03:37.360> used<00:03:38.490> for<00:03:39.660> um<00:03:41.490> are<00:03:42.490> used<00:03:42.730> for<00:03:42.910> height<00:03:43.290> so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
are used for um are used for height so

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.980 
are used for um are used for height so
if<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.470> do<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.740> and<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.400> load<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.090> up<00:03:46.209> again<00:03:46.450> here

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
if I do that and I load it up again here

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.670 
if I do that and I load it up again here
then<00:03:49.990> it<00:03:50.080> takes<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.650> little<00:03:50.950> while<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.190> load<00:03:51.940> up

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
then it takes a little while to load up

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:01.740 
then it takes a little while to load up
not<00:03:53.680> really<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.320> fire<00:03:56.560> it<00:04:00.030> as<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.630> can

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
not really and you fire it as you can

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.550 
not really and you fire it as you can
see<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:01.959> goes<00:04:02.140> way<00:04:02.470> higher<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:04.840> believe<00:04:05.200> if

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
see it goes way higher and I believe if

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.960 
see it goes way higher and I believe if
you<00:04:05.590> use<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.489> I<00:04:07.200> believe<00:04:08.200> if<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.680> use<00:04:09.520> a<00:04:09.550> regular

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
you use a I believe if you use a regular

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.920 
you use a I believe if you use a regular
block<00:04:10.510> because<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.320> fence<00:04:11.709> post<00:04:11.800> is<00:04:12.750> one<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.900> a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
block because a fence post is one and a

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.720 
block because a fence post is one and a
half<00:04:14.080> blocks<00:04:14.290> with<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.830> pressure<00:04:15.130> plate<00:04:15.310> on<00:04:15.550> it

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
half blocks with a pressure plate on it

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.960 
half blocks with a pressure plate on it
I<00:04:16.260> think<00:04:17.260> that's<00:04:17.350> one<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.769> a<00:04:17.799> half<00:04:17.890> blocks<00:04:18.100> so

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
I think that's one and a half blocks so

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.530 
I think that's one and a half blocks so
if<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.329> put<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.540> regular<00:04:19.930> block<00:04:20.140> here<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:21.540> it's

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
if I put a regular block here so it's

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.250 
if I put a regular block here so it's
like<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.200> half<00:04:23.710> slab<00:04:23.980> is<00:04:24.160> half<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.790> block<00:04:25.260> the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
like the half slab is half a block the

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.230 
like the half slab is half a block the
regular<00:04:26.680> block<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:27.040> obviously<00:04:27.550> one<00:04:27.760> block<00:04:27.970> and

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
regular block is obviously one block and

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.390 
regular block is obviously one block and
the<00:04:28.660> fence<00:04:28.960> posts<00:04:29.200> are<00:04:29.290> one<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> half

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
the fence posts are one and a half

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.710 
the fence posts are one and a half
blocks<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:32.320> believe<00:04:33.040> if<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.430> activate<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
blocks so I believe if I activate the

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
blocks so I believe if I activate the
cannon<00:04:35.200> here<00:04:35.560> I<00:04:36.630> will<00:04:38.430> huh<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.820> guess<00:04:40.630> um<00:04:41.020> this

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
cannon here I will huh I guess um this

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.920 
cannon here I will huh I guess um this
one<00:04:41.950> that<00:04:42.100> just<00:04:42.280> goes<00:04:42.460> more<00:04:44.010> straight<00:04:45.010> I<00:04:45.430> guess

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
one that just goes more straight I guess

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.600 
one that just goes more straight I guess
so<00:04:46.930> yeah<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.320> guys<00:04:47.440> can<00:04:47.740> experiment<00:04:48.280> for

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
so yeah you guys can experiment for

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.909 
so yeah you guys can experiment for
yourself<00:04:48.970> you<00:04:49.960> guys<00:04:50.140> can<00:04:50.410> make<00:04:50.560> this<00:04:50.770> for

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
yourself you guys can make this for
