00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.430
 very good what happens people even read 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.650
 good we are testing this time 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.029
 good they presented a new loop for the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 part of the confluence that is the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.630
 second part of the chalk incursion 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.700
 good very easy the only thing we need 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 It's a month they made Haedo worth with the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.210
 auto revive let's go with the super charged 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.280
 well here as I did not have it in this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 case then we activate the center is worth the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.640
 center platform that is where they come out 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.220
 the enemies and this part starts and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 good killing stage enemies and 0 then it 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.460
 fill in the super before it's good 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.080
 in my case I did not have it and well I put 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.699
 here to kill enemies little by little it's worth 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.949
 as you can see the super by killing the 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.269
 enemies is going up it's going up and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.220
 good things very important to do 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.920
 these vouchers very important people 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.930
 all your classmates should throw away 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.720
 it's worth going through the ravine that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.790
 you are watching dais from the platform to 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.799
 resuscitate it to people already have to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.330
 jump around where you go to 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.619
 pull to be able to resurrect the rapids 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.420
 well we will also see that there is a portal 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.340
 for hanging around the portal is worth 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.140
 sword you have to go from er vale but 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.790
 you also have to be careful since you 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.020
 strike the sword quite well then good 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.310
 there you are seeing my colleagues who are 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.170
 they are pulling down the ravine and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.670
 I'm just left standing, what's the matter? 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 I still understand the super charged 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 well I wait a little bit killing 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.299
 and I'm filling the super little by little 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.060
 filling in little by little and you will see that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.649
 now the trick goes perfectly 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.930
 Well, I've already loaded it. 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.549
 where my colleagues have been thrown where 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.439
 they have fallen before but nothing we throw 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.789
 from the ravine people we throw ourselves and we'll see 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.369
 that there is a countdown worth and good 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.920
 we have to give him authority when he is 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.490
 a second is worth there I give it to him with car 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.320
 resurrected 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.610
 is worth another resurrected and the only thing 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.679
 is here in the portal by then 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.600
 quickly resurrected my companions worth 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.580
 one by one and good and we go up 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.229
 to the agent we go upstairs in the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.850
 stairs the top part the holder 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.539
 swords we passed him with care that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.740
 do not kill us 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.080
 well there we will see that I have a 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.490
 grenade and more and already able we went from not 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.690
 we kill him, vale, people are very important 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.399
 do not kill it good now with 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.619
 snipers and bazocas let's go 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.390
 up and we're loading not the enemies 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.400
 of the other platform is worth the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.950
 platform in front there is footman 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.810
 there is more gas and so on and when 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.269
 have died a good amount of 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.489
 enemies we'll see what goes in ogres worth 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.530
 that come magas and ogres well we just 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.209
 with the magas and we finish with the ogres 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 that come out beware of ogres 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.260
 because he's going to give us enemies from 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.430
 here it's worth but they hide and it's 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.739
 complicated 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.599
 but hey, I could finish them off in my 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.250
 case I was here with a good franc and 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.840
 well you are also loading 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.370
 here enemies and enemies 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.079
 this is a pretty good bug people already 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.180
 that frees us from having to do the 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.189
 bridge with the sword to kill the custodian 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.810
 etcetera is very well is very good is 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.609
 a very good trick that the truth helps 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.170
 pretty and good as you can see already the 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.639
 ogres were starting to come out I 'm 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.840
 here hitting with the bazooka my 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.730
 colleagues is also waiting with 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.379
 step almost snipers and good a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.299
 Once we finish with achievements we will see that 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.760
 it will give us the reward it is a bug 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.200
 very good in which the digital author in 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.579
 when a second is left they disappear 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 all enemies and above all 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.970
 the enemies come out of the final part that 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.590
 if we finish them because they give us the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.510
 prizes are worth here in this case when 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.069
 we finish with all enemy with the ogres 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.569
 And that gives me the front and 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.159
 fragments but here the prize is 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.780
 Random can give you energy that you can 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.669
 fragment can the front you can 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.989
 boots 7 ok good people I hope that you 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.180
 have liked the truth with a very trick 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.040
 well saves you enough time I 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.329
 I recommend until I think good patch are 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.280
 attentive because I'm also going to bring the 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.840
 way to be able to do this well is worth it without 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.280
 need to play the good but of 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.620
 Suddenly it is the button of the area that entered 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.120
 case and it deserves to be subscribed if still 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.450
 you are not and even the bag friends 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.450
 two
