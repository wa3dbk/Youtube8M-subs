00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.020
 entering a young woman 's room and I could 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.700
 to realize that she was asleep and her 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.790
 mother with an open Bible next to the 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.290
 bed and asked if I could touch any 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.329
 She asked me to play the hymn. 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.279
 I played with a big subject. 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.570
 I could see that the girl opened the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.520
 eyes and tried to speak at that moment. 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.640
 it seemed natural that I had awakened 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.160
 when the mother then in tears grabbed me 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.860
 by hands thrilled as doctors 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.930
 entered the room and told my 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.330
 daughter was in a coma three years ago 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.790
 this time to discover that God 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.510
 could you use me as your instrument 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.510
 through music 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.530
 I can witness in people 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.000
 several feelings sent a touch to 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.330
 that their eyes speak to tears 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.340
 Smiles and the instant tensamba 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.229
 monitored 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.200
 you see a reduction in the frequency 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.560
 a reduction in blood pressure 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.479
 the data become more stable and greater 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.300
 interaction of some patients at times 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.149
 who was in a coma and not reactions 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.100
 I did not see on a daily basis and starting 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.750
 From his song the difference is huge. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.149
 music does very well 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.450
 she brought moments of peace brings moments 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.860
 of tranquility it brings moments of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.220
 spirituality 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.869
 I can feel that people are listening to 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.509
 feline sound 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:59.149
 they are inter in that two of them are 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.979
 captivated she feels really more 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.229
 next to god we stay 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:11.270
 sensitizing why because something 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:14.120
 wonderful surprise is a joy of the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.099
 Sir, it 's because whenever there's still 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.810
 hope once in a visit to the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.660
 Steve playing for a gentleman who was 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.340
 with cancer he timidly left the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.290
 door ajar 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.319
 I played for him I will not say goodbye 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.359
 filled his face in the door 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.780
 he has a hug and wish that god 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.730
 I was with him and he shyly 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.030
 replied from within 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.999
 God just made a visit 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.849
 I always pray to God in prayer that 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:48.579
 message is a message of salvation 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.549
 these people because I believe this is a 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.379
 mission a mission that god gave me as 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.439
 Adventist church member Seventh 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.439
 day 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.340
 to visit the sick sick the 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.610
 people in prison for orphans 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.099
 I know I 'm visiting God too. 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.050
 I believe that anyone can 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.050
 transform your life into a ministry
