00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.500
 Welcome to nugget number 15. This will probably be a controversial video, 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.150
 I'm already telling you. At the end some will love me or 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.700
 just want to hit me, although you may already want to. Today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.800
 why animal lovers suck. I am mainly talking about animal lovers 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.059
 who still eat animals (products). How many people do you know? 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.349
 animal lover? They rescue every homeless animal within a radius of 10 km from their home 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.010
 and do petitions to save dolphins, adopt unwanted dogs and protect them 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.800
 dying species. They share thousands of photos online of their hundreds of cats on their Facebook page 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 and as they hand out leaflets about habitat destruction 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.300
 and they make a donation 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.819
 big chicken salad. You may think that it conflicts to love animals 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.409
 and eat them anyway. This seems to be a common separation in our society. 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.350
 The vast majority of animal lovers love to eat their animals. These people 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.890
 go off if you leave your dog in your car in the sun, or if you leave 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.530
 don't let your dog or cat help you. But invite them to a barbecue that is their local animal shelter 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.090
 sponsors and they are there. And really, how logical is it to make a distinction 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.590
 between species? People go wild about killing dolphins and eating 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.200
 of dogs in other countries. You compare a pig with a dog. Pigs are even 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.930
 much smarter than any dog ​​and do better than children of 3 years old. 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.130
 So why be angry about eating dogs while we continue to eat beef and pork? 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.109
 Let us look at similar beliefs that are not 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.250
 being approved. Say I protest against racism. I'm for it 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.859
 the equality of all races. I would probably say that in politics, 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.049
 I always vote for the minority and I have friends from different ethnicities and backgrounds. 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.619
 I like to watch Oprah, I quote Martin Luther King and find Taye Diggs very sexy. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.359
 And, I allow my slaves more and more education by supplying them with teachers. 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.179
 Tell me I'm a feminist. I believe in equality. I think women pay the same amount and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.480
 earn respect. I participate in protests 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.610
 female rights. I am even a lesbian and I keep my girlfriend under control with reprimands 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.480
 and an occasional blow. But it's for her own good. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.069
 Too ridiculous you say? Some of this real example, NAMBLA. NAMBLA is the North American 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.379
 Man Boy Love Association. They say that the love between man and boy is natural, 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.890
 and goes way back in history. They refer to a quote: "The enormous affection of 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.360
 an older man for a younger man, as Plato made the basis of his philosophy, is 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.780
 that deep, spiritual affection that is just as pure as perfect. "NAMBLA says that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.470
 "most man / boy relationships are based on mutual respect and affection. Such relationships 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.640
 don't hurt anyone and often have many benefits for both men and boys. "Here is an organization 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.790
 he says that promotes the well-being, freedom and rights of young boys. The members give 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.450
 their lives, identities and sometimes even lose their freedom, because they love 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.830
 these guys love. Now you may think that it is absurd of me to eat animals and love them 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.849
 comparable to men who come out for keeping boys. Certainly, animal lovers 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.189
 who still eat animals (products) are not nearly as bad as 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.849
 active pedophiles, right? And I have to agree with you on some points. First, 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.120
 the men of NAMBLA do not say that it is ok to have some boys under certain circumstances 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.879
 kill. Where animal-eating animal lovers make random differences between 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.439
 animals that must be saved and which are tortured and killed 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.069
 be for food. To be honest, both animal-eating animal lovers and NAMBLA members believe 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.340
 that they do their best for those they advocate. But eating animals 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.659
 animal lovers only go to their own limits. 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.069
 Dog or cat? To rescue. Dolphin is an endangered species? Protect them. Cow, pig or chicken? 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.879
 Torture, milk, kill and eat them. Animals on a children's farm? Love it, but eat 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.860
 their brothers and sisters for dinner. Is this all too much for you? Do you have rational 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.829
 objections? You may say, cats and dogs are one thing, 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.840
 but pigs and cows and chickens, are they there to eat? I would like to refer you to 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.519
 this video for the answer. And what about the argument that we developed into it 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.650
 eating meat and that it is just natural? Why don't you look at this before you do that 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.509
 makes an argument. And last, perhaps you say, I am not for torturing animals or whatever 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.970
 cruelty whatsoever, I only eat animals (products) that have been treated humanely and slaughtered. 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.380
 You probably guessed it, there is also a video about that. 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.750
