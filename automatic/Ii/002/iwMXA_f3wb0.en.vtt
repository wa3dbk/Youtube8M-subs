00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:25.119
 This time is was I was s who was released in April 2015 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:30.259
 I would like to introduce Toyota Corolla Fielder here 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:35.059
 11th generation current Corolla from the 1966 debut 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.570
 I debuted in May of 2012, but clearly saying it our evaluation is much yeah 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.670
 As if it wasn't a good thing 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.480
 In response to a change in the storage and has era even better maneuverability make the downsizing 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.739
 There was a thing that I did, but on the other hand, the design is a little boring. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.300
 If there is no break 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.080
 Corolla very much by that or not a new technology is not much, such as after draws ne eye 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.560
 A little blur I mean I wonder was what the car would do was a car for What 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.810
 There is a feeling that kana Teru 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:06.700
 After that the hybrid Kinkyushin was added and it showed the recovery like Toyota 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:11.440
 But this minor change is Corolla who is pushing the direction further 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.820
 Kuru also to those enthusiasm that'll be in once attractive car it is very felt 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.550
 I think that I think we have become First there was big here. It is the exterior design 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.780
 Well face what 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.400
 Even if you look at it, it changes to a very sharp look Not only around the light but also the tongue fender 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.900
 All the bumpers have also changed 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:31.970
 In fact , I think it is similar to this design American elder but I think too 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.350
 For America , too, I measured rejuvenation all at once in the same way, and now I'm sleeping successfully. 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.830
 Follow it 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.720
 I think it means that it was very rejuvenated for Japan 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:47.149
 The other of the first 1.5-liter of the new engine as the feature has been installed here 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:50.509
 Newly developed units have significantly improved fuel efficiency and this is actually the best point 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.340
 I'm wondering if it is full of advanced safety equipment 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.340
 I think this can also be raised Toyota made 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.630
 Toka is a pre-crash brake called ft sense Sea 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.689
 Lane Departner and those which are set are standard on many models 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.590
 You can now select by equipment or option 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.090
 Well, until now it was a feeling that I was taking a bit late in that point Corolla . 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.330
 And Well Do finally came 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.290
 I think that has also of possible gold overtake part not just that catch up 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.209
 I will 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.900
 It is an engine and the spec of the highest vision 109 horsepower at 1.5 liters has not changed 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:28.659
 However, the contents are actually completely newly designed 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.959
 Of particular note is 38.5%, which is a bit surprising for those who know a bit 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.310
 Fuel efficiency is realized by realizing thermal efficiency 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.770
 From 21.2 k to 23 km 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.130
 Well per liter, it has been greatly improved 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.350
 It is an interior 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.860
 Sounds from various places such as meters around the steering shift even just looking at the package 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.450
 Say trying to increase value or quality feeling has changed is fine design 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.650
 Goodness of this parting when the mark is will I design also That's right ride governance Corolla again seen 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.970
 It is shining 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.120
 A lot of pillars How to see the bonnet All the way you see Side here 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.260
 Corolla stretches out 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.580
 There is a place called Do not have been passed down unchanged to this time of the Corolla Fielder 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:11.510
 It is the enhancement of advanced safety equipment that can be said to be a major feature 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:17.090
 What is called Toyota Safety Sense Sea 1.5 g 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.110
 More than this car comes standard with a combination of monocular camera and laser radar 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.470
 It is a system, but by this 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.040
 In pre-crash brake so-called collision avoidance system 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.580
 With it and lane departure alert It will say that it is dangerous if the lane goes out. 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.750
 function 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.350
 And automatic high beam high beam low beam will switch automatically 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.630
 Machine's 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.810
 These are set 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:44.430
 It is a rear seat, so I think it is enough for space, so the number should be narrow 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.030
 Well, there is nothing like the side of the head touching the roof when sitting down 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.950
 The 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.710
 It's a fairly compact car but there is plenty of space in front of the knees and it's very spacious 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.620
 And until it is fully convinced Kedomo does not say is 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.510
 And I Mayo' 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.980
 It is wide enough so even if it is 3 adults , if it is a short time, I wonder if this can be enough 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.440
 That's where you say 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:09.909
 It is luggage space capacity Well, considering that it is of 407 Tatsudama 5 number size wagon 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.640
 I think it's enough, not just the capacity but also look at the opening 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:18.500
 It seems that it is easy to put in a big one with a fairly wide width . 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.870
 Such that the defeat of the rear seat, but you can also create a truly meters more space Well 2 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.100
 If it's meters, it's pretty long 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.340
 I think I think that I can load it in time, and I want to beat that sheet 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.360
 All you have to do is pull the levers on the three sides 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.080
 I turn around next time I beat one, and even if I don't come back to the back I entered 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.630
 Good 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.420
 Good idea 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.960
 There are a lot of things 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:44.770
 Corolla with improved fuel consumption with a new 1.5 liter engine 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.770
 I would like to see what kind of change there was when I was running
