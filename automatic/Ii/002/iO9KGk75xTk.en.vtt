00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
mod showcase to then take a look at the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.550 
mod showcase to then take a look at the
gravity<00:00:17.970> gun<00:00:18.000> which<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.600> absolutely<00:00:19.020> amazing

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
gravity gun which is absolutely amazing

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
gravity gun which is absolutely amazing
but<00:00:20.340> before<00:00:20.490> get<00:00:20.760> into<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.090> let's<00:00:21.300> take<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
but before get into it let's take a

need minecraft forge now let's get back

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.180 
need minecraft forge now let's get back
to<00:00:42.930> Mycroft<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.559> will<00:00:43.680> show<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.040> this

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
to Mycroft and I will show you what this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.520 
to Mycroft and I will show you what this
great<00:00:44.489> mod<00:00:44.730> does<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.480> quite<00:00:45.840> obvious<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
great mod does it is quite obvious of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.340 
great mod does it is quite obvious of
course<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:47.039> adds<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.910> gravity<00:00:48.780> gun<00:00:48.809> from

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
course it adds the gravity gun from

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.459 
course it adds the gravity gun from
half-life<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.250> Minecraft<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> really

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
half-life to Minecraft and it is really

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319 
half-life to Minecraft and it is really
really<00:00:52.770> great<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.370> grab<00:00:53.699> blocks<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
really great you can grab blocks and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.250 
really great you can grab blocks and
such<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.920> throw<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> air<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:57.260> just

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
such and throw them in the air or just

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
such and throw them in the air or just
let<00:00:58.379> them<00:00:58.530> go<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.280> hold<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.820> stuff<00:01:00.030> but

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
let them go and a hold of more stuff but

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.760 
let them go and a hold of more stuff but
the<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:00.899> I'll<00:01:01.050> show<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> crossing

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the first I'll show you the crossing

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.130 
the first I'll show you the crossing
with<00:01:01.859> speed<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.190> actually<00:01:02.520> two<00:01:02.730> guns<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
with speed are actually two guns and the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.620 
with speed are actually two guns and the
first<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.650> crafted<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
first one is crafted like so it is

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.990 
first one is crafted like so it is
really<00:01:06.990> expensive<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.979> quite<00:01:08.490> hard<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> make

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
really expensive and quite hard to make

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.469 
really expensive and quite hard to make
but<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.080> justified<00:01:10.680> by<00:01:11.280> its<00:01:11.549> power<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.270> is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
but that is justified by its power it is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.080 
but that is justified by its power it is
really<00:01:13.380> really<00:01:13.950> powerful<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.820> doesn't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
really really powerful and it doesn't

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060 
really really powerful and it doesn't
have<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> durability<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
have a durability so I think this is a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.240 
have a durability so I think this is a
good<00:01:17.280> recipe<00:01:17.600> now<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.710> blue<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:19.920> is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
good recipe now this one the blue one is

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
good recipe now this one the blue one is
a<00:01:20.600> supercharged<00:01:21.600> gravity<00:01:22.140> gun<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.619> are

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
a supercharged gravity gun and there are

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
a supercharged gravity gun and there are
two<00:01:23.070> ways<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.869> first<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.350> by

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
two ways you can get it the first is by

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.390 
two ways you can get it the first is by
a<00:01:25.710> secret<00:01:26.430> recipe<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:28.110> won't<00:01:28.560> show<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
a secret recipe and I won't show you the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580 
a secret recipe and I won't show you the
exact<00:01:29.970> recipe<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:31.049> tell<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
exact recipe but I can tell you that it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.359 
exact recipe but I can tell you that it
has<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> nether<00:01:32.909> star<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.310> believe<00:01:35.310> me

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
has a nether star in it and believe me

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
has a nether star in it and believe me
those<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.939> really<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.540> hard<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.020> unit

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
those are really really hard to get unit

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.260 
those are really really hard to get unit
Achille<00:01:37.770> wither<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.640> weather<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.939> quite

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
Achille wither and the weather is quite

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600 
Achille wither and the weather is quite
strong<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.979> yeah<00:01:40.979> that's<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.310> cool<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
strong but yeah that's pretty cool the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
strong but yeah that's pretty cool the
second<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.740> struck<00:01:44.070> by

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
second way to get it is to be struck by

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160 
second way to get it is to be struck by
lightning<00:01:44.850> while<00:01:45.000> holding<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.600> normal

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
lightning while holding this normal

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.789 
lightning while holding this normal
gravity<00:01:46.590> gun<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.979> he<00:01:47.909> had<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> chances<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
gravity gun and he had a chances of that

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.090 
gravity gun and he had a chances of that
happening<00:01:49.860> aren't<00:01:50.670> really<00:01:51.420> great<00:01:51.659> either<00:01:52.100> so

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
happening aren't really great either so

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
happening aren't really great either so
it's<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.880> hard<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:54.329> by<00:01:54.540> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's really really hard to get by this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.219 
it's really really hard to get by this
one<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.880> then<00:01:56.880> again<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.509> are<00:01:57.540> both<00:01:57.780> really

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
one but then again they are both really

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.139 
one but then again they are both really
really<00:01:58.560> powerful<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.219> cool<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.909> well

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
really powerful and really cool as well

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
really powerful and really cool as well
so<00:02:00.420> let's<00:02:00.659> go<00:02:00.869> ahead<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.170> take<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.409> look<00:02:01.590> what

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
so let's go ahead and take a look what

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.410 
so let's go ahead and take a look what
you<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.149> showed

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you can do with it like I just showed

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.440 
you can do with it like I just showed
you<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.229> throw<00:02:05.159> blocks<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:05.700> grab<00:02:06.149> blocks

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you you can throw blocks or grab blocks

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.859 
you you can throw blocks or grab blocks
like<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.170> throw<00:02:08.069> them

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
like so and throw them

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.600 
like so and throw them
and<00:02:08.989> they<00:02:09.110> will<00:02:09.289> be<00:02:09.379> placed<00:02:09.709> again<00:02:10.009> the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
and they will be placed again the

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.030 
and they will be placed again the
physics<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.569> model<00:02:11.780> are<00:02:12.049> absolutely

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
physics of this model are absolutely

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.390 
physics of this model are absolutely
amazing<00:02:13.099> you<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:14.030> push<00:02:14.989> them<00:02:15.170> around

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
amazing you can just push them around

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.110 
amazing you can just push them around
thrown<00:02:16.400> into<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:16.940> tree<00:02:17.330> over<00:02:17.360> there<00:02:17.599> or

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
thrown into that tree over there or

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.899 
thrown into that tree over there or
against<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.269> tree<00:02:20.510> whatever<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.159> it<00:02:22.159> is<00:02:22.640> just

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
against the tree whatever and it is just

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.699 
against the tree whatever and it is just
absolutely<00:02:23.180> amazing<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.900> can<00:02:24.019> also<00:02:24.200> throw<00:02:24.530> me

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
absolutely amazing you can also throw me

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.949 
absolutely amazing you can also throw me
against<00:02:25.129> mobs<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.989> can<00:02:27.829> hit<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.159> right<00:02:28.959> I

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
against mobs if I can hit it right I

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.500 
against mobs if I can hit it right I
have<00:02:30.260> terrible<00:02:30.530> aim<00:02:31.690> cats<00:02:32.690> come<00:02:33.110> here<00:02:34.510> maybe

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
have terrible aim cats come here maybe

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.360 
have terrible aim cats come here maybe
those<00:02:36.700> come<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:38.000> there<00:02:38.780> we<00:02:38.959> go<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.129> see<00:02:40.250> it

so<00:02:43.910> let's<00:02:44.120> grab<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.599> log<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.260> hit<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.040> cat

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
so let's grab this log and hit that cat

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.750 
so let's grab this log and hit that cat
pretty<00:02:47.810> cool<00:02:48.049> i've<00:02:48.200> got<00:02:48.410> some<00:02:48.590> other<00:02:48.760> blocks

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
pretty cool i've got some other blocks

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.150 
pretty cool i've got some other blocks
here<00:02:49.940> as<00:02:50.060> well<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.420> as<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.319> can<00:02:51.440> see<00:02:51.470> right

now<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.269> also<00:02:53.450> purchase<00:02:53.900> obsidian<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.329> with

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
now it's also purchase obsidian and with

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.970 
now it's also purchase obsidian and with
furnaces<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:58.629> note<00:02:59.629> block<00:02:59.959> or<00:03:00.200> two<00:03:00.530> boxes

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.680 
actually but I'm it works with a lot of
different<00:03:04.030> blocks<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.299> is<00:03:05.420> really<00:03:05.659> cool

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
different blocks and that is really cool

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.349 
different blocks and that is really cool
as<00:03:05.959> well<00:03:06.159> now<00:03:07.159> a<00:03:07.190> really<00:03:07.640> nice<00:03:07.790> thing<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.329> that

as well now a really nice thing is that

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.280 
as well now a really nice thing is that
you<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.540> also<00:03:08.810> grab<00:03:09.290> mobs<00:03:09.819> like<00:03:10.819> so<00:03:11.140> look<00:03:12.140> at

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
you can also grab mobs like so look at

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.190 
you can also grab mobs like so look at
him<00:03:12.379> he's<00:03:12.530> strike<00:03:12.859> to<00:03:12.980> run<00:03:13.069> away<00:03:13.190> hi<00:03:13.519> cat<00:03:14.200> and

around with and come here come here oh
well<00:03:33.440> anyway<00:03:33.919> and<00:03:34.220> I'll<00:03:34.579> spawn<00:03:34.819> some<00:03:34.970> slides

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
well anyway and I'll spawn some slides

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.199 
well anyway and I'll spawn some slides
you<00:03:35.870> could<00:03:35.989> also<00:03:36.139> show<00:03:36.440> these<00:03:36.879> it's<00:03:37.879> a<00:03:38.030> really

really fun and you can also do this kind

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.680 
really fun and you can also do this kind
of<00:03:41.510> power<00:03:42.040> push<00:03:43.040> thing<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:43.970> just<00:03:44.209> push

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
of power push thing but you just push

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.510 
of power push thing but you just push
them<00:03:44.900> away<00:03:45.049> like<00:03:45.169> so<00:03:46.329> cats

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
them away like so cats

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.450 
them away like so cats
Cody<00:03:49.450> edge

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.390 

and<00:03:53.780> yeah<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:54.990> just<00:03:55.230> really<00:03:55.410> really<00:03:55.650> fun<00:03:55.920> but

and yeah it's just really really fun but

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.040 
and yeah it's just really really fun but
this<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.700> actually<00:03:56.850> also<00:03:57.150> quite<00:03:57.540> useful<00:03:57.960> if

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
this is actually also quite useful if

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.630 
this is actually also quite useful if
you<00:03:58.170> really<00:03:58.380> want<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.620> just<00:03:58.980> get<00:03:59.160> rid<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.430> some

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
you really want to just get rid of some

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.420 
you really want to just get rid of some
blocks<00:03:59.910> really<00:04:00.240> quickly<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:01.160> really<00:04:02.160> cool

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
blocks really quickly and a really cool

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.510 
blocks really quickly and a really cool
use<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.000> found<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.340> can

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
use that I found is that you can

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.140 
use that I found is that you can
actually<00:04:05.700> pick<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:06.510> primed<00:04:07.290> T&amp;T<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.820> when<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.030> do

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
actually pick up primed T&amp;T so when I do

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.380 
actually pick up primed T&amp;T so when I do
this<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:10.260> grab<00:04:10.770> my<00:04:10.800> gravity<00:04:11.580> gun<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.940> I

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
this and I grab my gravity gun and I
