00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.360
 once on our planet they lived 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.009
 huge beasts terrible monsters that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.839
 if it were not for his fossil remains 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:17.640
 they could never even have imagined 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.130
 animals so strange and unknown that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.380
 they tell us about an unlikely story 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.230
 since millions of years ago when the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.210
 man does not exist yet 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.630
 from this land of the dominated by 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.980
 giant and in each span of land the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.669
 life by cell goes of beings 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.669
 extraordinary 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.030
 we will never get to know the exotic 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.680
 lifestyles that once existed 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:48.370
 but there is a place in Mexico where 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.370
 we can see the remains of a lost world 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.120
 monsters of the past in Mexico part 1 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.920
 the adventure by Guadalajara Jalisco 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.600
 has brought to this museum that is the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.310
 paleontology museum where 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.920
 we will find the fossil records of 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.330
 animals millions of years ago so 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 that accompanies me to know him 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.650
 what is paleontology paleontology 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.990
 is the natural science that studies 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.950
 interprets the past of life on the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.170
 earth through fossils 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.299
 the fossils are the remains of animals or 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.250
 organisms of the past creatures that 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.439
 they existed at some time on earth 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.070
 and that have been petrified or 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.650
 marked in stone 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.840
 and paleobiology studies the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.450
 organisms of the past animals that 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.450
 we know only because of its fossil remains 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.229
 the diversity of the state of Jalisco is 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.330
 very large and one of the most important 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.640
 of the country to which we must add a rich 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.830
 paleontological heritage that places the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.680
 been a promising place for the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.020
 investigation of life in the past its 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.420
 importance lies in the large number of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.380
 locations with discoveries of 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.380
 fossil remains 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.750
 undoubtedly the collections gathered here 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.930
 So far they are the largest 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.459
 in Mexico that we can appreciate in this 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.459
 wonderful museum 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.420
 the first shocking creature with the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.790
 that I found was the saber tooth 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.250
 a big cat that seems to have left 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.620
 from a science fiction movie and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.500
 that his huge fangs are really 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.620
 terrifying which they used to 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.620
 cut the flesh of these unfortunate 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.620
 dams 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.500
 felines of the genus smile or gong 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.349
 they know only from north and south america 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.870
 these creatures appeared 2.5 ago 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.079
 million years and the latter 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.099
 they extinguished 10 thousand years ago at the end 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.099
 of the last ice age 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.390
 so far three have been found 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.769
 species of this genus that have 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.769
 different characteristics 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.040
 the smile or done gracilis found 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.690
 only in the east of the USA was the most 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.690
 small and first species of the genus 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.100
 the smile popular or found in 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.300
 South American countries like Brazil 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.910
 argentina chile bolivia or venezuela 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.430
 appeared a million years ago weighed 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.040
 around 300 kilos and their fangs 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.040
 they measured 18 centimeters of africom 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.069
 and fainting are fatal that has been 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.230
 found in the western part of 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.930
 throughout the Americas as 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.150
 He emigrated from North America in deposits 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.760
 ranch the pitch in california it 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.969
 they found hundreds of fossils of this 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.969
 animal 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.760
 this last species is what we see here 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.640
 representing in Mexico the remains 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.730
 fossils from the sme lo dona fatalis have been 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.760
 found at least in aguascalientes and 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.760
 jalisco 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.470
 having this data that is power 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.830
 recognize what kind of smile or gong 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.490
 was the diego character of the movie the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.490
 ice Age 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.479
 the museum had many surprises and 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.639
 he gave us incredible information about 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.819
 discoveries in the regions of 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.550
 state and one of these discoveries of 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.620
 I was really moved since I was able to observe 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.650
 the fossil remains of one of the most 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.360
 strange creatures that there was always 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.259
 interested 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.259
 the glyptodonte 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.830
 The remarkable thing about this animal is its huge 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.350
 shell formed by partner shields 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.660
 they served him as protection was an animal 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.240
 that moved with average slowness near 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.390
 two to three meters and weighed more than one 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.390
 ton 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.319
 unfortunately here he could only observe 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:28.440
 partner parties as fragments of their 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:32.169
 shell since this creature is 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.960
 discovered mainly in South America 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.789
 at the silver museum in argentina 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.939
 You can admire complete copies of 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.099
 this animal that in its morphology is very 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:44.590
 similar to the armadillos that we can still 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:48.659
 know in this time and that is very 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.659
 important that we preserve them 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.780
 but still these fragments of 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.390
 glyptodonte for being in 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.730
 Mexican territory are very special 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:04.790
 since there are only three discoveries of 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.790
 This species registered in our country 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:12.960
 we are coming specifically to 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.210
 look for one of these animals that stops 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.159
 we are very special and that is very 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.509
 incredible what is the glyptodont that we 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.789
 you can say about the glyptodont and 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.369
 about the parts you have here of 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.169
 remains of these good animals and the 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:28.210
 glyptodonte is a pretty animal 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.310
 peculiar this unique 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.350
 then in its kind the relatives more 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.169
 nearby that they have today are 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.860
 Armadillos are animals that possessed 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:40.750
 a bony shell formed by plates 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.400
 which are called thermos or rosettes 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.610
 by the way it has a way 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.550
 as a flower and each carapacho in this 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.289
 each glyptodont possessed up to 1,800 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.060
 plates of this type we are talking about 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.830
 an animal about the size of a 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.680
 volkswagen sedan a pretty animal 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.960
 big compared to your representatives 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.570
 current not even the largest of the 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.130
 armadillos that live in South American 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.320
 a curious story about the find 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.410
 of the clips everything before is that of a child 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.900
 in Cochabamba Bolivia in 2012 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.780
 when homework they let them take a 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.460
 bone of an animal to study it and he 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.590
 He decided to take a very large one that his 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.659
 father had found some time ago and 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.840
 that they had buried again for thinking 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:25.810
 that they treated the bones of a cow 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.760
 the teacher seeing the incredible fossil gave 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.880
 part to an institution which 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:35.400
 ruled that they were before the remains of 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.400
 a giant glyptodonte 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:45.170
 in the next chapter we will know the 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.720
 most impressive animal of the museum one of 

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.850
 the most important discoveries in 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.710
 our country in addition to an exhibition 

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:55.460
