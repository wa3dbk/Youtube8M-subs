00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
vulnerability we patch it so like even

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.090 
vulnerability we patch it so like even
before<00:02:41.790> Apple<00:02:42.360> does<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.720> raw<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:42.959> ah<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.950> your

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
before Apple does it raw like ah in your

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.610 
before Apple does it raw like ah in your
face<00:02:44.370> vulnerability<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.540> anytime<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.320> a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
face vulnerability so anytime that a

vulnerability tries to do it they're

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.240 
vulnerability tries to do it they're
like<00:02:48.209> stymied<00:02:48.810> they're<00:02:49.170> totally<00:02:49.590> totally

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
like stymied they're totally totally

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.979 
like stymied they're totally totally
blocked<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.940> then<00:02:51.180> when<00:02:51.390> Apple<00:02:51.660> does<00:02:51.810> their

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
blocked and then when Apple does their

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.870 
blocked and then when Apple does their
patch<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.560> get<00:02:52.709> out<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.980> way<00:02:53.100> we<00:02:53.430> let<00:02:53.610> Apple
