today I am going to be bringing you a
quick<00:00:06.899> video<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.290> how<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.830> was<00:00:08.189> attacked<00:00:08.580> by<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820

golem dragon and Pekka actually

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.660 
golem dragon and Pekka actually
multiples<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.179> them<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.160> peckers<00:00:14.549> were

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670

level<00:00:14.969> 3<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:16.080> just<00:00:16.289> think<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.710> always

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
level 3 and I just think it's always

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.170 
level 3 and I just think it's always
interesting<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.699> these<00:00:17.910> high-level

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
interesting to see these high-level

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.720 
interesting to see these high-level
raids<00:00:18.830> especially<00:00:19.830> if<00:00:19.949> you're<00:00:20.100> not<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
so enjoy this video and just take it for

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.260 
so enjoy this video and just take it for
what<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.850> worth<00:00:36.140> I<00:00:37.140> did<00:00:37.739> lose<00:00:37.950> 150<00:00:38.610> k<00:00:38.969> gold

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
what it's worth I did lose 150 k gold

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.240 
what it's worth I did lose 150 k gold
and<00:00:39.690> 100k<00:00:40.079> elixir<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.700> no<00:00:41.820> dark<00:00:42.059> elixir<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
and 100k elixir but no dark elixir so

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
and 100k elixir but no dark elixir so
I'd<00:00:44.250> say<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.610> base<00:00:44.820> didn't<00:00:45.270> hold<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.930> well

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I'd say my base didn't hold up that well

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.190 
I'd say my base didn't hold up that well
but<00:00:46.440> against<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:46.980> army<00:00:47.750> I'd<00:00:48.750> say<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.079> did

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
but against this army I'd say it did

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.029 
but against this army I'd say it did
better<00:00:49.410> than<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.739> would<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:49.920> expected

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
better than I would have expected

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.970 
better than I would have expected
because<00:00:50.640> i<00:00:50.879> only<00:00:51.000> got<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.360> start<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
because i only got one start and at this

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.889 
because i only got one start and at this
level<00:00:53.250> i<00:00:53.640> assume<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.210> he's<00:00:54.360> trying<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> root

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
level i assume that he's trying to root

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.590 
level i assume that he's trying to root
he's<00:00:55.230> trying<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> increase<00:00:55.829> his<00:00:56.239> his<00:00:57.239> trophy

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
he's trying to increase his his trophy

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.740 
he's trying to increase his his trophy
count<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.739> he<00:00:59.670> did<00:01:00.059> lose<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> lot<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> dark

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
count so he did lose a lot of dark

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.520 
count so he did lose a lot of dark
elixir<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.590> golems<00:01:02.100> cost<00:01:02.399> 450<00:01:03.530> dark

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
elixir because golems cost 450 dark

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.940 
elixir because golems cost 450 dark
elixir<00:01:04.710> each<00:01:05.040> um<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.330> his<00:01:07.260> pekka's<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
elixir each um and his pekka's and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
elixir each um and his pekka's and
dragons<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.610> not<00:01:08.820> cheap<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> also<00:01:10.080> he

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
dragons are not cheap and also he

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.260 
dragons are not cheap and also he
actually<00:01:10.530> used<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.689> fully<00:01:12.689> upgraded<00:01:13.439> spells

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
actually used for fully upgraded spells

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
actually used for fully upgraded spells
so<00:01:15.270> I'd<00:01:16.259> say<00:01:16.470> he<00:01:16.590> didn't<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.220> if

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so I'd say he didn't really get much if

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.149 
so I'd say he didn't really get much if
in<00:01:18.060> fact<00:01:18.390> he<00:01:18.540> actually<00:01:18.750> lost<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.229> lot<00:01:19.380> elixir

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
in fact he actually lost a lot elixir

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.749 
in fact he actually lost a lot elixir
and<00:01:20.310> dark<00:01:21.030> elixir<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.979> I'll<00:01:22.979> definitely<00:01:23.250> watch

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and dark elixir so I'll definitely watch

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.730 
and dark elixir so I'll definitely watch
this<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:25.070> take<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.610> worth<00:01:27.740> now

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
this and take it for what it's worth now

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.330 
this and take it for what it's worth now
I<00:01:29.130> am<00:01:29.790> gonna<00:01:30.030> point<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.409> his<00:01:31.770> golem<00:01:32.070> is

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
I am gonna point out that his golem is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.390 
I am gonna point out that his golem is
not<00:01:32.549> at<00:01:32.850> level<00:01:33.240> 3<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.229> i<00:01:34.680> believe<00:01:34.920> level<00:01:35.220> three

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
not at level 3 and i believe level three

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.830 
not at level 3 and i believe level three
is<00:01:35.430> too<00:01:35.579> max<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> strongest

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
is too max so it's not the strongest

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.380 
is too max so it's not the strongest
golem<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:38.100> his<00:01:38.430> Peck<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> our<00:01:38.909> level<00:01:39.150> 3<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
golem but his Peck is our level 3 and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.090 
golem but his Peck is our level 3 and
his<00:01:39.540> dragons<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:40.020> level<00:01:40.229> 3<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.500> everything

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
his dragons are level 3 and everything

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.810 
his dragons are level 3 and everything
else<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.400> next<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.350> he<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> using<00:01:43.680> his<00:01:43.950> three

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
else is next so he is using his three

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.249 
else is next so he is using his three
lightning<00:01:45.060> spells<00:01:45.479> two<00:01:45.899> are<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> be

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
lightning spells two are going to be

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.690 
lightning spells two are going to be
used<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.710> mortar<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> take<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.549> out<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
used on this mortar to take it out and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
used on this mortar to take it out and
one's<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.420> used<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.930> mortar

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
one's going to be used on this mortar

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.600 
one's going to be used on this mortar
now<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.680> air<00:01:52.680> defenses<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.340> are

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
now I do have to air defenses that are

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.310 
now I do have to air defenses that are
still<00:01:53.850> being<00:01:54.000> upgraded<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:55.079> wizard

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
tower that's still being upgraded so my

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.170 
tower that's still being upgraded so my

is it at full capacity now normally i
would<00:02:05.130> suggest<00:02:05.570> deploying<00:02:06.570> our<00:02:06.689> golems<00:02:07.200> first

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
would suggest deploying our golems first

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
would suggest deploying our golems first
because<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.300> don't<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:09.929> want<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.920> clan

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
because you don't actually want the clan

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250 
because you don't actually want the clan
castle<00:02:11.220> troops<00:02:11.670> targeting<00:02:12.569> your

castle troops targeting your
peckers<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.730> are<00:02:14.819> attacking<00:02:15.150> with

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
peckers if you are attacking with

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.509 
peckers if you are attacking with
becca's<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> golems<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.920> want<00:02:17.099> your<00:02:17.220> golems

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
becca's and golems you want your golems

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.020 
becca's and golems you want your golems
to<00:02:17.640> be<00:02:17.760> taking<00:02:18.060> all<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.299> damage<00:02:18.629> so<00:02:19.620> now<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.400> did

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
to be taking all the damage so now I did

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.699 
to be taking all the damage so now I did
take<00:02:21.209> out<00:02:21.360> both<00:02:21.569> these<00:02:21.689> pekka's<00:02:22.079> or<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.319> will<00:02:22.530> be

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
take out both these pekka's or I will be

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.699 
take out both these pekka's or I will be
taking<00:02:23.040> out<00:02:23.129> both<00:02:23.310> his<00:02:23.340> pekka's<00:02:24.709> immediately

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
taking out both his pekka's immediately

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.020 
taking out both his pekka's immediately
so<00:02:26.360> those<00:02:27.360> were<00:02:27.540> sort<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.840> wasted<00:02:28.379> I'd<00:02:28.980> say<00:02:29.280> if

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
so those were sort of wasted I'd say if

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.880 
so those were sort of wasted I'd say if
I<00:02:30.180> were<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.450> critique<00:02:30.840> how<00:02:31.079> he<00:02:31.140> how<00:02:31.860> he

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
I were to critique how he how he

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.149 
I were to critique how he how he
deployed<00:02:32.549> this<00:02:32.760> attack<00:02:33.379> now<00:02:34.379> all<00:02:34.680> three<00:02:35.069> of

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
deployed this attack now all three of

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.940 
deployed this attack now all three of
his<00:02:35.900> dragons<00:02:36.900> are<00:02:37.079> being<00:02:37.379> deployed<00:02:37.650> all

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
his dragons are being deployed all

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.970 
his dragons are being deployed all
together<00:02:38.310> now<00:02:38.959> my<00:02:39.959> air<00:02:40.170> defense<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.739> being

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
together now my air defense is being

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.160 
together now my air defense is being
worked<00:02:41.159> on<00:02:41.459> or<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:42.150> working<00:02:42.569> on<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.750> dragons

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
worked on or is working on the dragons

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.710 
worked on or is working on the dragons
and<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:44.099> only<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.370> two<00:02:44.640> as<00:02:44.879> I<00:02:45.269> pointed<00:02:45.599> out

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
and I only have two as I pointed out

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.930 
and I only have two as I pointed out
earlier<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.769> he<00:02:46.799> did<00:02:47.099> get<00:02:47.310> me<00:02:47.459> at<00:02:47.609> a<00:02:47.640> pretty

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
earlier so he did get me at a pretty

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.940 
earlier so he did get me at a pretty
good<00:02:48.000> time<00:02:48.500> especially<00:02:49.500> if<00:02:49.590> he<00:02:49.680> had<00:02:49.799> all

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
good time especially if he had all

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.979 
good time especially if he had all
dragons<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.640> would<00:02:50.819> have<00:02:50.909> done<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.329> lot<00:02:51.959> of

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
dragons that would have done a lot of

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.270 
dragons that would have done a lot of
work<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.470> my<00:02:53.359> on<00:02:54.359> my<00:02:54.420> base<00:02:54.780> but<00:02:55.680> I'm<00:02:55.799> like<00:02:56.159> I

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
work on my on my base but I'm like I

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.309 
work on my on my base but I'm like I
said<00:02:56.489> he's<00:02:56.670> only<00:02:56.819> going<00:02:57.000> at<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.329> star<00:02:57.599> so<00:02:57.900> he's

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
said he's only going at one star so he's

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.160 
said he's only going at one star so he's
not<00:02:58.470> really<00:02:58.620> getting<00:02:58.889> much<00:02:58.980> out<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.609> and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
not really getting much out of this and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.839 
not really getting much out of this and
you'll<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.319> his<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.620> his<00:03:01.950> last<00:03:02.280> pick<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> diet

his archer Queen and his last golem now
the<00:03:12.989> golems<00:03:13.349> do<00:03:13.560> split<00:03:13.889> up<00:03:14.010> into<00:03:14.220> smaller

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the golems do split up into smaller

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.080 
the golems do split up into smaller
golems<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.480> they<00:03:15.599> are<00:03:15.720> weaker<00:03:16.079> but<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.609> they

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
golems but they are weaker but and they

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.259 
golems but they are weaker but and they
do<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.780> are<00:03:18.930> susceptible<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.650> traps

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
do and they are susceptible the traps

do and they are susceptible the traps
set<00:03:21.269> Chaz<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.900> trampoline<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:23.069> believe<00:03:23.639> it's<00:03:23.819> a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
set Chaz the trampoline I believe it's a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.869 
set Chaz the trampoline I believe it's a

trembling it shoots off units into the
air<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.930> golems<00:03:28.440> actually<00:03:28.709> take<00:03:28.859> forever<00:03:29.160> so

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
air and golems actually take forever so

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.849 
air and golems actually take forever so
I'm<00:03:29.459> speeding<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.940> up<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.930> um<00:03:31.169> this<00:03:31.500> this

what's going on this golem is about to
split<00:03:40.650> into<00:03:40.919> two<00:03:41.129> once<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.519> dies<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.720> you'll

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
split into two once it dies and I you'll

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.800 
split into two once it dies and I you'll
see<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.739> golem<00:03:44.040> actually<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.819> launched

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
see that the golem actually is launched

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.170 
see that the golem actually is launched
by<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.139> trampoline<00:03:46.500> trap<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:48.030> other

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.059 
by this trampoline trap and the other
one<00:03:48.389> actually<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.870> take<00:03:49.019> affair<00:03:49.319> tank<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.919> fair

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
one actually can take affair tank a fair

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.580 
one actually can take affair tank a fair
amount<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.430> damage<00:03:50.730> before<00:03:50.940> dying<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.599> now<00:03:52.440> as
