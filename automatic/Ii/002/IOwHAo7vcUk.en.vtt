that<00:00:43.700> when<00:00:43.940> I<00:00:43.970> taken<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.510> sewing<00:00:44.690> machine

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
that when I taken to the sewing machine

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.140 
that when I taken to the sewing machine
I<00:00:45.290> know<00:00:45.830> which<00:00:46.250> pieces<00:00:46.520> i'm<00:00:46.760> sewing<00:00:46.970> together

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
I know which pieces i'm sewing together

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.220 
I know which pieces i'm sewing together
to<00:00:47.480> recreate<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.170> image<00:00:48.380> i<00:00:48.500> have<00:00:48.680> here<00:00:49.010> and

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
to recreate the image i have here and

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.050 
to recreate the image i have here and
i'm<00:00:51.230> going<00:00:51.560> to<00:00:51.650> sew<00:00:52.040> these<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:53.320> smallest<00:00:54.320> side

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
i'm going to sew these the smallest side

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.490 
i'm going to sew these the smallest side
together<00:00:56.060> first<00:00:56.450> so<00:00:56.720> i'm<00:00:56.870> going<00:00:57.050> to<00:00:57.170> sew<00:00:57.470> these

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
together first so i'm going to sew these

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.180 
together first so i'm going to sew these
blocks<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.820> then<00:00:59.390> these<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.050> then<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:00.980> these

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
blocks and then these and then so these

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.030 
blocks and then these and then so these
two<00:01:01.489> strips<00:01:01.850> together<00:01:02.260> okay<00:01:03.260> because<00:01:03.890> i<00:01:03.950> think

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
two strips together okay because i think

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.360 
two strips together okay because i think
it's<00:01:04.220> easier<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.820> match<00:01:05.030> only<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.020> few<00:01:06.560> fewer

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
it's easier to match only a few fewer

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's easier to match only a few fewer
corners<00:01:08.330> then<00:01:08.600> trying<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.110> match<00:01:09.290> more<00:01:10.280> on<00:01:10.490> the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
corners then trying to match more on the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.610 
corners then trying to match more on the
obvious<00:01:12.050> out<00:01:12.260> this<00:01:12.680> side<00:01:13.090> so<00:01:14.090> take<00:01:14.630> your<00:01:15.170> first

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
obvious out this side so take your first

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.420 
obvious out this side so take your first
piece<00:01:15.979> like<00:01:16.760> this<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.390> put<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.320> facedown<00:01:18.770> on

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
piece like this and put it facedown on

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.219 
piece like this and put it facedown on
your<00:01:19.520> second<00:01:20.120> piece<00:01:20.380> then<00:01:21.380> do<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.710> same<00:01:21.740> again

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
your second piece then do the same again

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.950 
your second piece then do the same again
remove<00:01:24.229> your<00:01:24.640> top<00:01:25.640> piece<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.240> first<00:01:26.510> one<00:01:26.780> on

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
remove your top piece the first one on

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.170 
remove your top piece the first one on
top<00:01:27.560> creating<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.159> small<00:01:28.400> part<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:28.850> keep

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
top creating a small part and just keep

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.899 
top creating a small part and just keep
going<00:01:29.510> like<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:32.440> until<00:01:33.440> at<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.619> end<00:01:33.909> you'll

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
going like that until at the end you'll

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.120 
going like that until at the end you'll
then<00:01:35.180> have<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:36.190> pack<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.780> will<00:01:39.170> be<00:01:39.320> your

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
then have a pack and this will be your

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.750 
then have a pack and this will be your
first<00:01:40.159> line<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.299> do<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.690> same<00:01:41.960> again<00:01:42.380> each<00:01:43.310> row

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
first line so do the same again each row

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.330 
first line so do the same again each row
you<00:01:44.570> will<00:01:44.750> end<00:01:45.049> up<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.470> think<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:45.830> have<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.159> think

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
you will end up I think I have I think

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.109 
you will end up I think I have I think
might<00:01:46.460> eight<00:01:46.700> by<00:01:46.909> ten<00:01:47.210> do<00:01:47.900> you'll<00:01:48.020> end<00:01:48.229> up<00:01:48.380> with

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
might eight by ten do you'll end up with

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.330 
might eight by ten do you'll end up with
ten<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.360> these<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.049> then<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.040> take<00:01:52.250> them

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
ten of these and then you can take them

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.160 
ten of these and then you can take them
to<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.640> machine<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:53.960> each<00:01:54.260> pair<00:01:54.650> together

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
to the machine and so each pair together

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.560 
to the machine and so each pair together
that<00:01:57.170> way<00:01:57.439> they<00:01:57.799> were<00:01:57.860> all<00:01:58.220> staying<00:01:58.549> nicely<00:01:59.270> in

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
that way they were all staying nicely in

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.240 
that way they were all staying nicely in
order<00:02:00.200> okay<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:01.250> that's<00:02:01.610> step<00:02:02.000> one
