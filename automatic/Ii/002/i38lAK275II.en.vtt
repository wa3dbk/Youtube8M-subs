nothing<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.599> do<00:00:09.719> with<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.960> liver<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.590> was<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
nothing to do with the liver this was a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.749 
nothing to do with the liver this was a
term<00:00:11.309> from<00:00:11.700> many<00:00:12.300> years<00:00:13.290> ago<00:00:13.500> where<00:00:14.429> they

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
term from many years ago where they

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
term from many years ago where they
really<00:00:15.179> weren't<00:00:15.360> sure<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:16.619> caused<00:00:16.949> these

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
really weren't sure what caused these

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.300 
really weren't sure what caused these
brown<00:00:17.760> spots<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> skin<00:00:18.930> but<00:00:19.650> now<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:19.949> know

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
brown spots on the skin but now we know

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.370 
brown spots on the skin but now we know
and<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:20.880> caused<00:00:21.210> from<00:00:21.359> sun<00:00:21.750> damage<00:00:21.779> it's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
and they are caused from sun damage it's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.429 
and they are caused from sun damage it's
not<00:00:22.619> maybe<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.400> exposure<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> Sun<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
not maybe one exposure to the Sun but a

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.640 
not maybe one exposure to the Sun but a
cumulative<00:00:25.890> exposure<00:00:26.820> over<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.930> years<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
Sun on the skin and so we tend to see

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.100 
Sun on the skin and so we tend to see
these<00:00:31.650> sunspots<00:00:32.360> mainly<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> tops<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:34.020> the

shins these are areas that have gotten

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.780 
shins these are areas that have gotten
the<00:00:38.940> most<00:00:39.180> Sun<00:00:39.480> over<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> years<00:00:40.700> there<00:00:41.700> are

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the most Sun over the years there are

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
the most Sun over the years there are
many<00:00:42.000> different<00:00:42.329> ways<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.870> use<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.530> treat<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
many different ways we use to treat the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600 
many different ways we use to treat the
sunspots<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.059> most<00:00:45.930> simple<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.980> using

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
sunspots the most simple way is using

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910 
sunspots the most simple way is using
liquid<00:00:47.940> nitrogen<00:00:48.329> liquid<00:00:49.050> nitrogen<00:00:49.559> is

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
liquid nitrogen liquid nitrogen is

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.910 
liquid nitrogen liquid nitrogen is
basically<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.460> very<00:00:50.789> cold<00:00:51.270> air<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.530> apply

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
basically a very cold air that we apply

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
basically a very cold air that we apply
to<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.309> surface<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> skin

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to the surface of the skin

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.200 
to the surface of the skin
and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.170> freezes<00:00:55.620> those<00:00:56.100> cells<00:00:56.489> causing<00:00:57.180> them

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and it freezes those cells causing them

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.599 
and it freezes those cells causing them
to<00:00:57.510> die<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.710> week<00:00:58.890> later<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.430> whole

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to die off and a week later the whole

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.630 
to die off and a week later the whole
spot<00:00:59.940> peels<00:01:00.300> off<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.620> also<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.399> some

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
spot peels off we can also use some

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.719 
spot peels off we can also use some
peels<00:01:03.120> either<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.080> light<00:01:04.530> peel<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.610> the

peels either a light peel all over the
face<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.930> spot<00:01:07.260> treat<00:01:07.290> some<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
face or we can spot treat some of the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160 
face or we can spot treat some of the
brown<00:01:08.130> spots<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.000> heavy<00:01:09.240> peels<00:01:09.689> this

brown spots with some heavy peels this

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.500 
brown spots with some heavy peels this
too<00:01:10.560> will<00:01:10.770> cause<00:01:10.950> an<00:01:11.130> exfoliation<00:01:11.820> depending

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
too will cause an exfoliation depending

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.149 
too will cause an exfoliation depending
on<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> strength<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> peel<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.799> might<00:01:13.979> be

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
on the strength of the peel it might be

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.170 
on the strength of the peel it might be
light<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.640> heavy<00:01:16.009> other<00:01:17.009> methods<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.880> use

light or heavy other methods that we use

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.940 
light or heavy other methods that we use
include<00:01:18.630> lasers<00:01:19.140> such<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.590> photo

this<00:01:23.250> light<00:01:23.700> device<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:25.049> direct<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.890> energy

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
this light device will direct the energy

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.940 
this light device will direct the energy
toward<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> brown<00:01:27.330> spots<00:01:27.810> cause<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
toward the brown spots cause them to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.670 
toward the brown spots cause them to
pull<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.000> surface<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.689> within<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
pull up to the surface and within the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
pull up to the surface and within the
order<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.340> about<00:01:32.460> 5<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.000> 7<00:01:33.360> days<00:01:33.720> those<00:01:34.290> peel

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
order of about 5 or 7 days those peel

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.940 
order of about 5 or 7 days those peel
off<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.100> well<00:01:35.750> finally<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.710> more

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
off as well finally we have a more

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.370 
off as well finally we have a more
advanced<00:01:38.369> laser<00:01:38.670> called<00:01:39.210> Total<00:01:39.689> Effects<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
advanced laser called Total Effects and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.219 
advanced laser called Total Effects and
this<00:01:41.009> helps<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> resurface<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.570> top<00:01:42.930> layers

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
this helps to resurface the top layers

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
this helps to resurface the top layers
of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> skin<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.759> actual<00:01:45.299> peeling

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
of the skin so you do get actual peeling

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.830 
of the skin so you do get actual peeling
of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> top<00:01:46.350> layers<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:46.920> well<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> deeper

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
of the top layers as well as a deeper

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.510 
of the top layers as well as a deeper
benefit<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> wrinkles<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
benefit to the wrinkles and the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.789 
benefit to the wrinkles and the
