00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
usually do is put it into a pond see if

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740 
usually do is put it into a pond see if
you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.369> such<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> both<00:01:24.479> hands

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
you can see like such and both hands

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.890 
you can see like such and both hands
together<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:26.549> way<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.970> solid<00:01:27.330> once<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
together this way it's a solid once it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.050 
together this way it's a solid once it
gets<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.920> body<00:01:29.490> temperature<00:01:29.670> room

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
gets to a body temperature room

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910 
gets to a body temperature room
temperature<00:01:30.119> I'd<00:01:30.630> assume<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.560> start<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
temperature I'd assume actually start to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
temperature I'd assume actually start to
turn<00:01:32.070> into<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> liquid<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.420> it's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
turn into a liquid as you can see it's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.200 
turn into a liquid as you can see it's
change<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.990> texture<00:01:34.350> already<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.909> usually

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
change in texture already and I usually

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.469 
change in texture already and I usually
rub<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> until<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:37.020> almost<00:01:37.799> all<00:01:38.369> liquid<00:01:39.119> but

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
rub it until it's almost all liquid but

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.520 
rub it until it's almost all liquid but
of<00:01:39.570> course<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.810> don't<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> run<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.500> a
