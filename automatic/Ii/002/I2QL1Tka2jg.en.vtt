00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.380

battlefield<00:03:49.830> 3<00:03:50.100> was<00:03:50.280> kind<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.670> litmus<00:03:51.090> test

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
battlefield 3 was kind of a litmus test

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.850 
battlefield 3 was kind of a litmus test
they<00:03:51.600> geared<00:03:51.930> up<00:03:52.050> they've<00:03:52.290> been<00:03:52.440> gearing<00:03:52.710> up

they geared up they've been gearing up

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.160 
they geared up they've been gearing up
for<00:03:53.130> years<00:03:53.370> for<00:03:53.640> battlefield<00:03:54.150> 3<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.600> they

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
for years for battlefield 3 and they

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.510 
for years for battlefield 3 and they
knew<00:03:55.410> what<00:03:55.560> they<00:03:55.590> were<00:03:55.710> doing<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.160> choosing

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520

Battlefield<00:03:59.970> 3<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:01.290> think<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.710> sort<00:04:02.070> of

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
Battlefield 3 and I think it was sort of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.280 
Battlefield 3 and I think it was sort of
a<00:04:02.220> litmus<00:04:02.670> test<00:04:03.000> ea<00:04:03.360> wanted<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.930> see<00:04:04.080> it's<00:04:04.200> like

think<00:06:42.430> in<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.670> comments<00:06:43.030> below<00:06:43.120> again<00:06:43.360> this

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
think in the comments below again this

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.790 
think in the comments below again this
isn't<00:06:43.810> about<00:06:43.990> whether<00:06:44.260> it<00:06:44.500> will<00:06:44.620> actually

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
isn't about whether it will actually

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.410 
isn't about whether it will actually
kill<00:06:45.220> call<00:06:45.520> of<00:06:45.640> duty<00:06:45.880> but<00:06:46.000> I<00:06:46.060> think<00:06:46.300> it's

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420 
kill call of duty but I think it's

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.540 
kill call of duty but I think it's
interesting<00:06:46.630> that<00:06:46.870> EA<00:06:47.170> has<00:06:47.860> the<00:06:48.130> gall<00:06:48.310> to<00:06:48.370> say

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
interesting that EA has the gall to say

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.980
