00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 well that's it everyone's how 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.290
 are you going it's roman and today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 we find ourselves on the techno channel and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.810
 is to discover a little what 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.580
 I use on my mac 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.080
 I know that it interests more than one and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.120
 maybe it will annoy others 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.200
 so if that does not interest you well 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.730
 I invite you to watch others 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.170
 videos I did a lot of others on 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.789
 the chain but today it goes 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.439
 really to be discovering all that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.740
 I use all day long on the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.180
 mac 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.529
 and for that I took into account your 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.910
 comments from the last time you 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 have been several to tell me that the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.480
 camera did not suit you that the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.660
 pack call of duty ghost so today 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.949
 we use the 60d gun in 1080 hd so 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.840
 obviously invites you to put the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.910
 video quality if your connection 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 but you can do it all 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.660
 simply since I know that the 1080 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 hd is often hard for individuals 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.719
 to have but if you have the opportunity 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.290
 I really invite you to put it to 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.290
 the test part 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.460
 first of all we find ourselves on the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.230
 mac with a fairly sober wallpaper 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.740
 since it is simply the logo 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.390
 chain 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.130
 as you can see I have some 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.600
 folders that hang out right but I 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.730
 I'm not really a big fan of 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.440
 let all the folders drag on the 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.760
 office and we will linger so 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.450
 directly to applications that 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.860
 I use 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.700
 we can have for those who do not 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.410
 know a lot I make it a 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.490
 little discover at the same time to have 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.140
 all the apps you can 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.510
 use of course the launchpad where you 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.520
 have them all summarized on pages 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.640
 different it looks a bit like 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.530
 on iphone simply 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.960
 so here I can see several 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.910
 applications like firefox vlc I have it all 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 you present them anyway for 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.520
 the moment we will linger 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.530
 applications that appears on the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.960
 springboard so on the home page 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.430
 first we of course find later 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.869
 the ocz no calendar I you 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.890
 learn nothing brief we go directly 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.930
 to applications 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.640
 I use the smart converter for 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.899
 simply convert files 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.399
 I advise you 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.290
 but I think it's okay 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.660
 click on this one right now 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.920
 that's it's total video converter elites 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.050
 that I advise you it works a lot 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.560
 better than smart converter for those who 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.990
 wish 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.640
 we will say transfer files on 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.920
 mac and use them in bad point not 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.450
 in points for life which is used in opara 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.090
 prior to windows 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.160
 then I have of course skype safari 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.810
 google chrome and firefox so why 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.740
 three browsers and everything 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.940
 simply because I own 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.950
 several youtube accounts and several 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.630
 google accounts to manage and for me it's 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.520
 much simpler than having one go 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.380
 say one account with all the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.300
 accounts on I really prefer to handle 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.800
 separately his accounts there so that's 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.020
 for that I have three browsers 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.580
 then i have itunes of course 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.170
 ibooks that I have not had the opportunity yet 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.330
 to discover it's just a 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.190
 new software since it's about bones 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.840
 x mavericks i'm currently using 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.250
 so this is a new software that will 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.050
 allow you I think to download 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.150
 books if I remember correctly 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.380
 Then I have to imovie and final cut pro 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.599
 I use we will say more 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.740
 especially final cut pro x who 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.940
 walk for me much better pebbles 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.140
 life but it's true that sometimes there are 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.640
 small transitions or small 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.930
 cuts that are more difficult to do 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.760
 with final cut since it's a bit more 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.750
 complicated so for that I use everything 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.819
 simply to imovie 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.220
 then we call a game that serves me well 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.720
 obviously is writing texts by 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.069
 example when I'm traveling or what 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.200
 and that I told you a little about 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.220
 articles what I do I use page 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.690
 the 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.130
 it's the little software that allows me 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.290
 saving screen is 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.100
 screen capture pro it's free if my 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.810
 memories are good 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.330
 but you have just right 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.250
 maquis x video converter pro that I have 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.840
 earns in a previous video 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.130
 so I had saved some codes 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.600
 and I always win on twitter 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.280
 so I invite you obviously to me 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.930
 follow to try to win them you 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.850
 also if you have a mac and you 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.320
 want to use a stupid software 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.120
 video recording 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.430
 then for all that is fitting 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 photo I use well on photoshop and 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.760
 to finish clean up that will allow me 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.410
 in fact to completely delete a 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.790
 application since you have to know that 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.290
 on mac and well they save 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.540
 always a small file in case you 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.190
 wanted to reinstall this software so 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.390
 it's really super convenient 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.970
 to have an application that allows you 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.250
 to completely erase the software that 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.959
 cleanapp and obviously free the 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.930
 most software that hinders you 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.810
 present are free except paige mac 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.430
 x video converter pro and imovie 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.320
 I think we have it in a suite finally 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.550
 I am I am really not for 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.959
 buy the software so I'll get it to you 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.459
 not hide that I cracked them I do not 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.880
 can not explain to you how everything 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.709
 simply 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.080
 but these are not software 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.640
 authentic then it's pretty much 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.080
 everything I use on the mac to 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.300
 day length these are really these 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.830
 software then has it otherwise we will 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.190
 discover other software 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.600
 as rare extra extra wrong free excuse 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.799
 me this software there I do not need to 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.150
 click on it that's why it's 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.880
 not in the main task bar 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.410
 but it's just we'll say in the background 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.260
 since it will simply be 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.250
 to execute rare points then one 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.200
 did she know who's just going 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.460
 allows me to read my files 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.530
 video since I do not like it too much and 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.200
 quicktime it annoys me a little 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.310
 wine butler or ain are two 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.140
 software that I have a little trouble doing 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.790
 walk but normally they will you 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.190
 actually allow to perform 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.660
 pc / mac software including kivu where they go 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.700
 allow you to software a file 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.979
 ex points on a mac so the 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.550
 turn into dmg points since the dmg 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.810
 this is the file used by mac x quartz 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.460
 them I do not even remember what 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.020
 I'm sorry I'm going to fight 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.449
 i will just watch what these x 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.580
 quartz game 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.930
 absolutely not remember if not in 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.180
 Waiting for you to start 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.430
 in the launchpad and we'll see what 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.259
 I have at first sight at first sight 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.180
 at htc sync manager simply 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.029
 because I own a htc phone 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.449
 etc to transfer we'll say all 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:19.889
 files to explore these for ipod i 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.180
 believe it is to manage files on 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.589
 will say a little more simply than about 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.319
 itunes because itunes is still 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.969
 closed enough we have adobe bridge chelsea this 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.589
 which I absolutely do not use but seen 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.870
 I installed Adobe Photoshop has 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.969
 also installed automatically 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.520
 then I have garageband that I use 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.469
 never fault at the end facetime messages 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.089
 contacts finally really where all he 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.490
 there is more banal on a mac 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.990
 we have the dashboard also I think 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.150
 that he was part of it before yes yes 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.469
 of course he was part of it before I 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.509
 thought it was that it was another 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.789
 another software that had appeared with 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.349
 the following bone x mavericks so here is so 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.490
 secular square I do not remember at all 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.740
 I think it's a trick to debug 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.330
 some files finally brief I'll you to 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.710
 almost all presented I hope it 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.240
 you will have been pleased to discover a 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.310
 little what I use to length of 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.509
 day on this do not hesitate to share 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.669
 the video if you wish to do 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.779
 discover maybe os x mavericks but 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.639
 frankly there is nothing new that 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:13.830
 would change to d the notifications it's 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.659
 always about the same we are hungry 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.259
 for me I really saw no big 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.669
 change 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.379
 I invite you to go and find others
