00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.729
 hello youtube friends in this video les 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.280
 I will talk about how to release the 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.759
 internal storage of a cell phone or 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.759
 smartphone 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.700
 currently all cell phones or 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.340
 smartphone come with a memory 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.170
 internal a memory that is inside the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.020
 cellular and is out of what we 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.480
 we call external storage using 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.970
 rote memory stick against those 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.890
 small memories this storage 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.800
 internal generally has a capacity 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.680
 of 4 gigas 2 gigs depending on the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.220
 model and product range or smartphone 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.750
 that we are acquiring or that we use 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.760
 many times this internal memory is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 full due to applications that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 we install configurations that we do 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.769
 inside the cell phone etcetera is why 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.210
 that it is necessary to free it and speaking 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.280
 particularly of the case of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.260
 cell phones that work under the system 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.540
 operative android in any of its 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.820
 versions I discovered that the way 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.760
 easier to clean or release this 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.490
 memory is accessed through some 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.540
 explorer 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.680
 in the folder called the points 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.380
 as it is showing up in this 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.119
 moment that is a folder inside the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.399
 internal storage of our 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.860
 cellular and the only thing we have to do 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.140
 is to delete all the files that are 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.890
 find inside that folder since 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.420
 they are backup copies like some 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.310
 cows are backups of what we're going 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.990
 changing or we are installing in our 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.340
 cellular if we erase that usually 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.960
 They are 2 gigs 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.869
 adding up all the size of the files or 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.509
 2 gigas and a half is enough we will have 2 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.670
 gigas or maybe more free space than 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.399
 we have cleaned by simple 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.409
 process of deleting those files as 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.570
 I repeat that they are inside the folder 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.120
 the points 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.920
 it's pretty simple I hope you 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.659
 animes to try this advice since the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.970
 Easiest way to have extra space 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.009
 in memory or internal storage 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.700
 of our cell phone that is usually 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.280
 pretty limited 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.010
