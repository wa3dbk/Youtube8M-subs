00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
but then when you go to play it'll just

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.660 
but then when you go to play it'll just
show<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.560> white<00:01:07.770> screen<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> Xbox

so<00:02:11.489> let's<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.300> look<00:02:12.989> up<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.470> old<00:02:13.800> keys<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:14.970> we

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so let's just look up the old keys so we

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.860 
so let's just look up the old keys so we
have<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.870> took<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> couple<00:02:16.530> dumps<00:02:17.069> when<00:02:17.819> we<00:02:18.450> did

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
have I took a couple dumps when we did

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.229 
have I took a couple dumps when we did
only<00:02:19.290> dumped<00:02:19.769> out<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> keys<00:02:20.160> from<00:02:20.519> using<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
only dumped out the keys from using the

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.660 
only dumped out the keys from using the
security<00:02:21.569> probe<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:22.950> there<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.489> your

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
security probe so in there you have your

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.850 
security probe so in there you have your
dummy<00:02:23.879> files<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.510> identify<00:02:24.959> identify<00:02:25.200> files

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
dummy files your identify identify files

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.699 
dummy files your identify identify files
and<00:02:26.190> query<00:02:26.430> key<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.760> serial<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.380> we'll<00:02:28.530> do

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
and query key in serial so what we'll do

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.559 
and query key in serial so what we'll do
is<00:02:28.920> we'll<00:02:29.099> blow<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:29.819> jumble<00:02:30.209> flasher<00:02:34.160> and

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
is we'll blow it up jumble flasher and

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.170 
is we'll blow it up jumble flasher and
we'll<00:02:36.569> pull<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.380> file<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:37.890> key<00:02:38.640> file<00:02:41.180> if

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
we'll pull in that file that key file if

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.370 
we'll pull in that file that key file if
you've<00:02:42.330> never<00:02:42.450> done<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.690> before<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.200> kind

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
you've never done this before it's kind

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.930 
you've never done this before it's kind
of<00:02:43.500> took<00:02:44.010> me<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> while<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.340> figure<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.819> out

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
of took me a while to figure it out

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.850 
of took me a while to figure it out
because<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:46.200> process<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> little<00:02:46.680> bit

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
because the process a little bit

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.620 
because the process a little bit
different<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:47.519> when<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.790> flashed<00:02:48.120> when<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
different then when you flashed when you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.500 
different then when you flashed when you
flash<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.319> I'm<00:02:50.010> gonna<00:02:50.220> open<00:02:50.340> up<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:53.510> source

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
flash it so I'm gonna open up the source

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.559 
flash it so I'm gonna open up the source
file<00:02:54.930> with<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.069> dummy<00:02:56.370> dump<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.790> from<00:02:57.090> my<00:02:57.269> dump

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
file with the dummy dump in from my dump

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.620 
file with the dummy dump in from my dump
and<00:02:58.079> you'll<00:02:58.680> see<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> DVD<00:02:59.310> key<00:02:59.640> will<00:02:59.910> come<00:03:00.450> up

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
and you'll see the DVD key will come up

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.120 
and you'll see the DVD key will come up
there<00:03:01.910> then<00:03:02.910> we'll<00:03:03.120> open<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.540> target

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
there then we'll open the target

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.539 
there then we'll open the target
firmware<00:03:05.130> will<00:03:05.549> pull<00:03:05.849> open<00:03:06.120> up<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:10.069> BL<00:03:11.069> t<00:03:11.250> +

you see the erase line so let's click
yes

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.380 

let's<00:04:15.410> guess<00:04:15.830> okay<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.700> sending<00:04:17.150> light<00:04:17.269> on

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
let's guess okay and sending light on

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.670 
let's guess okay and sending light on
race<00:04:17.630> all<00:04:18.140> right

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
race all right

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.350 
race all right
then<00:04:19.280> power<00:04:19.670> off<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.120> on<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:22.220> then<00:04:23.150> we've<00:04:23.240> got

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
then power off and on and then we've got

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.320 
then power off and on and then we've got
a<00:04:23.420> set<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.690> 72<00:04:24.260> so<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:25.460> just<00:04:25.640> confirming<00:04:26.300> that

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
a set of 72 so this just confirming that

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.960 
a set of 72 so this just confirming that
flash<00:04:26.750> chip<00:04:27.020> properties<00:04:27.500> type<00:04:28.130> is<00:04:28.400> pseudo

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
flash chip properties type is pseudo

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.950 
flash chip properties type is pseudo
flash<00:04:29.300> with<00:04:29.600> status<00:04:29.990> 0<00:04:30.620> X<00:04:30.830> 72<00:04:31.250> that's<00:04:32.210> good<00:04:32.600> all
