00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.560
 in this video we are going to draw a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.050
 rectangle equivalent to this triangle 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.139
 for this we are going to base on that the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.179
 area of ​​a rectangle is the base for the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.869
 height while the area of ​​a 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.220
 triangle would be the base by height 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.980
 match for 2 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.100
 The first thing we will do is trace the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.010
 height of this triangle 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.160
 with the help of square and bevel 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.750
 we will trace that height 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.910
 and let's say it in half for it 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.150
 let's trace the half-thirds of the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.150
 height 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.310
 we need a measure higher than 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.150
 half 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.150
 the arches 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.710
 we're 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.829
 we would have 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.829
 the arcs to trace the middle trees 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.270
 well we have divided the height in the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.600
 half 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.420
 personally we have left 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.960
 draw two perpendicular to the base by 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.960
 the extremes 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.789
 and this would be 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.420
 our light and has better marked our 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.100
 rectangle with an area equivalent to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.560
 area of ​​the triangle that they gave us to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.340
 beginning 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.939
 you set this triangle that we have here 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.299
 would be equivalent to this and this one that is 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.460
 here would be equivalent to this so 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.200
 that we have reserved a part of the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.270
 triangle and it's as if this one what 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.649
 we would have rotated here and it's here 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.069
 this would be the rectangle of the solution 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.829
 the rectangle that has an area 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.260
 equal to the triangle that they gave us to 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.659
 principle and we have based simply 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.359
 in which the area of ​​a rectangle is 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.159
 base for opening while several of 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.499
 a triangle at the base by height 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.719
 split by two so we've 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:30.980
 divided in height by half and 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.980
 we have preserved the base 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.640
 this is all he asked be useful us 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.640
 we see in the following video
