that<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.629> very<00:00:06.899> last<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.519> material

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
that is the very last of the material

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.589 
that is the very last of the material
from<00:00:10.139> my<00:00:11.330> worm

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
from my worm

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.200 
from my worm
Rimmer<00:00:13.530> composting<00:00:14.160> system<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:15.000> is

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
Rimmer composting system this is

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.790 
Rimmer composting system this is
actually<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> last<00:00:15.960> video<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.410> I'll<00:00:16.710> be

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
actually the last video that I'll be

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.880 
actually the last video that I'll be
creating<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.260> overfeeding<00:00:19.260> challenge

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
creating in this overfeeding challenge

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.519 
creating in this overfeeding challenge
video<00:00:20.279> series<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.660> reason<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
video series and the reason for that is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.140 
video series and the reason for that is
that<00:00:22.560> I've<00:00:22.740> actually<00:00:22.920> taken<00:00:23.250> down<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> system

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
that I've actually taken down the system

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.500 
that I've actually taken down the system
and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:25.189> just<00:00:26.189> sort<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.400> been<00:00:26.490> having<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.880> look<00:00:27.060> at

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and I just sort of been having a look at

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.380 
and I just sort of been having a look at
what's<00:00:27.750> been<00:00:27.869> going<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.380> inside<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.340> big<00:00:30.150> part

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
what's been going on inside a big part

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
what's been going on inside a big part
of<00:00:30.449> why<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> stopped<00:00:31.170> using<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.340> Worman<00:00:32.669> for

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
of why I stopped using the Worman for

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700 
of why I stopped using the Worman for
now<00:00:33.120> I'm<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.989> setting<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.380> back<00:00:34.530> up

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
now I'm going to be setting it back up

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010 
now I'm going to be setting it back up
in<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> fall<00:00:35.180> but<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.239> took<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.660> down<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:36.960> an

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
in the fall but I took it down for an

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
in the fall but I took it down for an
hour<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:38.010> focusing<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.879> lot

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
hour just because I'm focusing a lot

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.930 
hour just because I'm focusing a lot
more<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.440> my<00:00:40.440> outdoor<00:00:40.829> activities<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
more on my outdoor activities and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.200 
more on my outdoor activities and
outdoor<00:00:42.570> worm<00:00:42.840> bins<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.489> don't<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:44.879> want

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
outdoor worm bins so I don't really want

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.440 
outdoor worm bins so I don't really want
to<00:00:45.329> take<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> time<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:47.340> take<00:00:47.940> care<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
to take the time to to take care of the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.860 
to take the time to to take care of the
system<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:50.010> basement<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.750> also<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
system in my basement and also the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
system in my basement and also the
amount<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.170> waste<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.710> I've<00:00:52.890> been<00:00:53.010> putting

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
amount of waste that I've been putting

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.610 
amount of waste that I've been putting
into<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> warm<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.090> would<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.960> better<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
into the warm and would be better put to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.400 
into the warm and would be better put to
use<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.789> my<00:00:56.910> other<00:00:57.000> systems<00:00:57.690> so

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
use and some of my other systems so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
use and some of my other systems so
that's<00:00:58.590> sort<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.850> sort<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.359> I'm

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that's sort of not sort of what I'm

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
that's sort of not sort of what I'm
doing<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> course<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.620> did<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> see

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
doing but of course I did want to see

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.170 
doing but of course I did want to see
what<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.910> inside<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.719> Worman<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
what was going on inside the Worman and

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.140 
what was going on inside the Worman and
also<00:01:06.180> wanted<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.229> sense<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:08.150> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
also wanted to get some sense of the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.929 
also wanted to get some sense of the
abundance<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> worms<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.460> ended<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.880> with

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
abundance of worms that we ended up with

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.450 
abundance of worms that we ended up with
now<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> exactly<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
now that is exactly what we have in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.929 
now that is exactly what we have in
front<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.850> us<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:16.280> essentially<00:01:17.280> for

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
front of us here this is essentially for

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.749 
front of us here this is essentially for
the<00:01:18.060> most<00:01:18.270> part<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.720> worm<00:01:18.960> population

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
the most part the worm population

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.899 
the most part the worm population
concentrated<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> point<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.070> occupy

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
concentrated down to the point of occupy

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.789 
concentrated down to the point of occupy
on<00:01:24.259> essentially<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:26.630> portion<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
on essentially that portion of this this

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.899 
on essentially that portion of this this
sort<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> trail<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.590> gonna

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
sort of trail here so I'm just gonna

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.190 
sort of trail here so I'm just gonna
continue<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:34.700> move<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.150> material<00:01:36.869> slowly

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
continue to move this material slowly

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
continue to move this material slowly
away<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:38.850> anything<00:01:39.090> fancy

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
away I'm not going to do anything fancy

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.230 
away I'm not going to do anything fancy
you're<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> weigh<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.500> worms<00:01:40.710> or

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
you're not going to weigh the worms or

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.910 
you're not going to weigh the worms or
certainly<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> count<00:01:42.869> them<00:01:43.200> it's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
certainly not going to count them it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.319 
certainly not going to count them it's
already<00:01:44.220> taken<00:01:44.579> quite<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.149> time<00:01:45.299> just

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
already taken quite a bit of time just

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.560 
already taken quite a bit of time just
to<00:01:45.750> concentrate<00:01:46.140> them<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.390> want

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
to concentrate them down but I just want

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
to concentrate them down but I just want
to<00:01:48.659> give<00:01:48.810> people<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.200> sense<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.829> we've

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
to give people a sense of what we've

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.770 
to give people a sense of what we've
been<00:01:50.430> left<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.090> thing<00:01:51.450> you'll<00:01:51.659> notice

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
been left it now one thing you'll notice

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.410 
been left it now one thing you'll notice
not<00:01:52.740> only<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.189> concentrating<00:01:53.610> worms<00:01:54.119> but

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
not only are we concentrating worms but

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
not only are we concentrating worms but
there<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:55.110> was<00:01:55.860> quite<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> bit<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
there are what was quite a bit of a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
there are what was quite a bit of a
spring<00:01:56.759> tail<00:01:57.000> population<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
spring tail population in this in this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.490 
spring tail population in this in this
warm<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.270> they'll<00:02:01.110> appear

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
warm in and you can see they'll appear

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.910 
warm in and you can see they'll appear
like<00:02:01.680> white<00:02:02.009> flecks<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.390> video<00:02:03.740> but<00:02:04.740> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
like white flecks in the video but this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520 
like white flecks in the video but this
there's<00:02:05.369> quite<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> springtails<00:02:06.600> being

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
there's quite a lot of springtails being

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.180 
there's quite a lot of springtails being
concentrated<00:02:08.300> here<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.450> well

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
concentrated here as well

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.530 
concentrated here as well
and<00:02:12.190> one<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.550> things<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.180> stood

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and one of the things that really stood

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.280 
and one of the things that really stood
out<00:02:13.599> for<00:02:14.730> me<00:02:15.730> when<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.030> when<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.569> was<00:02:16.840> starting<00:02:17.230> to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
out for me when I when I was starting to

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.150 
out for me when I when I was starting to
take<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.640> materials<00:02:19.209> out<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.660> Worman<00:02:20.160> for

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
take the materials out of the Worman for

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.130 
take the materials out of the Worman for
starters<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.819> was<00:02:22.030> amazed<00:02:22.390> at<00:02:22.569> how<00:02:22.599> well

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
starters I was amazed at how well

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.199 
starters I was amazed at how well
processed<00:02:23.769> everything<00:02:24.069> was<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.550> was<00:02:24.730> expecting

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
processed everything was I was expecting

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.540 
processed everything was I was expecting
to<00:02:25.239> find<00:02:26.010> everything<00:02:27.010> down<00:02:27.160> at<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> bottom

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
to find everything down at the bottom

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.960 
to find everything down at the bottom
pretty<00:02:28.390> nice<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.750> processed<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:30.190> as<00:02:30.670> it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
pretty nice the processed but as it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.910 
pretty nice the processed but as it
turned<00:02:31.150> out<00:02:31.300> much<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:31.989> what<00:02:32.410> was<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.769> the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
turned out much of what was in the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.240 
turned out much of what was in the
system<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.459> general<00:02:33.810> was<00:02:34.890> very<00:02:35.890> well

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
system in general was very well

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.820 
system in general was very well
processed<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.840> what<00:02:37.989> was<00:02:38.170> interesting<00:02:38.349> is

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
processed and what was interesting is

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.559 
processed and what was interesting is
that<00:02:38.860> around<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.430> outer<00:02:39.580> edges<00:02:39.819> of<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
that around the outer edges of the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.509 
that around the outer edges of the
Worman<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:43.090> was<00:02:43.330> somewhat<00:02:44.290> drier<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.040> I

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
Worman it was somewhat drier and I

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.520 
Worman it was somewhat drier and I
noticed<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:45.970> there<00:02:46.090> was<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.480> fair<00:02:47.230> amount<00:02:47.319> of

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
noticed that there was a fair amount of

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.800 
noticed that there was a fair amount of
material<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:48.430> hadn't<00:02:49.150> been<00:02:49.209> broken<00:02:49.420> down

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
material that hadn't been broken down

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.880 
material that hadn't been broken down
nearly<00:02:50.170> as<00:02:50.410> much<00:02:52.260> essentially<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.410> central

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
nearly as much essentially the central

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.440 
nearly as much essentially the central
core<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.989> system<00:02:56.579> so<00:02:57.579> I<00:02:57.610> thought<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.209> was

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
core of the system so I thought that was

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.470 
core of the system so I thought that was
rather<00:02:58.660> interesting<00:02:59.519> and<00:03:00.519> something<00:03:01.150> else

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
rather interesting and something else

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.309 
rather interesting and something else
that<00:03:01.840> really<00:03:02.769> stood<00:03:03.099> out<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.610> material

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
that really stood out in the material

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.850 
that really stood out in the material
was<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.470> abundance<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.430> worm<00:03:10.090> cocoons

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
was the abundance of worm cocoons

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.210 
was the abundance of worm cocoons
there's<00:03:11.860> an<00:03:11.980> absolutely<00:03:12.760> incredible<00:03:14.220> number

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
there's an absolutely incredible number

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.670 
there's an absolutely incredible number
of<00:03:16.170> cocoons<00:03:17.170> in<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.859> material<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.989> start<00:03:20.500> to

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
of cocoons in this material and start to

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.349 
of cocoons in this material and start to
see<00:03:20.859> some<00:03:21.100> of<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.280> worms<00:03:21.549> I'm<00:03:21.910> getting<00:03:22.180> down

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
see some of the worms I'm getting down

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:28.530 
see some of the worms I'm getting down
to<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.720> there<00:03:25.889> so<00:03:26.889> it<00:03:27.160> certainly<00:03:28.000> turned<00:03:28.359> out

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
to you there so it certainly turned out

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.420 
to you there so it certainly turned out
to<00:03:28.660> be<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.810> pretty<00:03:29.680> productive<00:03:29.950> system<00:03:30.910> I

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
to be a pretty productive system I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.390 
to be a pretty productive system I
originally<00:03:33.430> when<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.819> started<00:03:34.299> up<00:03:35.400> this

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
originally when I started up this

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.870 
originally when I started up this
particular<00:03:36.910> worm<00:03:37.420> on<00:03:37.660> all<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.620> did<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.250> stock<00:03:39.639> it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
particular worm on all I did to stock it

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.360 
particular worm on all I did to stock it
was<00:03:40.150> add<00:03:40.530> essentially<00:03:41.530> material<00:03:42.040> they<00:03:42.160> looked

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
was add essentially material they looked

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.990 
was add essentially material they looked
like<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.620> had<00:03:44.829> some<00:03:45.519> smaller

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
like this that that had some smaller

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.900 
like this that that had some smaller
worms<00:03:46.359> in<00:03:46.569> it<00:03:46.720> not<00:03:46.870> very<00:03:47.049> many<00:03:47.700> some<00:03:48.700> worm

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
worms in it not very many some worm

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.000 
worms in it not very many some worm
cocoons<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.440> didn't<00:03:50.829> add<00:03:50.980> any

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
cocoons in it but I didn't add any

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.150 
cocoons in it but I didn't add any
specific<00:03:51.910> quantity<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:52.959> worms<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.440> was<00:03:53.920> sort<00:03:54.130> of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
specific quantity of worms I was sort of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.610 
specific quantity of worms I was sort of
curious<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.549> see<00:03:54.959> how<00:03:55.959> well<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.380> population

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
curious to see how well the population

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.569 
curious to see how well the population
would<00:03:57.220> develop<00:03:57.489> on<00:03:57.790> its<00:03:57.970> own<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.590> it

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
would develop on its own and it

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.059 
would develop on its own and it
certainly<00:04:01.170> certainly<00:04:02.170> did<00:04:02.380> develop<00:04:02.680> quite

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
certainly certainly did develop quite

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.039 
certainly certainly did develop quite
nicely<00:04:05.790> yeah<00:04:06.790> so<00:04:07.060> we're<00:04:07.180> getting<00:04:07.329> down<00:04:07.599> here

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
nicely yeah so we're getting down here

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.170 
nicely yeah so we're getting down here
if<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:08.980> push<00:04:09.220> on<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:09.760> don't<00:04:09.940> want<00:04:10.090> to

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
if you push on that I don't want to

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.770 
if you push on that I don't want to
stress<00:04:10.480> them<00:04:10.690> out<00:04:10.810> too<00:04:10.930> much<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.169> don't<00:04:11.230> want<00:04:11.500> to

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
stress them out too much I don't want to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.710 
stress them out too much I don't want to
fiddle<00:04:13.780> around<00:04:13.959> with<00:04:14.260> them<00:04:14.380> too<00:04:14.410> too<00:04:14.889> much<00:04:15.720> but

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
fiddle around with them too too much but

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.140 
fiddle around with them too too much but
really<00:04:17.650> what<00:04:18.039> it<00:04:18.130> comes<00:04:18.220> down<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.519> is<00:04:18.729> just

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
really what it comes down to is just

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.120 
really what it comes down to is just
giving<00:04:19.780> people<00:04:19.959> an<00:04:20.440> idea

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
giving people an idea

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.879 
giving people an idea
of<00:04:25.889> the<00:04:26.889> quantities<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:28.870> warmth<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.620> were

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
of the quantities of warmth that were

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.120 
of the quantities of warmth that were
left<00:04:30.190> in<00:04:30.340> this<00:04:30.460> system<00:04:31.680> obviously<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:32.979> in

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
left in this system obviously this is in

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.340 
left in this system obviously this is in
every<00:04:33.460> single<00:04:33.669> warm<00:04:34.120> some<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.229> other

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
every single warm some of the other

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.080 
every single warm some of the other
material<00:04:35.949> that<00:04:36.070> I've<00:04:36.190> separated<00:04:36.400> off<00:04:36.850> had

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
material that I've separated off had

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.250 
material that I've separated off had
warms<00:04:37.389> in<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.660> but<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:38.050> did<00:04:38.949> my<00:04:39.100> best<00:04:39.310> to

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
warms in it but I did my best to

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.850 
warms in it but I did my best to
concentrate<00:04:41.260> them<00:04:41.410> as<00:04:42.190> quickly<00:04:42.490> as<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:42.880> could

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
concentrate them as quickly as I could

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.710 
concentrate them as quickly as I could
still<00:04:45.870> still<00:04:46.870> be<00:04:46.990> left<00:04:47.229> with<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:48.449> pretty<00:04:49.449> good

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
still still be left with a pretty good

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.540 
still still be left with a pretty good
estimate<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:51.870> what<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.020> total<00:04:54.180> quantity<00:04:55.180> was

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
estimate of what the total quantity was

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.770 
estimate of what the total quantity was
you<00:04:57.550> know<00:04:57.639> is<00:04:57.760> tell<00:04:58.330> when<00:04:58.540> you're<00:04:58.660> getting

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
you know is tell when you're getting

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.460 
you know is tell when you're getting
down<00:04:59.110> close<00:04:59.470> to<00:05:00.310> pure<00:05:00.729> worms<00:05:01.060> if<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.020> push<00:05:02.290> it

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
down close to pure worms if you push it

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.210 
down close to pure worms if you push it
it<00:05:02.910> sort<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:03.940> bounces<00:05:04.419> back<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.040> can<00:05:06.190> see

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
it sort of bounces back and you can see

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.879 
it sort of bounces back and you can see
a<00:05:06.370> bit<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:06.700> movement<00:05:06.910> down<00:05:07.300> that<00:05:07.540> so<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:08.650> is

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
a bit of movement down that so this is

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:18.270 
a bit of movement down that so this is
you<00:05:09.850> can<00:05:10.000> see<00:05:10.240> here<00:05:12.450> santuary<00:05:17.039> we're<00:05:18.039> getting

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
you can see here santuary we're getting

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.870 
you can see here santuary we're getting
down<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.760> point<00:05:19.000> where<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:22.690> this<00:05:22.870> is<00:05:23.880> pure

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
down to the point where and this is pure

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.820 
down to the point where and this is pure
warming<00:05:25.660> essentially<00:05:26.350> so<00:05:27.160> there's<00:05:28.350> is<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.410> good

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
warming essentially so there's is a good

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.690 
warming essentially so there's is a good
gob<00:05:30.400> of<00:05:30.430> worms<00:05:31.770> in<00:05:32.770> right<00:05:32.979> hand<00:05:33.220> right<00:05:33.460> there

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
gob of worms in right hand right there

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.900 
gob of worms in right hand right there
and<00:05:34.600> that<00:05:34.840> is<00:05:35.080> just<00:05:35.410> from<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.610> one<00:05:36.669> little

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
and that is just from this one little

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.260 
and that is just from this one little
corner<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:38.220> this<00:05:39.220> entire<00:05:39.639> thumb<00:05:40.000> so

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
corner of this entire thumb so

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.529 
corner of this entire thumb so
essentially<00:05:40.930> it's<00:05:43.229> same<00:05:44.229> sort<00:05:44.590> of<00:05:44.650> idea<00:05:45.539> all

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
essentially it's same sort of idea all

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:52.440 
essentially it's same sort of idea all
the<00:05:46.720> way<00:05:46.870> across<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:49.690> can<00:05:49.750> just<00:05:50.050> see<00:05:51.450> the

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
the way across you can just see the

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.000 
the way across you can just see the
quantity<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:53.020> worms<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.560> are<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.860> then

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
quantity of worms that are and then

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.000 
quantity of worms that are and then
these<00:05:54.190> aren't<00:05:54.520> huge<00:05:54.880> worms<00:05:55.150> by<00:05:55.450> any<00:05:55.660> means<00:05:56.010> so

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
these aren't huge worms by any means so

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.960 
these aren't huge worms by any means so
I<00:05:57.070> can<00:05:57.220> only<00:05:57.370> imagine<00:05:57.700> how<00:05:59.520> many<00:06:00.520> are<00:06:00.729> in<00:06:00.880> the

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
I can only imagine how many are in the

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.500 
I can only imagine how many are in the
air<00:06:01.090> would<00:06:01.210> be<00:06:01.360> thousands<00:06:01.960> for<00:06:02.830> sure<00:06:06.450> this<00:06:07.450> is

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
air would be thousands for sure this is

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:24.860 
air would be thousands for sure this is
another<00:06:08.380> gob

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.110 

similar<00:06:26.460> appearance<00:06:27.460> all<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.669> way<00:06:27.790> across<00:06:28.000> it

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
similar appearance all the way across it

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.170 
similar appearance all the way across it
seemed<00:06:29.020> to<00:06:29.110> be<00:06:29.199> constituted<00:06:29.770> a<00:06:30.130> lot<00:06:30.790> at<00:06:31.060> the

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
seemed to be constituted a lot at the

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.659 
seemed to be constituted a lot at the
back<00:06:31.389> there

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
back there

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:39.270 
back there
but<00:06:33.669> there's<00:06:34.540> another<00:06:34.810> or<00:06:35.050> they<00:06:35.139> did<00:06:35.320> gob<00:06:38.280> you

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
but there's another or they did gob you

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.770 
but there's another or they did gob you
can<00:06:39.400> see<00:06:39.669> this<00:06:40.540> is<00:06:40.780> just<00:06:41.110> absolutely<00:06:42.780> loaded

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
can see this is just absolutely loaded

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.830 
can see this is just absolutely loaded
with<00:06:44.110> worms<00:06:44.320> and<00:06:44.530> when<00:06:45.010> I<00:06:45.039> first<00:06:45.660> dumped<00:06:46.660> out

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
with worms and when I first dumped out

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.159 
with worms and when I first dumped out
the<00:06:46.900> contents<00:06:47.650> of<00:06:47.740> the<00:06:47.889> Worman<00:06:48.250> I<00:06:49.169> noticed

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
the contents of the Worman I noticed

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.879 
the contents of the Worman I noticed
that<00:06:50.320> there<00:06:50.740> was<00:06:50.830> a<00:06:50.889> lot<00:06:51.250> of<00:06:51.430> worms<00:06:52.110> but<00:06:53.110> it's

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 
that there was a lot of worms but it's

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.270 
that there was a lot of worms but it's
really<00:06:54.130> interesting<00:06:54.340> to<00:06:54.669> see<00:06:54.850> them

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
really interesting to see them

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.640 
really interesting to see them
concentrated<00:06:57.280> down<00:06:57.490> to<00:06:58.060> this

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
concentrated down to this

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.290 
concentrated down to this
the<00:06:59.650> to<00:06:59.889> this<00:07:00.070> point<00:07:01.620> so<00:07:02.620> yeah<00:07:02.860> that<00:07:03.520> is<00:07:03.550> is

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
the to this point so yeah that is is

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.570 
the to this point so yeah that is is
quite<00:07:04.780> a<00:07:04.810> substantial<00:07:05.160> quantity<00:07:06.160> of<00:07:06.340> red

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
quite a substantial quantity of red

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:13.320 
quite a substantial quantity of red
worms<00:07:07.949> and<00:07:09.240> the<00:07:10.240> air<00:07:10.389> I'm<00:07:10.870> going<00:07:11.169> to<00:07:11.320> be<00:07:12.330> taking

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
worms and the air I'm going to be taking

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.050 
worms and the air I'm going to be taking
and<00:07:13.510> stocked<00:07:13.840> into<00:07:14.200> another<00:07:14.470> system<00:07:14.919> not<00:07:15.460> 100%

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
and stocked into another system not 100%

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.480 
and stocked into another system not 100%
sure<00:07:16.090> where<00:07:16.360> I'm<00:07:16.450> going<00:07:16.479> to<00:07:16.630> stock<00:07:16.840> them<00:07:17.050> it<00:07:17.139> up

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
sure where I'm going to stock them it up

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.610 
sure where I'm going to stock them it up
probably<00:07:18.490> one<00:07:18.610> of<00:07:18.639> my<00:07:18.849> outdoor<00:07:19.289> outdoor<00:07:20.289> beds

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
probably one of my outdoor outdoor beds

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.850 
probably one of my outdoor outdoor beds
so<00:07:21.580> they<00:07:21.820> will<00:07:22.000> certainly<00:07:22.870> do<00:07:23.229> just<00:07:23.590> fine

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
so they will certainly do just fine

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.480 
so they will certainly do just fine
again<00:07:24.700> I<00:07:25.150> will<00:07:25.419> be<00:07:25.650> planning<00:07:26.650> to<00:07:26.830> set<00:07:27.220> up<00:07:27.340> my

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
again I will be planning to set up my

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.260 
again I will be planning to set up my
warm<00:07:27.789> and<00:07:28.060> once<00:07:28.330> again<00:07:28.740> once<00:07:29.740> we<00:07:29.919> get<00:07:30.099> a<00:07:30.310> little

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
warm and once again once we get a little

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.409 
warm and once again once we get a little
bit<00:07:31.389> closer<00:07:31.599> to<00:07:31.930> the<00:07:32.050> fall<00:07:32.289> and<00:07:32.880> we'll<00:07:33.880> get

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:34.419 
bit closer to the fall and we'll get

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.710 
bit closer to the fall and we'll get
back<00:07:34.660> into<00:07:35.610> worm<00:07:36.610> and<00:07:36.849> vermicompost<00:07:37.330> and

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:37.720 
back into worm and vermicompost and

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.810 
back into worm and vermicompost and
action<00:07:38.110> again<00:07:38.349> I<00:07:38.530> was<00:07:39.070> pretty<00:07:39.310> pleased<00:07:39.639> with

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:39.820 
action again I was pretty pleased with

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.719 
action again I was pretty pleased with
the<00:07:40.000> way<00:07:40.120> that<00:07:40.360> my<00:07:40.840> test<00:07:41.289> turned<00:07:41.710> out<00:07:41.949> this
