00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
go ahead and get started so let's say I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.990 
go ahead and get started so let's say I
have<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:36.110> structure<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.350> TNT<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:38.879> just

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
have a structure of TNT so I'm just

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.160 
have a structure of TNT so I'm just
going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> go<00:00:39.329> ahead<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.750> build<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
going to go ahead and just build a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.950 
going to go ahead and just build a
random<00:00:40.530> structure<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.340> TNT<00:00:42.000> ok<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.870> like

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
random structure of TNT ok just like

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.709 
random structure of TNT ok just like
that<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> branded<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> TNT<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.510> made

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that so I branded a TNT and I just made

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.590 
that so I branded a TNT and I just made
my<00:00:45.899> random<00:00:46.559> TNT<00:00:47.010> structure<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:48.329> looks<00:00:48.480> pretty

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
my random TNT structure it looks pretty

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.319 
my random TNT structure it looks pretty
cool<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.200> let's<00:00:49.440> say<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.039> don't<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.940> where<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
cool so let's say I don't like where it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.689 
cool so let's say I don't like where it
is<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.770> want<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> move<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> around<00:00:53.250> because

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
is and I want to move it around because

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
is and I want to move it around because
I<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.480> where<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> just

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
I just don't like where it is so I just

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 
I just don't like where it is so I just
take<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.460> portable<00:00:57.300> structure<00:00:57.750> block

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
take out my portable structure block

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
take out my portable structure block
which<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.590> blocky<00:00:59.070> craft<00:00:59.430> i<00:00:59.670> also<00:01:00.180> just

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
forgot to show you how to make the block

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.609 
forgot to show you how to make the block
so<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.019> you're<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> need

one diamond and then you'll be able to
make<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.229> portable<00:01:10.830> structure<00:01:11.159> block<00:01:11.340> so

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
make the portable structure block so

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.950 
make the portable structure block so
just<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> put<00:01:12.869> on

here's like here's like a corner of my

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.910 
here's like here's like a corner of my
structure<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.900> i'll<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.049> tap<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> block

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
structure so i'll just tap on a block

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.310 
structure so i'll just tap on a block
right<00:01:23.700> under<00:01:24.060> where<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.110> like

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
tap there just like that first block

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.749 
tap there just like that first block
selected<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:34.950> we're<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> go

right there and let's say I want to move
it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
it

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.040 
it
I<00:02:12.400> don't<00:02:13.240> know<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.330> just<00:02:13.420> want<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.750> move<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.959> over

I don't know I just want to move it over

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.920 
I don't know I just want to move it over
here<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.319> little<00:02:14.530> couple<00:02:15.040> blocks<00:02:15.250> away<00:02:15.430> from<00:02:15.580> it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
here a little couple blocks away from it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.380 
here a little couple blocks away from it
so<00:02:16.930> then<00:02:17.110> we<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:17.380> tap<00:02:17.590> right<00:02:17.800> here<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.390> it's
