00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello and welcome on a canal 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.570
 Today I want to fly you out of sheer 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.140
 videos sometimes my throne itself 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.269
 demonstrate 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.730
 as you can see 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.810
 I ordered the black body and have 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 Just leave it that way 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.460
 simply the plastic foil already settled 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.070
 On top of that is a caste furniture 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.119
 a customizable body almost to fresh 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.940
 paint yourself 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.300
 I did not paint it looks quite 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.760
 I think that's nice with me 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.760
 onboard camera I have failed too many times 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.000
 me down 808 tinkered here because 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.770
 as you can see just cheap 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.610
 I want to cover tape with cover 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.040
 glued 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.780
 so the buttons are still eating and stuff 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.340
 programmed that when you turn that on 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.510
 Immediately recording that means when I'm on 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.220
 the runway turns on and off you go 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.710
 then I already saw myself directly 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.509
 Lamps burned once here 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 and once all the lamps are on 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.020
 the side on which I then the rc 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.490
 I would already have to wire critt 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 a star but it is unfortunately me 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.540
 broke that means I have here 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.590
 under the tape the lamp here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.619
 connected and here I have the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.869
 lamp is connected and looks like 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.329
 I would go and have one too 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.219
 here the cables are all relatively clean 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.279
 mislaid you all here led long 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.709
 that they are down below together 

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:37.829
 made with a threesome so that 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:40.259
 the three producers ends here and here 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.990
 turn on the power supply for the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.189
 lamps connect with their music like 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.189
 extremely bright that is 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 or you can not see the ground anymore 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.840
 out of sheer light and only in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.700
 the camera you see it's already extreme 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.560
 is light I already have the one or 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.090
 other video made with it and can stop 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.439
 not really the recording betrayed 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:12.269
 but it makes flying around in any case 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:13.379
 fun so that on the one modification what 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.650
 you do not sid I have of course 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.110
 also these known spread 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.090
 tradition precision ball bearings 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.200
 built-in 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.379
 if that will really make sense knows 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.739
 Not me , but I stopped 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.890
 By the way, I use tax to good effect 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.410
 throne ace who does not kempa that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.190
 Advantage you can do this wonderful part 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.120
 use here 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.569
 this is a so-called six area 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.090
 gamepad that finally the iphone 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.430
 as soon as thrones started the computer 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.680
 throne it puts me my iphone one 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.060

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.069
 flies assumption through the sounds 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.870
 works really nice is a whole 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.340
 beautiful transition what you tell again 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.560
