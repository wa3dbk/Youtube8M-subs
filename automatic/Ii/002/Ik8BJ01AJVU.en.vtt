 reason to follow our target owen shock 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.710
 a former special forces 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.640
 years ago that with a long time 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.500
 they ask for courses in europe 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.700
 but it's their latest feat that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.730
 propelled on the highest step of the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.730
 podium 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 family a manna al hiti copper 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.580

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.160
 total immunity know not that the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.220
 promise the one to take or to 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.220

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.970
 Florence or bust 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.010

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.350

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.340

 predictable and in the branch is 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.610
 predictable is with maple 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.180

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.180
 when I want 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.130
 you believe in the regions it is perhaps 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.920
 the more ethics we knew about 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.340
 do not turn their backs on the family even though 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.340
