pretty<00:04:03.920> straightforward<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.870> then<00:04:06.050> you<00:04:06.200> can

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
pretty straightforward and then you can

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.280 
pretty straightforward and then you can
also<00:04:06.470> do<00:04:06.650> see<00:04:06.890> list<00:04:07.250> items<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.090> if<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:09.140> want

also do see list items and if you want

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.260 
also do see list items and if you want
any<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.560> these<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.860> can<00:04:09.950> do<00:04:10.070> see<00:04:10.310> item<00:04:11.030> and

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
any of these you can do see item and

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.730 
any of these you can do see item and
then<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.510> item<00:04:11.660> name<00:04:11.960> and<00:04:12.170> it<00:04:12.290> will<00:04:12.440> give<00:04:12.620> it

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
then the item name and it will give it

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.229 
then the item name and it will give it
to<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.160> bear<00:04:13.430> trap<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:15.910> think<00:04:16.910> all<00:04:17.030> one

word and it should work there we go so

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.000 
word and it should work there we go so
yeah<00:04:20.209> just<00:04:20.900> hope<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.350> does<00:04:21.470> not<00:04:21.650> contain

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
yeah just hope that it does not contain

yeah just hope that it does not contain
bears<00:04:24.250> ahaha

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
bears ahaha

that's<00:04:29.330> really<00:04:29.690> awesome<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.950> can<00:04:31.130> try<00:04:31.310> all

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
that's really awesome so you can try all

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.370 
that's really awesome so you can try all
these<00:04:31.580> out<00:04:31.790> I've<00:04:32.360> only<00:04:32.540> tried<00:04:32.630> a<00:04:32.840> few<00:04:33.020> out<00:04:33.170> and

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
these out I've only tried a few out and

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.960 
these out I've only tried a few out and
the<00:04:33.590> ones<00:04:33.770> I<00:04:33.920> have<00:04:34.100> looked<00:04:34.340> at<00:04:34.520> are<00:04:34.670> really

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
the ones I have looked at are really

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.690 
the ones I have looked at are really
funny<00:04:35.210> so<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:35.990> can<00:04:36.170> also<00:04:36.260> change<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.010> law<00:04:37.370> and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
funny so you can also change the law and

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.850 
funny so you can also change the law and
the<00:04:37.760> name<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.060> an<00:04:38.690> item<00:04:38.900> which<00:04:39.410> I<00:04:39.560> mentioned

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
the name of an item which I mentioned

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.640 
the name of an item which I mentioned
earlier<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.400> way<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.550> do<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:40.850> is<00:04:41.030> see

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
earlier so the way to do that is see

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.560 
earlier so the way to do that is see
chain<00:04:42.650> then<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.520> name<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:43.970> we're<00:04:44.330> going<00:04:44.510> to

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
chain then the name and we're going to

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.680 
chain then the name and we're going to
want<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.810> set<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.380> as<00:04:45.940> something<00:04:46.940> so<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.330> can

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
want to set it as something so you can

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.920 
want to set it as something so you can
cheap<00:04:47.870> used<00:04:48.290> color<00:04:48.560> codes<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.750> spaces<00:04:50.750> which

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
cheap used color codes and spaces which

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.080 
cheap used color codes and spaces which
is<00:04:51.080> a<00:04:51.110> really<00:04:51.350> nice<00:04:51.470> feature<00:04:51.710> color<00:04:52.370> codes<00:04:52.700> and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
is a really nice feature color codes and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.450 
is a really nice feature color codes and
that<00:04:53.870> will<00:04:54.020> change<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.320> name<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.340> can

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
that will change the name and you can

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.990 
that will change the name and you can
also<00:04:55.610> do<00:04:55.850> this<00:04:55.970> for<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.300> law<00:04:56.510> so<00:04:57.430> change<00:04:58.430> name

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
also do this for the law so change name

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.230 
also do this for the law so change name
to<00:04:59.030> law<00:04:59.890> set<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.220> then<00:05:01.490> type<00:05:01.880> something<00:05:02.180> you

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
to law set and then type something you

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.790 
to law set and then type something you
can't<00:05:02.480> use<00:05:02.660> color<00:05:02.870> code<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.200> this<00:05:03.320> by<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.620> way

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
can't use color code to this by the way

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.330 
can't use color code to this by the way
so<00:05:04.730> law<00:05:05.060> law<00:05:05.780> one<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:06.770> will<00:05:06.890> change<00:05:07.190> the

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
so law law one and that will change the

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.630 
so law law one and that will change the
law<00:05:07.490> you<00:05:08.390> can<00:05:08.570> also<00:05:08.660> add<00:05:09.020> for<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.560> law<00:05:09.710> like

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
law you can also add for the law like

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
law you can also add for the law like
this<00:05:10.880> and<00:05:11.150> it<00:05:11.870> will<00:05:11.990> say<00:05:12.650> on<00:05:13.000> other<00:05:14.000> lines<00:05:14.330> I

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
this and it will say on other lines I

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.750 
this and it will say on other lines I
believe<00:05:15.170> you<00:05:15.290> can<00:05:15.440> also<00:05:15.500> add<00:05:15.920> for<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.220> name<00:05:16.520> of

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
believe you can also add for the name of

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.680 
believe you can also add for the name of
the<00:05:17.980> thing<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.640> items<00:05:19.970> so<00:05:20.240> let's<00:05:20.450> try<00:05:20.660> that

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
the thing the items so let's try that

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.050 
the thing the items so let's try that
now<00:05:20.960> maybe<00:05:21.830> a<00:05:21.950> different<00:05:22.220> color<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:22.610> see<00:05:22.850> what

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
now maybe a different color and see what

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.000 
now maybe a different color and see what
happens

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
happens

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.360 
happens
so<00:05:25.010> yeah<00:05:25.520> it's<00:05:25.760> added<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.890> name<00:05:28.070> but

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
so yeah it's added to the name but

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.180 
so yeah it's added to the name but
without<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.420> color<00:05:29.600> codes<00:05:29.840> interesting<00:05:30.380> so<00:05:30.800> I

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
without the color codes interesting so I

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.910 
without the color codes interesting so I
just<00:05:31.610> set<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.060> name<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:33.260> be<00:05:33.350> honest<00:05:33.590> that's

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
just set the name to be honest that's

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.070 
just set the name to be honest that's
probably<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.340> best<00:05:34.490> way<00:05:34.640> to<00:05:34.670> do<00:05:34.910> it<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.900> yeah

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
probably the best way to do it and yeah

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.310 
probably the best way to do it and yeah
that<00:05:36.500> looks<00:05:36.710> nice<00:05:36.970> so<00:05:37.970> yeah<00:05:38.390> I<00:05:38.600> believe<00:05:39.020> that

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
that looks nice so yeah I believe that

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.650 
that looks nice so yeah I believe that

to or the name if you were going with an
RPG<00:06:16.500> style<00:06:17.100> server<00:06:17.430> but<00:06:18.150> most<00:06:18.690> this<00:06:18.870> is<00:06:19.050> fine

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
RPG style server but most this is fine

RPG style server but most this is fine
the<00:06:19.620> way<00:06:19.710> it<00:06:19.740> is<00:06:20.009> you<00:06:20.430> could<00:06:20.610> disable<00:06:21.150> the

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
the way it is you could disable the

the way it is you could disable the
overpowered<00:06:22.199> items<00:06:22.590> if<00:06:23.070> you<00:06:23.160> wanted<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.669> now

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
overpowered items if you wanted to now

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.810 
overpowered items if you wanted to now
up<00:06:24.570> here<00:06:24.840> when<00:06:25.350> we<00:06:25.380> go<00:06:25.620> into<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.949> enchantment

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
up here when we go into the enchantment

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.939 
up here when we go into the enchantment
section<00:06:27.270> the<00:06:27.630> enchantment<00:06:28.229> probability

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
section the enchantment probability

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.040 
section the enchantment probability
which<00:06:29.130> is<00:06:29.190> really<00:06:29.490> cool<00:06:29.669> when<00:06:30.600> players<00:06:30.870> are

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
which is really cool when players are

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.200 
which is really cool when players are
enchanting<00:06:31.590> items<00:06:32.039> in<00:06:32.190> the<00:06:32.340> enchantment

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
enchanting items in the enchantment

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.620 
enchanting items in the enchantment
table<00:06:33.630> this<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.620> the<00:06:35.330> probability<00:06:36.330> that<00:06:36.360> it

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
table this is the probability that it

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.339 
table this is the probability that it
will<00:06:36.660> pop<00:06:36.990> up

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
will pop up

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.360 
will pop up
so<00:06:37.919> obviously<00:06:38.520> quickening<00:06:39.150> 25%<00:06:40.080> that<00:06:40.320> is<00:06:40.650> very

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
so obviously quickening 25% that is very

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.439 
so obviously quickening 25% that is very
very<00:06:41.490> high<00:06:41.960> compared<00:06:42.960> to<00:06:43.940> 7%<00:06:44.940> so<00:06:45.150> you<00:06:45.270> wouldn't

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
very high compared to 7% so you wouldn't

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.779 
very high compared to 7% so you wouldn't
really<00:06:45.660> see<00:06:46.259> that<00:06:46.410> too<00:06:46.620> often<00:06:46.800> if<00:06:47.340> we<00:06:47.550> scroll

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 
really see that too often if we scroll

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.659 
really see that too often if we scroll
up<00:06:47.970> to<00:06:48.000> the<00:06:48.240> top<00:06:48.630> of<00:06:48.930> the<00:06:49.830> config<00:06:50.310> file<00:06:50.490> there

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
up to the top of the config file there

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.839 
up to the top of the config file there
is<00:06:50.699> a<00:06:50.820> few<00:06:51.060> things<00:06:51.240> that<00:06:51.389> we<00:06:51.479> could<00:06:51.599> change<00:06:51.840> so

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
is a few things that we could change so

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.430 
is a few things that we could change so
up<00:06:53.849> here<00:06:54.150> it's<00:06:54.539> pretty<00:06:54.780> cool<00:06:54.900> you<00:06:55.050> can<00:06:55.080> change

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
up here it's pretty cool you can change

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.360 
up here it's pretty cool you can change
the<00:06:55.680> colors<00:06:56.160> and<00:06:56.810> formatting<00:06:57.810> of<00:06:57.990> it<00:06:58.370> italics

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
the colors and formatting of it italics

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.310 
the colors and formatting of it italics
I<00:06:59.550> don't<00:06:59.729> think<00:06:59.940> that<00:07:00.060> looks<00:07:00.270> very<00:07:00.690> nice<00:07:00.870> from

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
I don't think that looks very nice from
