00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
hours that we play these sometimes in a

row doesn't change the way they sound at

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:47.039 
row doesn't change the way they sound at
all<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:46.030> is<00:01:46.180> what<00:01:46.330> again<00:01:46.600> we<00:01:46.690> call<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
all this is what again we call the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.039 
all this is what again we call the
comfort<00:01:47.560> notch<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.970> we<00:01:49.030> also<00:01:49.330> do<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:49.720> different

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
comfort notch now we also do a different

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.130 
comfort notch now we also do a different
cut<00:01:50.260> called<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.710> dynamic<00:01:50.890> notch<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.840> has

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
cut called the dynamic notch this has

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.399 
cut called the dynamic notch this has
two<00:01:53.740> curves<00:01:54.100> on<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.570> flat<00:01:55.869> surface

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
two curves on it and the flat surface

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.070 
two curves on it and the flat surface
for<00:01:56.440> palm<00:01:56.860> gripping<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:58.330> reason<00:01:58.720> we<00:01:58.840> do<00:01:59.049> this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
for palm gripping the reason we do this

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.020 
for palm gripping the reason we do this
is<00:01:59.260> it<00:01:59.500> lets<00:01:59.680> you<00:01:59.799> change<00:01:59.830> your<00:02:00.520> techniques

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
is it lets you change your techniques

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.480 
is it lets you change your techniques

while you're playing without needing to

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.570 
while you're playing without needing to
grip<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.909> drum<00:02:04.150> all<00:02:04.390> over<00:02:04.780> again<00:02:05.580> so
