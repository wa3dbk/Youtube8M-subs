this over the entire bag so I mean
everything<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.380> had<00:03:53.680> stayed<00:03:54.010> dry<00:03:54.340> except

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
everything that I had stayed dry except

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.580 
everything that I had stayed dry except
for<00:03:55.360> my<00:03:55.480> sides<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:57.840> again<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:59.050> just<00:03:59.230> rolled<00:03:59.440> up

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
for my sides and again it just rolled up

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.920 
for my sides and again it just rolled up
real<00:03:59.830> easy<00:04:00.100> just<00:04:00.820> tucked<00:04:01.209> into<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.540> bottom<00:04:01.840> of

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
real easy just tucked into the bottom of

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.350 
real easy just tucked into the bottom of
the<00:04:02.020> bag<00:04:02.230> has<00:04:03.040> its<00:04:03.280> own<00:04:03.459> compartment<00:04:04.000> down

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
the bag has its own compartment down

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.090 
the bag has its own compartment down
there<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:05.050> it's<00:04:05.200> not<00:04:05.350> in<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.530> way<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.860> anything

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
there so it's not in the way of anything

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.699 
there so it's not in the way of anything
I<00:04:06.610> don't<00:04:07.150> really<00:04:07.360> suggest<00:04:07.630> packing<00:04:08.320> anything

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
I don't really suggest packing anything

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.680 
I don't really suggest packing anything
else<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:09.070> there<00:04:09.220> with<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.670> just<00:04:10.330> because<00:04:10.570> the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
else in there with it just because the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.590 
else in there with it just because the
bottom<00:04:11.020> is<00:04:11.110> only<00:04:11.320> velcro<00:04:11.890> it<00:04:12.700> stays<00:04:13.090> tight<00:04:13.420> in

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
bottom is only velcro it stays tight in

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.600 
bottom is only velcro it stays tight in
there<00:04:13.780> but<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.350> wouldn't<00:04:14.830> add<00:04:14.920> any<00:04:15.100> weight<00:04:15.340> to

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
there but I wouldn't add any weight to

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.740 
there but I wouldn't add any weight to
us<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:18.070> main<00:04:18.370> compartment<00:04:18.910> of<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.239> bag<00:04:19.359> is

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750

us the main compartment of the bag is
also<00:04:20.109> fully<00:04:20.350> interesting<00:04:21.010> because<00:04:21.419> they<00:04:22.419> gave

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
also fully interesting because they gave

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.820

your<00:04:32.500> hiking<00:04:32.740> bags<00:04:33.100> nowadays<00:04:33.760> but<00:04:34.630> they<00:04:35.500> have

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
your hiking bags nowadays but they have

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.130 
your hiking bags nowadays but they have
a<00:04:35.800> large<00:04:36.040> compartment<00:04:36.790> in<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.150> very<00:04:37.390> back<00:04:37.660> for

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
a large compartment in the very back for

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.190 
a large compartment in the very back for
Camelback<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.640> then<00:04:39.850> they<00:04:40.000> have<00:04:40.210> two

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
Camelback and then they have two

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.260 
Camelback and then they have two
different<00:04:41.380> insertions<00:04:42.160> on<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.460> side<00:04:42.700> so<00:04:43.210> you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
different insertions on the side so you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.210 
different insertions on the side so you
can<00:04:43.479> let<00:04:43.630> your<00:04:43.780> camel<00:04:44.500> straw<00:04:44.770> come<00:04:45.100> out

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
can let your camel straw come out

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.420 
can let your camel straw come out
through<00:04:45.460> there<00:04:46.830> definitely<00:04:47.830> again<00:04:48.160> another

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
through there definitely again another

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.690 
through there definitely again another
key<00:04:48.790> component<00:04:49.000> because<00:04:50.040> what<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.160> camel<00:04:51.550> bag

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
key component because what the camel bag

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.130 
key component because what the camel bag
prevents<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.300> from<00:04:52.330> having<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.750> constantly

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
anything like that and one nice little

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.900

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
thing that they did do that I thought

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.060

was<00:05:01.090> kind<00:05:01.300> of<00:05:01.390> clever

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
they definitely targeted a little bit

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.270 
they definitely targeted a little bit

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
through I can just realize that I mean I

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.600 
through I can just realize that I mean I
never<00:06:24.870> had<00:06:25.050> a<00:06:25.080> backache<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.890> entire<00:06:26.130> weekend

- doing this for a few years

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.980 
- doing this for a few years
this<00:07:03.580> would<00:07:03.730> be<00:07:03.820> too<00:07:04.000> bad<00:07:04.150> of<00:07:04.330> a<00:07:04.390> choice<00:07:04.570> ever

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990
