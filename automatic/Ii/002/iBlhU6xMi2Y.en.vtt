00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.160
 hello and welcome to a bone x ilife me it's yesterday and after the little 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.700
 video of the other time regarding the choice of your ski size and that we 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.740
 will be talking in this video a little more ahead of the constructions and the failure 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.450
 before entering further into the detail of the different segmentation I 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.000
 are you going to do some titles so first thing what is it that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.140
 beginners in France who beginners is generally more trendy track 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.880
 which is relatively flexible enough that we will not take very big and that will 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.250
 to help you to feel confident for the first sensations 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.320
 over the year we now know what it intermediate so we will increase a 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.680
 little stiffness we will give a little more tone also while 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.250
 staying in something affordable 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.170
 and then after you will have the skis performance obviously or lassana 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.650
 drew gold rails confirmed the power will have well engaged and who are going 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.320
 ask to be toned have a minimum of muscle power and well 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.610
 sure of the technique in talking about it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.400
 to start you talk about woman skiing so what makes the difference 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.040
 at what speaks they are first lighter but also one that can more 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.240
 flexible equivalents not bad because women and children 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.340
 develop muscle power a little less second thing we're going 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.700
 shift centering 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.890
 of the shoe on the ski a little further forward and in the same way one 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.340
 going to go up the thickness at the swell shoes come to stand at 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.890
 heel level because women simply by their position 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.530
 basin tend to ski so-called cuchery cassenti little too much on 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 the back we will force them by refocusing and increasing the size of the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.870
 forward heel go skiing at a little bit more on pointe supports 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.910
 first range we will tackle the best known ski for the track only 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.250
 they're going to be for action at this size is suitable to have a dad who 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 will be very very hungry in the center to increase ease of passage 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.900
 caracas and directional skis that are made to be helped only 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.640
 forward then you're going to have the skicross range otherwise called kate 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.890
 kate one part on a kombouarÃ© piste ski base width a little bit 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.470
 more 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.860
 to give them just a little more lift in powder when we 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.010
 wants to come out of the tracks that are going to be a little more at its highest 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.740
 level of the spatula with technicalities that will allow in their 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.610
 shots jerking in the land a little bit chaotic then he goes there 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.109
 see the segmentation which 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.319
 tracker tracker we're going to be a little bit on the segmentation that before except that 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.889
 there we are going to go on a powder base pure powder convard and refine a 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.079
 little bit more his marthaler a little bit of the sidelines just for the 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.489
 people who do not love you is mainly time outside of 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:06.040
 tracks 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.930
 but of course who likes to cut the curve of so much 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.420
 others we see regularly 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.500
 now that we attack the skikdis part criticizes so that's really 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 reserved for guys who want to send for the level free state we go 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.540
 start with the range of skis 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.810
 three pure park entities not been distilled that will be natively to 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.549
 its purposes even though the lines of code are less exaggerated than on skis 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.010
 track with double spatula to power them back and forth 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.370
 skis that will be well catchy anyway in the paris for the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.470
 segmentations rather pro-model is the opposite which month will have to show very 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:35.989
 flexible 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.969
 for the little gibert guys who want to send in modjo their way 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.079
 Strictly in the same range just above you will find the skis 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.930
 10 all types backcountry so it's kind of the same thing as before except that 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.109
 once again its energy the sidelines to give them more 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.299
 lift in powder so that's what you can use as well on 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.860
 track in the park a little bit in the step and it depends on their board to iter 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.449
 and of course that will make sense when you want 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:03.079
 return all your tricks splendor dvd track in the big popo albert and 7 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:03.859
 to have fun 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.949
 again above the smaller country balls we will find the twin tip not 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:08.609
 honor 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.239
 but when they are really reserved for guys who want to send back 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.459
 knitting but rowing outside tracks only because on runway running 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.719
 not at all so generally secure with a delay of a banal 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.420
 to have a water ski effect that thwarts in the powder 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.760
 always with effects of tonicity and that we can arrive in switch for 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.950
 finish we're going to have extreme scrap ski segmentation so here we go 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.720
 really on a ski typed all pink only even if suicide at black 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.030
 pink for example be used by rails towards confirmed on track and guard 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.670
 a very good behavior yield what they are really meant to engage 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.980
 on big lines 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.220
 so with big take for granted - series j -d that's obviously some 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.420
 directional skis that can almost not be used in reverse switch 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.760
 drawn in a month off of oran committed committed equivalence which 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.110
 refers to the meaning of second stick obviously in all these types of 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.350
 chef you will find different ranges so just finished pre-breeders 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.239
 hobbies for people who want to go to the cup who want to start any 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.009
 slowly 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:03.459
 but what is a little more intermediate ski support intended 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.129
 in darralde at half-mast committed well confirmed 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.980
 again if you need more information 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.279
 complementary of a little bit lost in the kids are very broad it is 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:11.629
 know 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.980
 feel free to pay the guys as usual you have a team 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.079
 do not hesitate to use it
