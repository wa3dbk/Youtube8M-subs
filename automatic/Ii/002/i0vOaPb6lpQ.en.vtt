00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
maybe tablespoon two tablespoons we

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.410 
maybe tablespoon two tablespoons we
whisk<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.600> up

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.850 

what<00:02:01.420> we're<00:02:01.540> doing<00:02:01.690> here<00:02:01.750> also<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.350> creating<00:02:02.800> a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
what we're doing here also is creating a

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.640 
what we're doing here also is creating a
nice<00:02:03.070> thick<00:02:04.060> slurry<00:02:04.540> that<00:02:05.200> goes<00:02:05.350> over<00:02:05.560> the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
nice thick slurry that goes over the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.770 
nice thick slurry that goes over the
french<00:02:05.830> toast<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.370> kind<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.700> coats<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.240> so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
french toast and kind of coats it so

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.000 
french toast and kind of coats it so
that<00:02:07.900> when<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.110> do<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:12.960> there's<00:02:13.960> no<00:02:14.110> sugar<00:02:14.320> so

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
that when you do one there's no sugar so

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.510 
that when you do one there's no sugar so
it's<00:02:15.190> not<00:02:15.340> going<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.850> burn<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:18.280> milk

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
it's not going to burn to the milk

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's not going to burn to the milk
powder<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.110> caramelize<00:02:20.290> because

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
powder is going to caramelize because

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.310 
powder is going to caramelize because
they're<00:02:21.160> shittles<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.490> note<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.990> you

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
they're shittles a note so you you

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.080 
they're shittles a note so you you
aren't<00:02:23.470> actually<00:02:23.980> dealing<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.400> any<00:02:24.640> real
