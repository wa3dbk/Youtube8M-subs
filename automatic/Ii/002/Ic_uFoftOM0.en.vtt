00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello, my good todays 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.460
 the video will be from the series of the organization I want 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.870
 show you three ways how you can 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.000
 store scarves 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.530
 The fact is that I am very strong 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 love this one of my favorite 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.400
 accessories and I have accumulated them 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.480
 pretty much a lot to me 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 but basically can for 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.490
 average person is 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.859
 a bit much and as they grow 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.019
 The ways of their storage and the most 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.029
 the first way is the easiest way 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.099
 he lies can be said on the surface 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.779
 this is a special hanger actually 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.680
 the hanger goes for the trousers that is you can 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.980
 ask for three pairs of pants and jacket probably 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.750
 yes or women so there is a jacket 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 special general hangers for scarves 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
 they go round but with hangers you need 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.870
 order online at the base either 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.660
 through ebay through amazon and then depending on what 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 you have these hangers available 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.280
 find in almost any city 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.660
 which I found on them too 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.760
 quite comfortable this whole thing 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.649
 organize if you are not strong 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.359
 large amount when you have 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 the quantity starts to grow and then this 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.360
 the way is already inconvenient they we shall be shot 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 51 on one and when you shoot 1 tone 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.850
 cling the rest the whole thing falls 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.369
 in general, it becomes uncomfortable as 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.530
 I used their growth 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.630
 another option is the basket option 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.970
 I show the example of a basket but it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.580
 can be arranged in a dresser in the shelves either 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.340
 in any sliding shelf or if you take 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 big box up which you can take off 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.420
 from some high shelf too 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 we kept the basket pretty 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.340
 tall just took her out and here 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.170
 this way I kept my scarves 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.470
 now for example took not quite 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.090
 a good scarf is he so voluminous massive 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.920
 knitted wool scarf so he 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.689
 takes up a lot of space if you are 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.509
 small ordinary scarves then they 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.720
 take up little space as you can see in 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.240
 In principle, the method is convenient for what you see 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.479
 what kind of scarves do you have ? 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.590
 pretty clear on sight everything is convenient 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.799
 only he is uncomfortable for those who 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.530
 used to come home took off abandoned and 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.840
 I forgot yes that is, you need to twist everything 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.750
 this thing and put in place that is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.640
 scarf simply take the usual 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.450
 scarf yes I fold 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.810
 I twist their points like that and load iq 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.810
 roll 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.350
 Twisted and put in place everything that is 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.230
 so this is the second storage method 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.320
 it is convenient in principle it is convenient when 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.630
 you pretty big capacity or something 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.850
 that is, it is a locker some sliding 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.489
 box or if this basket is more likely 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.590
 just not one picture and a third way 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.810
 this is the way i stayed he 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.980
 the most convenient for me he is stabbed 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.690
 tenacious and yes let's show and third 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.519
 the way that turned out to be the most for me 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.620
 handy this is when all my scarves i 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.820
 I keep in the internal doors of the cabinet which 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.239
 we have a hallway 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.190
 here I use 2 shelves needed need 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.590
 add 3 because not all fit 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.750
 you have this shelf and here for the bathroom 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.760
 this one can be shortened 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.950
 have they go standard lengths we 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.440
 cut a little bit and inserted 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.720
 and then everything is fine and in general 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.970
 great way at least for 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.280
 I have it working perfectly what all 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.400
 scarves in sight and convenient to take them 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.459
 convenient to return back as I hang 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.670
 here to hang a scarf I fold 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.340
 they fold it in half folded and here 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.890
 I pass this loop behind the coat hanger 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.230
 and through it I am wearing a scarf full length 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.840
 all now he will not run me anywhere 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.090
 will not fall, you can, in principle, their 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.190
 just hang over this one 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.750
 hanger but the fact is that when I have them 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.209
 accumulates large enough 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.430
 the amount is when you take one for 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.200
 disappears from the next so here's 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.049
 the way is much safer and much 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.610
 more convenient for me to actually 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.530
 This I ate hope that some of 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.329
 these methods you need to write 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.959
 me, please, how do you keep yours 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.940
 scarves 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.750
 and we will see you very very soon and 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.750
 until new meetings bye
