00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.990
 tutorial to install the dart this mode 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.730
 empyr so we go then you go 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.130
 on your internet browser 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.890
 you will go into the description on this 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.070
 link on the news site b of the coup what 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.080
 you must know his total war game 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.590
 you basically have the mode page 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.769
 so you have download links 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.109
 right here 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.780
 so you can download it in 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.660
 several parts what I did that that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.260
 the part one and the part of so 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.260
 put berries 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.010
 so part one is a point exe 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.310
 his first two files that will be needed 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.430
 open and part of these so not 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.950

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.370
 download in one yesterday by torrent 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.860
 or strategic form hours that I have 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.270
 not done that's what I prefer mode db 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.690
 So once you have these two 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.240
 files 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.940
 I'll explain how ma 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.700
 grouping its mode the soft power or 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.979
 that you give me aude 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.750
 here so once you have older 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.420
 but to clarify and that thing 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.790
 importantly it makes you the patch so 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.190
 the best is to take on a 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.990
 baby I can very much to the page and not 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:36.200
 not normally displayed linked so here 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.170
 you have for now the files in 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.600
 who is going to put him next to go away 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.150
 put it next to the files for 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.160
 install the mode you have your 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.440
 file 2 which normally in a slip 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.960
 you do an extraction on the desk 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.340
 it is a file weighs on what format it 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.119
 but good so you open fashion bars 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.780
 empire version 8.0 platinum it takes 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.170
 to wait a little 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.390
 we meet again when we are on the right 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.100
 in law 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.930
 so here we are again on installations that 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.709
 you open your life and it gives you 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.220
 finally a page like that your text aya 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.750
 gray next check if you have a 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.440
 space next a sage on legs for 40 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.520
 viewfinder next in next 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.380
 so it takes time 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.010
 ah it's still so we'll do a 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.010
 Small break 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.160
 during the installation go we get 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.560
 found once moved me 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.239
 So here is the installation finished 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:53.610
 we can click on finish now on 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.610

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.560
 here 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.910
 done next aya grid you are next next 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.790
 next 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.030
 do not compete much time be 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.220
 finish that created you a nikon who was 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.290
 already before I advise you a lot 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.120
 a lot a lot to install this patch 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.100
 does not get much spaced anymore 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.230
 adds a lot of moisture the runs 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.360
 it's much better 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.660
 so now 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.230
 we will install the soft power mode in 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.480
 count five 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.280
 so it's very simple you go in 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.040
 the library 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:52.670
 you do bones x finally enhanced by 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.670
 no you go in steam 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.920
 six maps common empire total war date to 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.830
 Arsonval Stuffer 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.750
 so now what are you going to do 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:13.430
 is that you are going to open your 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:15.920
 file that's here that I forget to get 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.680
 to say that he had to winrar is good I 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.840
 think a lot of people have it then 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.840
 you look at the files that are in 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.410
 common between these two names that there already 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.410
 in data 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:38.889
 so here you delete data bars 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.289
 cdd mode of ars mode platinum helicon 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.939
 more than I did it it worked 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:48.840
 normally and I check 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:51.110
 you have been deleted 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.110
 Yes 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.920
 copy you paste everything we do not take 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.920
 too much time normally 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.060
 and you can close closed shutters 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.150
 so that's art this moment besides 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.100
 he went to open your launcher 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.680
 here it is you have left fashion here 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.210
 so chose it's me that's how 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.590
 I settled I do not think it works 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.430
 here it is necessary to install others 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.430
 things apart you look good now 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.080
 we might be an explanation 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.510
 casual velts francis if you want 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.720

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.220
 of cool thing are playable that does not 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.240
