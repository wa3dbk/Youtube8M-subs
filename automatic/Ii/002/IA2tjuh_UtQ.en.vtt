00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
is using a lot of fresh herbs our mix

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.040

uses cilantro oregano and parsley and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.869 
uses cilantro oregano and parsley and
it's<00:00:40.500> really<00:00:40.710> important<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> wash<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> herbs

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it's really important to wash the herbs

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.400 
it's really important to wash the herbs
well<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.170> there's<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
well because you can see that there's a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.139 
well because you can see that there's a
lot<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.649> dirt<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.100> clings<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.879> leaves

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
lot of dirt that clings to the leaves

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.790 
lot of dirt that clings to the leaves
and<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.840> make<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> sauce<00:00:46.289> taste<00:00:46.590> really

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and this can make the sauce taste really

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
and this can make the sauce taste really
gritty<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> show<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
gritty so now I'm going to show you a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.229 
gritty so now I'm going to show you a
really<00:00:49.440> simple<00:00:49.620> trick<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.520> washing<00:00:50.940> there

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
really simple trick for washing there

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.110 
really simple trick for washing there
you<00:00:52.050> take<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> herbs<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.520> break<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you take the herbs and you break off the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880 
you take the herbs and you break off the
stem<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.570> close<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> leaves<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.410> possible

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
stem as close to the leaves as possible

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.860 
stem as close to the leaves as possible
because<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.760> stems<00:00:57.000> contains<00:00:57.360> kind<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.690> bear

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
because the stems contains kind of bear

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.860 
because the stems contains kind of bear
and<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:59.280> put<00:01:00.059> them<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> bowl<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> water

and then put them in the bowl of water

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.460 
and then put them in the bowl of water
and<00:01:01.520> swish<00:01:02.520> them<00:01:02.730> around<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:03.210> your<00:01:03.359> hand<00:01:03.600> all
