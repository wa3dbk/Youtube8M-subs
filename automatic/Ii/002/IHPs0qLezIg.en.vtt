00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
know there's there's just not clear very

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.590 
know there's there's just not clear very
clear<00:01:38.650> water<00:01:38.950> here<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:39.580> you<00:01:39.820> know<00:01:40.299> I<00:01:40.330> think

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
clear water here and so you know I think

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.789 
clear water here and so you know I think
that's<00:01:40.780> going<00:01:40.870> to<00:01:40.930> be<00:01:41.049> just<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.350> little<00:01:41.380> bit<00:01:41.590> of

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
that's going to be just a little bit of

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.370 
that's going to be just a little bit of
a<00:01:41.940> little<00:01:42.940> bit<00:01:43.060> tough<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:43.570> where<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.140> clear

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
a little bit tough and where the clear

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.140 
a little bit tough and where the clear
water<00:01:44.620> is<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:45.010> water<00:01:45.220> colder<00:01:45.670> us<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:46.030> know

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
water is the water colder us you know

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.270 
water is the water colder us you know
you<00:01:46.210> can<00:01:46.750> get<00:01:46.930> in<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.560> can<00:01:47.740> get<00:01:47.890> in<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.070> very

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
you can get in you can get in the very

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.100 
you can get in you can get in the very
very<00:01:48.460> box<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.240> little<00:01:49.479> bit<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:50.080> know

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
very box and it's a little bit you know

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.630 
very box and it's a little bit you know
a<00:01:50.229> little<00:01:50.320> bit<00:01:50.560> warmer<00:01:50.950> but<00:01:51.310> it's<00:01:51.460> pretty

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
a little bit warmer but it's pretty

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.789 
a little bit warmer but it's pretty
dirty<00:01:51.760> back<00:01:52.030> there<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.390> this<00:01:52.900> lake<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.680> is

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
dirty back there is this lake is it is

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.980 
dirty back there is this lake is it is
it<00:01:54.010> more<00:01:54.340> off<00:01:54.640> color<00:01:55.150> than<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.570> has<00:01:55.750> been<00:01:55.780> in

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
it more off color than it has been in

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.600 
it more off color than it has been in
the<00:01:56.170> past<00:01:56.200> or<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.619> this<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.799> normal<00:01:57.040> color<00:01:57.430> is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
the past or is this a normal color is

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.550 
the past or is this a normal color is
just<00:01:57.670> harder<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.150> see<00:01:58.390> on<00:01:58.540> this<00:01:58.659> leg<00:01:58.869> I<00:01:59.110> hadn't

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
just harder to see on this leg I hadn't

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.320 
just harder to see on this leg I hadn't
really<00:01:59.770> fished<00:01:59.979> here<00:02:00.159> in<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.340> long<00:02:00.490> time<00:02:00.790> Rob<00:02:01.150> I

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
really fished here in a long time Rob I

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.600 
really fished here in a long time Rob I
mean<00:02:01.510> it's<00:02:01.780> probably<00:02:01.990> been<00:02:02.290> 15<00:02:02.860> years<00:02:02.890> since<00:02:03.280> I

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
mean it's probably been 15 years since I

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.280 
mean it's probably been 15 years since I
even<00:02:03.850> have<00:02:04.119> been<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:04.600> lake<00:02:04.810> besides

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
even have been on this lake besides

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.440 
even have been on this lake besides
pre-practice<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.729> what<00:02:06.939> I'm<00:02:07.119> seeing

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
pre-practice and so what I'm seeing

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.449 
pre-practice and so what I'm seeing
right<00:02:07.479> now<00:02:07.689> it's<00:02:08.349> definitely<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.009> lot<00:02:09.189> dirtier

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
right now it's definitely a lot dirtier

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.949 
right now it's definitely a lot dirtier
than<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.909> used<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.179> be<00:02:10.239> I<00:02:10.360> mean<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.929> know

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
than it used to be I mean it you know

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.110 
than it used to be I mean it you know
used<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.439> be<00:02:11.590> there<00:02:12.159> was<00:02:12.280> grass<00:02:12.549> in<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.879> lake

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
used to be there was grass in this lake

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.790 
used to be there was grass in this lake
and<00:02:13.150> I'm<00:02:13.480> talking<00:02:13.780> 20<00:02:14.080> years<00:02:14.260> ago<00:02:14.410> probably

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
and I'm talking 20 years ago probably

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.710 
and I'm talking 20 years ago probably
you<00:02:15.220> know<00:02:15.250> grass<00:02:15.640> grew<00:02:15.849> out<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.060> 20<00:02:16.330> feet<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
you know grass grew out to 20 feet and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.180 
you know grass grew out to 20 feet and
it<00:02:17.020> was<00:02:17.200> gin<00:02:17.680> clear<00:02:18.270> but<00:02:19.270> it's<00:02:19.540> just<00:02:19.780> not

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
it was gin clear but it's just not

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.380 
it was gin clear but it's just not
you<00:02:20.340> know<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.550> not<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.880> way<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.210> don't

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you know it's not that way and I don't

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.850 
you know it's not that way and I don't
think<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.630> really<00:02:21.780> been<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.080> way<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.350> for

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
think it's really been that way and for

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
think it's really been that way and for
a<00:02:22.920> while<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.490> something<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.630> grass

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
a while the something you know grass

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.330 
a while the something you know grass
goes<00:02:25.110> through<00:02:25.290> cycles<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.860> know<00:02:25.950> I've<00:02:26.130> talked

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
goes through cycles you know I've talked

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.970 
goes through cycles you know I've talked
about<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.640> before<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.380> right<00:02:28.380> now<00:02:28.590> there's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
about it before and right now there's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.490 
about it before and right now there's
grass<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.910> doesn't<00:02:30.150> grow<00:02:30.210> deep<00:02:30.540> we

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
grass here but it doesn't grow deep we

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.780 
grass here but it doesn't grow deep we
got<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.920> might<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.340> mentioned<00:02:32.760> we

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
got it you might like you mentioned we

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.250 
got it you might like you mentioned we
got<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> little<00:02:33.120> front<00:02:33.450> coming<00:02:33.720> through<00:02:33.990> here

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
got a little front coming through here

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.740 
got a little front coming through here
but<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.680> think<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.400> might<00:02:35.460> be<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.180> front<00:02:36.540> at

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
but I think this might be the front at

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.420 
but I think this might be the front at
which<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.170> fish<00:02:37.350> are<00:02:37.530> already<00:02:37.920> committed

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
which the fish are already committed

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.670 
which the fish are already committed
like<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.480> know<00:02:39.600> you'll<00:02:39.840> have<00:02:39.930> fronts<00:02:40.620> that

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
like you know you'll have fronts that

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.800 
like you know you'll have fronts that
push<00:02:41.040> fish<00:02:41.280> off<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.850> push<00:02:42.030> fish<00:02:42.240> off<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:42.690> it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
push fish off and push fish off but it

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.320 
push fish off and push fish off but it
this<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.530> not<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.130> be<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.640> big

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
this one is just not going to be as big

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.780 
this one is just not going to be as big
of<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.600> front<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.470> fish<00:02:46.680> are<00:02:46.890> already<00:02:47.310> to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
of a front and the fish are already to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.120 
of a front and the fish are already to
the<00:02:48.030> bank<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.600> committed<00:02:49.020> ways<00:02:49.350> up<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.980> that

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the bank in a committed ways up is that

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.560 
the bank in a committed ways up is that
what<00:02:50.280> you're<00:02:50.460> saying<00:02:50.640> yeah<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:51.540> I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
what you're saying yeah I think so I

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.240 
what you're saying yeah I think so I
mean<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.260> two<00:02:52.440> ways<00:02:52.680> really<00:02:53.100> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
mean I think the two ways really that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.410 
mean I think the two ways really that
are<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.520> be<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> fish<00:02:53.910> are<00:02:54.120> going<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.300> be

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
are going to be the fish are going to be

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.450 
are going to be the fish are going to be
something<00:02:54.990> up<00:02:55.260> fish<00:02:55.470> are<00:02:55.650> spawning<00:02:55.860> or<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
something up fish are spawning or the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.130 
something up fish are spawning or the
ones<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.600> know<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.870> Brett

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
ones that are you know that Brett
