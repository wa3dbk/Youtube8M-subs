00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.280 
like coming back in this capacity um
it's<00:00:42.809> different

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it's different

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 
it's different
um<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:44.460> supposedly<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.210> came<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> Rockwell<00:00:45.899> in

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
um we supposedly I came to Rockwell in

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
um we supposedly I came to Rockwell in
fifth<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.350> sixth<00:00:46.680> year<00:00:46.829> when<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.130> was<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.520> and

fifth and sixth year when I was here and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
fifth and sixth year when I was here and
it<00:00:47.910> was<00:00:48.000> 88<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.380> that<00:00:49.500> capacity<00:00:49.680> it's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it was 88 so in that capacity it's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
it was 88 so in that capacity it's
probably<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.270> different<00:00:51.629> cuz<00:00:51.930> you're

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
probably not as different cuz you're

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.690

life there's a camp Rockwell on here so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.960 
life there's a camp Rockwell on here so
they<00:02:00.990> might<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.009> camp<00:02:02.220> again<00:02:02.520> but

they might think that's a camp again but

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.399 
they might think that's a camp again but
it's<00:02:03.090> actually<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.630> lot<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.899> work<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
it's actually a lot of work and I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.359 
it's actually a lot of work and I
suppose<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.770> building<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> be

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
suppose it's building what to be

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.280 
suppose it's building what to be
professional<00:02:05.960> professional<00:02:06.960> rugby<00:02:07.049> player

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.809 
honest which I can't speak highly enough
of<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.319> benefits<00:03:11.709> of<00:03:11.859> having<00:03:12.159> him<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.609> for

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
of the benefits of having him here for

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.610 
of the benefits of having him here for
two<00:03:13.000> or<00:03:13.030> three<00:03:13.299> days<00:03:13.480> if<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.019> was<00:03:14.139> my<00:03:14.290> thing<00:03:14.500> I

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
two or three days if it was my thing I

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.559 
two or three days if it was my thing I
tried<00:03:14.769> having<00:03:15.010> five<00:03:15.280> days<00:03:15.489> here<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:16.120> know<00:03:16.269> so

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
tried having five days here you know so

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.020 
tried having five days here you know so
but<00:03:17.169> I<00:03:17.230> am<00:03:17.409> no<00:03:17.680> massively<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.579> I<00:03:18.669> suppose<00:03:18.909> from

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
but I am no massively and I suppose from

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.879 
but I am no massively and I suppose from
my<00:03:19.180> own<00:03:19.329> point<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.900> view<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.229> found<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.859> very

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
my own point of view I found it very

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.589 
my own point of view I found it very
beneficial<00:03:21.099> for<00:03:21.729> the<00:03:21.849> six<00:03:22.090> weeks<00:03:22.269> we<00:03:22.359> used<00:03:22.509> to

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
beneficial for the six weeks we used to

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.969 
beneficial for the six weeks we used to
do<00:03:22.659> in<00:03:22.750> Clongowes<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.470> can<00:03:23.650> see<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979 
do in Clongowes so I can see the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.979 
do in Clongowes so I can see the
benefits<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.609> straight<00:03:24.790> away<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.509> finally

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
benefits of it straight away and finally

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.039 
benefits of it straight away and finally
brings<00:03:26.319> in<00:03:26.530> your<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.209> 119th<00:03:28.209> forwards<00:03:28.810> coach

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
brings in your the 119th forwards coach

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.039 
brings in your the 119th forwards coach
from<00:03:29.530> Monster<00:03:30.009> and<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:31.030> how<00:03:31.299> confident<00:03:31.720> are

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
from Monster and so how confident are

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.869 
from Monster and so how confident are
you<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.799> interpose<00:03:33.250> in<00:03:33.400> September

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
you going to the interpose in September

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.670 
you going to the interpose in September
or<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.299> bit<00:03:34.419> early<00:03:34.659> for<00:03:34.689> confidence<00:03:35.590> I

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
or is it a bit early for confidence I

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.289 
or is it a bit early for confidence I
wouldn't<00:03:35.949> say<00:03:36.069> I<00:03:36.099> didn't<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.549> am<00:03:36.939> I

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
wouldn't say I didn't like that am I

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.210 
wouldn't say I didn't like that am I
suppose<00:03:37.569> we're<00:03:38.199> getting<00:03:38.409> we're<00:03:39.009> getting<00:03:39.189> a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
suppose we're getting we're getting a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.559 
suppose we're getting we're getting a
game<00:03:39.370> plan<00:03:39.489> together<00:03:39.759> we're<00:03:40.090> getting<00:03:40.299> our

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
game plan together we're getting our

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.780 
game plan together we're getting our
different<00:03:40.930> unit<00:03:41.769> work<00:03:41.949> and<00:03:42.189> things<00:03:42.370> done<00:03:42.609> in

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
different unit work and things done in

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.909 
different unit work and things done in
here<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.509> I<00:03:43.840> suppose<00:03:44.139> it's<00:03:44.439> it's<00:03:44.650> hard<00:03:44.889> to

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
here so I suppose it's it's hard to

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.249 
here so I suppose it's it's hard to
gauge<00:03:45.189> at<00:03:45.909> this<00:03:46.120> level<00:03:46.329> like<00:03:46.569> there's<00:03:47.019> there's

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:47.259 
gauge at this level like there's there's

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.129 
gauge at this level like there's there's
we've<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.590> 26-mile<00:03:48.549> squad<00:03:48.819> here<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.449> we've<00:03:49.569> 36

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
we've a 26-mile squad here and we've 36

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.050 
we've a 26-mile squad here and we've 36
men<00:03:50.290> overall<00:03:50.650> squad<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.489> any<00:03:51.669> one<00:03:51.849> of<00:03:51.939> those

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
men overall squad and any one of those

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.300 
men overall squad and any one of those
pairs<00:03:52.329> come<00:03:52.659> in<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.049> it's<00:03:53.769> kind<00:03:53.919> of<00:03:53.979> early<00:03:54.099> to

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
pairs come in so it's kind of early to

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.589 
pairs come in so it's kind of early to
say<00:03:54.459> at<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.669> minute<00:03:54.909> what<00:03:55.060> we<00:03:55.180> were<00:03:55.329> shaping

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
say at the minute what we were shaping

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.020 
say at the minute what we were shaping
up<00:03:55.870> lines<00:03:56.500> are<00:03:56.680> working<00:03:56.979> hard<00:03:57.189> I<00:03:57.340> can't<00:03:57.549> fault

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
up lines are working hard I can't fault

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.249 
up lines are working hard I can't fault
him<00:03:58.150> for<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.299> we're<00:03:58.509> working<00:03:58.629> hard<00:03:59.019> we're

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
him for that we're working hard we're

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.869 
him for that we're working hard we're
getting<00:03:59.500> there<00:03:59.680> so<00:03:59.979> every<00:04:00.519> week<00:04:00.699> we're

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
getting there so every week we're

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.369 
getting there so every week we're
improving<00:04:01.150> what<00:04:01.449> you<00:04:01.569> all<00:04:01.900> we<00:04:02.019> can<00:04:02.139> ask<00:04:02.259> for

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
improving what you all we can ask for

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.369 
improving what you all we can ask for
but<00:04:03.069> I<00:04:03.579> suppose<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.299> can't<00:04:04.989> when<00:04:05.259> you're

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
but I suppose you can't when you're

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.539 
but I suppose you can't when you're
wearing<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.620> red<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.769> monster<00:04:06.099> you<00:04:06.219> can't<00:04:06.430> be

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
wearing a red a monster you can't be

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.819 
wearing a red a monster you can't be
Bush<00:04:06.790> with<00:04:07.419> it<00:04:07.540> not<00:04:08.109> an<00:04:08.229> arrogance<00:04:08.620> but<00:04:08.769> a

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
Bush with it not an arrogance but a

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.949 
Bush with it not an arrogance but a
confidence<00:04:09.759> that<00:04:09.969> we're<00:04:10.329> able<00:04:10.449> to<00:04:10.539> play<00:04:10.719> ball

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
confidence that we're able to play ball

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.289 
confidence that we're able to play ball
so<00:04:11.379> I<00:04:11.620> suppose<00:04:11.949> in<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:12.849> point<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.180> view<00:04:13.209> we

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
so I suppose in that point of view we

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.149 
so I suppose in that point of view we
did<00:04:13.569> instill<00:04:13.780> Latin<00:04:14.079> fellows<00:04:14.349> that's<00:04:14.620> you

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
did instill Latin fellows that's you

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.050 
did instill Latin fellows that's you
know<00:04:15.280> when<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.459> go<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.639> play<00:04:15.819> an<00:04:15.879> integral

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
know when you go to play an integral

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.060 
know when you go to play an integral
your<00:04:16.359> friend<00:04:16.570> or<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.840> monster<00:04:17.199> so<00:04:17.409> it

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
your friend or a the monster so it
