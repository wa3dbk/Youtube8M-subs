00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
was saying this is the main part of the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
was saying this is the main part of the
lighting<00:00:40.559> system<00:00:40.910> besides<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> lights<00:00:42.300> of

course<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.559> my<00:00:43.800> opinion<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
course but in my opinion this is the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.660 
course but in my opinion this is the
reason<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.629> bought<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.500> set<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.489> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
in my opinion and for my setup are more

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.840 
in my opinion and for my setup are more
than<00:02:04.020> enough<00:02:04.170> here's<00:02:04.979> two<00:02:05.219> right<00:02:05.369> here<00:02:05.579> well

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
than enough here's two right here well

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.670 
than enough here's two right here well
one<00:02:06.030> right<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:06.390> second<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.409> over<00:02:07.500> there

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
one right there second one over there

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.609 
one right there second one over there
and<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.039> third<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:09.319> down<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.590> I

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
and a third one actually down there I

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.250 
and a third one actually down there I
had<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.989> way<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.200> was

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
had that up here but the way it was

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.830 
had that up here but the way it was
mounting

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
mounting

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.020 
mounting
it<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.739> wasn't<00:02:14.920> strong<00:02:15.190> enough<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.849> gotta

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
it just wasn't strong enough and I gotta

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.479 
it just wasn't strong enough and I gotta
be<00:02:16.090> honest<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.630> adhesive<00:02:17.319> strips<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:18.220> came

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
be honest the adhesive strips that came

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.160 
be honest the adhesive strips that came
with<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> light<00:02:19.150> strips<00:02:19.510> were<00:02:19.840> not<00:02:20.020> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
with the light strips were not the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.440 
with the light strips were not the
strongest<00:02:20.520> while<00:02:21.520> I'm<00:02:21.640> currently<00:02:21.910> using<00:02:22.060> them

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
strongest while I'm currently using them

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.170 
strongest while I'm currently using them
still<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.680> see<00:02:24.130> them<00:02:24.310> eventually<00:02:24.520> falling

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
still I do see them eventually falling

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.030 
still I do see them eventually falling
off<00:02:25.330> because<00:02:25.540> like<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.530> said<00:02:26.709> they're<00:02:26.890> really

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
off because like I said they're really

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.250 
off because like I said they're really
not<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.520> great<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.030> I'll<00:02:28.569> probably<00:02:28.810> buy

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
not that great so I'll probably buy

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.670 
not that great so I'll probably buy
myself<00:02:29.470> some<00:02:29.860> double-sided<00:02:30.550> adhesive<00:02:30.790> tape

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
myself some double-sided adhesive tape

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.350 
myself some double-sided adhesive tape
strips<00:02:32.680> or<00:02:32.830> whatever<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.730> there<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.209> the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
strips or whatever so there is the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.290 
strips or whatever so there is the
overall<00:02:34.840> setup<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.680> now<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.760> time<00:02:37.000> for<00:02:37.239> a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
overall setup and now it is time for a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.770 
overall setup and now it is time for a
demo

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
demo

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
now pressing the power button I had a

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.600 
now pressing the power button I had a
little<00:02:58.120> sensor<00:02:59.790> right<00:03:00.790> down<00:03:01.660> there<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:03.430> can

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
little sensor right down there you can

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.400 
little sensor right down there you can
barely<00:03:03.970> see<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.540> but<00:03:04.660> trust<00:03:04.780> me<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.080> sensor<00:03:05.349> is

barely see it but trust me the sensor is
right<00:03:05.650> there<00:03:05.980> now<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.330> basic

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
right there now I have it in the basic

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.690 
right there now I have it in the basic
animation<00:03:08.140> mode<00:03:08.349> now<00:03:08.950> what<00:03:09.160> you're<00:03:09.310> seeing<00:03:09.549> is

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
animation mode now what you're seeing is

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.160 
animation mode now what you're seeing is
a<00:03:09.730> little<00:03:10.030> bit<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.209> flickering<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.810> noticed

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
a little bit of flickering I noticed

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.130 
a little bit of flickering I noticed
that<00:03:11.319> in<00:03:11.500> my<00:03:11.680> thank-you<00:03:12.069> diggnation<00:03:12.610> video

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
that in my thank-you diggnation video

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.780 
that in my thank-you diggnation video
that's<00:03:14.140> only<00:03:14.410> because<00:03:14.920> that's<00:03:15.370> how<00:03:15.730> it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
that's only because that's how it

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.880 
that's only because that's how it
appears<00:03:16.269> on<00:03:16.420> camera<00:03:16.450> I'm<00:03:17.230> not<00:03:17.470> sure<00:03:17.620> if<00:03:17.709> it's<00:03:17.829> a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
appears on camera I'm not sure if it's a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.430 
appears on camera I'm not sure if it's a
framerate<00:03:18.130> issue<00:03:18.430> or<00:03:18.880> what<00:03:19.840> but<00:03:20.140> believe<00:03:20.410> me

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
framerate issue or what but believe me

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.250 
framerate issue or what but believe me
the<00:03:20.650> flickering<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.130> see<00:03:21.280> right<00:03:21.549> now<00:03:22.260> you

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
the flickering you see right now you

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.020 
the flickering you see right now you
don't<00:03:23.440> actually<00:03:23.560> see<00:03:23.829> in<00:03:24.040> person<00:03:24.310> believe<00:03:24.850> me

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
don't actually see in person believe me

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.910 
don't actually see in person believe me
it's<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.299> lot<00:03:25.510> smoother<00:03:26.410> than<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.620> it

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
it's a lot smoother than that it

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.710 
it's a lot smoother than that it
actually<00:03:27.220> looks<00:03:27.370> perfect<00:03:27.820> now<00:03:28.359> let's<00:03:28.570> talk

actually looks perfect now let's talk
about<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.049> options<00:03:29.340> we<00:03:30.340> can<00:03:30.489> indeed<00:03:31.470> stop

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
about the options we can indeed stop

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.979 
about the options we can indeed stop
