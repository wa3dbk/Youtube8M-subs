00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.890
 very good I'm nico and in this video 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.040
 let's show you how to jailbreak 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.030
 any iphone ipad ipod touch that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.539
 have the version ios 6.1 point 36 point 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.000
 1.4 and six point 1.5 which are the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.520
 versions that were missing the tool were 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.369
 called proxy spain and is available 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.140
 both for windows and for mac this 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 jailbreak we had already done 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.940
 time but we have waited for the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.460
 hackers launched the windows version and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.010
 I solved options in some failures and now 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.570
 it seems that the jailbreak is stable if 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.720
 someone wants to go from jailbreak 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.930
 tethered to the untethered there is another video the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.120
 which will leave a link 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.610
 really this is very simple but 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.990
 let's show how it's done and give some 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.450
 advice 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.090
 the ideal is to have updated the 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.980
 device from itunes and not through 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.309
 the update of the device itself 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.290
 via wifi so it is recommended to make a 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.080
 backup in case something fails 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.240
 to be able to recover the data in case 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.970
 that something that up to now does not 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.670
 we have found in no case we are going 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.880
 to leave a video of how to reset the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.800
 device that is just pressing the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.540
 power and home buttons until 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.229
 apple apple appear so that it 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.740
 turn on and if this does not work like 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.500
 leave the device in df mode for 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.690
 restore it from habits although you have to 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.420
 keep in mind that if we restore it 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.009
 from itunes the last one will be installed 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.630
 version of the operating system that 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.440
 offer apple for that mode of what 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.660
 have 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.000
 we leave a link to the official website 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.560
 of the program where you have the possibility 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.440
 to download the files that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.540
 it is currently in version 1.0 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.910
 point 5 for both windows and mac 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.400
 but we will also upload it to our 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.540
 download section in case any fails 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.600
 time the servers of the official website 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.000
 in this case we have an iphone 3gs with 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.700
 version 6.1 point 3 that we just 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.530
 restore from itunes we connect the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.530
 device to the computer if we have not 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.990
 done we downloaded the program what 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.960
 unzip and a window appears 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.450
 with a button that also jailbreak 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.270
 we see the iphone that we have 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.280
 connected to the detected version and that 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.010
 press the jailbreak button to 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.040
 start at the moment we press the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.350
 button automatically closes itunes and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.570
 start the process you do not have to do anything 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.700
 more really it's very simple we're going to 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.129
 give a quick camera until the end 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.950
 the process in this iphone 3gs has us 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.040
 lasted almost three minutes and we see 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.720
 how it automatically restarts in the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.879
 moment when the bar is completed 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.099
 of progress in the boxes paint program 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.250
 from the computer we can close it and 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.290
 we continue on the iphone the iphone takes 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.430
 in turn on a minute and a half more more 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.680
 or less, we are going to give you a quick camera 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.580
 we unlock the device 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.580
 we look for cydia 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.690
 and we already see here how it appears and when 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.110
 open we will prepare the file system 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.930
 as it normally does and when it ends 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.400
 will close at the end we will give 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.670
 also to fast camera so that what 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.010
 you see this does not usually take long but 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.370
 it took us about three more minutes 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.370
 or less 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.640
 we slide 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.850
 we open cydia and it gives us the option of 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.500
