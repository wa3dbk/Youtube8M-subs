00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.010 
think like ten more fairies and then
like<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.770> bunch<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.370> doors<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.030> stuff<00:02:55.210> but<00:02:55.870> for

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
this video I'm just focusing on sketches

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.130 
this video I'm just focusing on sketches
because<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:01.210> video<00:03:01.480> was<00:03:01.660> actually<00:03:01.810> like

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
because the video was actually like

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.140 
because the video was actually like
three<00:03:02.410> hours<00:03:02.590> long<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.100> just<00:03:03.130> like<00:03:03.490> spent

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
three hours long and I just like spent

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.110 
three hours long and I just like spent
all<00:03:04.270> day<00:03:04.300> just<00:03:04.600> chopping<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.380> down<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.970> get

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
all day just chopping it down and to get

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.470 
all day just chopping it down and to get
it<00:03:07.240> this<00:03:07.360> short<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:08.740> we'll<00:03:09.460> split<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.850> split<00:03:10.390> it

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
it this short so we'll split it split it

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.420 
it this short so we'll split it split it
up<00:03:10.540> into<00:03:10.690> two<00:03:10.900> parts<00:03:11.140> one<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.980> one<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
up into two parts one this one the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.940 
up into two parts one this one the
sketching<00:03:13.000> process<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.510> then<00:03:13.630> later<00:03:13.960> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
sketching process and then later the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.699 
sketching process and then later the
inks<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.340> colors<00:03:16.410> unfortunately<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.440> only

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
inks and colors unfortunately I only

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.460 
inks and colors unfortunately I only
have<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.370> think<00:03:18.670> like<00:03:18.790> four<00:03:19.180> videos<00:03:19.840> or<00:03:20.230> four

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
have I think like four videos or four

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.550 
have I think like four videos or four
characters<00:03:21.450> including<00:03:22.450> one<00:03:22.720> gargle<00:03:23.290> so

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
characters including one gargle so

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.440 
characters including one gargle so
that's<00:03:23.709> good<00:03:24.010> but<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.910> first<00:03:25.180> four

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
that's good but of the first four

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.820 
that's good but of the first four
fairies<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.930> posted<00:03:26.290> on<00:03:26.410> Instagram<00:03:26.770> I

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
fairies that I posted on Instagram I

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.760 
fairies that I posted on Instagram I
didn't<00:03:27.160> think<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.760> record<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.270> process<00:03:28.770> but

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
didn't think to record the process but

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.860 
didn't think to record the process but
that's<00:03:29.890> okay<00:03:30.190> because<00:03:30.270> each<00:03:31.270> character<00:03:31.840> I

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
that's okay because each character I

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.910 
that's okay because each character I
think<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.200> gonna<00:03:32.290> be<00:03:32.440> split<00:03:32.650> up<00:03:32.680> to

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
think it's gonna be split up to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.040 
think it's gonna be split up to
sometimes<00:03:33.430> maybe<00:03:33.640> three<00:03:34.030> videos<00:03:34.360> because

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
sometimes maybe three videos because

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.870 
sometimes maybe three videos because
they<00:03:35.170> are<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.410> little<00:03:35.800> bit<00:03:36.010> long<00:03:36.280> longer

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
they are a little bit long longer

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.380 
they are a little bit long longer
so<00:03:37.420> for<00:03:38.170> Luciana<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.920> character<00:03:39.340> I'll<00:03:40.240> be

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
so for Luciana this character I'll be

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.360 
so for Luciana this character I'll be
posting<00:03:40.600> up<00:03:40.930> probably<00:03:41.530> two<00:03:41.860> parts

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370

fits<00:03:49.209> underneath<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.690> dress<00:03:49.900> because<00:03:50.320> I'm

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
fits underneath the dress because I'm

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.350 
fits underneath the dress because I'm
drawing<00:03:50.709> like<00:03:51.190> clothing<00:03:51.610> but<00:03:52.000> then<00:03:52.150> when

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
drawing like clothing but then when

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.670 
drawing like clothing but then when
you're<00:03:52.450> drawing<00:03:52.570> clothing<00:03:53.170> sometimes<00:03:53.410> it

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
you're drawing clothing sometimes it

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.710 
you're drawing clothing sometimes it
gets<00:03:53.800> lost<00:03:54.130> or<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.610> an<00:03:54.700> Anatomy<00:03:55.330> gets<00:03:55.510> lost

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
gets lost or the an Anatomy gets lost

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.190 
gets lost or the an Anatomy gets lost
all<00:03:56.200> your<00:03:56.320> ideas<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:56.680> draw<00:03:57.100> some<00:03:57.820> guides

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
all your ideas just draw some guides

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.699 
all your ideas just draw some guides
underneath<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.500> know<00:03:59.620> your<00:03:59.770> Anatomy<00:04:01.709> to

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
underneath if you know your Anatomy to

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.580 
underneath if you know your Anatomy to
make<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:02.950> clothes<00:04:03.190> look<00:04:03.400> believable<00:04:03.760> and

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
make the clothes look believable and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.199 
make the clothes look believable and
since<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.709> is<00:04:05.860> gonna<00:04:05.980> be<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.190> 3d<00:04:06.580> model<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.120> want

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
since it is gonna be a 3d model you want

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.660 
since it is gonna be a 3d model you want
to<00:04:07.330> make<00:04:07.450> sure<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.930> designs<00:04:08.260> look<00:04:08.950> solid

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
to make sure that the designs look solid

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.360 
to make sure that the designs look solid
like<00:04:09.850> actually<00:04:10.330> 3d<00:04:10.660> so<00:04:11.320> this<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.070> definitely

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
like actually 3d so this is definitely

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.370 
like actually 3d so this is definitely
the<00:04:13.090> whole<00:04:13.270> way<00:04:13.420> through<00:04:13.450> I'm<00:04:13.900> keeping<00:04:14.260> in

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
the whole way through I'm keeping in

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.800 
the whole way through I'm keeping in
mind<00:04:14.530> how<00:04:14.680> would<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:15.280> look<00:04:15.580> in<00:04:15.820> 3d<00:04:16.510> space

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
mind how would this look in 3d space

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.110 
mind how would this look in 3d space
which<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:17.830> something<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.220> should<00:04:18.489> do<00:04:18.730> if<00:04:18.970> you

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
which is something you should do if you

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.260 
which is something you should do if you
are<00:04:19.299> looking<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.720> draw<00:04:19.900> realistic<00:04:20.230> anyway<00:04:21.270> so

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
are looking to draw realistic anyway so

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.060 
are looking to draw realistic anyway so
as<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.690> guys<00:04:22.810> can<00:04:22.900> see<00:04:22.960> I'm<00:04:23.320> still<00:04:23.590> blocking

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
as you guys can see I'm still blocking

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.290 
as you guys can see I'm still blocking
in<00:04:24.220> some<00:04:24.580> rough<00:04:24.910> draft<00:04:25.210> lines

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
in some rough draft lines

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.150 
in some rough draft lines
the<00:04:26.810> first<00:04:27.139> stage<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:27.650> was<00:04:27.740> just<00:04:27.919> trying<00:04:28.099> to

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
the first stage I was just trying to

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.070 
the first stage I was just trying to
capture<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.490> gesture<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.660> like<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.960> call

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
capture the gesture and I like to call

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.029 
capture the gesture and I like to call
that<00:04:30.139> layout<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:31.039> same<00:04:31.280> like<00:04:31.520> for<00:04:32.180> like

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
that layout the same like for like

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.499 
that layout the same like for like
comics<00:04:34.039> or<00:04:34.220> manga<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.819> you<00:04:35.030> want<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.270> layout

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
comics or manga you you want to layout

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.450 
comics or manga you you want to layout
just<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.080> important<00:04:36.530> stuff<00:04:36.740> like<00:04:37.039> the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
just the important stuff like the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.430 
just the important stuff like the
placement<00:04:37.729> of<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.030> hands<00:04:38.449> and<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.780> direction

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
placement of the hands and the direction

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.779 
placement of the hands and the direction
that<00:04:39.560> they're<00:04:39.710> facing<00:04:40.039> and<00:04:40.430> things<00:04:40.639> like<00:04:40.729> that

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
that they're facing and things like that

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.629 
that they're facing and things like that
blocking<00:04:41.599> in<00:04:41.690> really<00:04:42.020> simple<00:04:42.650> shapes<00:04:42.889> so<00:04:43.400> in<00:04:43.580> a

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
blocking in really simple shapes so in a

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.980 
blocking in really simple shapes so in a
sense<00:04:43.849> it<00:04:44.060> is<00:04:44.090> layout<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.860> then<00:04:46.660> before<00:04:47.660> this

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
sense it is layout and then before this

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.089 
sense it is layout and then before this
stage<00:04:48.199> right<00:04:48.410> now<00:04:48.440> I'm<00:04:48.680> actually<00:04:48.830> just

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
stage right now I'm actually just

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.650 
stage right now I'm actually just
roughing<00:04:49.580> in<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:50.000> final<00:04:50.240> lines<00:04:50.389> but

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
roughing in the the final lines but

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.920 
roughing in the the final lines but
before<00:04:51.289> this<00:04:51.530> I<00:04:51.830> would<00:04:52.819> call<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.180> roughs<00:04:53.449> rough

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
before this I would call it roughs rough

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.469 
before this I would call it roughs rough
draft<00:04:54.199> stage<00:04:54.470> number<00:04:54.770> one<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.430> that's<00:04:56.270> what

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
draft stage number one and that's what

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.010 
draft stage number one and that's what
I'm<00:04:56.660> trying<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:56.990> get<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.289> details<00:04:58.220> in<00:04:58.810> but<00:04:59.810> it

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
I'm trying to get the details in but it

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.990 
I'm trying to get the details in but it
can<00:05:00.229> be<00:05:00.319> super<00:05:01.009> messy<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.490> doesn't<00:05:01.759> matter<00:05:01.909> if

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
can be super messy it doesn't matter if

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.719 
can be super messy it doesn't matter if
it's<00:05:02.120> really<00:05:02.449> messy<00:05:03.220> rough<00:05:04.220> Jeff<00:05:04.400> detail

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
it's really messy rough Jeff detail

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.330 
it's really messy rough Jeff detail
number<00:05:04.970> two<00:05:05.590> this<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:06.770> this<00:05:06.979> is<00:05:07.130> what<00:05:07.250> I'm

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
number two this is this is what I'm

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.620 
number two this is this is what I'm
doing<00:05:07.460> now<00:05:07.580> it's<00:05:07.849> what<00:05:08.000> I'm<00:05:08.090> darkening<00:05:08.389> these

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
doing now it's what I'm darkening these

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.570 
doing now it's what I'm darkening these
these<00:05:09.169> lines<00:05:09.440> in<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.919> last<00:05:13.220> step<00:05:13.550> before

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
these lines in is the last step before

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.420 
these lines in is the last step before
you<00:05:14.210> ink<00:05:14.449> so<00:05:15.139> this<00:05:15.380> stage<00:05:15.650> really<00:05:16.009> helps<00:05:16.340> you

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
you ink so this stage really helps you

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.430 
you ink so this stage really helps you
in<00:05:16.460> your<00:05:16.610> inking<00:05:16.970> process<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:18.199> be<00:05:18.409> a

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
in your inking process it can be a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.930 
in your inking process it can be a
little<00:05:18.740> messy<00:05:18.830> but<00:05:19.220> you<00:05:19.340> want<00:05:19.520> it<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.669> be<00:05:19.759> as

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
little messy but you want it to be as

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.240 
little messy but you want it to be as
clean<00:05:20.479> as<00:05:20.720> possible<00:05:20.810> so<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:21.889> you<00:05:22.069> know

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
clean as possible so that you know

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.710 
clean as possible so that you know
exactly<00:05:22.759> what<00:05:23.090> you're<00:05:23.240> doing<00:05:23.449> when<00:05:23.630> you're

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
exactly what you're doing when you're

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.950 
exactly what you're doing when you're
inking<00:05:24.229> and<00:05:24.380> this<00:05:25.190> stage<00:05:25.460> works<00:05:25.849> well<00:05:26.210> and

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
inking and this stage works well and

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.270 
inking and this stage works well and
this<00:05:27.139> process<00:05:27.590> works<00:05:27.770> well<00:05:27.949> if<00:05:28.069> you're<00:05:28.190> gonna

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
this process works well if you're gonna

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.870 
this process works well if you're gonna
have<00:05:28.430> a<00:05:28.490> really<00:05:29.060> super<00:05:29.389> clean<00:05:29.659> inking<00:05:30.820> kind<00:05:31.820> of
