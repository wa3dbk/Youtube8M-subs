00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and I think the the thing that sometimes

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
and I think the the thing that sometimes
we<00:00:35.190> forget<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.730> Republicans<00:00:36.300> does<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.540> think

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
we forget is Republicans does we think

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.569 
we forget is Republicans does we think
about<00:00:36.960> individualism<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.219> importance

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
about individualism and the importance

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.720 
about individualism and the importance
of<00:00:38.670> personal<00:00:38.910> strength<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:40.230> think<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.950> teach

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
of personal strength I think they teach

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.610 
of personal strength I think they teach
us<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:42.000> community<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.020> care<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
us about community and care and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.529 
us about community and care and
compassion<00:00:44.070> how<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.730> need<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> take<00:00:45.239> care<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
compassion how we need to take care of

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.229 
compassion how we need to take care of
each<00:00:45.750> other<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:46.770> out<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.430> individual

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
each other and I think out of individual

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.450 
each other and I think out of individual
strength<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.170> excess<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.309> how

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
strength you have excess and that's how

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
strength you have excess and that's how
you<00:00:50.520> care<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.120> other<00:00:51.239> people<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.410> think

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you care for other people and I think

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.470 
you care for other people and I think
that's<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> concept<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.760> young<00:00:54.000> people<00:00:54.180> get

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
that's a concept that young people get

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
that's a concept that young people get
we<00:00:54.660> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.410> want<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> bouldin<00:00:56.100> them<00:00:56.250> to

we want to it we want to bouldin them to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
we want to it we want to bouldin them to
be<00:00:56.460> strong<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.350> turn

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
be strong so that they can then in turn

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.410 
be strong so that they can then in turn
care<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.160> others<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> that's<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.149> our
