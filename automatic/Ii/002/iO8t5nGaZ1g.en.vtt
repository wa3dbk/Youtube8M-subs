in<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.270> usual<00:01:39.689> list<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.340> doesn't

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
in a usual list because then it doesn't

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.700 
in a usual list because then it doesn't
really<00:01:41.970> look<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.899> kind<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> want<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
mimic like operating system and that's

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.530 
mimic like operating system and that's
what<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.670> point<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.299> entire

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
what this the point of this entire

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.990 
what this the point of this entire
footer<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.439> kind<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.649> mimics<00:01:49.860> an<00:01:50.220> operating

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
footer is it kind of mimics an operating

footer is it kind of mimics an operating
system<00:01:51.180> within<00:01:51.509> your<00:01:51.840> browser<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.399> order

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
system within your browser so in order

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.060 
system within your browser so in order
to<00:01:53.850> achieve<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.329> effect<00:01:54.479> what<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.140> did<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.560> we

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
to achieve this effect what we did is we

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.270 
to achieve this effect what we did is we
built<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.549> unordered<00:01:57.450> list<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.590> now

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
built an unordered list in here now

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.429 
built an unordered list in here now
that's<00:01:59.820> why<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> had<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.390> style<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.079> little

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
that's why I had to style it a little

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.889 
that's why I had to style it a little
bit<00:02:01.590> differently<00:02:01.950> because<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:03.030> now<00:02:03.270> we

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
bit differently because right now we

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
bit differently because right now we
already<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.409> an<00:02:04.560> unordered<00:02:05.040> list<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
already have an unordered list the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.999 
already have an unordered list the
entire<00:02:05.610> footer<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.200> list<00:02:07.409> items<00:02:07.829> are

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
entire footer is in the list items are

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.520 
entire footer is in the list items are
buttons<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.209> whenever<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.660> make<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:10.020> unordered

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
buttons so whenever we make an unordered

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.260 
buttons so whenever we make an unordered
list<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.979> here

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
list in here

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.980 
list in here
unordered<00:02:12.870> lists<00:02:14.120> unordered<00:02:15.120> lists<00:02:15.360> what<00:02:15.870> we

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
unordered lists unordered lists what we

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.100 
unordered lists unordered lists what we
need<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.290> do<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.620> we<00:02:16.770> need<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.130> give<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.550> class

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
float to the right-hand side now we

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.800 
float to the right-hand side now we
already<00:05:32.310> said<00:05:32.550> that<00:05:32.580> okay<00:05:33.060> we<00:05:33.210> already<00:05:33.330> styled

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
already said that okay we already styled

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.830 
already said that okay we already styled
all<00:05:33.990> of<00:05:34.139> it<00:05:34.289> so<00:05:34.919> whenever<00:05:35.250> we<00:05:35.729> add<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.509> class

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
all of it so whenever we add the class

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.379 
all of it so whenever we add the class
right<00:05:37.409> to<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.889> list<00:05:38.219> item<00:05:38.430> in<00:05:38.880> other<00:05:39.000> words<00:05:39.270> a

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
right to a list item in other words a

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.209 
right to a list item in other words a
button<00:05:39.690> it<00:05:40.110> takes<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:40.620> button<00:05:40.949> and<00:05:41.069> it

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
button it takes that button and it

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:43.010 
button it takes that button and it
pushes<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:41.909> the<00:05:42.029> right-hand<00:05:42.270> side<00:05:42.750> so

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
pushes it to the right-hand side so

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.439 
pushes it to the right-hand side so
that's<00:05:43.469> why<00:05:43.740> this<00:05:43.800> logout<00:05:44.490> button<00:05:44.550> isn't

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
that's why this logout button isn't

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.120 
that's why this logout button isn't
