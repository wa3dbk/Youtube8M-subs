00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
more conservative I've always been

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.640 
more conservative I've always been
worried<00:03:36.880> about<00:03:37.060> not<00:03:37.240> having<00:03:37.300> money<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.320> grew<00:03:38.620> up

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
worried about not having money I grew up

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.470 
worried about not having money I grew up
with<00:03:39.130> not<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.370> lot<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.640> money<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.210> I'm<00:03:40.270> very

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
with not a lot of money so I'm very

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.230 
with not a lot of money so I'm very
aware<00:03:40.990> of<00:03:41.050> what<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.380> feels<00:03:41.920> like<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.550> I've

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
aware of what that feels like and I've

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.210 
aware of what that feels like and I've
always<00:03:43.570> preferred<00:03:44.020> to<00:03:44.350> have<00:03:44.530> what<00:03:44.800> I<00:03:44.830> needed

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
always preferred to have what I needed

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.800 
always preferred to have what I needed
versus<00:03:45.850> what<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.060> wanted

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
versus what I wanted

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.010 
versus what I wanted
so<00:03:47.020> only<00:03:48.010> until<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.400> had<00:03:48.670> had<00:03:48.820> more<00:03:49.030> money<00:03:49.330> was<00:03:49.900> I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
so only until I had had more money was I

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.290 
so only until I had had more money was I
able<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.350> really<00:03:50.770> purchase<00:03:51.670> for<00:03:51.940> no<00:03:52.090> good

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
able to really purchase for no good

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.520

reason<00:03:53.070> but<00:03:54.070> I<00:03:54.130> love<00:03:54.580> shoes<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.510> clearly<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.410> do

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
reason but I love shoes and clearly I do

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.440 
reason but I love shoes and clearly I do
because<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.130> spent<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.490> last<00:03:57.520> year<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.300> know
