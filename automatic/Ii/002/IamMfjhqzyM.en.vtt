00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.230
 how about friends of the action as they were 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.029
 I hope you find the day very well 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.910
 today I bring you a video of how 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.860
 paint the headlights the modification that 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.310
 know people as black housing 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.070
 it's very simple, let's start 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.260
 locating the headlights and disconnecting with 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.160
 be very careful what the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.160
 spotlights 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.080
 Álvaro very careful not to 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.770
 break them and once we remove the 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.980
 focuses we are going to locate what are the 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:38.030
 screws in the case of my headlights I do not know 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.660
 if 102 were only three screws two 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.580
 that were seven millimeters that came in 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.010
 the sides of the headlights and one that came to 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.040
 the grill that was cross very 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.080
 easy to remove it did not take me long 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.470
 time in that and good once 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.199
 let's take out the lighthouse since we have it to the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.230
 hand let's start to take off what 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.120
 They bring a very very thin silicone is not 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.430
 necessary to use heat gun in 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.130
 this case the truth is that it came out very 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.560
 easy very carefully obviously and a 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.170
 small navajita and I was separating a 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.720
 little by little 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.720
 and as my lighthouse was already a little 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.270
 dirty so good I made the decision to 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.810
 do some other good things 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.010
 I also met several people 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.110
 they say you had to take that 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.030
 piece that better projected the light 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.770
 because then we will see what the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.330
 grace only carries a single screw 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.360
 to eliminate it and well in this 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.390
 case he did it once we opened it 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.220
 the lighthouse we will start to wash it for 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.280
 remove this a residue of dust that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.650
 bring I also use a wax that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.650
 I had kept it there with polish 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.030
 for half the lighthouse and with a mockery 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.610
 I started to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.620
 to clean it 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.800
 in this case I did not like anything else isolate 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.920
 part d 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.799
 a little bit main 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.780
 to start painting it and the truth is 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.330
 that was very simple I bought a 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.400
 painting 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.220
 I was telling you that it was for headlights in cars are 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.320
 in fact and it was very simple once 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.520
 that he finished painting him not only 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.860
 remove the paper and with silicone the pse and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.450
 the lighthouse well reinstalled 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.940
 absolutely what are all the bulbs 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.099
 and I really do something very very 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.980
 simple that looks very good and I can 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.970
 do you us at your house 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.370
 I not long before the two more than an hour 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.319
 I believe 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.750
 I wish you liked the video friends and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.760
 then you should not share it with all your 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 guys and thanks for following us 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.190
 have an excellent day until then 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.190
 Thank you
