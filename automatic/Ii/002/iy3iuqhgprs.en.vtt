00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.170
 1 to 1 but strong emotions reopen the saint 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.940
 paolo after four and a half months and the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.610
 naples you see naples and its audience 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.200
 and in 60,000 almost in the stands that of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.389
 Campania derby 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.029
 training problems for de canio e 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.010
 for blue zemen without the bomber 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.080
 lazio would like the clock and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.199
 the udinese grenade without the goalkeeper 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.119
 sovereign and defender 0 first ball goal 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 after two minutes for la grappa 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.820
 so the napoli is at the ninth 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.250
 jankuloski in the middle all the delay 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.530
 on his cross is the time of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.500
 sovereignty or of a former neighbor left 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.930
 out again in Naples 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.960
 weighs to die I deployed peak 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.670
 arrives well in the air but does not coordinate 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.010
 perfectly 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.309
 tamburini on punishment intervenes 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.270
 left-handed high on the crossbar 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.600
 still left-handed and still on drummers 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.719
 blow by stroke without heel for staples 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.519
 neck right foot and barrel that that 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.670
 replaced his veil and with 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.110
 images mounted from pink ugo we are at 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.540
 eighteenth punishment defended the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.930
 barrel deviation developments on 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.520
 consequent corner jankuloski in the center 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.710
 b the winning deviation 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.890
 one to zero to the nineteenth of the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.049
 danger recovery for Naples 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.890
 faulty left-handed interventions 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.810
 on this shot cross expelled scratches 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 to the twenty-ninth for sum of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.520
 Campedelli's header admonitions 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.229
 right up on the crossbar 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.229
 or case of a draw three minutes conceded 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.390
 from the fourth man 4 says the referee why 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.520
 there was a fan that invaded and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.030
 right on this I in this minute of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.360
 recovery 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.970
 lanzaro after the centered pole you have 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.909
 seen from close up, he scores the goal 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.710
 of one to one 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.960
 the teams were more beautiful and more 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.869
 strong of the controversy of the vigil 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 words left a little too free 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.700
 the two teams in the field sought each other out 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.250
 and they also obstinately searched for the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.349
 result was fine a victory ad 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.690
 both teams to chase the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.849
 series in Naples, perhaps especially 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.840
 considering that next Sunday at the stadium 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.790
 St. Paul 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.090
 will face the league leaders 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.150
 standard b the modena and there will still be 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.129
 the 60,000 two accidents a rocket that a 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.770
 half a game ended in a corner for 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.150
 luck without consequence at least not 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.370
 he knows accordingly until now 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.220
 and stones against the coach of 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.800
 salernitana line maps well yes in 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.750
 indeed effects napoli has wasted 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.160
 a great opportunity to bring us 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.980
 at one point from the fourth in the standings 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.750
 that is to say the como but since I am 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.239
 talking about the ranking maybe worth the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.269
 worth a quick look 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.830
 in the ranking of the cadet championship 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.629
 updated to the twenty-first day 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.360
 ie after this recovery then 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.930
 modena empoli reggina in command with 43 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.390

 palermo 29 cosenza 28 genova 27 messina 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.690
