00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.609
 new video today I introduce you one 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.189
 very small bluetooth speaker from 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.929
 the company anke before like the mini kicker 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.330
 to test after about a week 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:21.029
 has beaten her after the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:23.130
 intro a lot of fun as i dice that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 I thought for the first time in my hands 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 wow is the little one 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 because especially with his light weight of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.130
 only 90 grams fits comfortably anywhere 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.590
 the dimensions of the small speaker 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.059
 are 45 x 45 x 45 cm 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.510
 the scope of delivery consists of the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.649
 Guide a micro usb to usb cable 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.329
 a micro usb aux cable a microfiber 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.579
 pocket around the speaker for sure 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.070
 transport and the small one 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.469
 speakers but why did I want 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.239
 test this speaker because he despite 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.030
 its small size with one nevertheless 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.890
 Surprising sound convinced I will 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.449
 give you now a little audio example 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.280
 However, the sound can be through my 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.030
 microphone and through your speakers 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.030
 something falsified 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.290
 the speaker has a Toggle 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.390
 or off switch and a micro 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.030
 usb input to charge and play 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.980
 of music around the smartphone with the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.020
 to be able to connect this speaker now 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.120
 Settings activates the bluetooth 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.820
 and connects to the anchor pocket 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.800
 speakers before music 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.750
 can play the volume turns 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.940
 rather something down the speaker 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.380
 is very loud 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.180
 Furthermore, the pocket has me with 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.610
 his very long battery life of 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.050
 convinced for twelve whole hours 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.630
 comparable to other big ones 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.700
 speakers, he holds three times as long 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.830
 the speaker is made up very much 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.930
 high quality plastic in the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.510
 gives a noble touch to speakers 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.090
 currently the anchor costs poppe bluetooth 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.430
 loudspeaker of 20 euros what a dubai 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.680
 We are already on the price list 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.330
