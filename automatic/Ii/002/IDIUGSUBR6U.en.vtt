 let's make the light fixture of 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.469
 brake for the sun helmet sl 68 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.640
 Now we will show how the kit works 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.640
 connected to the brake light 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.260
 you can see 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.699
 each time the brake is squeezed 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.089
 turn on the light of the helmet which increases 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.589

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:46.019

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.070

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.090
