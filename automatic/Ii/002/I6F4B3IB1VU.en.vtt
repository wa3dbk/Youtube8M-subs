every time that rabbit takes in a breath
of<00:00:55.829> air<00:00:56.010> he's<00:00:56.399> gonna<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.760> tighter<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
of air he's gonna get tighter and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
of air he's gonna get tighter and
tighter<00:00:57.539> until<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.109> rabbit<00:00:58.440> can't<00:00:58.649> breathe

tighter until that rabbit can't breathe
anymore<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.699> then<00:01:00.030> suffocates<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.809> lot<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
anymore and then suffocates a lot of

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.540 
anymore and then suffocates a lot of
people<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.559> that's<00:01:01.680> possible<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
people think that's possible to that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
people think that's possible to that
it's<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:02.820> suffocation<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> kills<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's not just suffocation that kills the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
it's not just suffocation that kills the
rabbit<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.619> possibly<00:01:05.070> cardiac<00:01:05.700> arrest<00:01:06.090> or<00:01:06.360> or

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
rabbit but possibly cardiac arrest or or

rabbit but possibly cardiac arrest or or
a<00:01:06.810> heart<00:01:07.080> attack<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:08.580> point<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.210> happens

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
a heart attack the point is that happens

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that rat down now because these guys

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.910 
that rat down now because these guys
take<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.270> long<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.600> digest<00:01:16.020> their<00:01:16.170> food<00:01:16.200> they

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
take so long to digest their food they

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
take so long to digest their food they
can<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.220> several<00:01:17.490> months<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.150> possibly<00:01:18.600> even

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
can go several months and possibly even

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.530 
can go several months and possibly even
several<00:01:19.170> years<00:01:19.740> without<00:01:20.070> eating<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
several years without eating because it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.850 
several years without eating because it
takes<00:01:21.720> them<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:21.960> long<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.500> food<00:01:22.710> from

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
takes them so long to get that food from

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.770 
takes them so long to get that food from
one<00:01:23.070> end<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> other<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.570> long

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
one end to the other and that's a long

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
one end to the other and that's a long
way<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.290> sink<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.799> size<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.310> guy

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
way for a sink of this size this guy

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.370 
way for a sink of this size this guy
