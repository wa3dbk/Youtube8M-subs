pretty addicting to do that and
apparently<00:01:48.960> I've<00:01:49.320> broken<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.799> bone<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
apparently I've broken my bone and I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.249 
apparently I've broken my bone and I
don't<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.600> anything<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
don't think I have anything for that

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
don't think I have anything for that
it's<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.250> an<00:01:53.399> use<00:01:53.579> cloth<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.570> can

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it's like an use cloth so what you can

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.539 
it's like an use cloth so what you can
do<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.049> click<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.500> items<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.490> your

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
do is you click the items in your

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.280 
do is you click the items in your
inventory<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.479> equip<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> equip

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
inventory then you can equip the equip

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.560 
inventory then you can equip the equip
whatever<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.420> there<00:02:00.420> is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
whatever you want to do there is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.270 
whatever you want to do there is
crapping<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.520> make<00:02:02.780> tools<00:02:03.780> instead

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
crapping so you can make tools instead

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.030 
crapping so you can make tools instead
so<00:02:04.640> let<00:02:04.909> me<00:02:04.970> see<00:02:05.210> something<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.830> mean<00:02:06.830> can<00:02:06.979> I

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
so let me see something I mean can I

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.370 
so let me see something I mean can I
drag<00:02:07.490> stuff<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.270> mean<00:02:08.660> I'm<00:02:08.720> put<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.020> pretty<00:02:09.259> much

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
drag stuff I mean I'm put is pretty much

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.870 
drag stuff I mean I'm put is pretty much
the<00:02:09.440> first<00:02:09.679> time<00:02:10.100> I've<00:02:10.250> ever<00:02:10.280> play<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:10.700> this

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
the first time I've ever play in this

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.309 
the first time I've ever play in this
but<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:12.770> guess<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.580> can't<00:02:13.790> actually<00:02:14.230> blending<00:02:15.230> in

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
but I guess I can't actually blending in

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.920 
but I guess I can't actually blending in
there<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.590> then<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.770> have<00:02:15.890> skills<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.480> you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
there and then you have skills so you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.360 
there and then you have skills so you
get<00:02:18.080> experience<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.740> can<00:02:18.860> crease<00:02:19.010> your<00:02:19.100> skill

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
get experience you can crease your skill

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.800 
get experience you can crease your skill
so<00:02:19.490> that's<00:02:19.670> actually<00:02:19.819> pretty<00:02:20.090> interesting<00:02:20.390> so

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
so that's actually pretty interesting so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.479 
so that's actually pretty interesting so
I<00:02:21.080> guess<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.470> really<00:02:21.650> need<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.950> level<00:02:22.220> up<00:02:22.370> in

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
I guess you really need to level up in

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.360 
I guess you really need to level up in
this<00:02:22.580> game<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.030> survive<00:02:23.590> really<00:02:24.590> badly<00:02:24.860> like

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
this game to survive really badly like

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.520 
this game to survive really badly like
really<00:02:26.180> really<00:02:26.360> bad<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.290> Games<00:02:27.470> supposed

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
really really bad so this Games supposed

to be multiplayer but I can't I don't

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.910 
to be multiplayer but I can't I don't
think<00:02:29.600> any<00:02:29.690> servers<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.709> see<00:02:30.860> you

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
some other cool stuff alright i'm

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.060 
some other cool stuff alright i'm
approaching<00:02:35.420> zombie<00:02:35.989> town<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.500> gets<00:02:36.890> there

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
approaching zombie town so I gets there

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.460 
approaching zombie town so I gets there
my<00:02:37.280> leg<00:02:37.519> was<00:02:38.120> broken<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.780> i<00:02:39.200> guess<00:02:39.440> like

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
my leg was broken so i guess like

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.050 
my leg was broken so i guess like
breaking<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.100> automatically<00:02:40.610> recovers

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
breaking just automatically recovers

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.640 
breaking just automatically recovers
itself<00:02:41.450> because<00:02:41.720> now<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:41.959> can<00:02:42.050> actually<00:02:42.260> run

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
itself because now I can actually run

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.070 
itself because now I can actually run
thank<00:02:43.430> god<00:02:43.610> there's<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.330> food<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.900> water

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
thank god there's the food and water

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.870 
thank god there's the food and water
thing<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.470> course<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.100> actually<00:02:46.280> takes<00:02:46.700> to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
thing of course so it actually takes to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.460 
thing of course so it actually takes to
a<00:02:47.030> hundred<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:47.810> one<00:02:47.900> hundred<00:02:48.110> percent<00:02:48.140> means

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
a hundred so one hundred percent means

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.680 
a hundred so one hundred percent means
you're<00:02:48.680> probably<00:02:48.860> dead<00:02:49.100> there<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.060> radiation

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690
