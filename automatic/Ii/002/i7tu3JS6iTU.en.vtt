soon as you get here that's when you
extend<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.840> kick<00:04:40.110> take<00:04:40.440> your<00:04:40.590> time<00:04:40.650> come<00:04:41.220> on

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
extend that kick take your time come on

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.399 
extend that kick take your time come on
down<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.750> need<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.110> really<00:04:43.320> really

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
down so you need to do a really really

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.140 
down so you need to do a really really
fast<00:04:43.770> hi<00:04:43.979> I'm<00:04:44.130> floating<00:04:44.490> whatever
