00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
things got a little bit crazy in the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.350 
things got a little bit crazy in the
clan<00:00:14.130> people<00:00:14.429> were<00:00:14.519> pretty<00:00:14.670> mad<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.179> lost

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
clan people were pretty mad that we lost

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.510 
clan people were pretty mad that we lost
by<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.690> much<00:00:15.900> but<00:00:16.139> since<00:00:16.500> then<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:17.190> have<00:00:17.340> gone

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
by that much but since then we have gone

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.400 
by that much but since then we have gone
on<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> tear<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.300> we've<00:00:18.449> won<00:00:18.660> three-straight

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
on a tear and we've won three-straight

on a tear and we've won three-straight
clan<00:00:19.680> wars<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.789> think<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.210> won<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> first

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
got matched up with private enemy

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
here he's one of my code leaders and it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.630 
here he's one of my code leaders and it
looks<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.800> he<00:00:43.890> dropped<00:00:44.129> his<00:00:44.280> lightning

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
looks like he dropped his lightning

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
looks like he dropped his lightning
spell<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> very<00:00:45.300> beginning<00:00:45.750> which<00:00:45.899> was

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
spell in the very beginning which was

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.110 
spell in the very beginning which was
really<00:00:46.379> bold<00:00:46.860> because<00:00:47.160> sometimes<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.910> don't

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
really bold because sometimes you don't

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.029 
really bold because sometimes you don't
take<00:00:48.420> care<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> witch<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.649> spell

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
take care of the witch in one spell

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.410 
take care of the witch in one spell
sometimes<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> little<00:00:51.090> bit<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> health

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
sometimes there's a little bit of health

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
sometimes there's a little bit of health
left<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> witch<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> happened

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
left in the witch and if that happened

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.340 
left in the witch and if that happened
then<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.719> spawned<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.140> ton

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
then the which would have spawned a ton

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.510 
then the which would have spawned a ton
of<00:00:55.379> skeletons<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.010> things<00:00:56.100> could<00:00:56.430> have

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
of skeletons and things could have

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.189 
of skeletons and things could have
gotten<00:00:56.670> dangerous<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.360> turns<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
gotten dangerous but turns out the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.510 
gotten dangerous but turns out the
Lightning<00:00:58.469> spell<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.710> perfect<00:00:59.070> looks<00:00:59.399> like

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
Lightning spell is perfect looks like

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.250 
Lightning spell is perfect looks like
he's<00:00:59.670> using<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.030> gowiwi<00:01:00.270> strategy<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.050> let's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
he's using the gowiwi strategy and let's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
he's using the gowiwi strategy and let's
see<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.559> happens<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.820> looks<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.090> he

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
see what happens so it looks like he

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.080 
see what happens so it looks like he
decided<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> attack<00:01:04.140> from<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> top<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
decided to attack from the top and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.280 
decided to attack from the top and
instead<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> bottom<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
instead of the bottom for this one and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.539 
instead of the bottom for this one and
that's<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:07.619> pretty<00:01:07.860> smart<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.460> of

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that's actually pretty smart a lot of

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.679 
that's actually pretty smart a lot of
people<00:01:08.760> might<00:01:08.880> attack<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> bottom

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
people might attack from the bottom

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.899 
people might attack from the bottom
because<00:01:10.020> there's<00:01:10.830> only<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:11.100> layer<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.520> layers

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
because there's only two layer of layers

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
because there's only two layer of layers
of<00:01:12.090> walls<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.450> fact<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.900> would<00:01:13.170> probably<00:01:13.320> attack

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
of walls in fact I would probably attack

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.630 
of walls in fact I would probably attack
through<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> bottom<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.549> I'm

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
through the bottom just because I'm

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
through the bottom just because I'm
stubborn<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.360> level<00:01:15.600> forty<00:01:16.140> Heroes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
stubborn and I have level forty Heroes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.649 
stubborn and I have level forty Heroes
but<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> looks<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.060> more<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
but here it looks like more of the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.910 
but here it looks like more of the
defenses<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> bottom<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
defenses are on the bottom like the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
defenses are on the bottom like the
cannons<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.400> archer<00:01:20.700> tower<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.150> he

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
cannons in the archer tower so he

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
cannons in the archer tower so he
decided<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> attack<00:01:22.080> through<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> top<00:01:22.530> he

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
decided to attack through the top he

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.380 
decided to attack through the top he
decided<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.549> through<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.850> those<00:01:24.030> level

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
decided to go through all those level

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
decided to go through all those level
seven<00:01:24.810> walls<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.409> from<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.189> he<00:01:26.310> made<00:01:26.460> his

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
seven walls and from there he made his

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.429 
seven walls and from there he made his
way<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> townhall<00:01:27.210> pretty<00:01:27.450> easily<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
way to the townhall pretty easily so it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.690

can see my boy torito's going in and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.550 
can see my boy torito's going in and
he's<00:02:22.090> using<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> balloon<00:02:22.690> minion<00:02:23.110> strategy

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
he's using the balloon minion strategy

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.580 
he's using the balloon minion strategy
so<00:02:24.250> attacking<00:02:24.550> from<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.060> top<00:02:25.270> left<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.870> yeah

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
so attacking from the top left and yeah

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.810 
so attacking from the top left and yeah
it<00:02:26.740> looks<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:27.040> he's<00:02:27.250> doing<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.460> pretty<00:02:27.580> good

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
it looks like he's doing a pretty good

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.160 
it looks like he's doing a pretty good
job<00:02:27.940> he's<00:02:28.120> dropped<00:02:28.330> his<00:02:28.450> rage<00:02:28.600> spells<00:02:28.870> already

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
job he's dropped his rage spells already

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.780 
job he's dropped his rage spells already
they're<00:02:29.350> going<00:02:29.560> towards<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.860> center<00:02:30.010> didn't

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
they're going towards the center didn't

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.250 
they're going towards the center didn't
even<00:02:30.880> care<00:02:31.120> about<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:31.390> clan<00:02:31.600> castle<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:32.110> guess

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
even care about the clan castle I guess

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.480 
even care about the clan castle I guess
you<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:32.530> do<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.830> with<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> balloon<00:02:33.220> minion

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
you can do that with the balloon minion

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.070 
you can do that with the balloon minion
strategy<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.270> looks<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.720> ones<00:02:34.960> on

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
strategy and it looks like the ones on

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.330 
strategy and it looks like the ones on
the<00:02:35.170> Left<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.530> already<00:02:35.890> made<00:02:36.010> their<00:02:36.190> way

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the Left have already made their way

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.730 
the Left have already made their way
inside<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.670> base<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.810> right<00:02:37.930> now<00:02:38.080> since<00:02:38.440> he<00:02:38.620> is

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
inside the base so right now since he is

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.230 
inside the base so right now since he is
using<00:02:38.920> balloon<00:02:39.250> minion<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.700> balloons<00:02:40.000> will

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
using balloon minion the balloons will

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.790 
using balloon minion the balloons will
not<00:02:40.420> attack<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> Town<00:02:41.080> Hall<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.500> he's<00:02:41.680> gonna

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
not attack the Town Hall so he's gonna

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.800 
not attack the Town Hall so he's gonna
have<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.100> make<00:02:42.310> sure<00:02:42.370> his<00:02:42.670> minions<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.300> his

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
have to make sure his minions and his

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.050 
have to make sure his minions and his
wizards<00:02:44.170> attack<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.700> looks<00:02:45.910> like

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
wizards attack that and it looks like

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.040 
wizards attack that and it looks like
he's<00:02:46.180> not<00:02:46.210> gonna<00:02:46.420> be<00:02:46.600> able<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.840> reach<00:02:47.020> that

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
he's not gonna be able to reach that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.140 
he's not gonna be able to reach that
second<00:02:47.710> Inferno<00:02:48.160> tower<00:02:48.520> so<00:02:48.730> at<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:48.940> point

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
second Inferno tower so at this point

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.000 
second Inferno tower so at this point
he's<00:02:49.270> at<00:02:49.390> 36%<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.290> he<00:02:50.350> still<00:02:50.560> has<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.770> lot<00:02:50.950> of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
he's at 36% but he still has a lot of

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.740 
he's at 36% but he still has a lot of
minions<00:02:51.280> as<00:02:51.550> well<00:02:51.790> as<00:02:51.940> those<00:02:52.060> wizards<00:02:52.570> right

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
minions as well as those wizards right

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.000 
minions as well as those wizards right
there<00:02:52.900> if<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.290> see<00:02:53.440> those<00:02:53.590> behind<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
there if you can see those behind the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.830 
there if you can see those behind the
Town<00:02:54.160> Hall<00:02:54.340> those<00:02:55.000> are<00:02:55.240> actually<00:02:55.570> gonna<00:02:55.660> be

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
Town Hall those are actually gonna be

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.750 
Town Hall those are actually gonna be
clutch<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.440> do<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.710> final<00:02:56.920> damage<00:02:57.280> against

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
clutch and do the final damage against

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.490 
clutch and do the final damage against
the<00:02:57.850> Town<00:02:58.030> Hall<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:58.990> looks<00:02:59.110> like<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.350> rates

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the Town Hall so it looks like the rates

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.440 
the Town Hall so it looks like the rates
pretty<00:02:59.680> good<00:02:59.800> right<00:02:59.920> now<00:02:59.950> he's<00:03:00.280> at<00:03:00.400> 45%<00:03:01.060> he's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
pretty good right now he's at 45% he's

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.300 
pretty good right now he's at 45% he's
gonna<00:03:01.570> activate<00:03:02.020> his<00:03:02.110> King<00:03:02.320> with<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.680> Iron

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
gonna activate his King with the Iron

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.980 
gonna activate his King with the Iron
Fist<00:03:03.340> ability<00:03:03.820> it's<00:03:04.000> gonna<00:03:04.120> go<00:03:04.270> beast<00:03:04.510> mode<00:03:04.600> it

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
Fist ability it's gonna go beast mode it

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.480 
Fist ability it's gonna go beast mode it
looks<00:03:05.230> like<00:03:05.350> it's<00:03:05.530> actually<00:03:05.680> gonna<00:03:06.040> Duke<00:03:06.340> out

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
looks like it's actually gonna Duke out

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.640 
looks like it's actually gonna Duke out
with<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:06.970> level<00:03:07.510> 15<00:03:07.900> King<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.290> take<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.500> out

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
with this level 15 King and take it out

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.530 
with this level 15 King and take it out
so<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.490> was<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.640> good<00:03:09.820> showdown<00:03:10.180> right<00:03:10.330> there

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
so that was a good showdown right there

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.210 
so that was a good showdown right there
and<00:03:10.690> even<00:03:11.320> though<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.500> King<00:03:11.680> died<00:03:11.830> he<00:03:12.010> dropped

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and even though the King died he dropped

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.500 
and even though the King died he dropped
his<00:03:12.340> Archer<00:03:12.550> Queen<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.850> bottom<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.360> that

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
his Archer Queen on the bottom and that

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.720 
his Archer Queen on the bottom and that
got<00:03:13.690> him<00:03:13.720> 50%<00:03:14.410> for<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.590> raid<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:14.950> another<00:03:15.550> two

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
got him 50% for the raid so another two

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.220 
got him 50% for the raid so another two
stars<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.209> Town<00:03:16.360> Hall<00:03:16.480> 10<00:03:16.720> definitely

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.230 
stars on the Town Hall 10 definitely

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
pretty good and at this point we were

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.390 
pretty good and at this point we were
sort<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.570> coasting<00:03:20.110> I'm<00:03:20.320> not<00:03:20.650> gonna<00:03:20.770> lie<00:03:20.980> this

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
sort of coasting I'm not gonna lie this

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.340 
sort of coasting I'm not gonna lie this
was<00:03:21.610> one<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.090> most<00:03:22.390> casual<00:03:22.870> clan

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
was one of like the most casual clan

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.710 
was one of like the most casual clan
wars<00:03:23.620> we've<00:03:23.830> been<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.280> far<00:03:24.420> there<00:03:25.420> wasn't<00:03:25.690> a

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
wars we've been in so far there wasn't a

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.390 
wars we've been in so far there wasn't a
lot<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.900> strategy<00:03:26.380> going<00:03:26.530> on<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:26.890> chat<00:03:27.130> we

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
lot of strategy going on in the chat we

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.190 
lot of strategy going on in the chat we
got<00:03:27.580> off<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.880> really<00:03:28.150> big<00:03:28.450> lead<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.020> very

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
got off to a really big lead in the very

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.320 
got off to a really big lead in the very
beginning<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.770> we<00:03:30.400> sort<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.730> held<00:03:30.910> on<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.209> it

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
beginning and we sort of held on to it

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.050 
beginning and we sort of held on to it
for<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.570> long<00:03:31.959> time<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.680> end<00:03:32.860> so<00:03:33.459> really

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
for a long time and to the end so really

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.550 
for a long time and to the end so really
like<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.570> attacks<00:03:34.870> are<00:03:35.050> really<00:03:35.200> slow<00:03:35.530> I

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
like the attacks are really slow I

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.440 
like the attacks are really slow I
didn't<00:03:35.980> do<00:03:36.070> my<00:03:36.190> attacks<00:03:36.520> on<00:03:36.730> my<00:03:36.820> main<00:03:37.060> cheap<00:03:37.300> at

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
didn't do my attacks on my main cheap at

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.880 
didn't do my attacks on my main cheap at
account<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:37.900> with<00:03:38.170> like<00:03:38.320> 30<00:03:38.590> minutes

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
account I think with like 30 minutes

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.220 
account I think with like 30 minutes
left<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.310> did<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:39.600> but<00:03:40.600> overall<00:03:40.900> there's<00:03:41.170> a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
left I did it but overall there's a

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.810 
left I did it but overall there's a
little<00:03:41.440> bit<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.680> snoozer<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.340> we<00:03:42.459> didn't<00:03:42.670> put

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
little bit of a snoozer so we didn't put

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.150 
little bit of a snoozer so we didn't put
too<00:03:43.030> much<00:03:43.180> effort<00:03:43.360> into<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:44.020> but<00:03:44.620> let's<00:03:44.980> see<00:03:45.070> if

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
too much effort into it but let's see if

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.130 
too much effort into it but let's see if
we<00:03:45.250> can<00:03:45.370> shake<00:03:46.150> up<00:03:46.270> did<00:03:46.420> on<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:46.600> next<00:03:46.810> raid<00:03:46.989> so

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
we can shake up did on this next raid so

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.810 
we can shake up did on this next raid so
he's<00:03:47.290> already<00:03:47.440> baited<00:03:47.739> out<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.100> clan<00:03:48.489> castle

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
he's already baited out the clan castle

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.390 
he's already baited out the clan castle
troops<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.300> if<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.290> looked<00:03:50.500> up<00:03:50.620> earlier<00:03:51.160> when

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
troops and if you looked up earlier when

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.430 
troops and if you looked up earlier when
he<00:03:51.430> dropped<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.820> hog<00:03:52.090> all<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.900> clan<00:03:53.080> castle

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
he dropped that hog all the clan castle

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.020 
he dropped that hog all the clan castle
troops<00:03:53.470> were<00:03:53.800> already<00:03:54.010> together<00:03:54.400> in<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.850> giant

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
troops were already together in a giant

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.390 
troops were already together in a giant
group<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:55.959> at<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.230> point<00:03:56.440> he<00:03:56.560> could<00:03:56.980> drop<00:03:57.250> his

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
group so at that point he could drop his

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.770 
group so at that point he could drop his
lightning<00:03:57.760> spell<00:03:57.940> right<00:03:58.120> then<00:03:58.360> he<00:03:58.540> didn't

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
lightning spell right then he didn't

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.880 
lightning spell right then he didn't
have<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:58.989> wait<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.350> bring<00:03:59.500> him<00:03:59.620> all<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.800> way

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
have to wait to bring him all the way

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.500 
have to wait to bring him all the way
over<00:04:00.160> here<00:04:00.190> he<00:04:00.880> could<00:04:01.060> have<00:04:01.150> dropped<00:04:01.300> his

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
over here he could have dropped his

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.390 
over here he could have dropped his
lightning<00:04:01.810> spell<00:04:01.959> earlier<00:04:02.410> in<00:04:02.650> fact<00:04:03.220> that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
lightning spell earlier in fact that

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.590 
lightning spell earlier in fact that
lighting<00:04:03.640> spell<00:04:03.790> actually<00:04:04.209> wasn't<00:04:04.390> that

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
lighting spell actually wasn't that

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.090 
lighting spell actually wasn't that
great<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:04.930> at<00:04:05.170> this<00:04:05.260> point<00:04:05.410> things<00:04:05.770> are<00:04:05.890> going

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
great so at this point things are going

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.729 
great so at this point things are going
okay<00:04:06.370> he<00:04:06.550> dropped<00:04:06.790> his<00:04:06.940> barbarian<00:04:07.420> King<00:04:07.739> maybe

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
okay he dropped his barbarian King maybe

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.140 
okay he dropped his barbarian King maybe
a<00:04:08.830> little<00:04:09.040> bit<00:04:09.220> too<00:04:09.370> early<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:09.910> guy<00:04:10.000> got

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
a little bit too early so that guy got

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.729 
a little bit too early so that guy got
shot<00:04:10.390> down<00:04:10.540> fairly<00:04:10.810> easily<00:04:11.080> but<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.560> looks

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
shot down fairly easily but it looks

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:12.840 
shot down fairly easily but it looks
like<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.980> clan<00:04:12.130> castle<00:04:12.459> troops<00:04:12.489> are<00:04:12.760> gonna

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
like the clan castle troops are gonna

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.460 
like the clan castle troops are gonna
take<00:04:13.060> care<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.330> archer<00:04:13.570> Queen<00:04:13.600> and<00:04:14.020> at

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
take care of the archer Queen and at

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.840 
take care of the archer Queen and at
this<00:04:14.590> point<00:04:14.770> he's<00:04:14.890> completely<00:04:15.280> fine<00:04:15.520> even

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
this point he's completely fine even

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.190 
this point he's completely fine even
though<00:04:16.060> things<00:04:16.239> weren't<00:04:16.540> perfect<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:17.109> the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
though things weren't perfect in the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.960 
though things weren't perfect in the
very<00:04:17.350> beginning<00:04:17.650> he<00:04:17.919> still<00:04:18.070> has<00:04:18.220> his<00:04:18.310> hogs<00:04:18.549> all

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
very beginning he still has his hogs all

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.610 
very beginning he still has his hogs all
of<00:04:19.270> the<00:04:19.359> clan<00:04:19.539> castle<00:04:19.870> troops<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.440> king

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
of the clan castle troops and the king

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.290 
of the clan castle troops and the king
and<00:04:20.710> queen<00:04:20.859> have<00:04:21.070> been<00:04:21.190> destroyed<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:22.090> as<00:04:22.180> long

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
and queen have been destroyed so as long

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.000 
and queen have been destroyed so as long
as<00:04:22.360> he<00:04:22.539> drops<00:04:22.750> his<00:04:22.900> heal<00:04:23.050> spells<00:04:23.289> perfectly

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
as he drops his heal spells perfectly

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.290 
as he drops his heal spells perfectly
he<00:04:24.160> should<00:04:24.370> be<00:04:24.490> able<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.700> get<00:04:24.790> three<00:04:24.970> stars<00:04:25.090> in

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
he should be able to get three stars in

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.060 
he should be able to get three stars in
his<00:04:25.390> face<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:26.230> that<00:04:26.350> was<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.470> great<00:04:26.620> heal<00:04:26.860> spell

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
his face so that was a great heal spell

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.290 
his face so that was a great heal spell
right<00:04:27.250> there<00:04:27.400> he<00:04:27.550> dropped<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:27.880> right<00:04:28.120> in<00:04:28.240> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
right there he dropped that right in the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.850 
right there he dropped that right in the
middle<00:04:28.540> of<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.750> Giant<00:04:29.080> Bomb<00:04:29.110> into<00:04:29.560> wizard

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
middle of the Giant Bomb into wizard

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.470 
middle of the Giant Bomb into wizard
towers<00:04:30.190> so<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.760> was<00:04:30.850> probably<00:04:31.000> one<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
towers so that was probably one of the

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.910 
towers so that was probably one of the
most<00:04:31.660> effective<00:04:32.140> heal<00:04:32.260> spells<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.620> can<00:04:32.740> do

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
most effective heal spells you can do

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.040 
most effective heal spells you can do
looks<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:34.090> he<00:04:34.270> did<00:04:34.450> bait<00:04:34.630> out<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:34.930> other

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
looks like he did bait out that other

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.510 
looks like he did bait out that other
Giant<00:04:35.410> Bomb<00:04:35.440> which<00:04:35.710> didn't<00:04:35.980> get<00:04:36.040> ahold<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.370> any

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
Giant Bomb which didn't get ahold of any

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.340 
Giant Bomb which didn't get ahold of any
of<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.730> hog<00:04:36.880> riders<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.330> like<00:04:37.420> I<00:04:37.540> said<00:04:37.600> giant

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
of the hog riders and like I said giant

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.660 
of the hog riders and like I said giant
bombs<00:04:38.560> are<00:04:38.710> pretty<00:04:38.950> much<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.280> number<00:04:39.550> one

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
bombs are pretty much the number one

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.340 
bombs are pretty much the number one
enemy<00:04:39.850> of<00:04:40.030> hog<00:04:40.300> riders<00:04:40.600> so<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.840> fact<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.140> he

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
enemy of hog riders so the fact that he

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.140 
enemy of hog riders so the fact that he
got<00:04:41.530> two<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.860> those<00:04:41.950> out<00:04:42.100> of<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.310> way<00:04:42.340> without

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
got two of those out of the way without

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.180 
got two of those out of the way without
even<00:04:43.390> flinching<00:04:43.510> was<00:04:44.380> pretty<00:04:44.590> solid<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.010> looks

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
even flinching was pretty solid it looks

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.320 
even flinching was pretty solid it looks
like<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.430> third<00:04:45.580> giant<00:04:45.910> bomb<00:04:46.000> went<00:04:46.210> off<00:04:46.240> right

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
like the third giant bomb went off right

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.210 
like the third giant bomb went off right
there<00:04:46.570> only<00:04:46.900> affected<00:04:47.290> one<00:04:47.470> hog<00:04:47.680> rider<00:04:47.920> maybe

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
there only affected one hog rider maybe

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.920 
there only affected one hog rider maybe
two<00:04:48.430> hog<00:04:48.580> riders<00:04:48.910> so<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.450> was<00:04:49.570> another<00:04:49.750> win

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
two hog riders so that was another win

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.270 
two hog riders so that was another win
and<00:04:50.110> at<00:04:50.410> this<00:04:50.560> point<00:04:50.740> he's<00:04:50.980> pretty<00:04:51.190> much

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
and at this point he's pretty much

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.560 
and at this point he's pretty much
coasting<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:51.820> he<00:04:52.000> should<00:04:52.150> be<00:04:52.180> able<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.420> win

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
coasting and he should be able to win

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.660 
coasting and he should be able to win
this<00:04:52.720> rate<00:04:52.870> easily<00:04:53.230> so<00:04:54.070> after<00:04:54.100> he<00:04:54.340> takes<00:04:54.520> care

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
this rate easily so after he takes care

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.220 
this rate easily so after he takes care
of<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.820> mortar<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.420> two<00:04:55.600> archer<00:04:55.930> towers

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
of the mortar and the two archer towers

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.360 
of the mortar and the two archer towers
looks<00:04:56.440> like<00:04:56.590> that's<00:04:56.770> gonna<00:04:56.890> do<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.130> for<00:04:57.250> this

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
looks like that's gonna do it for this

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.310 
looks like that's gonna do it for this
one<00:04:57.550> can<00:04:58.180> go<00:04:58.240> ahead<00:04:58.420> and<00:04:58.510> go<00:04:58.600> in<00:04:58.750> Cooper's

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
one can go ahead and go in Cooper's

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.840 
one can go ahead and go in Cooper's
control<00:04:59.650> through<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.890> end<00:05:00.040> of<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.370> fast

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
control through the end of it and fast

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.160 
control through the end of it and fast
forward<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.360> that<00:05:01.510> should<00:05:01.720> do<00:05:01.840> it<00:05:01.870> for<00:05:01.990> this

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
forward and that should do it for this

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.500 
forward and that should do it for this

Ekans and stuff that people didn't want

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.970 
Ekans and stuff that people didn't want
so<00:06:37.780> usually<00:06:38.140> I've<00:06:38.260> just<00:06:38.440> been<00:06:38.560> going<00:06:38.740> down

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
so usually I've just been going down

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.710 
so usually I've just been going down
base<00:06:39.220> by<00:06:39.400> base<00:06:39.550> and<00:06:39.850> donating<00:06:40.210> witches<00:06:40.570> and

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
base by base and donating witches and

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.180 
base by base and donating witches and
you<00:06:41.170> can<00:06:41.290> see<00:06:41.500> here<00:06:41.740> it's<00:06:41.860> worked<00:06:42.070> out

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
you can see here it's worked out

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.670 
you can see here it's worked out
extremely<00:06:42.670> well<00:06:42.880> so<00:06:43.600> I'm<00:06:43.870> sort<00:06:44.110> of<00:06:44.170> deciding

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
extremely well so I'm sort of deciding

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.290 
extremely well so I'm sort of deciding
what<00:06:44.830> the<00:06:44.950> best<00:06:45.160> clan<00:06:45.400> castle<00:06:45.760> troop<00:06:45.940> is<00:06:46.120> right

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
what the best clan castle troop is right

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.390 
what the best clan castle troop is right
now<00:06:46.450> for<00:06:46.810> defense<00:06:47.290> and<00:06:47.560> I<00:06:47.980> think<00:06:48.160> it<00:06:48.250> really

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
now for defense and I think it really

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.130 
now for defense and I think it really
varies<00:06:49.000> depending<00:06:49.690> what<00:06:49.840> you're<00:06:49.990> being

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
varies depending what you're being

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.530 
varies depending what you're being
attacked<00:06:50.290> with<00:06:50.710> so<00:06:51.250> things<00:06:51.700> like<00:06:51.910> dragons<00:06:52.420> are

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
attacked with so things like dragons are

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.120 
attacked with so things like dragons are
actually<00:06:52.990> really<00:06:53.260> good<00:06:53.380> for<00:06:53.560> like<00:06:53.710> hog<00:06:53.890> rider

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
actually really good for like hog rider

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.220 
actually really good for like hog rider
raids<00:06:54.400> but<00:06:55.180> they're<00:06:55.300> really<00:06:55.510> poor<00:06:55.780> against

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
raids but they're really poor against

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.330 
raids but they're really poor against
other<00:06:56.380> type<00:06:56.620> of<00:06:56.650> raids<00:06:56.920> that<00:06:57.100> you're<00:06:57.190> getting

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
other type of raids that you're getting

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.070 
other type of raids that you're getting
attacked<00:06:57.490> by<00:06:57.820> so<00:06:58.420> I<00:06:58.450> think<00:06:58.570> it<00:06:58.780> sort<00:06:58.930> of

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
attacked by so I think it sort of

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.960 
attacked by so I think it sort of
depends<00:06:59.410> but<00:06:59.620> in<00:06:59.830> general<00:07:00.280> witches<00:07:00.640> seem<00:07:00.850> to

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
depends but in general witches seem to

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.460 
depends but in general witches seem to
be<00:07:01.060> something<00:07:01.420> that<00:07:01.570> works<00:07:01.690> out<00:07:01.930> really<00:07:02.110> well

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
be something that works out really well

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.310 
be something that works out really well
no<00:07:03.280> matter<00:07:03.490> what<00:07:03.760> type<00:07:03.970> of<00:07:04.050> army<00:07:05.050> composition

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320
