00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
actually making some of these

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730 
actually making some of these
expressions<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.119> helps<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
expressions that really helps to in the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.330 
expressions that really helps to in the
