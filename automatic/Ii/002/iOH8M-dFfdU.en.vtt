00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.410 
second and then kind of just drifts out
this<00:01:29.130> time<00:01:29.310> he's<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.610> doing<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> usually

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
this time he's not doing that usually

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.170 
this time he's not doing that usually
receivers<00:01:30.840> are<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.439> very<00:01:31.560> basic<00:01:31.860> route<00:01:32.369> here

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
receivers are on very basic route here

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670 
receivers are on very basic route here
the<00:01:33.420> receivers<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:33.900> running<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.350> complex

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the receivers are running really complex

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
the receivers are running really complex
routes<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.540> really

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
routes and so it's going to be really

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.910 
routes and so it's going to be really
hard<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.290> opponent<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.799> this

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
hard for your opponent to see this

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
hard for your opponent to see this
screen<00:01:38.189> coming<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.720> want<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.020> follow

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
screen coming you just want to follow

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.020 
screen coming you just want to follow
your<00:01:43.470> blockers<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:44.850> how<00:01:44.970> we

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
your blockers you can see here how we

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.490 
your blockers you can see here how we
kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.299> ran<00:01:45.420> straight<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.079> sideline

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
kind of ran straight to the sideline

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
kind of ran straight to the sideline
first<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.549> cut<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.790> up<00:01:47.880> field<00:01:48.030> you'll

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
first and then we cut it up field you'll

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.429 
first and then we cut it up field you'll
want<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.840> your<00:01:48.930> blockers<00:01:49.170> can

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
want to do that so your blockers can

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.090 
want to do that so your blockers can
pick<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.740> those<00:01:49.860> defenders<00:01:51.920> again<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.040> is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
pick up those defenders again this is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.080 
pick up those defenders again this is
pretty<00:01:53.310> much<00:01:53.399> how<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> place<00:01:53.820> should<00:01:53.970> look

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
pretty much how the place should look

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
pretty much how the place should look
just<00:01:54.240> put<00:01:54.329> your<00:01:54.390> tie<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> streak

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
just put your tie down on a streak

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.810 
just put your tie down on a streak
running<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.159> an<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.369> route<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
running back on an out route in the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
running back on an out route in the
motion<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> left<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.799> whatever

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
motion to the left I'm gonna do whatever

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.440 
motion to the left I'm gonna do whatever
you<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> left<00:01:59.670> side<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> field

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.040 

and<00:02:04.450> then<00:02:04.540> we're<00:02:04.660> just<00:02:04.690> going<00:02:04.870> to<00:02:04.930> run

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
and then we're just going to run

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.330 
and then we're just going to run
straight<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.530> sideline<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:05.920> then<00:02:06.100> cut<00:02:06.250> it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
straight to the sideline and then cut it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.219 
straight to the sideline and then cut it
up<00:02:06.430> field<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:07.180> can<00:02:07.300> see<00:02:07.390> it's<00:02:07.540> an<00:02:07.600> easy<00:02:07.840> 15

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.020 
up field and you can see it's an easy 15
yards<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.470> doesn't<00:02:08.679> look<00:02:08.740> like<00:02:08.800> 15<00:02:09.190> 15<00:02:09.850> yards

halfway<00:02:15.940> decent<00:02:15.970> offensive<00:02:16.330> line<00:02:16.720> which<00:02:16.840> we

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
halfway decent offensive line which we

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.180 
halfway decent offensive line which we
don't<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.260> it'll<00:02:17.620> work<00:02:17.710> better<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:18.100> an

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
don't have it'll work better with an

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.430 
don't have it'll work better with an
offensive<00:02:18.610> line<00:02:18.730> that's<00:02:18.880> good<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.170> speedy

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
offensive line that's good and a speedy

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.500 
offensive line that's good and a speedy
running<00:02:20.740> back<00:02:20.860> which<00:02:20.980> we<00:02:21.100> have<00:02:21.250> here<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
running back which we have here so the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.760 
running back which we have here so the
better<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.870> running<00:02:23.110> back<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.440> faster

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
better the running back and the faster

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.870 
better the running back and the faster
he<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.190> better<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.490> offensive<00:02:24.760> line

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
he is and the better the offensive line

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.250 
he is and the better the offensive line
the<00:02:25.660> better<00:02:25.840> let's<00:02:26.020> play<00:02:26.140> will<00:02:26.320> work<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:32.080> said

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the better let's play will work you said

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530 
the better let's play will work you said
time<00:02:32.380> we<00:02:32.470> only<00:02:32.560> got<00:02:32.709> seven<00:02:33.490> yards<00:02:33.790> 67<00:02:34.300> yards

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
time we only got seven yards 67 yards

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.750 
time we only got seven yards 67 yards
but<00:02:35.290> still<00:02:35.530> it's<00:02:35.650> not<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> bad<00:02:36.040> gain<00:02:36.280> especially

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
but still it's not a bad gain especially

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.860 
but still it's not a bad gain especially
when<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:36.940> always<00:02:37.120> have<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.420> chance<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
when you always have that chance to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.820 
when you always have that chance to
break<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.230> for<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.440> big<00:02:38.709> 30<00:02:39.100> 40<00:02:39.430> yard<00:02:39.580> gain
