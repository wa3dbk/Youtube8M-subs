00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.200
 what is frit and well this is ours 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.279
 own vision shareware 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.310
 business models 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.720
 which we have come to actively use 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.360
 I'll say right away that it is somewhat different 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.270
 from what is usually used in 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.039
 industry classic approach looks like 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.070
 something like this company for real money 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.270
 offer the player unique items 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.949
 which give him some advantages 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.260
 in battle, for example 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.440
 a little more shop a little higher chance 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.440
 critical damage slightly more protection and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.140
 etc. as a result the more the donation 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.390
 more advantage the player has 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.549
 of course leads to record payments with 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.680
 sides of single players are also called 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.570
 whale top payers with this 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.699
 happy but all players start with 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.870
 a certain position in the top paying they 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.180
 feel unhappy 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.409
 despite all your payments or 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.900
 defaults they cannot boast 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.180
 by finding the ranking problem in 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.440
 that in western markets 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.409
 the dulling model has such an ironic 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.450
 nickname pay-to-win yes that is, pay 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.920
 for the victory and that we are in general 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.490
 traditional we go against the stream 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.799
 especially financial matters and not only 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.420
 well, that is, when everything was done, we did 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:30.710
 tanks until when everyone took the players 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:35.000
 payments at the test stage yes we were handing out 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.789
 here is the real currency of gold on here we are 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.090
 thought decided let's just we 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.859
 do not life wines as there teases 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.469
 some unknowingly comrades 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:48.289
 I will find win ce model free wins 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.899
 what does it mean it means u 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:56.929
 paying and u not paying 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.900
 player in battle there are absolutely the same 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.090
 opportunities 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.010
 and we began to try to sell 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.580
 premium shells consumables for playing 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.830
 silver 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.410
 which you can earn as you know in 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.600
 every battle now we see that this experience 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.600
 successful and no longer going from him 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.820
 refuse stressed that no 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.320
 game item purchased for gold 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.840
 will not give the player world of tanks 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.660
 advantage in battle it all depends on 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.430
 skills and from experience only they affect 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.810
 the outcome of the battle we do not want to share 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.730
 user on those who are ready for something 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.580
 to invest in the game and for those who are to this 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.050
 not ready need to understand that we act 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.950
 not because it occurred to us 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.770
 some kind of brilliant grandfather based 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.020
 our almost 3 years of experience 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.060
 that is, we initially worked by 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.700
 the classic model although we had it 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.040
 pretty weak here works 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.780
 math if we do so 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.850
 user to win need to spend 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.380
 real money is not everyone 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.690
 will play no matter 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.580
 how cool is the gameplay he gets 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.770
 and if we allow each player 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.390
 to win the battle regardless 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.519
 amounts spent and invested 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.530
 means it will constantly attract 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.420
 all new and new users already 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.190
 among them there are those who are ready to buy 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.620
 premium tank or 100 percentage type 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.150
 in general, everything is quite simple 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.980
 and finally, I would like to touch 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.280
 perhaps one of the most pressing 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.769
 our strategic issues so to speak 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.900
 studies have shown that optimal 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.010
 way will leave 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.380
 premium account for all three 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.980
 of our games trilogy that is tanks and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.760
 aircraft ships at the same level 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.280
 time van account is not 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.590
 will change that is if the user 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.390
 He decides that he needs a premium in the tanks 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.459
 he automatically gets this service and in 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.680
 airplanes here also do not need to look 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.260
 dirty trick and just we're sure it's 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.080
 attract us new players stay tuned 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 news we will surely still have that 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.680
 tell you
