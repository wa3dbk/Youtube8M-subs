00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.880
 now 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.479
 good polar 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.640
 welcome holy week will be done let's continue with the active drawing is a step 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.990
 more those who were being assured that we saw a first drawing only 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.669
 measuring taking directions proportions as we started to see earle 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.329
 the morphology the value 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.310
 and there we are going to see what unifies all that more than the use of the line in a 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.029
 text in works is over 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 let's try to straighten out I was like crazy 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.580
 but as we said this drawings apply everything we were seeing 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.319
 in the previous works 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:51.089
 directions proportions weights by the form and the simple the head post to begin 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.990
 to throw the first axes perched on the axes the eyes 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.300
 and let's start giving some tips to achieve with more finished work 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.870
 For example start with a good sheet we recommended the cardboard 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.780
 American who endures enough 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.890
 the use his enthusiasm gave him a tone when I do not think it's 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.010
 so raw 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.660
 I recommended to use it with char because because still feed a fact not 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.870
 I know if there will be 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.140
 yes it is very easy to erase 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.350
 feels absolutely nothing tuxtla caroni is allowed roasts a lot of correction and 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.730
 as in principle we said always let's start with hamas or quantities 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.760
 problems let's start with the amount of p errors is like being by 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.429
 example 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.620
 pina records that have the possibility 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.700
 to correct it very simple 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.820
 how to serve as with different materials and with different techniques 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.369
 we can achieve a jumbo in finished of our work 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.350
 always working with the same materials 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.630
 pastel artist black and white or coal and maybe maybe like grass 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.659
 get ahead 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.659
 so what 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.380
 good as we always say he did in another opportunity we work with a 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.930
 mirror for what they start to more than one hundred percent of the information are our 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.880
 own model 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.650
 see us remember that we have to be like to work be completely 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.570
 to the angle in that we have to move very little 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.440
 yes in this way you can opt for a scale model it was very dirty 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.520
 and I will try to look at possible method to have all the information that 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.579
 need yes 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.749
 ponce and working leading puppets taught determination techniques 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.809
 that's why we have some structure marked to have the big ones 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:50.760
 marked blocks 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.430
 now we have to start the issue of the completion of the work 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.770
 it went to a technique that the virgin is to work the one they had been part of 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.110
 prague still draw from prague to robert attended for a very interesting price 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.289
 I worked 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:07.309
 the first drawing of the maniacal torija in which way working with brushes 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.680
 Although it seems lie, it was convincing 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.260
 by deborah show how to combat the drawing or go up to yield the brush to 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.820
 start 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.439
 at the end of the work 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.009
 the technique consists the following we're going to guarantee glasses that chalk and we're going to 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.180
 pass it if for example a suitable sandpaper have a lot of powder 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.499
 which is not going to allow us to start with work this we pass product we have a 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:30.619
 lots of this 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.500
 or you will start to apply this on the drawing to 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.179
 make the issue of values 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.889
 Too much faster 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.249
 and men will not be much softer 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.249
 well alcÃ³n what is this? 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.619
 what we assume where the lights go 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.709
 hundreds in an almost pictorial way 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:57.119
 the floor solve 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:59.699
 and work 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.699
 he wanted to solve my drawing 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.539
 notice that simple 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:07.789
 how fast 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.789
 the floor has results 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.900
 and for those of us 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.120
 more picturesque ivuj before 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.550
 because drawing really sun is a discipline 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.379
 very strict very good 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.840
 I take this opportunity to send greetings to a great master of luxury 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.900
 Carlos perez 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.719
 josÃ© roberto marche 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:32.840
 barragÃ¡n 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.289
 alejandro bohn chimeric 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.289
 process thank you for all these pending and all because 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.819
 see how little 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.819
 let's start to get a result in this self portrait 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.169
 the same can be also 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.840
 with the darkest tones 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.490
 we are going to take another brush so that we inform gray we are going to devastate this 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.800
 case 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.800
 little bitten cake agonizes 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.229
 and we're going to start being dark tones 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.799
 once we have this we can move on to the pencils 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.840
 the white skin lepÃ­n blacks and we are not to to have the precision for example 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.030
 well try to solve a little crazy go a little of the column ending 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.129
 what can we achieve with this 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.129
 we make AIDS 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.889
 good but maybe I've come out remember as much of your mine as the brush after 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.849
 serve to close the shadows and chiaroscuros and start share the chalk 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.270
 from the macro, the micro, as we always say 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.380
 Well, I hope you have served them by mario jara 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.380
 we do not go the next one that is painted once 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:17.779
 next to bands 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:18.629
 as
