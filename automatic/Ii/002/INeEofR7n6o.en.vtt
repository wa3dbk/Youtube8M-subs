00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 Hello, we are preparing chicken cutlets 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.500
 I bought chicken breasts cool stuff 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.320
 very cheap and by the way cutlets finish 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 it turns out not less tasty than 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.960
 beef 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.500
 so here about 400 500 grams of chicken 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.930
 breasts 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.930
 give two bulbs x from cut 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.859
 In principle, we prepare everything exactly as drops 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.059
 at the start of years from beef 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 and all and slicing do us need 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.510
 some bread only a little 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.910
 if you go too far with the bread, then the chops 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.399
 when frying you will be very strong all in 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.250
 soak yourself for example the same 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:53.879
 sunflower oil so on all the water if 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.640
 his bread squeezed well the meat I cut 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.969
 now proceed 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.280
 everything is done they are taught to mr. barrels 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.390
 so prepared with a meat grinder we throw two 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.210
 pieces of meat 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.650
 12 onions and some bread to evenly 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.650
 but everything was twisted 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:41.590
 so fashion ready i put the dining room floor 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 I do not have a spoonful of salt and pepper 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.750
 scary I'm always about 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.250
 universal seasoning there full collection 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.520
 various herbs and get awesome 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.820
 burgers all now this whole thing 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.080
 it remains to mix and we will glow 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:07.120
 our pan all set to 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.360
 molding year years well as usual we do 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.740
 cutlets are so small 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.910
 we put either on the table or on 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.350
 chopping board as I did now 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:24.040
 how to make whole patties 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:27.610
 proceed to roasting all the chops we all 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.400
 done put the frying pan put on 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.040
 maximum fire from the tank and we are waiting 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.800
 when we have it build up about 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 70 80 degrees gave us a little bit lower 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.190
 fire and start frying the chops so 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.410
 our frying pan almost warmed up 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.380
 to the right to the right degree 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:58.989
 pour the oil is not too much quite 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:05.830
 enough for four diminishes everything 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:07.060
 we take our to the cell sounds put here 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:15.690
 on the pan 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.690
 and second and so on 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.480
 call our burgers until golden dark 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.030
 colors after which we turn over 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:41.210
 Now the rest of the case until the break 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:44.900
 and it's time to turn the answers like 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.250
 Here we see the shift on a platter 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.250
 and you can eat
