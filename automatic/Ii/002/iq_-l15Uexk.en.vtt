00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.570
 news colombia friends and friends 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.360
 Welcome once again to your space 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.210
 informative weekly news colombia the 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.039
 use of subscription television 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.140
 increases every day in our country to 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.000
 same as the cost to access this 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.340
 type of services but there are 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.610
 alternatives to receive free signals 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.350
 of economic and efficient satellites 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.600
 how many people access television 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.430
 by subscription a question that we 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.839
 It does reflect on the use made 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.480
 has given technology 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:50.890
 we have cable but really 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.660
 we see almost no no no no this 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.969
 channel is that we see over there but I do not 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.359
 like something because we cancel 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.969
 we have to cancel that as the starting 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.859
 15 around 17 and as he closed the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.839
 we have a bank account then no 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.910
 they charge them before and I do not agree 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.580
 with that in itself is a bit with everything 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.880
 its reality 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.100
 I think that a person who does not have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 enough input could not have it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.210
 connect to a satellite to receive 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.010
 free signals is not far from 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.600
 our reality is not necessary to be 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.610
 specialist since with only 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.680
 investigate a little you can have your 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 small connection system where you can 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.440
 receive cultural programming from others 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.110
 countries 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.730
 we need an antenna that depending 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.690
 of the satellite that we are going to choose now 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.220
 We said it's offset or primary focus 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.750
 depending on whether the satellite transmits in 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.940
 band aceh or in band k 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.630
 the type of antenna and also the type of 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.240
 antenna eye that we call lnb lnb is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.930
 for its acronym in English the noise block 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.590
 that is to say low noise block the signal 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.060
 that comes from the satellite can not be 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.930
 transformed directly to signal 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.369
 TV 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.170
 I can not hit a TV with a 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.270
 cable pointing up and grabbing it 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.600
 must be transformed into another frequency 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.759
 What does the lnb do? That signal is 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.370
 transmitted to the receiver totally free 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.620
 which captures and reflects on your screen to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.770
 technical practical level to you do not 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.690
 matter more than having a compass 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.819
 understand the elevation from it from the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.440
 where you are going to point the antenna 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.880
 If you are in Venezuela there is a 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.370
 elevation if you are in another country 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.950
 has another elevation and so you can 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.959
 align the satellite without any problem 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.769
 the antennas are divided into two 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.350
 offset type antennas that are antennas of 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.480
 by reflection they are called why they are called 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.510
 offset because they do not grab the satellite 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.280
 direct but by rebound and are the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.739
 Direct focus antennas like this one 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.600
 we have that direct focus antenna behind 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.640
 where it is pointing 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.410
 there is the satellite the antennas vary 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.780
 its size according to the frequency of 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.640
 satellite and the so-called shadow or spot 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.690
 of coverage that this device has 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.120
 about the world 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.489
 the ft a free to air is known in 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.840
 Spanish as free channels and works 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.300
 on two bands 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.510
 and the band makes the band frequency k 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.000
 is for the type antennas or set and the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.890
 band frequencies bands are for 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.340
 primary focus frequencies that are the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.980
 round this has no borders 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.810
 this has no country this has no mark 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.269
 this has no association with anything or with 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.970
 no one once you empower yourself 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.799
 this kind of watching television of this type 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.959
 of listening to radio of this kind of 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.049
 tune antennas you are free to 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:39.430
 Take her from Maracaibo to Margarida 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.290
 there are web pages like www.lan.com 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.760
 where information is reflected that 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.980
 can guide on the location of 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.980
 satellites as well as the signals that 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.319
 they find free national sovereignty 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.750
 it is also outward the 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.490
 democratization of spaces 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.680
 satellites is necessary 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.170
 to be able to again from your roof of the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.580
 that roof of that building 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.910
 backyard if you have a 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.910
 farm 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.900
 in a background where where has its 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.849
 plantations 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.430
 take advantage of it a zeal also has another 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.829
 different use but pointing up 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.630
 pointing to the space where there is 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.669
 a lot of surprises that you 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.310
 they wait and obviously not 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.200
 we know 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.720
 an aspect of I would say of d 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.030
 to a certain extent from pizzerias to 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.710
 say it a colloquial term of 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.510
 large companies that do not suit you 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.460
 you know this driving this 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.350
 information and installing the system 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.940
 correct way you perform a 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.920
 exploration to find new 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.500
 television channels and stations 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.000
 radio friends and we make a new 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.000
 pause in Colombian news
