00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.520 
do is we need to have him use peel from
reality<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:30.660> don't<00:04:31.660> know<00:04:31.960> how<00:04:32.110> we're<00:04:32.260> gonna<00:04:32.320> get

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
reality I don't know how we're gonna get

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:47.650 
reality I don't know how we're gonna get
him<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.680> do<00:04:32.860> that<00:04:37.110> unless<00:04:38.110> he<00:04:38.169> gets<00:04:38.410> greedy<00:04:38.710> and

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.790 

that's<00:04:48.290> a<00:04:48.440> good<00:04:48.620> draw<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:50.200> miss<00:04:51.200> Raven<00:04:51.650> into

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
that's a good draw to miss Raven into

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.430 
that's a good draw to miss Raven into
tandem<00:04:52.370> look<00:04:52.550> out<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.060> guess<00:04:53.300> is<00:04:53.810> that's<00:04:54.290> a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
tandem look out and I guess is that's a

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:15.000 
tandem look out and I guess is that's a
reasonable<00:04:55.070> draw

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.640 

I'm<00:05:15.430> going<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:16.060> lose<00:05:16.300> this<00:05:16.660> game<00:05:16.780> oh<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:20.590> he

I'm going to lose this game oh and he

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.130 
I'm going to lose this game oh and he
drew<00:05:20.800> smuggler<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.640> he<00:05:21.790> has<00:05:21.910> peel<00:05:22.090> up<00:05:25.140> top

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140

and<00:05:35.470> insane<00:05:36.430> draws<00:05:37.170> but<00:05:38.170> he<00:05:38.830> had<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:38.980> good<00:05:39.100> deck

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280

too<00:05:39.430> although<00:05:40.210> I<00:05:40.300> definitely<00:05:40.450> could<00:05:40.810> have

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
too although I definitely could have

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.080 
too although I definitely could have
beat<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.170> if<00:05:41.320> things<00:05:42.220> went<00:05:42.400> my<00:05:42.580> way<00:05:42.760> but<00:05:43.000> they

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
beat it if things went my way but they

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.480 
beat it if things went my way but they
didn't<00:05:43.330> anyway<00:05:44.260> I<00:05:44.470> think<00:05:44.710> my<00:05:44.950> strategy's

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
didn't anyway I think my strategy's

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.260 
didn't anyway I think my strategy's
still<00:05:45.670> viable

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
still viable

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.050 
still viable
