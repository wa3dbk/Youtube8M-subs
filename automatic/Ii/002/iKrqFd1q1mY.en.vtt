00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.750
 we are faced with an overdraft the revolutionary writes a little about what 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.619
 consists 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.619
 examination of the session produced another with the intention of 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.480
 save fuel but along the way they discovered but a lot 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.340
 pleasant that over plucking fuel drastically knocked down all the 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.779
 ancestors starting from the full of being famous for his son 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.070
 the new tech section 2 every year the engine is almost new without tv 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.580
 rai depth two, three 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.140
 immediately after installing the guide device you find full ita e ' 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.530
 passed by ron, you are more or less a normal jump not so much a lot of 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.870
 community culling this anti-particulate device comes 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.000
 inserted upstream of the engine, ie before entering the combustion chamber 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.640
 before entering the composition 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.900
 the effect you make to significantly improve fuel quality 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.430
 because the fuel bombard electromagnetic through this device 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.120
 mind 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.140
 molecules internal free radicals this month go crazy for di 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.020
 going crazy they increase their energy 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.280
 continually, upon entering the combustion chamber, this occurs 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.070
 to improve combustion precisely. 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.530
 more power more torque 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.200
 drastic reduction of pollutants 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 it is also a direction of consumption 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.450
 hahaha 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.550
 what prevents you from homologating this is me 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.700
 neurons still fail to understand what reason 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.020
 for this then explain to me is 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.760
 I was we respected 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.900
 the decree even though the decree was structured primarily for teenagers if 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.909
 not for upstream products as required by the European community 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.130
 and although the European community does not request love'-marry it asks to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.080
 enter pollution into certain parameters 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.140
 we don't know why 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.210
 we do not decide after two and a half years to relax the homologue 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.620
 I only know that two questions have been presented 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.749
 MPs 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:16.260
 and to be able to understand the motivations of this behavior by the 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.349
 ministry 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.899
 and then 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.609
 we are risking our company 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.099
 d kinder e 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.919
 after two and a half years 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.959
 every company needs to work invoicing 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.099
 with our device I believe that we can improve a lot 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.620
 quality of the ambient air for our anti-particulate devices 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.389
 there are different models 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.399
 they can work up 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.629
 where there is an engine with 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.569
 I have a diesel boiler and then on the boats on the analysis of the train systems 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.829
 industrial and even civil installations everywhere we want to do something 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.569
 in a sample city 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.809
 whatever it is you decide it doesn't matter to me 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.429
 so many cities do not make a site 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.979
 and then we'll talk about it
