and you guys finally visualize them use

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.820 
and you guys finally visualize them use
your<00:00:53.229> visualization<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:54.040> it<00:00:55.680> alright<00:00:56.680> guys

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830

visualization with the black with
orbital<00:01:01.000> vsat<00:01:01.150> looking<00:01:01.860> cursors<00:01:02.860> move<00:01:03.070> around

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
orbital vsat looking cursors move around

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.789 
orbital vsat looking cursors move around
so<00:01:03.820> here<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.180> know<00:01:04.299> it's<00:01:04.449> me<00:01:04.650> executing<00:01:05.650> this

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
so here you know it's me executing this

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.859 
so here you know it's me executing this
route<00:01:06.430> reason<00:01:06.909> why<00:01:07.000> I<00:01:07.030> use<00:01:07.270> this<00:01:07.450> route<00:01:07.659> the

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
route reason why I use this route the

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
route reason why I use this route the
most<00:01:08.049> when<00:01:08.200> I<00:01:08.260> play<00:01:08.500> drone<00:01:08.799> simply<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.760> because

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
most when I play drone simply is because

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.340 
most when I play drone simply is because
most<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.909> traffic<00:01:13.150> areas<00:01:13.689> around<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:14.109> year

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
most of the traffic areas around a year

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.020 
most of the traffic areas around a year
so<00:01:14.740> usually<00:01:15.130> what<00:01:15.219> you<00:01:15.340> want<00:01:15.549> to<00:01:15.640> do<00:01:15.789> is<00:01:16.000> you

so usually what you want to do is you
want<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.450> stay<00:01:16.630> around<00:01:16.780> here<00:01:17.219> main<00:01:18.219> reasons

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
want to stay around here main reasons

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.529 
want to stay around here main reasons
one<00:01:19.240> because<00:01:19.719> a<00:01:20.320> lot<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:20.950> people<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.240> go

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
one because a lot of people like to go

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.060 
one because a lot of people like to go
into<00:01:22.659> buildings<00:01:23.109> for<00:01:23.200> some<00:01:23.380> reason<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.859> don't

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
into buildings for some reason I don't

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.529 
into buildings for some reason I don't
know<00:01:24.159> it's<00:01:24.310> just<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.549> habit<00:01:24.729> I'm<00:01:25.030> one<00:01:25.329> of<00:01:25.450> them

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
know it's just a habit I'm one of them

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.719 
know it's just a habit I'm one of them
usually<00:01:26.500> that's<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:26.799> best<00:01:27.039> bet<00:01:27.189> you<00:01:27.340> have<00:01:27.520> any

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.069 
usually that's the best bet you have any
way<00:01:27.909> because<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.179> really<00:01:28.479> don't<00:01:28.600> want<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.899> run

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
way because you really don't want to run

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.719 
way because you really don't want to run
through<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.409> front<00:01:29.619> so<00:01:30.250> usually<00:01:30.399> what<00:01:30.609> you

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
through the front so usually what you

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.330 
through the front so usually what you
want<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.000> do<00:01:31.149> is<00:01:31.299> you<00:01:31.329> want<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.719> be<00:01:31.869> in<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.649> in<00:01:33.039> a

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
building where there's like a lot of

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:35.940 
building where there's like a lot of
different<00:01:34.719> ways<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.109> go<00:01:35.320> through<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.740> try

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
different ways to go through and try

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.800 
different ways to go through and try
stay<00:01:36.429> in<00:01:36.640> one<00:01:36.789> place<00:01:36.969> for<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.299> have<00:01:37.509> them<00:01:37.659> like

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
it at a choke point for example is

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.010 
it at a choke point for example is
building<00:01:39.999> where<00:01:40.119> I'm<00:01:40.179> at<00:01:40.299> right<00:01:40.329> here<00:01:40.630> don't

about<00:01:49.899> this<00:01:50.109> map<00:01:50.289> I'm<00:01:50.469> gonna<00:01:50.649> add<00:01:50.829> a<00:01:50.890> key<00:01:51.249> thing

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
about this map I'm gonna add a key thing

about this map I'm gonna add a key thing
about<00:01:51.460> this<00:01:51.789> map<00:01:51.999> on<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.929> other<00:01:53.109> side<00:01:53.409> of

about this map on the other side of

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.529 
about this map on the other side of
where<00:01:53.859> I'm<00:01:53.979> at<00:01:54.009> there's<00:01:54.969> two<00:01:55.149> different<00:01:55.390> ways

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
where I'm at there's two different ways

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.969 
where I'm at there's two different ways
well<00:01:56.109> through<00:01:56.319> different<00:01:56.619> ways<00:01:56.740> they<00:01:56.920> can

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
well through different ways they can

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.319 
well through different ways they can
come<00:01:57.219> from<00:01:57.399> they<00:01:57.520> can<00:01:57.670> go<00:01:57.789> in<00:01:57.850> from<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.030> bottom

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
come from they can go in from the bottom

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.330 
come from they can go in from the bottom
or<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.810> bottom<00:01:59.049> stair<00:01:59.350> case<00:01:59.590> bottom<00:02:00.069> left

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
or the bottom stair case bottom left

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.059 
or the bottom stair case bottom left
over<00:02:00.939> there<00:02:01.170> where<00:02:02.170> I'm<00:02:02.259> about<00:02:02.499> to<00:02:02.679> go<00:02:02.770> through

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
over there where I'm about to go through

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.739 
over there where I'm about to go through
and<00:02:03.159> then<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.429> top<00:02:03.670> they<00:02:04.119> can<00:02:04.359> go<00:02:04.479> through

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
and then the top they can go through

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.599 
and then the top they can go through
this<00:02:05.170> like<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.409> little<00:02:05.679> opening<00:02:06.009> right<00:02:06.340> there

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
this like a little opening right there

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:07.660 
this like a little opening right there
right<00:02:06.819> from<00:02:06.999> where<00:02:07.240> I'm<00:02:07.329> at

right from where I'm at
here<00:02:07.880> where<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.119> usually<00:02:08.509> try<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.750> look<00:02:08.929> through

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
here where I usually try to look through

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.779 
here where I usually try to look through
now<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.709> we<00:02:09.800> have<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.009> hardpoint<00:02:10.399> there<00:02:10.640> you

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
now that we have the hardpoint there you

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.120 
now that we have the hardpoint there you
know<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.349> usually<00:02:12.349> try<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.590> stay<00:02:12.770> around<00:02:12.890> this

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
know I usually try to stay around this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.240 
know I usually try to stay around this
area<00:02:13.810> knowingly<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.770> towards<00:02:16.130> my
