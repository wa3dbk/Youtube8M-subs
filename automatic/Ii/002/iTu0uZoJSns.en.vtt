00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:08.050
 hello everyone good I'm 30 frame and today 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.110
 I bring a new tutorial for all that 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.720
 I think it was very requested if I'm in another 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.180
 computer 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.920
 because good the other one I do not have it there 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.420
 Well, it changes my computer because 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.270
 because although 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.710
 we go there in this tutorial as you will see 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.270
 already the title is to make a game 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.270
 Multiplayer on split screen 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.360
 so well this is very simple this 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.770
 It serves for platform games and all 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.500
 and all I'm going to do a simple one but 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.490
 you can do as you want 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.490
 but with the spirits of the players 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.239
 to make one simple 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.750
 and player 2 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.000
 all right 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.480
 this spread is to know where they are 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.760
 the players on the screen because in 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.960
 the screen split like I'm not going to 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.960
 put fund then 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.179
 Well, you will not know where the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.520
 the players 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.180
 You already do this as you want 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.820
 and this is to know where they are in the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.920
 level these are the spirits we are going to 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.920
 for the player objects 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.700
 and if we take the player's controls 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.980
 that we want the left so that 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.810
 move to the left 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.550
 let's use game had decision 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:33.510
 and 0 x less and the speed that we want 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.510
 I'm going to put 5 pixels relative and so 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.270
 duplicate from right to go to the 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.840
 right it has to be by the X 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.840
 positive 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.510
 above 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.500
 to go up is the one and the one 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.500
 it has to be positive 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:02.100
 and down it has to be 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.470
 negative or not to give or not to work 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.110
 positive forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.510
 sorry and up negative 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.069
 sorry people 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.870
 and now they go for player 2 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.870
 there will be two changes the sprint 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.170
 I know with the letters 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.849
 on the left 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.019
 up the w for example 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.130
 this is what you can jump because we say 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.130
 It is a little roll and wright 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.280
 and they keep 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.420
 well, that's 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.420
 we already have the players 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.460
 and good and the blocks 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.880
 we have our objects now we are going 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.110
 to the level this is important for 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.110
 the screen well 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.670
 we are going to depend on how we have the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.030
 rom good I'm going to do half of 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.030
 this rom 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.030
 this is so such an object let's take the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.030
 player 1 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.070
 for example and now we go 10 we mark 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:43.000
 this box 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.000
 we go to the 1007 correct 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.169
 this has to be 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:55.950
 320 as you see has been reduced by half 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.950
 And this too 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.520
 and it is already 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.520
 we go to 10 21 sorry 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:15.450
 the same 320 320 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.450
 but here 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:26.650
 it has to be half the rice in this 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:29.820
 case is 320 because it is for each one 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.820
 and here too 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.360
 As you can see, it moves like that, it moves 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.759
 you see that the screens appear but 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.759
 it's a little messy to see it like that so I'll 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.680
 I'm going to do with squares, it's worth 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.430
 what I have done is worth for example 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.430
 Lets put 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.580
 the zone of player 2 is 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.280
 in the area of ​​player 1 this 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.280
 example is here now we already know where 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.360
 they can be so that it is not so messy 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.340
 this does not have to be because we already see 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.699
 so 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.699
 the other may be displacing this 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:39.490
 and another like you can not move comes by 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.800
 here the screen is this one of the 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.319
 right 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.620
 blue is on the right screen and the 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:50.160
 red is on the left 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.540
 it's good it looks a bit messy because 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.750
 there is not a line that divides the two 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.120
 screens is me everyone has to 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.940
 to do is very difficult because of course 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.280
 then an object is going to be seen in 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.490
 the two screens 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:09.130
 have to go I do not know it's a little weird 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.789
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.710
