00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.050
 hi my mines today I call them that because 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 I love kittens good in general 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.389
 I like all the animals but with 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.369
 the kittens I have something very special and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.170
 taking advantage of the winter coming 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 It's colder and you have to be more 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.920
 I gave myself to the task of creating 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.830
 these superheroes kitty hats 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.060
 I have loved the two of course 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.309
 because they are kittens and kittens and also 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.190
 because I think they look super cute is 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.170
 a simple way to recycle clothes 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.730
 of wool that no longer remains or is 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.470
 damaged also I take advantage for 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.570
 announce if they can already buy 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.520
 iPad case in the online store of 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.470
 fashion ray or many girls have me 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.600
 asked about her so if they are 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.090
 interested I leave you in the description 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.010
 of the video the link to the store and to my 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.320
 social networks for your juice without further 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.210
 contact if they have a cat put me in 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.159
 the comments as it is called there is something 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.979
 funny that you like to do because 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.940
 super funny cats in the end I hope that 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.940
 like this video 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.930
 you will need a piece of wool from 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.140
 preference that is damaged like this 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.290
 skirt that has a small hole a 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.210
 hat although this is optional 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.020
 any piece of fabric you have in 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.800
 House thread needles pins and the whole kit 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.750
 sewing grandma a chain 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.270
 estoperoles pebbles or anything 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.650
 you have to decorate supergift 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.450
 angel and a pencil to draw on fabric 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.510
 extend the garment that you chose in this 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.180
 case I'm wearing a skirt with the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.950
 hat on the fabric and remark what if not 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.350
 you have a hat you can also put 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.840
 the garment on your head to cut it 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.320
 to that extent then draw a couple of 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.390
 ears 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.580
 I made two little triangles to make the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.500
 ears of a cat but if the phrases more 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.530
 or baladita are round you can also 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.990
 make a puppy or a panda cut the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.630
 pieces and try to cut the hat a 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.000
 little bit thicker than what you already marked 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.710
 you know sometimes we're wrong and it's better 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.930
 that we over fabric that we lack 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.390
 choose two of the four pieces of 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.030
 ears that you should have and decorate them as 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.740
 more you like me I chose to put many 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.740
 of gold- colored studs 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.400
 When finished decorating place the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.210
 ears together with your bread the part 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.210
 adorned should be turned in 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.580
 and now you have to start sewing is very 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.880
 easy you just have to put a stitch 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.830
 below crossing both pieces and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.330
 then return that stitch but for 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.330
 up and so on 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.530
 you just have to sew two sides of the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.600
 rectangle and when you finish give it the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.020
 back and you'll see how pretty the 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.020
 ears 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.310
 place the little ears on the fabric of the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.180
 hat so that they are down 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.190
 use the pins to be fixed 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.820
 and then for the other part of the hat 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.980
 over now let's sew once more 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.380
 in the same way that it consists of 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.970
 ears by the way when you get to the 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.790
 part of the hat where the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.800
 ears very carefully and through the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.250
 Four layers of fabric for the hat 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.250
 you look good 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.140
 when you finish sewing just give it the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.840
 back and if you want you can leave it like that 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.510
 but I want to put a nose on it 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.530
 what can you do with the piece of cloth 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.200
 you just have to cut out a triangular 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.750
 I made two little noses and used a 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.330
 post-it to protect the table and paint 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.280
 a nose in golden color and so I could 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.730
 choose which nose I liked the most if the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.430
 black or the golden one at the end I decided 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.130
 the golden nose and to paste it I used 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.500
 a glue in gel unlike 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.800
 other glues this does not go through 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.050
 the fabric then you have to cut one 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.989
 chain to form a very strong whiskers 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.790
 flirty preferably puts three I think 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.730
 which is the typical number of whiskers that 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.919
 we do when we draw a kitten by 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.530
 last one of the first links of 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.970
 the chains with the needle and sews the very 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.970
 near the tip of the nose 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.280
 and also sew the chains on the other 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.249
 extreme but this time they remain 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.589
 separated 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:38.579
 and so the beheaded cap remains 

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:38.579
 super nice 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.280
 I also made a black cap in this 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.290
 decoration is simpler 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.150
 I only put a little bit of glue 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.130
 in gel on a post-it so that the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.290
 glue can be easier to fix in 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:05.310
 the pebbles and then stick them on 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:13.560
 ears is very easy and fast to be and 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:15.420
 that 's how the black cap looks 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.010
 those hot days these little caps 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.410
 they can also serve as objects of 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.720
 decoration you only need a few hooks 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.640
 like these that are very easy to put 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.440
 on the wall and you can complement the 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.030
 decoration of your room with something very 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.030
 original and created by you 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.490
 Y 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.870
