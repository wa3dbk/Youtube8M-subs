 superman and green lantern body 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.840
 say to lock them in a prison near 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.720
 of a sun that neutralizes those powers 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.180
 although he does not care, he assures 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.910
 that escaped from worst places one 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.459
 would suppose that the whole plan to unite all 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.260
 the worlds in one could only have been 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.230
 originated by superman 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.840
 and earth louis 2 together with super boy 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.200
 The truth is that the person responsible for 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.260
 everything was alexander mourning stone 3 that 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.870
 will seek to recreate the multiverse said 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 by the way this alexander the bull was son 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.780
 from the former land author 3 a world where 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.670
 his father was the only hero and he has 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.010
 a tragic outcome because he dies at the hands 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.370
 of the only person he did not 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.400
 part of his plans the joker the final 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.650
 of the comic presents us with a clear target 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.170
 Bruce Wayne talking about what they 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.409
 wait now that the crisis is over 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.030
 and now they see a different world where no 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.280
 they need to worry so much about the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.409
 land because there are many heroes that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.359
 will also defend it so they can 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.000

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.790
