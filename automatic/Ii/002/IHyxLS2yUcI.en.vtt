00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.679
 Hello everyone, I want to talk about how 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:11.599
 adjust valve on kawasaki zzr 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.480
 1100 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.610
 what you need to do the fable 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.610
 seat 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.360
 remove the fuel tank is desirable 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.360
 disconnect the battery 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:33.210
 then proceed to disassemble 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.910
 riding the engine for this is necessary 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.620
 remove the air filter boxing world after 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.809
 as removed airbox must be removed 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.249
 carburetor and in order to take off 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.420
 carburetor and first you need 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:54.050
 unscrew these clamps here need 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:59.329
 use a long screwdriver crawl 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:02.579
 after unscrewing the heat 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.170
 need to take off her panties 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.060
 gas cable or rather two gas cable 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.979
 direct and returnable 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.189
 connect the choke cable here they are all these 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.039
 three panties also parallel 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.880
 disconnect everything we need all 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:27.119
 tubes that will stop us from taking off 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.020
 carb disconnect all after that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.030
 how is it all disconnected you can proceed 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.240
 to remove carburetors in order to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.770
 convenient to remove the carburetor and 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.539
 you can use a wooden rod 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.869
 which insert between the rail on 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.770
 which are installed carburetors and frames and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:54.060
 press carburetors forward and upwards so 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.479
 they will get off very easily after you 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.360
 like something you shoot something unscrew 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:04.590
 I highly recommend immediately plugging 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.599
 all sorts of holes results to not 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.959
 dust has come in and most importantly not 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:12.569
 hit any items bolts and nuts 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 washers and stuff 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.840
 engine if that happens you will 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.250
 big trouble if you do it 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:28.280
 you will have to disassemble a lot and 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.030
 the cycle can even go out the engine building 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.030
 so after 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:46.360
 it all took off the next stage is the removal 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:49.580
 Ignition coils with funny wires 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.510
 after you took them off you can 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:59.480
 proceed with the removal 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:05.930
 paws it is fastened with four screws 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:09.010
 and here do not forget to remove the boot 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.040
 which stands between the head and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:17.500
 radiator it will be small 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.500
 the view prevents you from removing the cover 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.580
 after you took it all off 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:29.180
 unscrew the cap 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:33.099
 it is fastened with six screws 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.010
 cover and access 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.379
 gas distribution mechanism 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.730
 yes you took off the cover you need to put 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.799
 4 cylinder piston in the upper dead 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.650
 the point how to do it is the easiest 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.739
 the way is to put the bike on the sixth 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.440
 transfer and hand rotate the rear wheel 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.629
 after you put the piston 4 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.959
 cylinder top dead center you can 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.480
 check intake valve clearances 4 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.030
 exhaust cylinder 4 cylinder 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.400
 exhaust valve 3 cylinder and delicious 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.160
 by 2 goals skeleton how do you do it 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.920
 it is necessary to put the piston of the first cylinder 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.349
 top dead center then you can 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.209
 check intake valve clearance 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.150
 first cylinder exhaust valves 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.620
 first cylinder exhaust valves 2 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.580
 cylinder and intake valves 3 cylinder 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.729
 chips are used to check the gap 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.510
 the more of them the better but here it is 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.680
 the minimum set that I use 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:43.440
 at 50 ten zero 2015 for checking 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:47.980
 the gap insert the probe between 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.430
 adjusting washer and pusher 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.430
 valve 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:05.240
 the process of measuring draw here is a table 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.240
 and write it down 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:15.380
 those gaps that we intended for 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.930
 exhaust valves for intake valves 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.000
 after we measured the gap to us 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.600
 need to remove the puck in order to 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.930
 measure its thickness 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.930
 how to do this take a long screwdriver and 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.360
 move the pusher to the side 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.020
 until he clings to 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.450
 camshaft so we got 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.540
 puck access 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.540
 here he is 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.330
 puck thickness measurement results 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:00.020
 write the following table we measure 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.200
 thickness of each washer on the valve where to us 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.420
 you need to adjust the clearance just like 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:11.110
 we got data on existing 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:14.000
 gap on the puck we can define 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.910
 puck thickness that we need 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.270
 to replace 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:22.930
 for this we draw the following table 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.460
 based on the data you got 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.210
 referring to the manual we can get 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.770
 puck thickness that we need 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.020
 to acquire 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.550
 There are three options for the purchase of these washers 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.300
 the first option is to buy the original 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:42.110
 which is quite expensive and it should be 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.630
 order often and wait for the second option 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:48.740
 This is somewhere order and to you these washers 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.360
 milled and the third option option 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.010
 which I used to order 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:59.860
 console China link to the shop where I am 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.860
 ordered you will see under this video
