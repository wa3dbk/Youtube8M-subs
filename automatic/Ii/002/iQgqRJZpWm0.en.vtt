how<00:04:25.930> everything<00:04:26.410> plays<00:04:26.680> out<00:04:26.950> you<00:04:27.760> know<00:04:28.450> what<00:04:28.570> I

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
how everything plays out you know what I

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.090 
how everything plays out you know what I
felt<00:04:28.810> was<00:04:29.020> big<00:04:29.200> improvements<00:04:29.740> in<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.920> game

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
felt was big improvements in the game

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.530 
felt was big improvements in the game
some<00:04:30.370> people<00:04:30.400> were<00:04:30.700> playing<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.120> down<00:04:31.240> on<00:04:31.450> my

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
some people were playing it down on my

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.770 
some people were playing it down on my
FIFA<00:04:31.810> 12<00:04:32.020> video<00:04:32.340> but<00:04:33.340> overall<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.600> say

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
FIFA 12 video but overall I have to say

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.010 
FIFA 12 video but overall I have to say
I<00:04:35.320> like<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.040> menus<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.730> like<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.060> overlays<00:04:37.600> I

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
I like the menus I like the overlays I

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.010 
I like the menus I like the overlays I
think<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.740> feels<00:04:38.950> a<00:04:39.160> lot<00:04:39.280> better<00:04:39.870> when<00:04:40.870> you're

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
think it feels a lot better when you're

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.370 
think it feels a lot better when you're
playing<00:04:41.350> now<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:42.780> guess<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:43.990> haven't<00:04:44.140> really

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
playing now I guess I haven't really

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.840 
playing now I guess I haven't really
locked<00:04:44.590> down<00:04:44.770> my<00:04:44.920> camera<00:04:44.980> angle<00:04:45.430> I've<00:04:45.670> been

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
locked down my camera angle I've been

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.820 
locked down my camera angle I've been
changing<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.390> up<00:04:46.450> quite<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.780> bit<00:04:47.020> when<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.260> go<00:04:47.770> to

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
changing it up quite a bit when I go to

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.130 
changing it up quite a bit when I go to
look<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.220> play<00:04:48.420> which<00:04:49.420> is<00:04:49.570> kind<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.930> bummer

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
look to play which is kind of a bummer

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.140 
look to play which is kind of a bummer
because<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.560> used<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:50.950> have<00:04:51.100> my<00:04:51.250> camera<00:04:51.490> locked

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
because I used to have my camera locked

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.360 
because I used to have my camera locked
down<00:04:52.420> and<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.290> never<00:04:53.470> used<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.860> hospitality

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
down and I never used the hospitality

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.210 
down and I never used the hospitality
settings<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:55.210> it's<00:04:55.360> kind<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.720> bummer<00:04:56.220> I'm

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
settings so it's kind of a bummer I'm

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.860 
settings so it's kind of a bummer I'm
basically<00:04:57.880> like<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.120> said<00:04:58.150> in<00:04:58.390> basically<00:04:58.660> using

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
basically like I said in basically using

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.630 
basically like I said in basically using
a<00:04:58.930> standard<00:04:59.290> guy<00:04:59.440> he's<00:05:00.130> just<00:05:00.340> gonna<00:05:00.430> have<00:05:00.610> some

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
and as a pitcher I don't know why it was

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.170

it I understand but it's still gonna be

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.550 
it I understand but it's still gonna be
a<00:06:08.950> path<00:06:09.370> because<00:06:09.790> as<00:06:10.060> I'm<00:06:10.870> looking<00:06:10.990> at<00:06:11.290> there's

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
a path because as I'm looking at there's

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.990 
a path because as I'm looking at there's
a<00:06:11.590> lot<00:06:11.710> of<00:06:11.830> stuff<00:06:12.070> that<00:06:12.190> I<00:06:12.250> really<00:06:12.700> don't<00:06:12.880> know

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
a lot of stuff that I really don't know

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.940 
a lot of stuff that I really don't know
