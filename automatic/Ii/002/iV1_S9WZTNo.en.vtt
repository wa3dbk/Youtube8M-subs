00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello my name is olivier I am 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.760
 technical adviser to the federation 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.679
 French mountain and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.960
 climbed and I'm going to show you 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.730
 how are we removed and bent 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.699
 seal skin on ski touring 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 Seal skin has a shelf life 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.529
 long enough 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.480
 it can last several ski seasons 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.599
 at most you have to maintain the glue 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.390
 maybe once a year and fold it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.929
 carefully and store it at the shelter 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 dust 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.160
 so we simply remove it in 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.120
 pulling on the rubber for the skins 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.079
 parabolic 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.940
 we will neutralize the part precisely 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.930
 parabolic years folding it a 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.930
 first time on herself 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.500
 and then it's about folding the skin 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 as accurately as possible on 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 herself to leave the least space 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 possible to dust that might 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.520
 hang out in the backpack if the skins 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.180
 are marketed with a film in 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.310
 plastic 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.920
 it is not essential to their 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.040
 stick after each use 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.659
 we see here that by putting 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.289
 carefully the skin on itself 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.789
 it's enough to protect the glue 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.160
 and put her in her backpack and 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.280
 maintain it in a dry place and 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.890
 own at home compete the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.630
 competitors are in the habit of removing 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.200
 their seal skins extremely 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.530
 quickly 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.750
 we shoot here and in one blow the skin is 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.390
 removed now you know how 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.810
 proceed to remove and store your 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.810
 seal skin
