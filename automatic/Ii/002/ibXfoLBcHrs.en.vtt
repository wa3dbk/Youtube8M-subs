00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.150
 the ex dogs today as you have seen from 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.310
 my page I decided to do a log e 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.679
 talk about what is happening to cod 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.410
 why all these changes for 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.009
 example of the competitive scene perhaps the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.599
 switching from juan ps4 and so on 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.550
 then a small product must be made 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.950
 premise what god had you on 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.230
 his golden year with black ops where he has 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.160
 had the boom streaming reviews of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.410
 video on youtube 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.990
 even the competivi can be said that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 be reborn there after a few years anyway 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.230
 the uncertainty that there have been in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.350
 america had left the mlg circuit 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 after black or are on playstation 3 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.430
 however what I want to tell you is not 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.160
 this if only a small premise 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.170
 through then games like ghost and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.800
 advanced warfare has tried to make you 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.260
 to go up 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.480
 these of use to make them increase since 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.460
 kodo as true but never succeeded 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 enter fully into the top 10 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.250
 if not on black ops two inside 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 of the top 10 for example of the games of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.300
 tweets and so on very few times is 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 only managed to reach it 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.210
 on co2 sometimes on taste 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.330
 the bad thing is that the two have remained 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.120
 stagnant china black lux ii on the codec 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.860
 so let's not say there was n't this 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.500
 great change by itself has 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.300
 had a small slice of extra users 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.510
 that the user watching videos in 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.610
 streaming players also sought 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.100
 to renew game with prima with ghost 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.530
 pansa tour fair without being able to create 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 a game that could hold the mass 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.970
 of players and in any case to enlarge 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.510
 what is theirs 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.520
 how can their fanbase still be said 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.140
 more but also on the pro competitive 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.150
 the one has certainly helped a 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.390
 operating system perhaps less isolated but 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.289
 slow to three operating systems one one 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.310
 very slow 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.009
 let's say it was n't really the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.630
 maximum if you want to say these xboxes 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.000
 compared to what was the third is 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.280
 indeed it seemed a downgrade 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.870
 as for the ds4 it was done 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.610
 this message because microsoft doesn't have 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.160
 renewed the contract perhaps because the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.080
 sony paid more to get this 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.420
 exclusive definitely the ds4 gives gods 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.160
 these two advantages this year 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.569
 years surely has a year less than 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.430
 more occurred almost more than double 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.080
 of wan consoles if I 'm not mistaken 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.390
 but I don't want to go overboard 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.910
 plus a console enough 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.250
 fast ok yes there are some classics 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.459
 framerate problems etc. and so on 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.019
 but in any case of mama consul 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.329
 quite valid bouquet the problems of 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.849
 nef that is the joystick did not give much 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.840
 suitable fps however a much console 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.120
 varied and san domenico and I tried 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.910
 both core of advanced warfare mi 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.200
 seems to have a better xbox it seems to have 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.620
 also a better deal because 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.790
 however where I was shooting foxes they entered 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.489
 besides this if it seemed much more to me 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.489
 fluid and much more defined graphics 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 what's going on things are slowly coming up 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.650
 dying in europe they are investing 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.079
 so much money in the communion of anyway 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.670
 competitive but less and less 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.590
 people playing less and less people 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.150
 that fewer and fewer people train 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.220
 participate in tournaments in america this is 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.600
 contrary there are always more people than 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.670
 are more and more types of new 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.799
 faces this banks because theirs and it 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.239
 really 20 level live 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.819
 the best workout you can 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.010
 getting out of the 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.480
 from the mediocrity that exists in Europe 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.939
 instead we have many problems with 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.730
 connections between the various nations 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.260
 the netcode of these consoles do not help 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.069
 etc. etc. 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.109
 but there are many beautiful things we say 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.790
 initiatives like dc finished but 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.340
 even that Italy there were the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.170
 point is that piano cord is dying 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.689
 interest in call of is being lost 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.000
 in fact, many are going out 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.430
 fps that maybe they can compete in 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.090
 interview in the same semester will be a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.709
 flop 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.069
 I also always popstar and will be the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.019
 next really nice flight does not 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.030
 only new personal opinion this is the 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.109
 my thought flew this thing that 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.560
 they could easily compete 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.540
 call of duty because we know everything 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.230
 goes around the numbers and not around the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.790
 more competitive people are there more 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.500
 visibility and so there will also be for 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.690
 the competiti I would have known as 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.009
 you know it was really the boom of 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.419
 listen to have liked this video to which 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.740
 I gave a problem of motivation of the 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.330
 change of what I say about this one 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.800
 what is most alienating in the last not 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.900
 they knew that the community 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.280
 European is dying and so on 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.740
 I hope you liked towards globe 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.229
 so we keep sorry for streaming 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.479
 today that I haven't been a little bit of 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.500
 problems with the PCI also called the forest 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.150
 the planes between no one could 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.250
 resolve and I should go streaming today 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.250
 we see very loud pops
