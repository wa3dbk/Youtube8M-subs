00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 hi how are you like frank house know 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:15.450
 frank you do frank to dance town 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 since I was 16 years old I left school 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.820
 but if I threw a lot of dinner 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.279
 dance and I wanted to be cool 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.189
 I loved to go practically from 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.410
 school for dancing but they gave me a lot 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 of many problems that I have a lot of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 communication with my parents 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.930
 I have cut many ties of truth to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.930
 Although I live with them live in 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 the same house but it is not the same 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:46.800
 very little talked with barefoot parents 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.219
 to walk the streets like this 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.010
 dress is like they already identify me and 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.230
 It's like the guy dress 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.960
 barefoot guy and it's like 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.190
 that is an originality from me 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.830
 group not staying like that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.500
 because by feeling like I have 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.200
 learned many things about this not one 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.479
 survive and know that a person 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.030
 when a goal was planned then it does 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.500
 of everything for love to continue that not the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.500
 goal of being a professional dancer 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.850

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:33.620

 I have a very important curiosity 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.989
 to be able to make a decision with you 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.840
 besides this dance you enter to everything 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.910

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.349
 what I like the most is practicing everything 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.819
 so that I can include what is my 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.890
 passion the breakdance if it touches you a 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.200

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.239
