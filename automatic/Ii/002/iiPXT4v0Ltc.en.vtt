 digital bonfá galera beauty in the area of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 new bringing another commented video 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.500
 for you and this time is for those who already 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.860
 enrolled in the channel for those who already 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 been there for some time, she knows that the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 camera is not that way 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.219
 You're seeing, I had to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.820
 reverse the image 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.879
 I usually record by mirror mode 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 and now here for example I am 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.399
 recording in normal mode is fine then it is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.090
 That's why I'm different. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.540
 the camera is reversed so to speak is 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 That's because when I show you the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.430

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.540
 you pull yourself up the difficult step to open 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.849
 100 is very difficult 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.989
 Send that new scent of 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.019
 very good, right? 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.510
 Even more when I collect a card 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.450
 only in canopy season it is very rare 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.819
 collect other albums announce from the cup 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.780
 and it does well 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:58.290
 I'm opening here right with much 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.569
 careful not to end up threatening or 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.890
 worse still ripping no grease 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.269
 clothes 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:10.440
 Then it's ready, it's gone and it's ready. 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:15.180
 here the paper has already been removed and 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:19.019
 it comes exactly in these envelopes here 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.600
 What are you seeing, it's a cardboard 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.780
 This is where they come from, right? 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.319
 if you put it aside and look at the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.060
 cards that comes with what I am 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:36.000
 cover on my face and my face more 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:41.340
 anyway and the biggest doubt of the people is not 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.400
 that's exactly what I can say right? 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.790
 It's by how you know which card goes 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.620
 change what her exact number looks 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.260
 I'm just going to come here and see if 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.169
 It's going to be enough for you to see. I do not know. 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.430
 It's going to be very read for you. 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.060
 clarity 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.840
 but look how that is how they are 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.349
 Cards 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.489
 I think it's not going to focus, but it's the 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.690
 Following 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.959

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.180

 the number of the card to paste on 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.500

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.990
 now curious guy I do not know what it is 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.650
 Because I already completed my 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.710
 album né does not have any more space 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.729
 Let's open here on the Argentinian team. 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:11.430

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.070

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.969

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:54.659

 my other video I showed that I 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.960
 I talked about these new cards 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.030
 There was one card that is three in total 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.670
 Is this right? 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:45.310
