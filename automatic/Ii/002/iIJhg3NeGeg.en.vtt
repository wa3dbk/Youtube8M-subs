I've<00:00:14.309> made<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.030> model<00:00:15.450> 9<00:00:15.750> over<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.730> 9.8<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
I've made the model 9 over here 9.8 a

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.300 
I've made the model 9 over here 9.8 a
and<00:00:19.279> it<00:00:20.279> really<00:00:20.609> has<00:00:20.910> some<00:00:21.240> serious<00:00:21.600> upgrades

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
and it really has some serious upgrades

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.060 
and it really has some serious upgrades
first<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.580> all<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.480> cannon<00:00:24.990> no<00:00:25.710> longer

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
first of all of the cannon no longer

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
first of all of the cannon no longer
have<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> wings<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> side<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.269> made<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
have the wings on the side I made it

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.460 
have the wings on the side I made it
much<00:00:28.320> more<00:00:28.349> compact<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.900> also<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> decide<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
much more compact and also I decide to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.569 
much more compact and also I decide to
make<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.009> more<00:00:32.840> more<00:00:33.860> worthy<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.980> being<00:00:35.219> built

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
make it more more worthy of being built

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.709 
make it more more worthy of being built
as<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.930> price<00:00:37.260> range<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:38.190> mean<00:00:38.489> before<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
as in the price range I mean before it

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.700 
as in the price range I mean before it
used<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:41.059> tossing<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.510> lot<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.989> blocks<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
used to be tossing a lot of blocks and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.040 
used to be tossing a lot of blocks and
whatnot<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.430> build<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.850> well<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.719> pretty

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
whatnot just to build it well I pretty

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.529 
whatnot just to build it well I pretty
much<00:00:46.520> dumbed<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> down<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.879> little<00:00:48.180> bit<00:00:48.329> more

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
much dumbed it down a little bit more

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.479 
much dumbed it down a little bit more
and<00:00:48.899> i<00:00:49.770> made<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:51.230> engine<00:00:52.230> room<00:00:52.379> over<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:52.710> or

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and i made the engine room over here or

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.400 
and i made the engine room over here or
the<00:00:53.850> timer<00:00:54.090> room<00:00:54.829> much<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.660> traversable<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the timer room much more traversable so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.170 
the timer room much more traversable so
now<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> feels<00:00:58.800> overall<00:00:59.670> much<00:00:59.969> more

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
now it feels overall much more

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
now it feels overall much more
comfortable<00:01:01.579> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.879> dry<00:01:03.660> model<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.320> didn't

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
comfortable this is a dry model I didn't

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.850 
comfortable this is a dry model I didn't
really<00:01:04.949> add<00:01:05.189> anything<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.930> i<00:01:07.409> were<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
really add anything because if i were to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.760 
really add anything because if i were to
save<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:09.000> hack<00:01:09.330> more<00:01:09.750> items<00:01:10.200> into<00:01:10.500> this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
save and we hack more items into this

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.080 
save and we hack more items into this
world<00:01:11.130> i<00:01:11.490> probably<00:01:12.360> face<00:01:12.659> corruption<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> far

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
world i probably face corruption so far

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.230 
world i probably face corruption so far
all<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.390> 15<00:01:15.930> saves<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.470> getting<00:01:16.770> corrupted

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
all my 15 saves are getting corrupted

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.760 
all my 15 saves are getting corrupted
now<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> actually<00:01:19.409> built

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
now this one is the one I actually built

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.170 
now this one is the one I actually built
it<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> Imperial<00:01:21.000> vendor<00:01:21.320> 9.5<00:01:22.320> x<00:01:23.180> using

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it is the Imperial vendor 9.5 x using

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
it is the Imperial vendor 9.5 x using
the<00:01:24.299> same<00:01:24.540> model<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.650> nine<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the same model the nine this is the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.539 
the same model the nine this is the
wings<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.970> what<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:29.009> actually<00:01:29.159> take

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
wings of what not and I actually take

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
wings of what not and I actually take
advantage<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.509> made<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.200> ax

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
advantage of that and made that the ax

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.190 
advantage of that and made that the ax
model<00:01:32.070> compared<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.670> last<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.540> one

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
model compared to my last one a one

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.490 
model compared to my last one a one
block<00:01:34.439> o<00:01:34.950> thinner<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.799> i<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:39.000> block

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
block o thinner and i think one block

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.940 
block o thinner and i think one block
shorter<00:01:40.909> alright<00:01:42.439> greatest<00:01:43.439> thing<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.920> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
shorter alright greatest thing of all is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.710 
shorter alright greatest thing of all is
i<00:01:44.220> definitely<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:44.970> advantage<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
i definitely take advantage of the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.560 
i definitely take advantage of the
traversable<00:01:46.939> stock<00:01:47.939> room<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:50.479> making<00:01:51.479> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
traversable stock room here making it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
traversable stock room here making it
very<00:01:51.840> nice<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.530> my<00:01:52.860> stuff<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.670> got<00:01:54.060> my

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
very nice have my stuff here got my

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.399 
very nice have my stuff here got my
workbench<00:01:55.040> just<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.369> crazy<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:58.380> course

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
workbench just like crazy and of course

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.600 
workbench just like crazy and of course
this<00:01:58.950> entire<00:01:59.369> three<00:02:00.119> rows<00:02:00.450> over<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:01.610> are

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
this entire three rows over here are

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.440 
this entire three rows over here are
actually<00:02:02.880> furnaces<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.009> way<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
actually furnaces all the way to the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
actually furnaces all the way to the
very<00:02:06.630> end<00:02:06.930> awesome

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
very end awesome

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.750 
very end awesome
so<00:02:09.330> now<00:02:09.569> I've<00:02:09.810> made<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.410> very<00:02:10.860> good<00:02:11.039> barracks

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
so now I've made a very good barracks

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.580 
so now I've made a very good barracks
it's<00:02:12.590> quite<00:02:13.590> tall<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:16.019> actually<00:02:16.200> takes

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
it's quite tall but it actually takes

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.170 
it's quite tall but it actually takes
advantage<00:02:17.129> of<00:02:17.250> all<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.730> room<00:02:17.879> given<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:20.180> have

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
advantage of all the room given to have

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.000 
advantage of all the room given to have
the<00:02:21.360> ax<00:02:21.510> features<00:02:23.360> now<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.420> short<00:02:25.080> timer<00:02:25.830> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the ax features now the short timer I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.949 
the ax features now the short timer I
had<00:02:26.250> been<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> mark<00:02:26.700> anymore<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.239> signs<00:02:27.599> of<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
had been a mark anymore in signs of the

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.220 
had been a mark anymore in signs of the
Venn<00:02:28.170> design<00:02:28.980> over<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.489> but<00:02:30.019> short<00:02:31.019> timer

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
Venn design over here but short timer

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:40.009 
Venn design over here but short timer
has<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.739> glitch<00:02:31.980> fix<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:38.450> same<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
has the glitch fix and same with the

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:50.600 
has the glitch fix and same with the
medium<00:02:40.980> cover<00:02:48.349> so<00:02:49.349> now<00:02:49.530> more<00:02:49.739> pulsing<00:02:50.340> lights

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
medium cover so now more pulsing lights

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.740 
medium cover so now more pulsing lights
here<00:02:51.470> yay<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.640> included<00:02:54.209> with<00:02:54.480> my

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
here yay all that is included with my

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.620 
here yay all that is included with my
timer<00:02:55.049> update<00:02:56.329> and<00:02:57.329> over<00:02:58.019> here<00:02:58.260> hey<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:59.510> have<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
timer update and over here hey I have a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.530 
timer update and over here hey I have a
cat<00:03:02.720> he<00:03:03.720> likes<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.019> stare<00:03:04.349> at<00:03:04.410> me<00:03:05.060> okay<00:03:06.060> so

cat he likes to stare at me okay so

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.940 
cat he likes to stare at me okay so
anyway<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.180> my<00:03:09.209> mini<00:03:09.989> Imperial<00:03:10.500> venture

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
anyway this is my mini Imperial venture

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.490 
anyway this is my mini Imperial venture
using<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.940> same<00:03:12.150> technique<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.840> used<00:03:13.109> over

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
using the same technique I used over

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.039 
using the same technique I used over
here<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:14.010> make<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.850> entire<00:03:15.209> cannon<00:03:15.810> much

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
here to make the entire cannon much

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.559 
here to make the entire cannon much
smaller<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.829> terms<00:03:16.859> of<00:03:17.280> width<00:03:17.519> I've<00:03:17.910> applied

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
smaller in terms of width I've applied

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.759 
smaller in terms of width I've applied
to<00:03:18.780> hear<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.880> can't<00:03:21.120> really<00:03:21.239> see<00:03:21.359> but<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:21.930> have

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
to hear you can't really see but I have

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.530 
to hear you can't really see but I have
been<00:03:23.010> pretty<00:03:23.250> gone<00:03:23.519> here<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.120> inverter

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
been pretty gone here and this inverter

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.930 
been pretty gone here and this inverter
goes<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.109> direction<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.819> our<00:03:27.090> key<00:03:28.940> key

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
goes this direction this is our key key

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.210 
goes this direction this is our key key
block<00:03:30.299> over<00:03:30.660> here<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.260> one<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.530> our<00:03:31.889> power

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
block over here this one is our power

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.610 
block over here this one is our power
source<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:34.170> light<00:03:34.380> stick<00:03:34.829> jacent<00:03:36.620> adjacent

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
source and a light stick jacent adjacent

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.020 
source and a light stick jacent adjacent
blocks<00:03:37.709> over<00:03:38.100> here<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:40.489> you'll<00:03:41.489> see<00:03:41.700> he'll<00:03:41.819> go

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
blocks over here so you'll see he'll go

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.740 
blocks over here so you'll see he'll go
down<00:03:42.060> sides<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.139> seems<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.709> from<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.010> top

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
down sides and it seems in from the top

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.870 
down sides and it seems in from the top
so<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.810> get<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.739> thinner<00:03:47.040> model<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.730> also

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
so you get a thinner model and you also

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.490 
so you get a thinner model and you also
cover<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.389> little<00:03:48.690> hole<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.019> background

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
cover this little hole in the background

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.559 
cover this little hole in the background
here<00:03:49.639> look<00:03:50.639> at<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.049> two<00:03:52.049> birds<00:03:52.260> one<00:03:52.470> stone

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
here look at that two birds one stone

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.190 
here look at that two birds one stone
and<00:03:55.519> because<00:03:56.519> this<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> cannon<00:03:57.630> video<00:03:57.900> I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
and because this is a cannon video I

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.110 
and because this is a cannon video I
should<00:03:58.349> be<00:03:58.889> shooting<00:03:59.220> my<00:03:59.549> cannon

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120
