00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
leave 1/2 TSP asafoetida explain because

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.120 
leave 1/2 TSP asafoetida explain because
then<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:18.920> have<00:01:19.130> much<00:01:19.369> more<00:01:19.880> flour<00:01:20.570> right<00:01:21.130> mix

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
then we have much more flour right mix

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.440 
then we have much more flour right mix
it<00:01:22.340> went<00:01:22.580> all<00:01:22.790> over<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:25.460> just<00:01:25.970> lit<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> little

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
it went all over and just lit a little

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.550 
it went all over and just lit a little
water<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.170> make<00:01:27.409> them

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.070 

so<00:01:32.290> moved<00:01:33.290> on<00:01:33.680> right<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.280> it's<00:01:34.460> like<00:01:35.080> sticky

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
so moved on right so it's like sticky

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.520 
so moved on right so it's like sticky
sand<00:01:36.620> mixture<00:01:37.070> like<00:01:37.540> use<00:01:38.540> little<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.260> water

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
sand mixture like use little it in water

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.270 
sand mixture like use little it in water
and<00:01:39.830> make<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:41.650> in<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.890> end

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
and make it in the end

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.460 
and make it in the end
apply<00:01:43.640> little<00:01:43.910> oil<00:01:45.220> so<00:01:46.220> it's<00:01:46.370> not<00:01:46.550> sticky<00:01:47.470> just

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
apply little oil so it's not sticky just

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.530 
apply little oil so it's not sticky just
litter<00:01:52.600> see<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:53.900> that<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.650> like<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.100> now<00:01:55.540> if

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
litter see so that is like this now if

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.250 
litter see so that is like this now if
for<00:01:56.840> better<00:01:57.940> softness<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.210> here<00:01:59.570> it's<00:01:59.930> opposed

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
for better softness it here it's opposed

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.330 
for better softness it here it's opposed
a<00:02:00.440> wave<00:02:00.590> like<00:02:00.800> this<00:02:01.010> kind<00:02:01.910> of<00:02:02.030> things<00:02:02.330> just<00:02:06.340> all

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
a wave like this kind of things just all

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:16.870 
a wave like this kind of things just all
those<00:02:07.610> angles<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:14.170> need<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.350> make<00:02:15.560> small<00:02:16.520> small

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
those angles I need to make small small

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.880 
those angles I need to make small small
more<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.450> what<00:02:17.660> I'm<00:02:17.870> unone<00:02:18.500> are<00:02:18.620> doing<00:02:19.480> just

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
more so what I'm unone are doing just

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.479 
more so what I'm unone are doing just
stretch<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.959> stretches<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.489> together

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
stretch it and it stretches and together

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.640 
stretch it and it stretches and together
right<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.380> no<00:02:27.950> going<00:02:28.640> more<00:02:29.000> soft<00:02:29.650> see

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
right so so no going more soft see

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.860 
right so so no going more soft see
spread<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.230> together<00:02:33.280> stretch<00:02:34.280> together

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
spread is and together stretch together

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.550 
spread is and together stretch together
thank

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.580 

I<00:02:39.590> will<00:02:40.370> make<00:02:40.700> evenly<00:02:42.610> materials<00:02:43.610> all<00:02:43.880> its<00:02:44.270> all

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
I will make evenly materials all its all

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.520 
I will make evenly materials all its all
should<00:02:45.590> be<00:02:45.710> on<00:02:45.920> same<00:02:47.320> proportionate<00:02:48.320> so

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
should be on same proportionate so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.560 
should be on same proportionate so
that's<00:02:48.800> why<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:50.170> cut<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:53.590> nice<00:02:54.880> if<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.180> sticky

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570
