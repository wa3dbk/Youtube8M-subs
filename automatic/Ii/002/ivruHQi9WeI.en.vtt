00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.440
 but 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.420
 every one must see how they are hoping that 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.010
 It's happening fabulous here, little cocks and 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.570
 As you can see we are in microns because 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.940
 I told him a 0.10 point quota where 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.520
 checking textures packages and I know 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.980
 Air finished the mother my mother my good 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.320
 good good that this is the package 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.109
 faithfull is called and it is not very this 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.279
 it is not very say that to do so 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.360
 radical like the other package of 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.790
 textures let the volume is ok nothing 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.070
 more than anything it's class that how to say it 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.340
 I add it I have one more aspect it does not 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.710
 more try minecraft or more filmmaker 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.930
 It is clean as for example in the water 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.880
 it looks more transparent it is very much 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.880
 how the water looks if they can see the 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.330
 sword down here see this you can see more 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.250
 believe more smooth not so pixelated be a 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.830
 slightly rougher if you see 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.500
 all seven months let's say that in that 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.019
 property as smooth looks no more 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.910
 smart more cool and good let's see 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.070
 how the flowers have the water 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.080
 love the water really take it for a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.950
 certain power textures since we have 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.170
 flowers mushrooms and grass high grass 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.110
 go down to the trees to spoil data 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.280
 stupid stupid studies all the trees 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.450
 as you can see here we have the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.250
 different types of trees with their 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 respective wood and its respective 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.210
 foliage here are all also that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.620
 may be a little more the coolest 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.320
 of the cocoa teleno 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.570
 and good as you see it looks good to me 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.300
 personally I really love it 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.970
 go it looks great because we have more 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.080
 flowers the biggest flowers we are going to 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.650
 see out here that we have here are the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.600

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.800

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.800
 different blocks as you can see no 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.360
 they are not big precise changes like 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.310
 as the symptoms more list the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.440
 surface as science that more elegant 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.490
 let's see they are not the ones that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.910
 we have kraft chests in the bed 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.590
 carts I know what they are called 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.690
 things I have the point of the language is 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.569
 with what the corals here as 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.220

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.870

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.910
 they call of a friendship we are going to truth by 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.270
 here and how can you see all the blocks 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.970
 they look more like the river plus the pros in 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.510
 zulos and good here we have the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.540
 different mineral minerals batch 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.219
 wool reactor 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.439
 and the different types of blocks that 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.000
 we are in that land with the 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.480
 caves and all that in brick too 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.650
 great but nothing will we see now the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.109
 modes to the modes that the server 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.750
 crystallized in the glass like you 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.109
 jong wook but good here we have the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.970
 clippers between the mods do not change anything 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.950
 or good it will be that I want the same but 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.170
 the modes change it absolutely nothing 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.170
 everything remains the same spiders 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:29.810
 skeletons silveti germans the zombies 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.110

 we have pigs 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.180
 chickens and finally the sheep and as 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.610

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.260
 very cool to me I really like this 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.180

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.620
 tell the truth so remember that they are going to 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.300
 have download link of the package 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.130
 textures and I think this would be all the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.350
