00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.980
 Hello everyone, Mr. Rivers 45 and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.950
 today I will show you the guardian of stone or 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.540
 of course parody of him 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.360
 brown colors and brown details have 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.039
 I am not there therefore we will do it 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.619
 so gray 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.050
 weapons of course or another little 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.119
 will differ in color so that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.820
 set 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:31.289
 life probably cut the most interesting 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.040
 very interesting detail we want 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.350
 to consider 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.440
 so we will consider a little 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 later for now the guard guards 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.860
 dark and light gray brushes 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.010
 light gray black feet 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 these white claws are here on the sides here 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.239
 also beat a helmet dipped or sea 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.820
 the back is not covered as in the set 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 blue head and helmets used from 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.420
 the shelves of the series of the brain then notice it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.890
 here is the part made of bare pieces 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.159
 if you take it look like ours 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.110
 it will turn out very badly if I 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.909
 I will remove her 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.710
 then when I close my head slightly raised 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.200
 see dead and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.689
 what gives such a form that its not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.020
 moving head is obtained that is he 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.970
 looking only up and so he is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.060
 can turn your head than there 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.070
 let's look at the rod 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.970
 here is more like a did because 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.189
 that used brown details and 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.159
 a little yellow and such as but in principle 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:57.299
 to but in the very set of bionicle guard to me 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.840
 just as they said he is spinning here 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.469
 twist 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.899
 but we'll see the detail later. 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.479
 which is attached to on the second hand yet 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:12.659
 on two at once the same he has threads 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.530
 the blade here go know how 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:19.330
 what they give and how we all know that in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.430
 fear there is a machine gun and so small 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.480
 machine gunners they put everything here here 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.209
 he will stand but unfortunately machine guns 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.310
 was not there before and it will be completely new 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:40.329
 item so i used like you 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:43.859
 watch function now here i am 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.810
 used such blasters like that and 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:50.340
 pasted here in this 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.530
 and there are only two holes 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:59.909
 that is 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:03.430
 just shoot bite and strength and 2 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.590
 here we will remove them aside and 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.310
 let's see how it lies here this 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.310
 round life he is so easy to hide 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.170
 if we move this lever here 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.940
 quite simple if the question is 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:26.370
 this will be running to your hands 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.370
 part that is also very cool now 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.370
 about 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.510
 I also think very cool but all this 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.090
 Mechanism to interfere Of course, these 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:49.040
 blasters when we put in here too 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:53.130
 this room does not twist as it should and 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.290
 plaster is also not completely possible 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.330
 so watering for an amateur I think not all 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.470
 will use such blasts as 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:07.110
 the shooter puts everything just a hand 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:12.360
 fixed here so second hand 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:15.560
 Of course, fixed at the end and at 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.560
 we get scared 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.130
