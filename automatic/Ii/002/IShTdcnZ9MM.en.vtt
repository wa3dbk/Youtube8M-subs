like to present you the my oj that's our

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.640 
like to present you the my oj that's our
new<00:00:14.449> project<00:00:14.990> and<00:00:15.199> it's<00:00:15.320> all<00:00:15.440> about

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
new project and it's all about

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.580 
new project and it's all about
customizing<00:00:16.279> a<00:00:16.640> microphone<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:18.050> we<00:00:18.410> thought

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
customizing a microphone so we thought

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.340 
customizing a microphone so we thought
at<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.830> beginning<00:00:18.949> a<00:00:19.900> singer<00:00:20.900> on<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.140> stage

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
at the beginning a singer on the stage

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.380 
at the beginning a singer on the stage
for<00:00:21.619> example<00:00:22.160> he<00:00:22.520> had<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:22.880> much<00:00:23.090> personality

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
for example he had so much personality

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.380 
for example he had so much personality
that's<00:00:24.080> worth<00:00:24.830> making<00:00:25.250> an<00:00:25.640> individual

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
that's worth making an individual

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.540 
that's worth making an individual
microphone<00:00:26.869> for<00:00:27.080> him<00:00:27.230> because<00:00:27.380> everybody<00:00:28.039> its

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
microphone for him because everybody its

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.390 
microphone for him because everybody its
own<00:00:28.820> style<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:30.140> we<00:00:30.289> decided<00:00:30.590> to<00:00:30.740> have<00:00:30.920> four

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
own style and so we decided to have four

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.639 
own style and so we decided to have four
different<00:00:31.610> style<00:00:32.119> walls<00:00:32.449> we<00:00:33.289> have<00:00:33.410> for

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
different style walls we have for

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.000 
different style walls we have for
example<00:00:33.770> this<00:00:34.670> one<00:00:34.730> that's<00:00:35.180> called<00:00:35.480> midnight

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
example this one that's called midnight

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.920 
example this one that's called midnight
then<00:00:37.010> we<00:00:37.219> have<00:00:37.399> you<00:00:37.609> can<00:00:38.000> choose<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.570> ring

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
then we have you can choose to ring

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.319 
then we have you can choose to ring
there<00:00:39.200> but<00:00:40.070> also<00:00:40.310> you<00:00:40.880> have<00:00:41.000> for<00:00:41.270> example

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
there but also you have for example

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.110 
there but also you have for example
voice<00:00:41.870> frames<00:00:42.320> as<00:00:42.620> we<00:00:42.829> call<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:43.940> just

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
voice frames as we call it and you just

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.180 
voice frames as we call it and you just
upload<00:00:44.540> an<00:00:44.960> audio<00:00:45.200> file<00:00:45.649> for<00:00:46.100> example

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
upload an audio file for example

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.670 
upload an audio file for example
recording<00:00:47.000> of<00:00:47.090> your<00:00:47.270> voice<00:00:47.329> after<00:00:48.020> three<00:00:48.470> to

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
five seconds and then we engrave your

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.229 
five seconds and then we engrave your
voice<00:00:51.829> here<00:00:52.130> for<00:00:52.370> example<00:00:52.550> that's<00:00:52.910> named

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
voice here for example that's named

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.650 
voice here for example that's named
mario<00:00:54.050> game<00:00:54.500> part<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.160> that's<00:00:55.460> his<00:00:55.640> name<00:00:55.850> so

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
mario game part so that's his name so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.450 
mario game part so that's his name so
you<00:00:56.750> can<00:00:57.050> be<00:00:57.200> sure<00:00:57.379> nobody<00:00:57.829> else's<00:00:58.190> stay

you can be sure nobody else's stay

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.090 
you can be sure nobody else's stay
microphone<00:00:59.000> as<00:00:59.180> you<00:00:59.620> the<00:01:00.620> next<00:01:00.800> one<00:01:01.070> for

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
microphone as you the next one for

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.329 
microphone as you the next one for
example<00:01:01.790> that<00:01:01.910> spectrum<00:01:02.800> let's<00:01:03.800> all<00:01:04.070> about

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
example that spectrum let's all about

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.760 
example that spectrum let's all about
colors<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.149> have<00:01:06.140> something<00:01:06.530> special

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
colors and have something special

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.069 
colors and have something special
because<00:01:07.009> what<00:01:07.369> else<00:01:07.549> is<00:01:07.820> special<00:01:08.630> about<00:01:08.689> you

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
because what else is special about you

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.080 
because what else is special about you
so<00:01:09.829> you<00:01:09.890> can<00:01:10.130> actually<00:01:10.369> type<00:01:10.790> in<00:01:10.940> your

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
so you can actually type in your

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.570 
so you can actually type in your
birthday<00:01:11.540> on<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.869> internet<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:12.590> then<00:01:13.010> the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
birthday on the internet and then the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.899 
birthday on the internet and then the
computer<00:01:14.090> generates<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.229> form<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.640> size

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
computer generates the form and the size

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.330 
computer generates the form and the size
of<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.240> rings<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.080> can<00:01:18.260> have<00:01:18.409> depending

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
of the rings so you can have depending

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.200 
of the rings so you can have depending
on<00:01:19.460> your<00:01:19.549> birthday<00:01:20.000> different<00:01:20.570> combinations

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
on your birthday different combinations

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
that's other the gradient that's one

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.080 
that's other the gradient that's one
piece<00:01:26.540> also<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.650> shape<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.490> shaft<00:01:28.820> is

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
piece also the shape of the shaft is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.440 
piece also the shape of the shaft is
made<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:30.110> your<00:01:30.470> voice<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.369> of<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.760> audio<00:01:32.180> file

made of your voice so of the audio file
is<00:01:32.990> uploaded<00:01:33.560> afterwards<00:01:34.220> its<00:01:34.880> turn<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.720> you

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
is uploaded afterwards its turn so you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.899 
is uploaded afterwards its turn so you
have<00:01:36.020> really<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> single<00:01:36.979> piece<00:01:37.220> made<00:01:37.549> out<00:01:37.759> of

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
have really a single piece made out of

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.940 
have really a single piece made out of
your<00:01:38.090> more<00:01:38.270> out<00:01:38.869> of<00:01:38.930> your<00:01:39.259> voice<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:39.710> there's

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
your more out of your voice so there's

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
no dynamic phone and the last one that's

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.710 
no dynamic phone and the last one that's
the<00:01:44.720> retro<00:01:45.140> because<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.399> my<00:01:46.610> 88<00:01:47.270> sets<00:01:47.600> the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
the retro because the my 88 sets the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.170 
the retro because the my 88 sets the
technique<00:01:48.110> inside<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:48.770> exists<00:01:49.280> since<00:01:49.909> the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
technique inside it exists since the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.440 
technique inside it exists since the
1960s<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:51.440> we<00:01:51.619> went<00:01:51.979> back<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:53.000> old<00:01:53.149> mess
