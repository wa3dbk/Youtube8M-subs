gravestone that reads earth water air

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.690 
gravestone that reads earth water air
fire<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:42.350> all<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.739> double<00:00:44.100> click<00:00:44.129> here

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
fire and all we do is double click here

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.090 
fire and all we do is double click here
on<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.450> portrait<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.230> go<00:00:46.469> back<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.950> our<00:00:47.010> other

on a portrait to go back to our other

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.220 
on a portrait to go back to our other
party<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.590> similar<00:00:49.980> cave<00:00:54.230> as

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
party and go down a very similar cave as

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
party and go down a very similar cave as
you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> four<00:00:56.010> pillars<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.640> well<00:00:57.059> as

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
you can see the four pillars as well as

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.930 
you can see the four pillars as well as
a<00:00:57.390> gravestone<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.170> reads<00:00:58.350> water<00:00:58.800> earth<00:00:59.399> air

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
a gravestone that reads water earth air

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.039 
a gravestone that reads water earth air
fire<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.739> slightly<00:01:02.010> different<00:01:02.930> of<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
fire so it's slightly different of a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.039 
fire so it's slightly different of a
device<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:04.890> right<00:01:05.580> now<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:06.360> we

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
device that you see right now because we

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.190 
device that you see right now because we
will<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.860> phaeton<00:01:08.490> opponents<00:01:09.360> after<00:01:09.600> solving

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
will be phaeton opponents after solving

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.190 
will be phaeton opponents after solving
these<00:01:10.350> puzzles<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> we'll<00:01:12.240> quickly<00:01:12.450> jump<00:01:12.960> back

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
these puzzles so we'll quickly jump back

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
these puzzles so we'll quickly jump back
to<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> opposite<00:01:14.100> cave<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.820> read<00:01:15.000> F

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
to the opposite cave here and read F

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.370 
to the opposite cave here and read F
water<00:01:15.869> air<00:01:16.350> fire<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.420> actually<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
water air fire so this is actually the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.890 
water air fire so this is actually the
combination<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.580> need<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.939> solve<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.479> puzzle

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
combination we need to solve the puzzle

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.590 
combination we need to solve the puzzle
and<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.189> do<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> other<00:01:24.210> cave

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and we do it by going to the other cave

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.910 
and we do it by going to the other cave
and<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.890> putting<00:01:26.840> earth

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.020 

water<00:01:31.790> seemed<00:01:32.510> different<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:34.460> air<00:01:35.500> and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
water seemed different the air and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.770 
water seemed different the air and
finally<00:01:38.030> fire<00:01:39.369> and<00:01:40.369> after<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:41.030> just<00:01:41.300> quit<00:01:41.600> with

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
finally fire and after it just quit with

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.469 
finally fire and after it just quit with
skeptical<00:01:42.409> ex<00:01:42.560> cave<00:01:42.800> where<00:01:43.580> enter<00:01:43.850> fate<00:01:44.119> and

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
skeptical ex cave where enter fate and

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.230 
skeptical ex cave where enter fate and
that's<00:01:45.290> cave<00:01:45.560> it's<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:45.950> level<00:01:46.220> 5<00:01:46.550> Archer<00:01:47.119> that

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
that's cave it's a level 5 Archer that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.600 
that's cave it's a level 5 Archer that
appeals<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:47.840> can<00:01:48.110> be<00:01:48.229> quite<00:01:48.470> tough<00:01:48.890> especially

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
appeals so can be quite tough especially

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.510 
appeals so can be quite tough especially
if<00:01:49.970> you're<00:01:50.150> low<00:01:50.509> level<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.259> be<00:01:51.770> prepared<00:01:52.009> for<00:01:52.280> a

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
if you're low level so be prepared for a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.910 
if you're low level so be prepared for a
tough<00:01:52.880> battle<00:01:53.150> I'll<00:01:53.690> just<00:01:53.960> skip<00:01:54.259> that<00:01:54.470> battle

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
tough battle I'll just skip that battle

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.969 
tough battle I'll just skip that battle
and<00:01:55.190> quickly<00:01:55.729> show<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.659> input<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.800> need

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
and quickly show you the input you need

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.780 
and quickly show you the input you need
for<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.550> other<00:01:58.729> cave<00:01:59.150> so<00:01:59.930> this<00:02:00.290> time<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:01.280> have

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
for the other cave so this time we have

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.190 
for the other cave so this time we have
water<00:02:02.270> earth<00:02:02.720> air<00:02:03.320> fire<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:05.570> it's<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.990> same

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
water earth air fire so it's the same

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.630 
water earth air fire so it's the same
again<00:02:06.619> we<00:02:06.920> just<00:02:07.160> input<00:02:07.970> water<00:02:09.550> air<00:02:11.860> air<00:02:12.860> now<00:02:13.580> to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
again we just input water air air now to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.509 
again we just input water air air now to
find<00:02:14.209> out<00:02:14.300> what<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.690> finally<00:02:15.500> fire<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:16.370> that

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
find out what and finally fire do that

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.490 
find out what and finally fire do that
calls<00:02:16.730> me<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.120> if<00:02:17.300> we<00:02:17.450> skip<00:02:17.780> over<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.260> next

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
calls me and if we skip over to the next

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.790 
calls me and if we skip over to the next
cave<00:02:19.570> another<00:02:20.570> battle<00:02:20.959> communities<00:02:21.440> less

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
cave another battle communities less

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.020 
cave another battle communities less
time<00:02:22.100> with<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.340> level<00:02:22.640> 5<00:02:23.060> sword<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.019> shield<00:02:24.440> man

yes k so can be quite tough as you said
what's<00:02:28.790> these<00:02:28.970> low<00:02:29.209> levels<00:02:29.750> but<00:02:32.410> once<00:02:33.410> you've
