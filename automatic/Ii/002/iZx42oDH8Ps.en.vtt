we<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:19.109> an<00:00:19.260> absolutely<00:00:20.189> amazing<00:00:20.550> method

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
we have got an absolutely amazing method

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.259 
we have got an absolutely amazing method
I<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:22.050> been<00:00:22.260> testing<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.029> made

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
I have been testing this and I have made

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.710 
I have been testing this and I have made
more<00:00:24.510> than<00:00:24.570> 20k<00:00:25.320> per<00:00:25.920> hour<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.550> really<00:00:27.330> easy<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
more than 20k per hour is really easy to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.390 
more than 20k per hour is really easy to
do<00:00:27.869> before<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> could<00:00:29.220> smash

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
do before we get into it could smash

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.820 
do before we get into it could smash
that<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.820> button<00:00:30.000> more<00:00:30.390> than<00:00:30.539> 250<00:00:31.260> likes<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that like button more than 250 likes and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.310 
that like button more than 250 likes and
I'll<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:33.300> more<00:00:33.420> pack<00:00:33.690> openings<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I'll do some more pack openings and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
I'll do some more pack openings and
maybe<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:34.890> motrin<00:00:35.219> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> want<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> see<00:00:36.000> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
maybe some motrin if you want to see it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.110 
maybe some motrin if you want to see it
so<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.870> method<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.469> being<00:00:38.010> tested<00:00:38.460> by<00:00:38.730> me

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so this method is being tested by me

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 
so this method is being tested by me
today<00:00:39.510> I've<00:00:39.780> been<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> body<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.770> Twitter

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
today I've been on a body on Twitter

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.670 
today I've been on a body on Twitter
it's<00:00:41.610> been<00:00:41.820> brilliant<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.809> easy<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.410> is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it's been brilliant so easy to do is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.400 
it's been brilliant so easy to do is
kind<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> rediscovered<00:00:45.270> method<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.840> haven't

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
kind of a rediscovered method I haven't

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
kind of a rediscovered method I haven't
used<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.430> quite<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.730> while<00:00:47.969> because<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
used it for quite a while because I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
used it for quite a while because I
didn't<00:00:48.539> think<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.840> worked<00:00:49.250> tested<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> today

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
didn't think it worked tested it today

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.880 
didn't think it worked tested it today
and<00:00:50.940> I've<00:00:51.210> been<00:00:51.420> getting<00:00:51.629> some<00:00:51.780> quality<00:00:52.410> deals

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and I've been getting some quality deals

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.060 
and I've been getting some quality deals
now<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.789> method<00:00:54.120> might<00:00:54.300> get<00:00:54.770> ruined<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.890> little

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
now the method might get ruined a little

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
now the method might get ruined a little
bit<00:00:56.219> by<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.910> when<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> make<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> video

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
bit by me because I when I make a video

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
bit by me because I when I make a video
a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.350> people<00:00:58.590> try<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.949> refuel<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
a lot of people try it refuel do it a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.310 
a lot of people try it refuel do it a
corporate<00:01:00.329> life<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.629> watching<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> site<00:01:01.170> at

just convert it's real easy to do there
may<00:02:46.859> be<00:02:46.889> a<00:02:47.069> little<00:02:47.250> bit<00:02:47.400> cheaper<00:02:47.909> if<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.299> wear

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
may be a little bit cheaper if you wear

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.879 
may be a little bit cheaper if you wear
a<00:02:48.629> little<00:02:48.959> bit<00:02:49.079> longer<00:02:49.200> throughout<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.739> day

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889

if you're working this out in your ad
now<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.739> might<00:02:55.950> think<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.609> is<00:02:56.760> a

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
now you might think in all this is a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.789 
now you might think in all this is a
good<00:02:56.970> way<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.599> but<00:02:58.079> there's<00:02:58.379> no<00:02:58.590> proof

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
good way to do it but there's no proof

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.050 
good way to do it but there's no proof
while<00:02:59.280> i'm<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.609> show<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.760> right<00:03:00.000> now

and<00:04:31.919> this<00:04:32.919> dire<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.639> can<00:04:33.789> do<00:04:33.849> it<00:04:33.939> with<00:04:34.120> rares

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
and this dire you can do it with rares

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.959 
and this dire you can do it with rares
as<00:04:34.750> well<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.229> if<00:04:35.289> you<00:04:35.409> go<00:04:35.620> for<00:04:35.770> 600<00:04:36.250> 650<00:04:36.639> that's

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
as well so if you go for 600 650 that's

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.670 
as well so if you go for 600 650 that's
the<00:04:37.120> other<00:04:37.210> way<00:04:37.419> you<00:04:37.479> can<00:04:37.659> do<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.439> what<00:04:38.590> if

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the other way you can do it so what if

you're<00:04:38.830> selling<00:04:39.189> do<00:04:39.250> not<00:04:39.400> sell<00:04:39.610> straight<00:04:39.879> away

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
you're selling do not sell straight away

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.420 
you're selling do not sell straight away
but<00:04:40.139> yeah<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:41.349> you<00:04:41.439> can<00:04:41.650> do<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.830> with<00:04:41.949> life<00:04:42.159> wing

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
but yeah so you can do it with life wing

but yeah so you can do it with life wing
and<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:44.050> can<00:04:44.229> do<00:04:44.319> it<00:04:44.379> with<00:04:44.500> all<00:04:44.740> those<00:04:44.919> goals

and you can do it with all those goals
so<00:04:46.030> it's<00:04:46.810> better<00:04:47.169> if<00:04:47.349> that<00:04:47.590> is<00:04:47.740> fairly<00:04:47.979> simple

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
so it's better if that is fairly simple

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.920
