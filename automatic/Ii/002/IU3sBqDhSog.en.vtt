00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
first on the road yeah I drew first and

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.970 
first on the road yeah I drew first and
I<00:02:59.850> chose<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.299> go<00:03:00.390> first<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.530> think<00:03:01.680> dust

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
I chose to go first and you think dust

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.800 
I chose to go first and you think dust
is<00:03:02.190> going<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.579> on<00:03:03.090> your<00:03:03.269> side<00:03:03.480> if<00:03:03.690> your

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
is going to be on your side if your

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.630 
is going to be on your side if your
first<00:03:04.019> one<00:03:04.140> wrote<00:03:04.319> yeah<00:03:04.829> there's<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.459> bit<00:03:05.609> of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
first one wrote yeah there's a bit of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.069 
first one wrote yeah there's a bit of
that<00:03:05.819> but<00:03:06.000> also<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.329> think<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.630> could<00:03:06.720> rain<00:03:06.900> as

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
that but also I think it could rain as

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.990 
that but also I think it could rain as
well<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.620> if<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.100> rains<00:03:08.310> then<00:03:08.609> there's<00:03:08.880> also

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
well so if it rains then there's also

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.690 
well so if it rains then there's also
some<00:03:09.299> benefit<00:03:09.720> being<00:03:10.170> first<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:11.489> then<00:03:11.549> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
some benefit being first but then the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.580 
some benefit being first but then the
day<00:03:11.819> I've<00:03:12.090> never<00:03:12.720> been<00:03:12.870> first<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.380> rally

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590

where you wanted to be the last few

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.170 
where you wanted to be the last few
years<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.280> there<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.579> go<00:03:23.609> David<00:03:24.060> Higgins

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
years so there you go David Higgins

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.879 
years so there you go David Higgins
first<00:03:24.569> on<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.840> road<00:03:24.989> Antoine<00:03:25.470> what<00:03:25.650> did<00:03:25.769> you

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
first on the road Antoine what did you

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.920 
first on the road Antoine what did you
choose<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:27.030> second<00:03:27.420> choice<00:03:27.630> so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
choose and and then second choice so

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.080 
choose and and then second choice so
first<00:03:28.590> was<00:03:28.769> gone<00:03:28.950> already<00:03:29.250> i<00:03:29.400> was<00:03:29.639> first<00:03:29.850> last

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
first was gone already i was first last

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.900 
first was gone already i was first last
year<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.389> was<00:03:30.420> great<00:03:30.780> because<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.170> was<00:03:31.319> dusty

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
year it was great because it was dusty

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.280 
year it was great because it was dusty
so<00:03:32.910> maybe<00:03:33.120> it'll<00:03:33.359> be<00:03:33.510> dusty<00:03:33.870> again<00:03:34.079> this<00:03:34.230> year

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
so maybe it'll be dusty again this year

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.840 
so maybe it'll be dusty again this year
and<00:03:34.620> David<00:03:34.950> will<00:03:35.069> have<00:03:35.220> picked<00:03:35.430> up<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.730> right

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
and David will have picked up the right

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.090 
and David will have picked up the right
place<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.420> think<00:03:36.870> second<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.260> good<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.650> know
