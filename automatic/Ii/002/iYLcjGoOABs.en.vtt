free<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.840> start<00:00:13.049> off<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.200> game<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:13.740> looking

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
free to start off the game was looking

wall<00:00:20.640> there<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> didn't<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.270> could<00:00:21.480> do

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
wall there I didn't know you could do

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.019 
wall there I didn't know you could do
that<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.020> game<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> we're<00:00:23.670> off<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
that on this game so we're off to a

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.460 
that on this game so we're off to a
pretty<00:00:24.240> weird<00:00:24.449> start<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.960> know<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> triple

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
pretty weird start you know a triple

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.130 
pretty weird start you know a triple
feed<00:00:25.650> followed<00:00:26.070> by<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> wall<00:00:26.880> bang<00:00:27.140> through

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
feed followed by a wall bang through

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.099 
feed followed by a wall bang through
that<00:00:28.289> thick<00:00:29.070> wall<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:29.939> usually<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.019> know

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
that thick wall there usually you know

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.269 
that thick wall there usually you know
you<00:00:31.170> can't<00:00:31.470> shoot<00:00:31.619> through<00:00:31.830> walls<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you can't shoot through walls in this

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.120 
you can't shoot through walls in this
game<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.700> crap<00:00:33.140> even<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.290> deep<00:00:34.469> impact<00:00:34.860> on

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
game for crap even with deep impact on

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.500 
game for crap even with deep impact on
you'll<00:00:35.280> still<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> bunch<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.000> hit<00:00:36.149> markers

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
you'll still get a bunch of hit markers

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.139 
you'll still get a bunch of hit markers
but<00:00:36.860> that's<00:00:37.860> why<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.129> harden<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.820> much<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
but that's why I like harden so much in

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.030 
but that's why I like harden so much in
black<00:00:39.360> ops<00:00:39.570> make<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.200> makes<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
black ops make it makes it so that you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.709 
black ops make it makes it so that you
can<00:00:41.190> shoot<00:00:41.399> through<00:00:41.550> basically<00:00:41.940> any<00:00:42.210> surface

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
can shoot through basically any surface

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.900 
can shoot through basically any surface
with<00:00:42.960> damage<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.770> good<00:00:44.280> damage<00:00:44.700> but

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
with damage like good damage but

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.910 
with damage like good damage but
anywhere<00:00:45.809> we're<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.260> good<00:00:46.440> start<00:00:46.500> here

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
anywhere we're off to a good start here

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.560 
anywhere we're off to a good start here

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
color of black ops but it actually looks

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
it's called and basically what that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.750 
it's called and basically what that
allows<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.870> do<00:02:38.020> is<00:02:38.320> go<00:02:39.100> into<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> prestige

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
think they have some cool things on

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.650 
think they have some cool things on
there<00:02:44.410> like<00:02:44.560> resetting<00:02:45.070> your<00:02:45.190> stats<00:02:45.660> although

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
there like resetting your stats although

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.060 
there like resetting your stats although
i'm<00:02:46.780> not<00:02:46.810> going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.260> do<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.410> that's<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:47.860> waste

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
i'm not going to do that that's a waste

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.940 
i'm not going to do that that's a waste
my<00:02:48.400> opinion<00:02:48.790> um<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.630> don't<00:02:50.290> really<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.830> know<00:02:50.860> I

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
my opinion um I don't really you know I

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.470 
my opinion um I don't really you know I
don't<00:02:51.070> really<00:02:51.220> care<00:02:51.459> about<00:02:51.580> stats<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.270> much

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
don't really care about stats that much

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.780 
don't really care about stats that much
to<00:02:52.690> reset<00:02:53.020> them<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:54.070> think<00:02:54.130> it's<00:02:54.459> just<00:02:54.700> a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
to reset them and I think it's just a

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.720 
to reset them and I think it's just a
waste<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.270> spend<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.810> token<00:02:56.230> on<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:56.800> I

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
waste to spend the token on that but I

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.780 
waste to spend the token on that but I
think<00:02:58.180> there's<00:02:58.420> like<00:02:58.770> double<00:02:59.770> xp<00:03:00.130> for<00:03:00.160> a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
think there's like double xp for a

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.910 
think there's like double xp for a
certain<00:03:01.150> period<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.600> time<00:03:01.660> for<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.350> token<00:03:02.740> or

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
certain period of time for the token or

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.430 
certain period of time for the token or
maybe<00:03:03.730> like<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.330> can<00:03:04.510> pick<00:03:04.690> one<00:03:04.870> gun<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.290> keep

there's<00:05:21.130> different<00:05:21.540> motivations<00:05:22.540> I<00:05:22.690> guess

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.430 
there's different motivations I guess
that<00:05:24.090> different<00:05:25.090> motives<00:05:25.810> that<00:05:25.930> make<00:05:26.260> people

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
that different motives that make people

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.350 
that different motives that make people
you<00:05:26.890> know<00:05:27.010> not<00:05:27.220> prestige<00:05:27.610> or<00:05:27.790> prestige<00:05:28.120> but

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
you know not prestige or prestige but

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.330 
you know not prestige or prestige but
I'm<00:05:28.840> definitely<00:05:29.170> going<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.590> prestige<00:05:29.980> and

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
we'll see how long it takes its I think

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.810

it's<00:05:32.440> like<00:05:32.560> 80<00:05:32.770> levels<00:05:33.220> which<00:05:33.370> is<00:05:33.490> going<00:05:33.640> to<00:05:33.700> be

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820
