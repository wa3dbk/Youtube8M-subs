in Barcelona anyways let's go over some

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.060 
in Barcelona anyways let's go over some
of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.520> changes<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.350> from<00:00:22.350> coming<00:00:22.769> over<00:00:22.949> from

of the changes and from coming over from

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.400 
of the changes and from coming over from
the<00:00:23.130> HTC<00:00:23.550> One<00:00:23.880> m8<00:00:24.210> along<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:24.960> actually<00:00:25.260> what

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the HTC One m8 along with actually what

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.779 
the HTC One m8 along with actually what
they<00:00:25.560> brought<00:00:25.769> new<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> table<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.760> terms

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
they brought new to the table in terms

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.240 
they brought new to the table in terms
of<00:00:27.090> its<00:00:27.240> design<00:00:27.449> specs<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.590> general

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
of its design specs just general

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490 
of its design specs just general
features<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.939> well<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.869> let<00:00:31.170> me<00:00:31.230> spread<00:00:31.380> out

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
features as well so let me spread out

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.990 
features as well so let me spread out
start<00:00:31.800> off<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.040> specs<00:00:32.399> because<00:00:32.820> that's

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
start off with the specs because that's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.639 
start off with the specs because that's
where<00:00:33.180> you'll<00:00:33.329> notice<00:00:33.719> most<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> changes

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
where you'll notice most of the changes

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.560 
where you'll notice most of the changes
and<00:00:35.130> then<00:00:35.250> there's<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.030> some<00:00:36.210> changes

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and then there's actually some changes

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
and then there's actually some changes
that<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.690> made<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> scent<00:00:37.620> software<00:00:38.160> but

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that they made to the scent software but

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160 
that they made to the scent software but
like<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> said<00:00:39.210> we'll<00:00:39.450> start<00:00:39.629> off<00:00:39.690> some<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
like I said we'll start off some of the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.690 
like I said we'll start off some of the
specs<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> 64-bit

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
specs so it's going to be a 64-bit

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
specs so it's going to be a 64-bit
octa-core<00:00:41.879> processor<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> nap<00:00:43.440> during

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
octa-core processor this is a nap during

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.380 
octa-core processor this is a nap during
an<00:00:43.710> 810<00:00:44.010> processor<00:00:44.190> what's<00:00:44.700> interesting<00:00:45.030> here

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
an 810 processor what's interesting here

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
an 810 processor what's interesting here
is<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.870> four<00:00:46.200> cores<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.190> are

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
is that they have four cores that are

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
is that they have four cores that are
actually<00:00:47.760> clocked<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.539> two<00:00:49.110> gigahertz<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
actually clocked at two gigahertz and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.619 
actually clocked at two gigahertz and
they<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.190> four<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
they have four of them that are going to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.930 
they have four of them that are going to
be<00:00:51.750> clocked<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.230> 1.5<00:00:52.860> gigahertz<00:00:53.129> we're<00:00:53.850> not

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
be clocked at 1.5 gigahertz we're not

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.520 
be clocked at 1.5 gigahertz we're not
exactly<00:00:54.090> sure<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.320> mean

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
exactly sure what this is going to mean

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.709 
exactly sure what this is going to mean
in<00:00:55.829> terms<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.190> performance<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
in terms of performance but the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
in terms of performance but the
Snapdragon<00:00:58.379> 810<00:00:58.620> processor<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.460> is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
Snapdragon 810 processor was is

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
Snapdragon 810 processor was is
definitely<00:01:00.270> known<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.260> good<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
definitely known to be really good and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
definitely known to be really good and
it's<00:01:01.739> been<00:01:01.890> used<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> industry<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:02.910> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it's been used in the industry for like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299 
it's been used in the industry for like
the<00:01:03.390> past<00:01:03.420> year<00:01:03.870> many<00:01:04.439> smartphones<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.070> been

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the past year many smartphones have been

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
the past year many smartphones have been
using<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.790> HTC<00:01:06.570> seem<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.140> taken<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
using it HTC seem to have taken a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.609 
using it HTC seem to have taken a
different<00:01:07.530> approach<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.530> it's<00:01:10.530> going

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
different approach on it and it's going

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.020 
different approach on it and it's going
to<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.770> interesting<00:01:10.920> how<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.280> plays<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.820> but

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
to be interesting how that plays out but

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.280 
to be interesting how that plays out but
no<00:01:12.240> matter<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.659> you're<00:01:12.810> still<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> get

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
no matter what you're still going to get

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.899 
no matter what you're still going to get
the<00:01:13.439> performance<00:01:13.770> probably<00:01:14.430> better<00:01:14.610> than

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the performance probably better than

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.870 
the performance probably better than
what's<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> HTC<00:01:15.960> One<00:01:16.200> ma<00:01:16.530> had<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:17.040> well<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
what's the HTC One ma had as well in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
what's the HTC One ma had as well in
terms<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.270> RAM<00:01:18.479> you'll<00:01:18.750> find<00:01:18.990> 3<00:01:19.290> gigabytes<00:01:19.590> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
terms of RAM you'll find 3 gigabytes of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.450 
terms of RAM you'll find 3 gigabytes of

gigabytes of storage and you can
actually<00:01:24.990> expand<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.830> 128<00:01:26.549> gigs<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.479> a

like different folders for apps based on

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.479 
like different folders for apps based on

where you are like work home or anything

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.789 
where you are like work home or anything
you<00:03:27.090> have<00:03:27.330> different<00:03:27.959> folders<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.530> it'll

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
you have different folders and it'll

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.410 
you have different folders and it'll
it'll<00:03:29.130> show<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.400> those<00:03:29.640> folders<00:03:30.030> which<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.390> a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
it'll show you those folders which is a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.970 
it'll show you those folders which is a
really<00:03:30.720> cool<00:03:30.900> thing<00:03:31.170> that's<00:03:31.620> more<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.890> a

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
really cool thing that's more of a

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.520 
really cool thing that's more of a
widget<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.840> there's<00:03:33.840> also<00:03:33.989> different<00:03:34.200> apps

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
widget and there's also different apps

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.500 
widget and there's also different apps
that<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.799> can<00:03:34.830> download<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.299> really

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
that you can download but it's really

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.949 
that you can download but it's really
just<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.900> smart<00:03:37.200> UI<00:03:37.500> or<00:03:37.920> user<00:03:38.220> interface<00:03:38.700> and

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
just a smart UI or user interface and

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.539 
just a smart UI or user interface and
that<00:03:39.959> offers<00:03:40.290> some<00:03:40.560> tweaks<00:03:40.830> beyond<00:03:41.280> what

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
that offers some tweaks beyond what

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.180 
that offers some tweaks beyond what
Android<00:03:41.940> 5.0<00:03:42.180> lollipop<00:03:42.780> also<00:03:43.530> brings<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:44.070> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
Android 5.0 lollipop also brings to the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.100 
Android 5.0 lollipop also brings to the
table<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.670> that's<00:03:44.850> very<00:03:45.030> interesting<00:03:45.180> what<00:03:46.080> I

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
table so that's very interesting what I

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.900 
table so that's very interesting what I
didn't<00:03:46.500> do<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.799> usually<00:03:47.190> my<00:03:47.310> videos<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.730> talk

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
didn't do is usually my videos I talk

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.479 
didn't do is usually my videos I talk
about<00:03:48.090> design<00:03:48.630> first<00:03:49.140> but<00:03:49.470> really<00:03:50.160> you're<00:03:50.340> not

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
about design first but really you're not

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.550 
about design first but really you're not
going<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.760> see<00:03:50.880> major<00:03:51.180> differences<00:03:51.810> in<00:03:52.080> terms

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
going to see major differences in terms

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.320 
going to see major differences in terms
of<00:03:52.709> design<00:03:53.040> coming<00:03:53.340> over<00:03:53.580> from<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.790> one<00:03:54.120> and

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
of design coming over from the one and

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.289 
of design coming over from the one and
ma<00:03:54.709> HTC<00:03:55.709> kept<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.220> same<00:03:56.400> industrial<00:03:56.730> design

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
ma HTC kept that same industrial design

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.940 
ma HTC kept that same industrial design
and<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:57.660> been<00:03:57.870> working<00:03:58.049> for<00:03:58.320> them<00:03:58.470> it's<00:03:58.739> kind

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and it's been working for them it's kind

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.520 
and it's been working for them it's kind
of<00:03:59.010> like<00:03:59.130> an<00:03:59.280> icon<00:03:59.489> now<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.269> it's<00:04:01.019> really<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.500> a

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
of like an icon now and it's really is a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.750 
of like an icon now and it's really is a
really<00:04:01.830> good<00:04:02.010> design<00:04:02.280> there's<00:04:02.489> nothing

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
really good design there's nothing

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.210 
really good design there's nothing
really<00:04:02.910> wrong<00:04:03.060> with<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.110> HTC<00:04:04.590> thought<00:04:04.920> that

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
really wrong with it so HTC thought that

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.069 
really wrong with it so HTC thought that
they<00:04:05.459> just<00:04:05.610> tweaked<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.000> up<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.209> bit<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.660> around

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
they just tweaked it up a bit so around

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.080 
they just tweaked it up a bit so around
the<00:04:07.230> sides<00:04:07.470> there's<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.950> bit<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.549> differences

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
the sides there's a bit of a differences

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.819 
the sides there's a bit of a differences
but<00:04:09.510> for<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.750> most<00:04:09.900> part<00:04:09.989> it's<00:04:10.290> exact<00:04:10.650> same

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
but for the most part it's exact same

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.500 
but for the most part it's exact same
design<00:04:11.160> as

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
design as

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.159 
design as
m8<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.439> no<00:04:14.280> major<00:04:14.610> changes<00:04:14.849> in<00:04:15.390> terms<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.989> its

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
m8 and no major changes in terms of its

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.210 
m8 and no major changes in terms of its
design<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.620> that's<00:04:16.769> why<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:16.889> didn't<00:04:17.100> really

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
design so that's why I didn't really

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.849 
design so that's why I didn't really
cover<00:04:17.519> too<00:04:17.880> much<00:04:18.060> but<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.079> can<00:04:19.229> see<00:04:19.440> from<00:04:19.650> the

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
cover too much but you can see from the

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.710 
cover too much but you can see from the
images<00:04:20.160> as<00:04:20.280> well<00:04:20.519> really<00:04:21.030> they're<00:04:21.299> they're

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
images as well really they're they're

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.450 
images as well really they're they're
very<00:04:21.900> similar<00:04:22.139> in<00:04:22.410> terms<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.800> its<00:04:22.979> design<00:04:23.280> and

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
very similar in terms of its design and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.790 
very similar in terms of its design and
there's<00:04:23.970> nothing<00:04:24.090> wrong<00:04:24.270> with<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.840> samsung

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
there's nothing wrong with that samsung

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.960 
there's nothing wrong with that samsung
took<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.100> bit<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.400> different<00:04:26.729> approaches

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
took a bit of a different approaches

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.850 
took a bit of a different approaches
here<00:04:27.150> with<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.540> galaxy<00:04:27.930> s6<00:04:28.229> they<00:04:28.440> completely

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
here with the galaxy s6 they completely

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.710 
here with the galaxy s6 they completely
revamped<00:04:29.370> their<00:04:29.639> design<00:04:29.970> coming<00:04:30.330> from<00:04:30.539> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
revamped their design coming from the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.350 
revamped their design coming from the
galaxy<00:04:31.050> s5<00:04:31.320> but<00:04:31.860> that's<00:04:32.010> because<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.820> galaxy

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
galaxy s5 but that's because the galaxy

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.600 
galaxy s5 but that's because the galaxy
s5<00:04:33.630> really<00:04:33.990> was<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.199> subpar<00:04:34.830> device<00:04:35.220> in<00:04:35.430> terms

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
s5 really was a subpar device in terms

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.140 
s5 really was a subpar device in terms
of<00:04:35.789> its<00:04:35.940> design<00:04:36.120> anyways<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.740> One<00:04:37.860> m9<00:04:38.039> will<00:04:38.940> be

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
of its design anyways the One m9 will be

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.820 
of its design anyways the One m9 will be
