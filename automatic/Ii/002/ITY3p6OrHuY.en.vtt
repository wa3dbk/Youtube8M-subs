and I was just thinking man this has
really<00:03:45.000> changed<00:03:45.269> because<00:03:45.540> now<00:03:45.720> we<00:03:45.780> have<00:03:45.989> these

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
really changed because now we have these

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.289 
really changed because now we have these
two<00:03:47.220> guys<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.759> then<00:03:47.909> you<00:03:48.000> can<00:03:48.150> put

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
two guys and then you can put

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.039 
two guys and then you can put
woodysgamertag<00:03:48.629> in<00:03:49.819> in<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:51.629> category<00:03:51.900> too

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
woodysgamertag in in that category too

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.020 
woodysgamertag in in that category too
