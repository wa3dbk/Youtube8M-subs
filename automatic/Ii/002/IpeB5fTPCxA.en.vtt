 it's paola and today I'm going to 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.850
 teach how to make these pretty 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:21.039
 colorful and decorative cushions and also 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.990
 they are very easy to do if you want 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.030
 know how they are made still seeing the 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.150
 video the materials that we are going to 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.360
 need are thick fabric in my case 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.239
 I'm using blankets some other fabric 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.980
 of the color that you prefer painting 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.949
 Acrylic or textile of your colors 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:44.440
 favorites a ruler and pencil scissors 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:48.070
 brushes thread and needle or sewing machine 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.650
 and filling for the furniture 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.800
 The first thing we will do is cut in each 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.010
 one of the fabrics a square of 42 x 42 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.500
 centimeters to these we will add a 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.980
 margin one centimeter from the edge of 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.980
 square 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.540
 when the margin is done we are going to 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.119
 take the fabric and we are going to turn this 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.420
 will be the area that we will paint you will take the 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.020
 paintings of your favorite colors and 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.700
 we are going to fill all the fabric 15 the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.250
 you can use all the colors that you 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.440
 you want or a single color in different 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.440
 tonalities this depends on you 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.780
 I decided to put brushes in gold for 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.780
 that gave him a little more light 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.410
 when you have finished let it dry 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.720
 when it is dry with the help of a 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.100
 pencil let's draw the letters of the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:17.370
 word that we want after that what 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:20.460
 will cover with white paint in my case 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.650
 that uses the word arq that later is 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.810
 related to the bunch of brush strokes 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.730
 that we gave to the web but you can 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.030
 use the word or phrase that you 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.030
 want 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.240
 when you finish let it dry time 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.240
 enough 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.330
 for the decoration of the second cushion with 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.510
 the rule let's draw lines to everything 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.690
 along the square with a space of 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.730
 approximately 7 centimeters later 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.370
 with a round object we will help 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.670
 to draw half circles to shape 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.830
 banderillas 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.790
 when we have filled all the lines 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.500
 with circles we will start painting 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.180
 trying to make all circles a 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.620
 same color have a space 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.650
 considerable between when we have 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.069
 finished with a color we will continue with 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.069
 one more 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.480
 then with another 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.430
 and with another and with another and with another until 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.510
 we have finished with all the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.610
 circles when they have dried with 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.220
 a very thin brush and black paint 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.390
 that we will mark the lines on which 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.390
 we draw the circles 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.550
 When everything is ready and dry we can 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.890
 arm we will extend the fabric that will be the 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.230
 second side of the cushion and on this one 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.290
 our decorated fabric but rotating the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.380
 networks in this way we will take it to 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.720
 next step you can do it by hand or 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.090
 well on a sewing machine 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.280
 we will leave a small opening and 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.370
 here we will turn the cloth so that the goji 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.950
 do not be on the right side equally 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.030
 through that opening we will put all the 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.340
 stuffing the pillow 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.260
 with the amount you think is enough 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.190
 so that the cushion is so spongy 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.190
 as you wish 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.490
 finally we will know the exposed area 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.210
 with a thread the color of the fabric or 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.210
 transparent 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.050
 and ready 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.760
 no no 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.500
