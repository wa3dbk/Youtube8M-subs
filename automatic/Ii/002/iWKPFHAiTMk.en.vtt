00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.860
 good to everyone today I come to teach you 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.530
 How to paint your bike your dmx 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.530
 I'm just going to paint the wheel this wheel 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.420
 which is that it has a lilac color and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.970
 here worn out of the brake because it 's what 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.310
 only I have to paint but good 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.170
 if you want to paint the handlebar picture 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.940
 the fork or whatever it is made 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.870
 exactly the same 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.960
 we'll start by putting newspapers in 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.520
 a place where there is ventilation 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.520
 example I'm going to do it on my terrace 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.440
 we put enough newspapers to not 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:49.129
 stain the floor 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.129
 and good and we started with the sandpaper 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.920
 with the sandpaper we are going to limit the parts 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.350
 where they are not ready for example this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 you're spent then we'll go 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.860
 using there to have smooth parts 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.860
 rugged 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.070
 I'm flying the newspapers 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.130
 explains the condiments 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.450
 you also have to leave the chickens 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.450
 so that the painting 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.210
 absorb well 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.210
 those those pictures and what are the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.210
 others an abyss 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.990
 I just sanding this and going back 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.690
 Well, just sanding the buns 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.470
 grated etcetera that had the wheel and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.420
 well now we will proceed to cover 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.370
 the areas that we do not want to be painted 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 in my case how the radios are black and 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.620
 I'm going to paint it black because no no 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.550
 import 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.260
 is happening a weirdo good not 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.470
 it really matters because if it's black 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.030
 that is, if the radius is already black and 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.160
 a little paint on the radio because it's not going to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.560
 spend nothing is not going to be different but 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.280
 I'm going to be able to cover a few so that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.500
 you see how it is made to take a bit of 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.490
 tape what is zeal 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.000
 and roll up the tape on the side where 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.500
 you do not want it to be painted, it's not necessary 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 do it up here but you can do it 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.600
 up here more or less but as not 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.330
 I'm going to do 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.880
 it was to teach you lópez 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.650
 well once you have already sanded 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.510
 exposed the tape you have covered what 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.450
 do not want it to be painted either from 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.420
 handlebar picture or whatever it is then 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.400
 let's look for the poor painting 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.640
 if it's not a good the newspapers could 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.580
 paint 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.850
 Well I have chosen a spray of Chinese 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.360
 ordinary 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.280
 and a bright and good black I warn you 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.370
 what better than you are in the outdoors no 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.680
 you happen to paint at home because it's 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.400
 pretty bad and also that besides that 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.970
 you can paint the furniture or the 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.930
 good soil 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.930
 we will start 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.129
 I'm going to paint it not like that but more or 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.140
 less with a little inclination than the 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.140
 that this is always up 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.739
 good contrast a little and we started to 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.739
 paint 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.129
 little by little 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.920
 yes once you have painted then 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.920
 you want it to look better even 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.959
 endure more I advise you to echéis 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.700
 varnish I'm not going to throw because 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.990
 really this wheel is not going to have 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.730
 more than two months 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:13.459
 you do not need to know that it fits 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.459
 it's just to give it a better touch 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.510
 because it does not mix well with my bike this 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.220
 life and the wear of the full 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.220
 well let's do little by little 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.220
 but when you finish painting I notice 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.340
 well after a while of being 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.040
 painting and finishing 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.009
 I'm going to give it a touch up just for some 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.249
 side 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.849
 that still has lilac or chrome but already 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.849
 I was basically 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.310
 good once you have painted it what 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.900
 Let dry in the sun or wherever the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.180
 shadow of fields does not matter 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.250
 and when it dries you can take a 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.430
 coat of varnish and repaint 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.229
 again varnish so that it takes more to 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.479
 Take more color and do not leave before 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.910
 One thing that I also forgot to say is 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.060
 that you can also from here for before the 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.160
 old paint there are liquids there are things 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.830
 which is not that I understand much of 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.520
 this but if you go to a drugstore then 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.130
 there you will find anything to 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.550
 can pick it up what cappa is painting 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.490
 varnish eyes and well that would be all 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.350
 I already tell you that this method is useful for 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:41.249
 paint any piece of bike box 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.709
 I know well the handles whatever 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.659
 but good the network is the most or what 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:47.459
 it seems more difficult because of the radios because 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.519
 you have to remove the camera you have to do 

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:52.289
 more things but good that would be all if 

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:55.919
