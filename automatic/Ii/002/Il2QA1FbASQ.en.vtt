00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.820

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.930
 I saw the face and I saw the face of a place 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.840
 I know why then I finally decided 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.070
 I decided that name and I do not know I think it's going 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.070
 good that hits 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.840
 When I came here to Madrid, I'm from 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.900
 alicante always wanted to have but it was 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.610
 complicated for good my job such at 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.880
 final I got very heavy very very very 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.780
 heavy and my partner gave them to me and 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.310
 when I saw it I saw it I said it's not the weak and 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.310
 It was love at first sight 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.860
 one 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.340
 for me it is the dog or not 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.530
 that is the best for me if it is 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.530
 amazing is never wonderful 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.860
 but what about living with four animals 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.020
 at home is not new in the life of walesa 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.440
 Since she was little she has been surrounded by everything 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.560
 type of species since childhood has had 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.080
 animals dogs cats parrots turtles 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.480
 chickens I've had everything we always have 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.400
 been surrounded by animals then it is 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.890
 as they are part of my life 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.630
 animals I no longer imagine my life without a 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.600
 animal if the company of an animal 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.150
 because to me particularly the animals 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.280
 the dog or the cat coming into contact 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.370
 with them a lot of relationships is like 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.190
 that I do not get a series of 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.160
 things that I would not know how to explain them 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.770
 but they give me a lot of peace then 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.590
 get to your house that is tubed 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.050
 dog your cat that you receive that are 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.300
 always with you I do not know in a few minutes 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.740
 we will know why bars to rosemary ever 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.740
 I would leave lucas 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.300
 all right 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.330
 but how am I going to abandon this is 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.819
 impossible to leave it for me I do not know 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.980
 comes inside my head the power 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.930
 abandoning lukas ever in life is already 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.380
 like abandoning a part of me of me 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.500
 family then of my life is that it is 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.160
 What I want is that this is impossible 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.160
 I can not 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.260
 there is a part that surprises me a lot 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.989
 human being is that they can not 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.910
 abandon or mistreat animals and if 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.020
 one can not take care of an animal 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.090
 take it somewhere and look for a 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.050
 solution but never abandon it in the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.819
 lifetime 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.430
 Now you know why vanessa rosemary 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:34.139
 I would never abandon lucas if you want 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.150
