realize how recently minecraft had
actually<00:01:48.270> been<00:01:48.360> updated<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.229> busy

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
actually been updated I was kind of busy

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.429 
actually been updated I was kind of busy
so<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.570> can't<00:01:51.570> update<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.930> until<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> mods

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
so I can't update it until all the mods

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.260 
so I can't update it until all the mods
are<00:01:52.530> updated<00:01:52.860> unfortunately<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.759> when<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
are updated unfortunately but when the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.700

mods<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.540> updated<00:01:54.930> we'll<00:01:55.200> hopefully<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.590> the
