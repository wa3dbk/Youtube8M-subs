00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.919
 and now that he came here for the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.919
 city ​​of quito 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.769
 It's a pleasure to meet you here 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.769
 in my book that is beautiful with that 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.880
 hey I was surprised by the topic we're going 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.589
 to be treated is super interesting what 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.140
 says a person's face too 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.750
 look at that has been handled many, many 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.339
 years ago even the police also 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.199
 look for people who know about the 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.120
 reading the face to see also the 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.620
 identity of how is generally a 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.199
 person who has problems and ccoo for 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.269
 ticos and all that kind of stuff but I 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.149
 liked to talk about today's topic 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.489
 because it's a very interesting topic because 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.019
 sometimes we suffer disappointment and sometimes 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.120
 we have a person next to us and we do not 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.650
 we know how this person is but 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.449
 it is also explained that God sends us 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.699
 this also with a face type 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.229
 because we have wanted it, let me 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.019
 say what you have wished to have those 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.580
 lovely eyes that you have this kind of 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.079
 face that you have and just me 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.820
 you asked a moment ago what kind of 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.979
 I have a face and I told you they have the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.259
 oval face but I wanted to talk about 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.720
 three particular faces let's go when 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.250
 in the round face look at you this 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.990
 it is this is the first one that we are 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.890
 pointing to them here that is the face 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.659
 round 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.610
 now let's talk about the features 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.450
 of the face cynic these people are 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.280
 very versatile are not very people 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.850
 spontaneous and have a facility for 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.520
 make money 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.830
 so if you need a name of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.300
 a woman who has a lot of money 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.250
 choose those with a face 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.310
 redondito lie that those skinny 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.300
 they are going to give is economy and all that now 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.420
 Of course, we also have to 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.770
 analyze it under the type of eyes because 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.479
 suddenly you can be a pretty person 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.520
 but do not have money but the eyes 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.410
 they talk about this they give us the nose and the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.080
 mouth for example a person who has 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.170
 economy and has round face has 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.520
 have a big nose do not get 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.630
 the surgery please because they stay 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.149
 penniless 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.149
 have to have the men who have 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.880
 a lot of money they have a Roman nose 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.700
 perfect accompanied by some eyes 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.440
 almond trees not because the people who 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.269
 they have almond or small eyes 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.860
 They are people who have the facility to 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.220
 make money 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.260
 and the lips of the lips usually 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.940
 the lips show a lot for example 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.310
 they have to be meatier in the part 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.590
 from below and fine in the area a detail 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.870
 more now let's talk about the people of 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.489
 square face and so we realize 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.560
 that for example this guy of fame or 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.330
 cristian drama has the prototype of 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.890
 square face if we see the president 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.080
 you also have the face prototype 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.989
 then this face tells us about the 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.569
 people who are nice warm who 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.580
 they have a lot of scenic domain 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.709
 and that with super good to others but 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.920
 They are very reserved and they really like the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.049
 security and they are very homely but which one 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.670
 is the defect of this type of face that 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.470
 they let themselves be influenced a lot by others 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.450
 then that is a point that would have to be 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.330
 analyze it now if this we measure it with 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.849
 this red eyes and we clear 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.709
 it means that a person is very 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.870
 It also lasts in the deal and sometimes we 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.000
 They want to show the gravel the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.980
 salvation we have to do then and 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.900
 if we analyze it with a nose 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.010
 respingada is also a person who 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.349
 like to help others 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.060
 then let's analyze also it is third 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.099
 and the third one that is here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.019
 exactly we will see it in the form of 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.450
 pyramid shape of long list is the 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.780
 face that vanessa has already these 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.239
 people are generally like a power 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.069
 of incredible seduction have power of 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.040
 captive seduction well if you see that 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.379
 Vanessa captivates the cameras already apart 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.140
 of that is very magnetic is a person 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.690
 who likes spiritual life but not 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.510
 at the same time this one sometimes wants to dominate in 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.190
 the house but can not perfect because 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.470
 there are certain situations that can no longer 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.569
 handle by your face type but 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.239
 It is also a person you could say 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.150
 with characteristics to take very 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.709
 well harmoniously with others 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.500
 these are the three faces are those 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.140
 we find 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.060
 there are variations now of the face 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.130
 square we analyze the face 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.850
 rectangular which is the elongated square 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.470
 that is the best face because 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.630
 this is the face of people like 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.840
 in this case jefferson pérez that 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.100
 reach the highest positions in 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.330
 that is proposed for example if he 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.580
 would like to make a president would be a 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.140
 excellent president no longer for example 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.850
 if he wanted to reach another goal the 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.490
 he would achieve because he has the perfect face 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.500
 and in your case the oval face that is a 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.690
 dreamy person 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.930
 is a person who infantas llosa but a 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.009
 the time 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.360
 which is the pillar of the house I imagine 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.400
 that you are the pillar of your house so 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.470
 that I can see, you are the pillar of the 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.960
 house and where he is always giving 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.520
 orders but for good does not have this 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.320
 empowered to do things a 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.180
