limiting I really push my lighting to
the<00:01:41.430> limit<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> lot<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> times<00:01:42.540> I'll<00:01:42.689> put

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.609 
Wi-Fi and other interference on that
highway<00:02:00.540> there's<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> lot<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> stuff<00:02:01.590> that

highway there's a lot of stuff that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.590 
highway there's a lot of stuff that
communicates<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.549> frequency<00:02:02.729> range<00:02:03.299> and

communicates at that frequency range and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.929 
communicates at that frequency range and
i'll<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.110> wait<00:02:04.290> out<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> used<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
i'll just wait out you know I used to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.520 
i'll just wait out you know I used to
really<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.600> freaked<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.110> when<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.439> would

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
really get freaked out when that would

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.690 
really get freaked out when that would
happen<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:07.860> I'm<00:02:08.039> used<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.310> doing<00:02:08.459> my<00:02:08.670> own

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
happen because I'm used to doing my own

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.850 
happen because I'm used to doing my own
off-camera<00:02:09.660> lighting<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> nanos<00:02:10.679> have

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
off-camera lighting but the nanos have

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.410 
off-camera lighting but the nanos have
been<00:02:11.009> awesome<00:02:11.459> because<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.879> range<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
been awesome because the range is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.490 
been awesome because the range is
excellent

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
excellent

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.410 
excellent
they're<00:02:13.680> at<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> different<00:02:14.190> frequency<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:15.120> all

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
they're at a different frequency so all

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360 
they're at a different frequency so all
those<00:02:15.990> variables<00:02:16.440> don't<00:02:16.860> come<00:02:17.010> into<00:02:17.190> play

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
those variables don't come into play

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.730 
those variables don't come into play
here<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.820> they<00:02:18.210> just<00:02:18.360> work<00:02:18.570> you're<00:02:19.530> right<00:02:19.710> I

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
here and they just work you're right I

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.410 
here and they just work you're right I
do<00:02:19.860> ninety<00:02:20.220> percent<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.520> everything<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.970> ETTL

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
do ninety percent of everything in ETTL

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
do ninety percent of everything in ETTL
but<00:02:21.750> I'm<00:02:21.870> comfortable<00:02:22.320> in<00:02:22.500> manual<00:02:22.950> as<00:02:23.070> well<00:02:23.100> so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
but I'm comfortable in manual as well so

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.030 
but I'm comfortable in manual as well so
I<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.300> drop<00:02:24.510> him<00:02:24.660> into<00:02:24.840> manual<00:02:25.140> mode<00:02:25.260> I've

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
I just drop him into manual mode I've

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
I just drop him into manual mode I've
got<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> nanos<00:02:26.730> living<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.240> my<00:02:27.360> light<00:02:27.600> stand

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
got the nanos living on my light stand

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.560 
got the nanos living on my light stand
so<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.920> last<00:02:29.100> three<00:02:29.340> events<00:02:29.610> I've<00:02:29.820> had<00:02:30.090> I've

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
so the last three events I've had I've

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.030 
so the last three events I've had I've
had<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.900> turn<00:02:31.080> him<00:02:31.200> out<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.440> use<00:02:31.620> them<00:02:31.800> for<00:02:31.830> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
had to turn him out and use them for a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.800 
had to turn him out and use them for a
period<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.430> time<00:02:32.610> because<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.420> was<00:02:33.540> some

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
period of time because it was some

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.080 
period of time because it was some
frequency<00:02:34.350> interference<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.130> then<00:02:35.190> later<00:02:35.880> in

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
frequency interference and then later in

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.600 
frequency interference and then later in
the<00:02:36.180> evening<00:02:36.330> when<00:02:37.050> things<00:02:37.860> changed<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
the evening when things changed in the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.130 
the evening when things changed in the
environment<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.240> was<00:02:39.450> able<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.690> switch<00:02:39.900> back

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
environment I was able to switch back

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.800 
environment I was able to switch back
but<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.310> was<00:02:41.610> able<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.910> continue<00:02:42.510> with<00:02:42.660> my

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
but I was able to continue with my

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.810 
but I was able to continue with my
lighting<00:02:43.200> style<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.580> sacrifice

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
lighting style and not have to sacrifice

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.690 
lighting style and not have to sacrifice
anything<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:46.470> because<00:02:46.620> at<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.280> point<00:02:47.520> in

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
anything just because at that point in

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.520 
anything just because at that point in
time<00:02:47.730> something<00:02:48.570> else<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.110> highway<00:02:49.410> at

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
time something else is on the highway at

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.580 
time something else is on the highway at
2.4<00:02:50.160> gigahertz<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.720> you're<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.200> you're<00:02:52.230> saying

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
2.4 gigahertz so you're so you're saying

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.410 
2.4 gigahertz so you're so you're saying
that<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.890> are<00:02:52.920> using<00:02:53.250> your<00:02:53.400> six<00:02:53.790> hundreds<00:02:54.239> and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
that you are using your six hundreds and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.810 
that you are using your six hundreds and
you<00:02:54.630> actually<00:02:54.870> have<00:02:55.380> nanos<00:02:55.920> attached<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.610> them

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
you actually have nanos attached to them

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.840 
you actually have nanos attached to them
so<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.420> are<00:02:57.600> ready<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.470> pinch<00:02:58.739> if<00:02:59.040> they<00:02:59.610> fail

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
so you are ready in a pinch if they fail

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.990 
so you are ready in a pinch if they fail
for<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.270> for<00:03:01.140> sure<00:03:01.350> one<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.250> my<00:03:02.400> core<00:03:02.640> beliefs

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
for you for sure one of my core beliefs

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.750 
for you for sure one of my core beliefs
is<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:04.140> practice<00:03:04.320> practice<00:03:05.130> practice<00:03:05.160> and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
is to practice practice practice and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.930 
is to practice practice practice and
always<00:03:06.600> be<00:03:06.810> prepared<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.560> by<00:03:08.250> being<00:03:08.430> prepared

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
always be prepared and by being prepared

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.150 
always be prepared and by being prepared
you<00:03:09.510> know<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.660> don't<00:03:09.930> get<00:03:10.140> freaked<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.620> when

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
you know I don't get freaked out when

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.680 
you know I don't get freaked out when
the<00:03:11.340> first<00:03:11.520> few<00:03:11.700> times<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.060> was<00:03:12.150> unions<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the first few times I was unions in the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.600 
the first few times I was unions in the
six<00:03:12.989> hundreds<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.470> we<00:03:13.560> lost<00:03:13.739> communication

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
six hundreds and we lost communication

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.010 
six hundreds and we lost communication
and<00:03:14.790> you're<00:03:14.910> trying<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.239> reboot<00:03:15.600> you're

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
and you're trying to reboot you're

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.810 
and you're trying to reboot you're
trying<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.320> get<00:03:16.470> things<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.010> work<00:03:17.040> again<00:03:17.489> and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
trying to get things to work again and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.520 
trying to get things to work again and
then<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.330> have<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.570> go<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.750> one<00:03:19.110> bounce

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
then you just have to go to one bounce

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.380 
then you just have to go to one bounce
flash<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.580> that's<00:03:21.000> not<00:03:21.209> our

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
flash you know and that's not our

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.970 
flash you know and that's not our
signature<00:03:21.900> book<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.410> that's<00:03:22.530> not<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.799> way

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
signature book and that's not the way

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.949 
signature book and that's not the way
I'm<00:03:23.100> comfortable<00:03:23.489> working<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.720> when<00:03:24.870> you

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
I'm comfortable working so when you

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.150 
I'm comfortable working so when you
shared<00:03:25.200> with<00:03:25.260> me<00:03:25.350> two<00:03:25.560> prototypes<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.070> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
shared with me two prototypes of the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.530 
shared with me two prototypes of the
nano<00:03:26.340> I'm<00:03:26.489> like<00:03:26.610> yeah<00:03:26.850> those<00:03:27.030> suckers<00:03:27.330> are

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
nano I'm like yeah those suckers are

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.870 
nano I'm like yeah those suckers are
going<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.810> live<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.019> my<00:03:28.140> bag<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.519> soon<00:03:29.670> as<00:03:29.790> I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
going to live in my bag and as soon as I

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.370 
going to live in my bag and as soon as I
run<00:03:30.060> into<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.299> situation<00:03:30.480> when<00:03:30.930> I'm<00:03:30.989> testing

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
run into a situation when I'm testing

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.229 
run into a situation when I'm testing
the<00:03:31.410> lights<00:03:31.680> where<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.160> can<00:03:32.519> even<00:03:32.640> do<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.970> scan

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
the lights where I can even do the scan

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.210 
the lights where I can even do the scan
on<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> 600<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.470> frequencies<00:03:34.980> are<00:03:35.100> all

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
on the 600 and the frequencies are all

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.039 
on the 600 and the frequencies are all
over<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.580> place<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:36.000> don't<00:03:36.570> worry<00:03:36.720> about<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.019> I

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
over the place I don't worry about it I

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.900 
over the place I don't worry about it I
just<00:03:37.080> turn<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.799> nanos<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.280> away<00:03:38.400> we<00:03:38.549> go<00:03:38.580> oh

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
just turn on the nanos and away we go oh

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.500 
just turn on the nanos and away we go oh
right<00:03:39.690> great<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.000> had<00:03:42.120> mentioned<00:03:42.299> that

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
right great you you had mentioned that

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.910 
right great you you had mentioned that
you<00:03:42.600> maybe<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:42.989> some<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:43.620> did<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
you maybe have some you just did a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.410 
you maybe have some you just did a
workshop<00:03:44.370> recently<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.120> were<00:03:45.209> using

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
workshop recently and you were using

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.259 
workshop recently and you were using
them<00:03:45.690> at<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> workshop<00:03:46.970> with<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.030> whole<00:03:48.239> bunch

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
them at a workshop with a whole bunch

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.360 
them at a workshop with a whole bunch
people<00:03:48.690> checking<00:03:48.989> them<00:03:49.170> out<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.560> gotta<00:03:50.160> tell

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
people checking them out I gotta tell

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.600 
people checking them out I gotta tell
you<00:03:50.489> for<00:03:50.700> teaching<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:52.380> has<00:03:52.620> been<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:53.220> godsend

you for teaching this has been a godsend
and<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.360> reason<00:03:54.540> why<00:03:54.870> whenever<00:03:55.200> we<00:03:55.440> do<00:03:55.590> our

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
and the reason why whenever we do our

and the reason why whenever we do our
what<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.190> flash<00:03:56.400> lighting<00:03:56.970> workshops<00:03:57.390> folks

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
what the flash lighting workshops folks

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.960 
what the flash lighting workshops folks
come<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.709> we<00:03:59.070> encourage<00:03:59.400> them<00:03:59.430> set<00:03:59.730> up<00:03:59.760> their

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
come and we encourage them set up their

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.340 
come and we encourage them set up their
lights<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.480> things<00:04:00.690> but<00:04:00.930> what<00:04:01.140> inevitably

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
lights and things but what inevitably

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.610 
lights and things but what inevitably
happened<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:02.600> in<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.720> pinch<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.230> moment

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
happened is in the pinch of the moment

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.870 
happened is in the pinch of the moment
and<00:04:04.680> trying<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.100> have<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.370> model<00:04:05.700> do

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
and trying to have the model do

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.240 
and trying to have the model do
something<00:04:06.420> very<00:04:06.840> get<00:04:07.200> confused<00:04:07.769> on<00:04:08.010> how<00:04:08.190> to

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
something very get confused on how to

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.949 
something very get confused on how to
get<00:04:08.459> there<00:04:08.640> speedlights<00:04:09.150> communicating

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
get there speedlights communicating

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.890 
get there speedlights communicating
whether<00:04:10.140> it's<00:04:10.350> canon<00:04:10.739> nikon<00:04:10.920> anything

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
whether it's canon nikon anything

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.970 
whether it's canon nikon anything
oftentimes<00:04:12.900> are<00:04:13.230> frustrated<00:04:13.650> cuz<00:04:13.769> things

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
oftentimes are frustrated cuz things

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.830 
oftentimes are frustrated cuz things
aren't<00:04:14.220> working<00:04:14.370> right<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.150> then<00:04:15.570> it<00:04:15.690> takes

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
aren't working right and then it takes

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.840 
aren't working right and then it takes
me<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.079> lot<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.290> time<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.829> go<00:04:16.979> individually<00:04:17.280> to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
me a lot of time to go individually to

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.699 
me a lot of time to go individually to
get<00:04:18.030> all<00:04:18.180> their<00:04:18.510> gear<00:04:18.810> working<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.500> by<00:04:19.560> that

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
get all their gear working and by that

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.199 
get all their gear working and by that
time<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:20.040> could<00:04:20.130> be<00:04:20.250> an<00:04:20.310> hour<00:04:20.430> hour<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.060> half

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
time it could be an hour hour and a half

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.670 
time it could be an hour hour and a half
just<00:04:21.239> getting<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.080> speedlights<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
just getting the speedlights to

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.770 
just getting the speedlights to
communicate<00:04:23.130> my<00:04:23.789> passion<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.479> get<00:04:24.599> them

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
communicate my passion is to get them

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.480 
communicate my passion is to get them
excited<00:04:24.960> about<00:04:25.260> learning<00:04:25.560> how<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.860> light<00:04:26.160> and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
excited about learning how to light and

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.879 
excited about learning how to light and
share

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
share

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.559 
share
and<00:04:26.979> that<00:04:27.189> they<00:04:27.819> could<00:04:27.999> practice<00:04:28.389> the

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
and that they could practice the

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.260 
and that they could practice the
communication<00:04:29.289> outside<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.009> class<00:04:30.219> so<00:04:31.090> we

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
communication outside of the class so we

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.390 
communication outside of the class so we
used<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.810> nanos<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:32.379> we<00:04:32.439> had<00:04:32.650> cannon<00:04:33.069> people

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
used the nanos and we had cannon people

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.260 
used the nanos and we had cannon people
nikon<00:04:34.270> people<00:04:34.689> Sony<00:04:35.349> people<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.219> even<00:04:36.999> one

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
nikon people Sony people and even one

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.089 
nikon people Sony people and even one
person<00:04:37.449> with<00:04:37.719> a<00:04:37.749> point-and-shoot<00:04:38.319> like<00:04:38.560> Rico

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
person with a point-and-shoot like Rico

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.489 
person with a point-and-shoot like Rico
and<00:04:39.370> we<00:04:40.330> set<00:04:40.509> up<00:04:40.629> the<00:04:40.719> lights<00:04:40.930> how<00:04:41.139> we<00:04:41.199> wanted

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:41.499 
and we set up the lights how we wanted

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.739 
and we set up the lights how we wanted
them<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.740> be<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:42.189> then<00:04:42.939> we<00:04:43.150> just<00:04:43.539> passed

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:43.749 
them to be and then we just passed

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.869 
them to be and then we just passed
around<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.139> nano<00:04:44.319> transmitter<00:04:44.979> so<00:04:45.460> everybody

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:45.879 
around the nano transmitter so everybody

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.540 
around the nano transmitter so everybody
was<00:04:46.029> able<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.419> create<00:04:46.779> beautiful<00:04:47.319> images<00:04:47.860> all

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
was able to create beautiful images all

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.429
