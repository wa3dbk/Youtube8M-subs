00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:10.380
 one day in 1699 is here 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.920
 well this is another level 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.920
 difficult 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.449
 there they are going to have to try to go 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.730
 clasping kennels in 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:28.270
 more even possible that no leftover them 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.270
 many many cube above 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.010
 of none of the cages 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.300
 they see that everything is going down 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.300
 pretty small 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.680
 the goal of this is to try to get it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.730
 join the transport cages and that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.730
 do not separate much 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.680
 in saving what I keep I can not 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.410
 save 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.309
 the idea as of the cubes as to 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.309
 save a little more 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.520
 try to take it to globito enough 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.520
 our last instances 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.880
 ceases to be of great help in the end if not 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.520
 good when the level is locked 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.630
 obviously they are going to have to burst and 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.540
 if you are lucky 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.510
 they were never locked like me 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.880
 they take me to the end they see me they start 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.210
 to join the cages and take out the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.210
 mascots 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 and the right already are 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.939
 missing them from the left of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.939
 same and then obviously 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.100
 and this arrived at the base room 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.560
 it's a pretty complicated level I lost 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.950
 much is more in the end I thought there was 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.950
 lost 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.080
 when I only had the fort 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.350
 official but good luck 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.300
 I realized that the plank was going to hit 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.780
 He cited that wooden the last mascotita 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.780
 I was going to fall 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.709
 but good have patience is difficult 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.580
 the level have to be given enough 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.580
 circumstances to be able to pass 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.350
 We've been here for days and everything was 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.750
 separated and I thought I had lost 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.790
 but if you run all to the left 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.569
 in the chanchito stick in plank if you 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.960
 falls off 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.780
 Well I hope I hope they can pass 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.380
 and we would be seeing each other in the next 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.750
 God wants yes 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.750
 and have a great day greetings
