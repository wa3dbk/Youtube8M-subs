was<00:01:34.759> just<00:01:35.000> one<00:01:35.180> of<00:01:35.270> many<00:01:35.450> chances<00:01:35.840> created<00:01:36.440> in

was just one of many chances created in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.560 
was just one of many chances created in
the<00:01:36.770> second<00:01:37.159> half<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.700> think<00:01:37.820> I'm<00:01:38.149> feeling<00:01:38.330> to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
the second half I think I'm feeling to

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.180 
the second half I think I'm feeling to
over<00:01:38.840> there<00:01:38.960> are<00:01:39.080> boats<00:01:39.229> at<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.409> end<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:40.100> know

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
over there are boats at the end you know

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.410 
over there are boats at the end you know
again<00:01:40.430> they<00:01:40.580> were<00:01:40.640> under<00:01:40.880> strengthen<00:01:41.270> but

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
again they were under strengthen but

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.749 
again they were under strengthen but
there<00:01:41.659> he<00:01:42.290> scored<00:01:42.560> one<00:01:42.740> who<00:01:42.860> scored<00:01:43.280> four<00:01:43.490> I

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
there he scored one who scored four I

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.090 
there he scored one who scored four I
think<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:44.750> really<00:01:44.899> should<00:01:45.380> anyone<00:01:45.680> feel<00:01:45.890> won

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
think it's really should anyone feel won

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.249 
think it's really should anyone feel won
but<00:01:46.700> there<00:01:46.940> was<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.660> say<00:01:47.780> I've<00:01:47.869> gone<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.200> year

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
I'm gonna go on hopefully do think these

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.820

things<00:01:50.390> are<00:01:50.570> sure<00:01:50.750> well<00:01:51.380> considering<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
