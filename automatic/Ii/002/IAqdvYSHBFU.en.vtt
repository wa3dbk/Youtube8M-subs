00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.950
 good transmitted to a new video 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:07.439
 good not rumor that places it in that final 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.540
 fantasy 10 h of could have the 10 2 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.280
 inside of the disc company are 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.740
 Three good birds is an exclusive game 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.780
 of playstation 3 and precision vita 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.550
 will come out of the frame action of the end 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
 fantasy 10 I guess for precision 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.349
 three simple and zombie is what is not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.999
 know is it will also end final fantasy 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.130
 open two is still a rumor that no 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.470
 is completely confirmed with which there is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.329
 that having a little care is known that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 it is possible that in three and zombie so not 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.050
 come out the final fantasy gave everything 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.550
 only the final fantasy 10 with what 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.740
 the game would not be a big plus what 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.830
 on the same disc you have the end 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.510
 fantasy 10 h stop in 2 though 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.480
 well, it seems much better to me on the 10th 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.640
 normal with which well then you know 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.770
 the game I still think it has no date 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.800
 official I think the extra life they put it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.210
 for October if I 'm not wrong wrong 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.850
 I guess in e3 or before they do not have 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.410
 the official release date with what 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.230
 what am I going to be the pleasant surprise that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.060
 do not think it's another game in the hdv saga 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.409
 the final fantasy saga in hd with which 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.220
 very good we have attentive to not exist 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.530
 as 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.340
 it is confirmed that such but good the great 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 News 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.040
 final fantasy that I had nothing more 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 It came out for deep prices and I'm sure 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 I did not buy it in HD, I'm not going to 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.630
 know how to pass is the typical thing that happens to us 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.310
 all a lot of people have had a better time 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.050
 final fantasy 7 maybe try it 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.850
 now and do not know what to do this is 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.280
 because the games have changed 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.530
 much have changed in their ease in 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.480
 all in the way of making certain 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.190
 things and really our way of 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.840
 thinking about the games is different not the 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.640
 other games is maybe mind but but 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.619
 those guys already thought differently than 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.580
 before what does for example the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.540
 generation of the next generation 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.540
 I suppose it will be the same 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.720
 We will see to see what if it comes with the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.210
 wind but good for now expect nothing 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.790
 more we do not have to wait 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.229
 it is said that the version will come 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.290
 international that will basically include 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.450
 everything that is new content and such and 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.130
 that does not include the version 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.530
 European with which for a 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.969
 of luxury not so good we'll wait for 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.709
 see if you have the 10 2 also within the 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.190
 10 and nothing we see in the next videos 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.190
 the next 8
