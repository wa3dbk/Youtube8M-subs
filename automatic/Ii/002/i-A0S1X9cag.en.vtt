00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
video I want to go over how you can add

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.830 
video I want to go over how you can add
a<00:00:07.319> cursor<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.400> your<00:00:08.670> menu<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.360> people<00:00:09.690> can

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
a cursor to your menu so people can

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.709 
a cursor to your menu so people can
actually<00:00:10.519> see<00:00:11.519> where<00:00:11.820> their<00:00:12.000> mouth<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.210> and

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
actually see where their mouth is and

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.990 
actually see where their mouth is and
they<00:00:13.200> can<00:00:13.349> click<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.679> button<00:00:14.400> sufficiently

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
they can click the button sufficiently

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.029 
they can click the button sufficiently
so<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.780> do<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:16.650> we're<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> be

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
so to do that what we're going to be

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.900 
so to do that what we're going to be
using<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:18.180> onclipevent<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.770> an<00:00:20.100> image<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
using is a onclipevent with an image and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.070 
using is a onclipevent with an image and
then<00:00:21.390> we're<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.660> make<00:00:21.869> sure<00:00:21.900> that

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
then we're going to make sure that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.880 
then we're going to make sure that
tracks<00:00:22.910> basically<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.119> image<00:00:24.869> follows<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
tracks basically that image follows the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.250 
tracks basically that image follows the
mouse<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> start<00:00:27.210> off<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.080> make

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
mouse so to start off I'm going to make

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.680 
mouse so to start off I'm going to make
a<00:00:28.500> new<00:00:28.769> layer<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> call<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.210> cursor<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:33.660> can

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
a new layer and call it cursor you can

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.069 
a new layer and call it cursor you can
make<00:00:33.960> your<00:00:34.110> own<00:00:34.170> cursor<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.630> adobe<00:00:36.630> photoshop

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079

underscore PNG you want to make sure

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.310 
underscore PNG you want to make sure
you've<00:01:22.170> set<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.909> cursor<00:01:23.909> image<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:25.140> make

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you've set up your cursor image to make

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.020 
you've set up your cursor image to make
sure<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.590> lossless<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.369> make<00:01:26.820> sure<00:01:26.939> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
sure it's lossless and make sure you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.500 
sure it's lossless and make sure you
click<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.450> louse<00:01:27.780> moving

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
click a louse moving

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.810 
click a louse moving
and<00:01:30.410> you<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.860> won't<00:01:30.950> send<00:01:31.250> difference<00:01:31.640> of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
and you you won't send difference of

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.110 
and you you won't send difference of
that<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:32.300> it<00:01:32.990> does<00:01:33.260> work<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.770> ask<00:01:33.920> me<00:01:34.130> okay<00:01:35.060> so

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
that but it does work to ask me okay so

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.760 
that but it does work to ask me okay so
I'm<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.720> going<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.900> drag<00:01:36.110> this<00:01:36.170> down<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.740> the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
I'm just going to drag this down to the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.290 
I'm just going to drag this down to the
middle<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.370> makes<00:01:37.580> it<00:01:37.700> easier<00:01:38.030> for<00:01:38.180> me<00:01:38.270> to

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
middle so it makes it easier for me to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.250 
middle so it makes it easier for me to
see<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.470> can<00:01:39.710> resize<00:01:40.190> this<00:01:40.780> cursor<00:01:41.780> have<00:01:41.990> you

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
see you can resize this cursor have you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260 
see you can resize this cursor have you
want<00:01:42.500> like<00:01:42.800> you<00:01:43.130> can<00:01:43.280> make<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.610> really<00:01:43.910> big<00:01:43.940> if

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
want like you can make it really big if

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.420 
want like you can make it really big if
you<00:01:44.300> really<00:01:44.630> like<00:01:44.810> but<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.350> mean<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.770> doubt

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
you really like but I mean I doubt

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.280 
you really like but I mean I doubt
anyone<00:01:46.850> needs<00:01:47.090> occur<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.900> begs<00:01:48.110> I'm

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
anyone needs occur so that begs I'm

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.440 
anyone needs occur so that begs I'm
going<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.650> leave<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:48.980> to<00:01:49.160> what<00:01:49.370> it<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.490> it's

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
going to leave it to what it is it's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.970 
going to leave it to what it is it's
about<00:01:50.510> right<00:01:50.840> for<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.140> screen<00:01:51.380> resolution

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
about right for the screen resolution

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.880 
about right for the screen resolution
anyway<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:53.390> with<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:53.990> we're<00:01:54.470> going<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.710> want

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
anyway so with that we're going to want

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.830 
anyway so with that we're going to want
to<00:01:54.980> convert<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> symbol<00:01:56.330> because

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
to convert that to a symbol because

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.330 
to convert that to a symbol because
we're<00:01:57.020> going<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.200> be<00:01:57.290> using<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.710> onclipevent

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
we're going to be using a onclipevent

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.840 
we're going to be using a onclipevent
and<00:01:59.260> rather<00:02:00.260> than<00:02:00.410> a<00:02:00.560> button<00:02:00.950> as<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.430> previous

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
and rather than a button as the previous

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.460 
and rather than a button as the previous
things<00:02:02.300> we<00:02:02.479> made<00:02:02.690> we're<00:02:03.050> going<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.229> make<00:02:03.320> sure

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
things we made we're going to make sure

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.080 
things we made we're going to make sure
it's<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.770> movie<00:02:04.220> clip<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.670> I'm<00:02:04.790> just<00:02:04.880> going<00:02:04.970> to

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
it's a movie clip and I'm just going to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.120 
it's a movie clip and I'm just going to
call<00:02:05.240> this<00:02:05.800> cursor<00:02:07.390> yep<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.740> I'm<00:02:09.890> going<00:02:10.070> to

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
call this cursor yep and I'm going to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.500 
call this cursor yep and I'm going to
cause<00:02:10.310> cursor<00:02:10.670> symbol<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:14.920> press<00:02:15.920> ok<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
cause cursor symbol and press ok and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.700 
cause cursor symbol and press ok and
then<00:02:17.510> we're<00:02:17.630> going<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.780> want<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.020> apply<00:02:18.440> some

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
then we're going to want to apply some

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.100 
then we're going to want to apply some
simple<00:02:19.130> action<00:02:19.460> script<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.570> make<00:02:20.959> it

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
simple action script to that to make it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.370 
simple action script to that to make it
actually<00:02:21.340> do<00:02:22.340> side<00:02:22.670> follow<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.420> mouse<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.320> to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
actually do side follow the mouse so to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.020 
actually do side follow the mouse so to
start<00:02:24.740> off<00:02:24.860> we're<00:02:25.100> going<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.280> be<00:02:25.340> doing<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.760> nice

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
start off we're going to be doing a nice

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.640 
start off we're going to be doing a nice
simple<00:02:26.440> unclip<00:02:27.440> event<00:02:27.740> on<00:02:28.030> clip<00:02:29.030> event<00:02:29.930> make

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
simple unclip event on clip event make

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.390 
simple unclip event on clip event make
sure<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:31.900> type<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.080> exactly<00:02:33.590> as<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:33.920> do<00:02:33.980> if

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
sure you type this exactly as I do if

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.490 
sure you type this exactly as I do if
you<00:02:34.550> make<00:02:34.730> any<00:02:34.880> mistakes<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.570> can<00:02:35.750> make<00:02:36.440> it

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
you make any mistakes that can make it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.830 
you make any mistakes that can make it
not<00:02:36.800> work<00:02:37.010> properly<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.000> what<00:02:38.510> we're<00:02:38.660> going<00:02:38.750> to

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
not work properly so what we're going to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.890 
not work properly so what we're going to
do<00:02:38.989> is<00:02:39.290> put<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.100> as<00:02:40.370> inter<00:02:41.000> frame<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.540> soon<00:02:41.810> as

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
do is put this as inter frame so soon as

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.430 
do is put this as inter frame so soon as
it<00:02:41.989> loads<00:02:42.110> up<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:43.340> will<00:02:43.760> work<00:02:44.000> I'm<00:02:44.360> going<00:02:45.350> to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
it loads up this will work I'm going to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.100 
it loads up this will work I'm going to
close<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.650> off<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.489> I'm<00:02:47.420> going<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.600> open<00:02:47.810> up

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
close that off and I'm going to open up

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.930 
close that off and I'm going to open up
this<00:02:48.380> line<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.040> I'm<00:02:50.030> going<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.330> underscore<00:02:50.780> X

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
this line and I'm going to underscore X

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.430 
this line and I'm going to underscore X
basically<00:02:52.940> i'm<00:02:53.209> going<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.480> be<00:02:53.570> doing<00:02:53.720> x<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.290> y

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
basically i'm going to be doing x and y

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.090 
basically i'm going to be doing x and y
axis<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.370> make<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.790> go<00:02:55.940> up<00:02:55.970> up<00:02:56.780> down<00:02:57.500> left<00:02:57.530> and

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
axis to make it go up up down left and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.740 
axis to make it go up up down left and
right<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:58.970> underscore<00:02:59.480> x<00:02:59.690> equals<00:03:01.750> underscore

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
right so underscore x equals underscore

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.510 
right so underscore x equals underscore
root<00:03:03.080> dot<00:03:03.739> on<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.040> score

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
root dot on the score

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.240 
root dot on the score
exmouth<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:08.350> then<00:03:09.350> I'm<00:03:09.500> going<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.740> close<00:03:09.950> that

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
exmouth and then I'm going to close that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.610 
exmouth and then I'm going to close that
off<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:11.420> then<00:03:11.540> we're<00:03:11.690> going<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.840> make<00:03:12.080> another

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
off and then we're going to make another

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.140 
off and then we're going to make another
variable<00:03:13.630> which<00:03:14.630> is<00:03:14.800> underscore<00:03:15.800> y<00:03:16.070> as<00:03:17.890> equals

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
variable which is underscore y as equals

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.950 
variable which is underscore y as equals
underscore<00:03:20.150> root<00:03:20.420> dot<00:03:20.890> underscore<00:03:22.510> why<00:03:23.510> mouse

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
underscore root dot underscore why mouse

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.770 
underscore root dot underscore why mouse
as<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.890> can<00:03:24.980> see<00:03:25.190> those<00:03:25.430> two<00:03:25.670> variables<00:03:26.450> are

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
as you can see those two variables are

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.110 
as you can see those two variables are
the<00:03:26.870> same<00:03:27.140> basically<00:03:27.920> ways<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.520> what's<00:03:28.880> done

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
the same basically ways that what's done

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.820 
the same basically ways that what's done
is<00:03:29.360> done<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.900> set<00:03:30.140> like<00:03:30.380> two<00:03:30.650> different

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
is done to set like two different

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.290 
is done to set like two different
variables<00:03:31.130> 14<00:03:32.290> up<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.590> down<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.300> basically

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
variables 14 up and down and basically

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.230 
variables 14 up and down and basically
set<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.750> root<00:03:35.990> of<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.310> mouse<00:03:37.520> so

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
set the root of that to the mouse so

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.910 
set the root of that to the mouse so
whenever<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.690> move<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.140> it's<00:03:39.590> going<00:03:39.860> to

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
whenever you move it it's going to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.070 
whenever you move it it's going to
follow<00:03:40.130> along<00:03:40.490> with<00:03:40.520> the<00:03:40.760> image<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.270> then

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
follow along with the image and then

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.390 
follow along with the image and then
with<00:03:42.320> that<00:03:42.350> I'm<00:03:42.650> just<00:03:42.710> going<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:42.980> end<00:03:43.160> this

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
with that I'm just going to end this

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.230 
with that I'm just going to end this
like<00:03:44.000> adding<00:03:44.990> in<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:45.260> symbol<00:03:45.650> there<00:03:45.680> and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
like adding in that symbol there and

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.540 
like adding in that symbol there and
then<00:03:47.240> closing<00:03:47.540> off<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> statement<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:49.930> then<00:03:51.550> if

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
then closing off a statement and then if

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.630 
then closing off a statement and then if
I've<00:03:52.760> done<00:03:52.970> this<00:03:53.090> properly<00:03:53.330> it<00:03:53.780> should<00:03:53.840> work

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
I've done this properly it should work

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.750 
I've done this properly it should work
let's<00:03:55.640> go<00:03:55.850> test<00:03:56.090> out

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.300 

and<00:03:59.849> you<00:04:00.569> can<00:04:00.750> see<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.140> follows<00:04:01.500> your<00:04:01.709> cursor

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
and you can see it follows your cursor

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.030 
and you can see it follows your cursor
efficiently<00:04:02.879> now<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.750> now<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.260> UDK<00:04:04.799> they'll

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
efficiently now and now in UDK they'll

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.710 
efficiently now and now in UDK they'll
be<00:04:05.220> able<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.459> press<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.939> buttons<00:04:06.239> properly

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
be able to press the buttons properly

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.569 
be able to press the buttons properly
and<00:04:06.870> see<00:04:07.049> what<00:04:07.200> they're<00:04:07.379> doing<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:08.250> can<00:04:08.430> use

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
and see what they're doing you can use

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.729 
and see what they're doing you can use
cursors<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.269> these<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.750> pause<00:04:10.049> menus<00:04:10.590> and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
cursors like these and pause menus and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.170 
cursors like these and pause menus and
stuff<00:04:10.890> like<00:04:11.159> that<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.579> I'm<00:04:11.909> just<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.120> to

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
stuff like that so I'm just going to

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.440 
stuff like that so I'm just going to
close<00:04:12.390> this<00:04:12.450> off<00:04:13.010> there<00:04:14.010> we<00:04:14.099> go<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:15.060> that's
