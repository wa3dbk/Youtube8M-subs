oh that's what yeah they peels like a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
oh that's what yeah they peels like a
jet<00:01:39.270> engine<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> tail<00:01:40.050> right<00:01:40.319> supplies

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
jet engine and the tail right supplies

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.400 
jet engine and the tail right supplies
electrics<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> supplies<00:01:42.450> cool<00:01:42.899> air<00:01:43.110> bleed

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
electrics and it supplies cool air bleed

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.380 
electrics and it supplies cool air bleed
air<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.399> costs<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> lot<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.910> money<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.210> run

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
air but it costs a lot of money to run

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.320 
air but it costs a lot of money to run
so<00:01:45.720> anytime<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.679> have<00:01:46.710> ground<00:01:47.330> electricity

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
so anytime they have ground electricity

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.230 
so anytime they have ground electricity
in<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.690> air<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:50.340> keep<00:01:50.550> we<00:01:50.729> save<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.060> money

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
our papers for like weather itself and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.090 
our papers for like weather itself and
yep<00:02:03.460> yep<00:02:03.960> dispatch<00:02:04.960> releases<00:02:05.590> what<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.950> is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
yep yep dispatch releases what that is

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.810 
yep yep dispatch releases what that is
when<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.580> flat<00:02:07.030> out<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:08.020> 35,000<00:02:08.950> yup<00:02:09.670> not

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
when the flat out is to 35,000 yup not

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.740 
when the flat out is to 35,000 yup not
to<00:02:10.000> start<00:02:10.390> yeah<00:02:11.370> right<00:02:12.400> how<00:02:13.300> long<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
to start yeah right how long is the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.540 
to start yeah right how long is the
flight<00:02:13.780> actually<00:02:14.200> see<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.070> right<00:02:15.220> there<00:02:15.250> two

flight actually see it right there two

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.700 
flight actually see it right there two
hours<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.090> 25<00:02:16.480> minutes<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.200> air<00:02:17.320> hives<00:02:17.500> an

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
hours and 25 minutes in the air hives an

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.290 
hours and 25 minutes in the air hives an
air<00:02:17.830> time<00:02:18.100> that's<00:02:18.520> pretty<00:02:18.700> phat

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
air time that's pretty phat

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.030 
air time that's pretty phat
what's<00:02:19.660> your<00:02:19.810> cruising<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.320> eyeing<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.680> month

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
what's your cruising you eyeing a month

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
what's your cruising you eyeing a month
point<00:02:21.430> 7e<00:02:21.940> correct<00:02:22.570> point<00:02:22.810> 7<00:02:23.200> 8<00:02:23.320> 7<00:02:24.220> 8<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.940> know

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
point 7e correct point 7 8 7 8 you know

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.450 
point 7e correct point 7 8 7 8 you know
it's<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.960> regular<00:02:26.380> like<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.710> 8<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.010> 20<00:02:27.340> goes

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
it's a regular like that 8 to 20 goes

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.560 
it's a regular like that 8 to 20 goes
about<00:02:27.670> point<00:02:28.330> 78<00:02:28.800> W<00:02:29.800> normal<00:02:30.130> food<00:02:30.400> for<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
about point 78 W normal food for the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.180 
about point 78 W normal food for the
meal<00:02:31.750> before<00:02:34.050> Neil's<00:02:35.050> gonna<00:02:35.260> have<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.440> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
meal before Neil's gonna have a the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.620 
meal before Neil's gonna have a the
engines<00:02:36.520> are<00:02:36.610> gonna<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.850> more<00:02:37.030> economical

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
engines are gonna be more economical

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.900 
engines are gonna be more economical
yeah<00:02:38.260> better<00:02:38.800> it's<00:02:39.010> more<00:02:39.220> efficient<00:02:39.580> airplane

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
yeah better it's more efficient airplane

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.180 
yeah better it's more efficient airplane
yeah<00:02:40.390> so<00:02:40.870> Jeff<00:02:41.050> we've<00:02:41.260> gotten<00:02:41.560> one<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
yeah so Jeff we've gotten one so is the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.500 
yeah so Jeff we've gotten one so is the
difference<00:02:42.610> he<00:02:42.700> said<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.300> you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
difference he said it's just like you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.910 
difference he said it's just like you
know<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> airframe<00:02:44.170> flies<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> little

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
know the airframe flies a little

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.030 
know the airframe flies a little
different<00:02:45.400> well<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:47.500> gonna<00:02:47.620> be<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> newer

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
different well it's gonna be a newer

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.760 
different well it's gonna be a newer
more<00:02:48.280> efficient<00:02:48.730> engines<00:02:49.120> on<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.870> just

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
more efficient engines on it and just

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.940 
more efficient engines on it and just
hold<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.190> frame<00:02:51.459> they're<00:02:51.730> gonna<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:52.060> one

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
hold the frame they're gonna have one

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.180 
hold the frame they're gonna have one
should<00:02:53.950> all<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.430> them<00:02:54.580> should<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.930> Sharklets

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
should all of them should have Sharklets

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.260 
should all of them should have Sharklets
for<00:02:57.190> efficiency<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.760> wings<00:02:58.920> yeah<00:02:59.950> oh<00:03:00.280> by

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
for efficiency on the wings yeah oh by

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.490 
for efficiency on the wings yeah oh by
the<00:03:01.300> way<00:03:01.390> what<00:03:01.660> what<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.080> rod<00:03:02.170> are<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.380> gonna

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the way what what the rod are you gonna

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.490 
the way what what the rod are you gonna
set<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.890> when<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.190> take<00:03:03.550> off<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:04.030> it

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
set it to when you take off is it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.840 
set it to when you take off is it
flexible<00:03:05.500> flex<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.120> big<00:03:07.300> runway<00:03:07.510> here
