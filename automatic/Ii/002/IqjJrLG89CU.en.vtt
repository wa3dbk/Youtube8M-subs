00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.020 
self-discovery
I<00:01:37.100> wanted<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:37.880> visualize<00:01:38.480> that<00:01:38.780> as<00:01:39.080> if<00:01:39.320> if<00:01:40.070> one

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
I wanted to visualize that as if if one

I wanted to visualize that as if if one
had<00:01:41.330> been<00:01:42.080> able<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:43.090> continuously<00:01:44.090> grow<00:01:44.180> their

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
had been able to continuously grow their

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.040 
had been able to continuously grow their
hair<00:01:45.190> over<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.220> lifetime<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:47.120> what<00:01:47.660> evidence

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
hair over a lifetime what what evidence

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.520 
hair over a lifetime what what evidence
would<00:01:48.260> be<00:01:48.290> left<00:01:48.650> like<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.400> theater<00:01:50.240> in<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.230> play

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
would be left like in theater in a play

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.210 
would be left like in theater in a play
when<00:01:51.920> there's<00:01:52.160> a<00:01:52.220> moment<00:01:52.640> when<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.820> character

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
when there's a moment when the character

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.250 
when there's a moment when the character
has<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.760> moment<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.330> self-discovery<00:01:56.960> when

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
has a moment of self-discovery when

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.410 
has a moment of self-discovery when
suddenly<00:01:57.620> they<00:01:57.920> know<00:01:58.780> some<00:02:00.760> integral<00:02:01.760> part<00:02:02.150> of

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
suddenly they know some integral part of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.800 
suddenly they know some integral part of
the<00:02:02.570> story<00:02:02.930> comes<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:04.070> light<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.880> piece<00:02:05.150> goes

the story comes to light the piece goes

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.660 
the story comes to light the piece goes
in<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.080> sort<00:02:06.290> of<00:02:06.320> chronological<00:02:07.070> order<00:02:07.310> from
