00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
between just regular mascara and then

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.160 
between just regular mascara and then
fiber<00:02:53.989> lash<00:02:54.260> mascara<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.840> I'm<00:02:56.840> going<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.050> go

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
fiber lash mascara and I'm going to go

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.390 
fiber lash mascara and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.350> do<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.860> other<00:02:57.890> side<00:02:58.130> as

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
ahead and do it to the other side as

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:10.340 
ahead and do it to the other side as
well<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:01.489> this<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.060> implanting<00:03:02.630> gel

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.930 

that's<00:03:10.560> actually<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.430> find<00:03:11.760> is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
that's actually the I that I find is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.790 
that's actually the I that I find is
thinning<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.660> most<00:03:13.610> for<00:03:14.610> some<00:03:14.760> reason<00:03:15.800> then

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
thinning the most for some reason then

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:26.610 
thinning the most for some reason then
you<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:17.010> take<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.310> fibers

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620
