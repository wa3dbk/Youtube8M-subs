00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
ends because these are the spots that

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.730 
ends because these are the spots that
like<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:44.000> not<00:03:44.600> as<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.110> can<00:03:45.230> see<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:45.560> is

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
already starting to not it's not bad but

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.180 
already starting to not it's not bad but
it<00:03:48.680> needs<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.950> little<00:03:49.040> bit<00:03:49.280> of<00:03:49.340> our<00:03:53.920> oil<00:03:54.920> but<00:03:55.160> you

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
it needs a little bit of our oil but you

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:22.840

can<00:03:55.370> weep<00:03:55.610> on<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.970> tips

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:43.640 

I'm<00:04:23.850> just<00:04:24.210> rice<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.930> gotta<00:04:43.080> be<00:04:43.170> careful<00:04:43.530> that

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
strength so I think I'm good that's why

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.070 
strength so I think I'm good that's why
it's<00:04:47.670> important<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.150> add<00:04:48.420> moisture<00:04:48.690> in
