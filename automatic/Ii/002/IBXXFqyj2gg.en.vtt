00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.240
 welcome to the audible version and video 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.920
 of endodontic notes this resource 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.860
 audiovisual is a complement to the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.840
 Internet page that you consulted was 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.520

 sixth unit embryology physiology e 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.470
 thumb histology the topic that I'm going to read 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.930
 within pulpal embryology is that of 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.930
 the stages of dental development 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.060
 For convenience , stages are described 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.880
 development of the teeth although there is no 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.550
 precise boundaries between them stage of 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.620
 bud button or bud after the sixth 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.870
 week of fetal life occurs a 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.820
 Thickening of the epithelial layer by 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.640
 rapid proliferation of some cells 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.500
 of the basal layer this is known as 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.229
 dental blade and is the primordium 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.720
 precursor of the little enamel organ 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.119
 then in each maxilla they are presented 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.130
 ten small rounded thickenings 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.259
 inside the dental lamina 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.770
 these are future dental germs 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.690
 cap or hat stage after 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.780
 the button stage the cell division 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.240
 circadian rhythm causes proliferation 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.670
 uneven part of the epithelium the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.500
 deep surface of the button starts to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.259
 imagine and several layers are made 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.030
 obvious these are the dental epithelium 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.800
 internal that is a layer of cells 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.229
 epithelial at the level of 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.360
 concavity and external dental epithelium 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.460
 which is a simple layer of cells 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.220
 short epithelial on the surface 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.570
 outside in the center separate the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.920
 cells by fluid increase 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.470
 intercellular much 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.590
 take not as shown by the 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.420
 steve periodic acid reaction 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.549
 these cells are known as reticulum 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.530
 the dental organ starry 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.149
 Epithelial proliferation is fixed to the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.549
 dental lamina through a section of epithelium 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.950
 that continues to grow and proliferate towards 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.140
 the connective tissue around the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.000
 eighth week of intrauterine life is 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.850
 observe the first husband of the papilla 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.920
 dental this corresponds to condensation 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.750
 of connective tissue under the epithelium 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.090
 internal dental that later 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.890
 converts the dental pulp into a 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.140
 beginning the cells of the papilla 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.330
 teeth are large and rounded or 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.120
 polyhedral with pale cytoplasm and 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.890
 large nucleus at the same time it 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.750
 condenses the mesenchyme surrounding the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.540
 outside of the developing tooth and it 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.360
 it becomes more fibrous this tissue is called 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.730
 dental sac dental sac cells 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.580
 will form the tissues of the periodontium that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.519
 are the cement periodontal ligament and 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.590
 alveolar bone bell stage is 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.480
 deepens the imagination and occur one 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.670
 series of interactions between cells 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.440
 epithelial and mesenchymal 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.880
 cause differentiation of cells 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.550
 of the dental epithelium 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.890
 in high columnar cells called 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.780
 ameloblasts the exchange of 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.370
 inductive information between the epithelium 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.460
 mesenchyme occurs through the 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.770
 basal membrane the ameloblasts 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.110
 contribute to form enamel cells 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.510
 of the dental papilla that are below 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.390
 the ameloblasts differ 1 2

 coughs that are going to make dentinho 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.470
 several layers of squamous cells of 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.170
 little height begin to emerge next to 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.630
 internal dental epithelium this layer is 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.490
 intermediate layer called this is all 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.980
 for now to see the illustrations 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.120
 on the subject and the bibliography should 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:39.890
 check the site www point is here 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.440
 point 1 point mx diagonal r rivas but 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.390
 If you just want to keep going through 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.580
 to the following electronic page and 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.860
 will continue listening and watching this version
