quest land our technology lab what you

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.690 
quest land our technology lab what you
do<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.840> actually<00:02:24.019> sup<00:02:24.500> grid<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.190> medical

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
do is you actually sup grid you medical

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.390 
do is you actually sup grid you medical
sad<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:27.019> like<00:02:27.170> your<00:02:27.470> grid<00:02:27.739> anything<00:02:28.190> else

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
sad just like your grid anything else

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.390 
sad just like your grid anything else
but<00:02:29.090> as<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.450> go<00:02:29.750> first<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.739> all<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.890> get<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
but as you go first of all you get the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400 
but as you go first of all you get the
stuff<00:02:32.150> handed<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.840> dot<00:02:33.049> so<00:02:33.290> which

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
stuff handed in to the dot so which

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.770 
stuff handed in to the dot so which
gives<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.920> stickers<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.940> stims<00:02:35.480> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
gives you the stickers the stims and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.479 
gives you the stickers the stims and
stuff<00:02:35.989> like<00:02:36.170> them<00:02:36.470> then<00:02:37.130> you'll<00:02:37.250> get<00:02:37.459> a

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
you can't build them too early you've

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500 
you can't build them too early you've
gotta<00:03:30.709> increase<00:03:31.280> all<00:03:31.639> three<00:03:31.940> levels<00:03:32.150> will

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
gotta increase all three levels will

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.470 
gotta increase all three levels will
point<00:03:32.870> before<00:03:33.109> you<00:03:33.410> can<00:03:33.590> do<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:33.880> but<00:03:34.880> once

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
point before you can do that but once

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.259 
point before you can do that but once
you<00:03:35.660> have<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.680> can<00:03:37.010> build<00:03:37.310> them<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:37.730> that

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
you have you can build them and that

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.120 
you have you can build them and that
room<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.870> just<00:03:39.109> beam<00:03:39.350> in<00:03:39.380> was<00:03:39.680> actually<00:03:40.040> the

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
room you just beam in was actually the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.190 
room you just beam in was actually the
barracks<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:40.819> that<00:03:41.239> is<00:03:41.389> one<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.840> upgrades

you<00:03:42.290> get<00:03:42.560> from<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.040> workshop<00:03:43.609> which<00:03:44.480> you're

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
you get from the workshop which you're

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.870 
you get from the workshop which you're
about<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.170> see<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.620> workshop<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.519> actually

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
about to see the workshop is actually

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.970 
about to see the workshop is actually
where<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.569> engineers<00:03:48.109> are<00:03:48.380> one<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.680> first

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
where the engineers are one of the first

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.920 
where the engineers are one of the first
things<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.459> do<00:03:49.700> when<00:03:50.600> you<00:03:50.750> actually

Canterbury<00:04:20.549> Commons<00:04:21.080> but<00:04:22.080> they<00:04:22.230> all<00:04:22.350> tie<00:04:22.680> in

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
Canterbury Commons but they all tie in

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.940 
Canterbury Commons but they all tie in
case<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:24.120> start<00:04:24.510> off<00:04:24.660> with<00:04:24.930> your<00:04:25.260> basic<00:04:25.470> goods

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
case you start off with your basic goods

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.470 
case you start off with your basic goods
and<00:04:26.100> then<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.280> get<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.490> where<00:04:26.820> dedicated

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
and then you get to where dedicated

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.330 
and then you get to where dedicated
office<00:04:27.750> like<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.050> lab<00:04:28.230> or<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> workshop<00:04:29.130> or

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
office like the lab or the workshop or

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.130 
office like the lab or the workshop or
whatever<00:04:29.670> else<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.210> then<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.780> build<00:04:30.990> the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
whatever else and then you build the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.780 
whatever else and then you build the
stuff<00:04:31.350> they're<00:04:31.650> need<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.100> make<00:04:32.280> more<00:04:32.490> advanced

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
stuff they're need to make more advanced

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.040 
stuff they're need to make more advanced
stuff<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.240> then<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.450> advanced<00:04:33.780> stuff

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
stuff and then the advanced stuff

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.560 
stuff and then the advanced stuff
becomes<00:04:34.440> available<00:04:34.800> but<00:04:35.700> slowly<00:04:36.000> between<00:04:36.480> the

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
becomes available but slowly between the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.690 
becomes available but slowly between the
beginning<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.140> game<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.590> then<00:04:38.190> you're

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
beginning of the game and then you're

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.360 
beginning of the game and then you're
slowly<00:04:39.060> being<00:04:39.420> introduced<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.440> new<00:04:40.470> stuff<00:04:41.130> as

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
slowly being introduced to new stuff as

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.280 
slowly being introduced to new stuff as
you<00:04:41.790> go<00:04:42.350> so<00:04:43.350> it's<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.950> slow<00:04:44.390> development<00:04:45.390> of<00:04:45.810> the

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
you go so it's a slow development of the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.650 
you go so it's a slow development of the
bottom<00:04:46.710> modern<00:04:47.070> sloth<00:04:47.460> slurry<00:04:47.910> building<00:04:48.540> of

Canterbury<00:04:49.110> Commons<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.010> as<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.280> rebuild

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
Canterbury Commons and as you rebuild

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.490 
Canterbury Commons and as you rebuild
these<00:04:50.820> houses<00:04:51.450> you<00:04:51.600> see<00:04:51.780> now<00:04:52.020> these<00:04:52.170> empty

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
these houses you see now these empty

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.800 
these houses you see now these empty
houses<00:04:52.710> we<00:04:53.040> still<00:04:53.310> need<00:04:53.490> decorate<00:04:53.970> in<00:04:54.210> will

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
houses we still need decorate in will

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.570 
houses we still need decorate in will
eventually<00:04:55.350> fill<00:04:55.560> up<00:04:55.680> with<00:04:55.830> families<00:04:56.370> which

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
eventually fill up with families which

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.580 
eventually fill up with families which
are<00:04:56.700> attracted<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.450> place<00:04:57.690> because<00:04:58.470> of

but you get an idea sort of thing I'm
doing<00:05:19.680> now<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.670> can<00:05:20.820> see<00:05:21.000> how<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.300> works

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
doing now and you can see how it works

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.840 
doing now and you can see how it works
round<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.590> back<00:05:22.620> here<00:05:23.010> you'll<00:05:23.340> see<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.640> power

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
round the back here you'll see the power

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
will magically appear as your technology

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.030 
will magically appear as your technology
improves<00:05:29.660> that's<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.900> workshop<00:05:31.440> quest<00:05:31.770> line

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
improves that's the workshop quest line

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.770 
improves that's the workshop quest line
and<00:05:32.340> there's<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.520> water<00:05:32.760> spout<00:05:33.150> there<00:05:33.390> look<00:05:33.630> as

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
and there's a water spout there look as

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.090 
and there's a water spout there look as
well<00:05:33.990> so<00:05:34.260> it's<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.470> self<00:05:34.680> clocked<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:35.070> little

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100
