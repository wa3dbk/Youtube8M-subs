00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
spin so now you're gonna move the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550 
spin so now you're gonna move the
joystick<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> left<00:01:45.689> side<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.289> a<00:01:46.350> little

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
joystick on the left side just a little

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.490 
joystick on the left side just a little
bit

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.880 

so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:53.159> know<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.550> it's<00:01:54.290> working<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.620> so

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so you know that it's working there so

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.920 
so you know that it's working there so
now<00:01:56.070> you're<00:01:56.310> gonna<00:01:56.400> move<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.540> right

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
now you're gonna move your right

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.850 
now you're gonna move your right
joystick<00:01:59.030> either<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.420> down<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.620> see

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
joystick either up or down so you see

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.120 
joystick either up or down so you see
that<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.370> rear<00:02:02.729> motor<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.360> moving<00:02:04.130> right

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that the rear motor is moving right

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.230 
that the rear motor is moving right
there<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.850> move<00:02:09.240> it<00:02:10.400> left<00:02:11.400> you

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
there and so if you move it left you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.420 
there and so if you move it left you
will<00:02:12.330> feel<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.750> wrote<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.890> your<00:02:14.040> hand<00:02:14.220> with

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
will feel it wrote it in your hand with

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.690 
will feel it wrote it in your hand with
it<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.790> same<00:02:15.090> thing<00:02:15.120> when<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.550> move<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
it and same thing when you move it to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.940 
it and same thing when you move it to
the<00:02:17.910> right<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.110> happens<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.800> means

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the right so when that happens it means

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.400 
the right so when that happens it means
that<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.970> good<00:02:21.030> working<00:02:21.390> condition<00:02:21.510> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
that it's in good working condition so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.680 
that it's in good working condition so
