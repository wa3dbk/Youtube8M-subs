not like a warehouse is you're not it's

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.009 
not like a warehouse is you're not it's
it's<00:03:12.130> short<00:03:12.340> torn<00:03:12.579> short<00:03:13.150> term<00:03:13.359> story<00:03:13.720> very

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
it's short torn short term story very

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.319 
it's short torn short term story very
very<00:03:14.260> short<00:03:14.500> term<00:03:14.650> great<00:03:15.160> he<00:03:15.639> gave<00:03:15.819> me<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.060> quick

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
very short term great he gave me a quick

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.210 
very short term great he gave me a quick
lesson<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.959> how<00:03:17.049> they<00:03:17.260> size<00:03:17.530> up<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.010> fish

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
lesson and how they size up the fish

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.159 
lesson and how they size up the fish
they<00:03:18.430> buy<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:19.000> lot<00:03:19.419> of<00:03:19.450> those<00:03:19.599> fish<00:03:19.930> come<00:03:20.139> in

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
they buy a lot of those fish come in

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.930 
they buy a lot of those fish come in
with<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.530> skin<00:03:20.739> on<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:21.220> it's<00:03:21.370> easy<00:03:21.819> to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
with the skin on so it's easy to

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.550 
with the skin on so it's easy to
identify<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.660> we<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.930> lot<00:03:23.109> of<00:03:23.230> confidence

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
identify so we have a lot of confidence

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.069 
identify so we have a lot of confidence
for<00:03:23.950> ourselves<00:03:24.489> in<00:03:24.669> checking<00:03:25.599> what<00:03:25.959> we

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
for ourselves in checking what we

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.380 
for ourselves in checking what we
received

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
received

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.360 
received
but<00:03:27.690> consumers<00:03:28.170> don't<00:03:28.470> always<00:03:28.620> buy<00:03:28.890> fish<00:03:29.160> with

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
but consumers don't always buy fish with

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.500 
but consumers don't always buy fish with
the<00:03:29.460> skin<00:03:29.730> still<00:03:29.880> on

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the skin still on

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.320 
the skin still on
in<00:03:30.569> fact<00:03:31.260> we<00:03:31.830> usually<00:03:32.340> buy<00:03:32.490> it<00:03:32.550> when<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.150> looks

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
in fact we usually buy it when it looks

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.510 
in fact we usually buy it when it looks
like<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:34.170> example<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.860> Pacific

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
like this for example this is Pacific

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.420 
like this for example this is Pacific
halibut<00:03:35.940> from<00:03:36.630> Alaska<00:03:37.530> or<00:03:37.680> British<00:03:37.950> Columbia

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
halibut from Alaska or British Columbia

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.390 
halibut from Alaska or British Columbia
whereas<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.420> cortez<00:03:40.080> halibut<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:41.250> is

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
whereas this is cortez halibut this is

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.160 
whereas this is cortez halibut this is
from<00:03:41.610> Mexico<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.180> cortez<00:03:42.690> halibut

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
from Mexico so it's cortez halibut

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
from Mexico so it's cortez halibut
imagine<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.220> may<00:03:45.120> be<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.270> smaller<00:03:45.630> piece<00:03:46.190> just

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
imagine this may be a smaller piece just

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.670 
imagine this may be a smaller piece just
a<00:03:47.400> portion<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.120> cooked<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.080> plate<00:03:49.410> you

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
a portion of it cooked on a plate you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.820 
a portion of it cooked on a plate you
can't<00:03:50.400> really<00:03:50.550> tell<00:03:50.840> or<00:03:51.840> take<00:03:52.170> these<00:03:52.410> salmon

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
can't really tell or take these salmon

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.100 
can't really tell or take these salmon
fillets<00:03:53.190> they<00:03:53.940> look<00:03:54.150> alike<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.720> they're<00:03:54.989> both

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
fillets they look alike and they're both

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.949 
fillets they look alike and they're both
farmed<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:56.310> ones<00:03:56.580> more<00:03:56.910> expensive<00:03:57.630> than<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
farmed but ones more expensive than the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.020 
farmed but ones more expensive than the
other<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.800> one<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.130> farmed<00:03:59.520> in<00:03:59.700> British

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
other this one is farmed in British

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.260 
other this one is farmed in British
Columbia<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:01.709> one<00:04:01.860> is<00:04:02.010> farmed<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.640> Scotland

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
Columbia this one is farmed in Scotland

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.600 
Columbia this one is farmed in Scotland
so<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:04.320> fish<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.770> different<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.459> the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
so this fish is different in that the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.699 
so this fish is different in that the
fat<00:04:05.880> content<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.110> lot<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.380> other<00:04:07.500> things

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
fat content and in a lot of other things

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.100 
fat content and in a lot of other things
so<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.610> more<00:04:08.820> valuable<00:04:08.850> product<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
so this is a more valuable product the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.600 
so this is a more valuable product the
more<00:04:10.260> this<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.620> more<00:04:10.800> valuable<00:04:10.830> part<00:04:11.400> it's

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
more this is a more valuable part it's

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.490 
more this is a more valuable part it's
from<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> specific<00:04:12.300> area<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.750> fat<00:04:12.930> content<00:04:13.140> is

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
from a specific area the fat content is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.710 
from a specific area the fat content is
different<00:04:13.980> but<00:04:14.400> it's<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.640> same<00:04:14.820> size<00:04:15.060> same

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
species so that's difficult things get

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.729 
species so that's difficult things get
even<00:04:18.090> more<00:04:18.390> confusing<00:04:18.900> when<00:04:19.079> fish<00:04:19.500> have

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
even more confusing when fish have

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.220 
even more confusing when fish have
