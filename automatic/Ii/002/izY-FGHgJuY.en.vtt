00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.210
 m 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 via hello all pretty delicate 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.369
 I hope you are well in any case 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.959
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.960
 new video en route in the 10000 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.460
 success points with so the dungeon 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.720
 maleficient one remained more than the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.369
 biskri evil spell as you could 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.770
 see it quickly on the screen 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.809
 I put the video you can see it in 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.750
 accelerated x 3 simply because the 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.219
 fight is ultra long and ultra boring 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.350
 continue in normal speed 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.420
 so I preferred to speed it up to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.710
 minimize video while 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.920
 still offering a fight 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.469
 relatively visible because it does not include 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.030
 no major difficulty 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.800
 once the boss is dead after 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.510
 it's just waves of monsters and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 so it's completely uninteresting 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.059
 that was also so to make the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.339
 more pleasant thing then the technique 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.809
 so from this evil and tax to do it at 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.969
 bliss creek georgia awarded to my little in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.909
 of 6 with the iop and the zobal in order to 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.659
 to make masquerade and gap anger for the 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.340
 succeed without major worry there because in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.049
 do the blitzkrieg despite his small 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.409
 level without us already causing big 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.060
 worries because if it has less than 50% of these pv 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.470
 whenever we make an attack 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.000
 above it is added 500 points of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.170
 shields so if you will tell me 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.880
 to do blitzkrieg it's a little bit 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.320
 boring because we can always 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.230
 do not get past 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.940
 so we say good, it's a little 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.680
 little miss so we'll change the anger 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.260
 of yop so i already changed torah on 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.240
 is already turns 2 so here I'm just finishing 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.590
 the last little monster and there we 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.880
 will wait for turn 4 so we're just going 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.030
 booster divine sword etc 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.149
 for to just wait anger 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.640
 and the pulse very easily so we go 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.829
 just started it so 50% with the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.679
 masquerade that is 35% I think of 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.390
 memory and after I'm just doing a 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.159
 attack on I believe after so they 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 then end up at 50 and coconut for 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.700
 do 2500 guys you go to loire and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.530
 it really goes 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.869
 all alone there is no difficulty 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.850
 for this success and so after it's just 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.140
 of the demon will be fuck and so the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.030
 four waves of monsters from the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.099
 day of turn 5 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.720
 so there's nothing very complicated there 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.060
 soon the turn of the coconut I come from 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.430
 masquerade I give back the pea the chest 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.980
 is there 3220 points of life here is the coconut 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.349
 concentration to be sure alas the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.269
 coco beam me up and the wave is coming so 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.010
 the next wave and after that so that's 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.800
 what is it that these four waves 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.660
 of 6 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 so there is still 24 monster butted 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.590
 so that's why in fact that the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.580
 up to the boss's bones 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.660
 power technique etc 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.950
 I thought, well, that's enough 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.410
 profitable to make life hard in times 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.910
 because well I explain etc but after 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.500
 good it was really too chopped and then 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.240
 after the four waves of monsters 24 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.800
 monster at 1800 1900 pv we see ya not 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.690
 great thing commented on a doubt you 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.300
 well so I said to myself, well, here we go 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.830
 it's gone to put the video 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.830
 accelerated for the benefit of all 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.550
 so suddenly there I kill the waves so 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.960
 there is just to pay attention to 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.550
 Bernard Coste So it's the monster who 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.400
 stay here he puts himself a vulnerable one 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.379
 turn so 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.030
 but otherwise that's when he's over 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:15.120
 vulnerable we kill him without worry I had 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.430
 to note also that I had the beef of the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.290
 area that gave me 50 % vitality in 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.689
 more why you see my 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.340
 characters has a lot a lot a lot of 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.849
 vita that's normal it's the buzz of the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.590
 area that gives 50% more pv but 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.180
 the characters are unreachable 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.450
 for the duration of the fight so this 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.769
 which is really low must be wary 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.359
 here on a dungeon like that there is 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.819
 no worries admit that everyone 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.019
 is still life crowd 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.930
 so there are not too many worries 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.030
 on the other hand it may seem a lot of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.370
 worries about other dungeon one so that's it 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.810
 but for that one it's not at all 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.470
 dangerous 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.879
 so that's why I took advantage 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.609
 also to do it with this beef because 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.470
 that he would have nothing would have changed in 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.420
 nothing the outcome of this fight 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.550
 that's because monsters do not hit hard 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.590
 here it is 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.610
 So here is the wave and already killed at the same 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.610
 not a trick with the masquerade 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.930
 so that's so after that done that's it 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.060
 makes ten points of success and more 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.890
 has really good race halves 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.060
 I feel good for now these voices 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.910
 there but I still have a lot of 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.480
 way to go 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.880
 here I am trying to do several 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.550
 several small dungeon to manage at 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.310
 maximum of success 5 are there 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.020
 still hard enough and the yobo compo 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.270
 ball for now is very effective 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.730
 and really just use a lot 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.230
 do that I turned one to another 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.220
 video that will be released soon 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.780
 on another dungeon you're going to have 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.260
 I let you discover that I do not spoil 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.290
 not for now but the compo of the 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.260
 bat louis exactly will have been still 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:59.570
 a great help 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.570
 the last wave yes it's the fifth 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.389
 it's the fifth wave 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.990
 but after that, that's a dungeon 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.630
 actually ends here it's just not necessary 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.550
 typing the word that plays right after you 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.759
 then otherwise the success really passes 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.039
 quietly even for levels 150 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:27.370
 i think chad is finally the 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.199
 success rather is really accessible there 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.560
 need to type very strong just 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.150
 elsewhere for coconut and then and then 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.150
 that's it's really quiet 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.529
 so here I am going to kill the mob once 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:48.089
 that he will have been able to survive durability 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:49.469
 so 15 minutes and 25 seconds we can 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.299
 see me so I put time pose 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.839
 the video we can see so hexes 

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:57.739
 blitzkrieg and so blow success 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.739
 global of this monster to 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.440
 so suddenly see I finish at 3100 for 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.100
 a life so I have a little bit to eat 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.780
 but not too much yet so here it is 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.380
 8527 with all makes sense in percent 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.380
 the first two 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.520
 and it's the continuous adventures I hope in 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.960
 any case that this video you liked 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.260
 finds himself very quickly for new 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.710
 videos 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.710
 Hi
