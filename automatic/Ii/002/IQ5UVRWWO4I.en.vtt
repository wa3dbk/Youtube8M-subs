00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
today I was sitting around thinking

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.340 
today I was sitting around thinking
about<00:00:08.430> how<00:00:08.639> most<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> people<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.809> know<00:00:09.870> are

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
about how most of the people I know are

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.170 
about how most of the people I know are
a<00:00:10.380> lot<00:00:10.590> more<00:00:10.799> settled<00:00:11.100> into<00:00:11.370> their<00:00:11.639> jobs<00:00:11.940> and

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
a lot more settled into their jobs and

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.180 
a lot more settled into their jobs and
careers<00:00:12.570> than<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.990> am<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.710> started

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
careers than I am and so I started

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.890 
careers than I am and so I started
wondering<00:00:14.400> about<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.030> various<00:00:15.420> kinds<00:00:15.660> of

wondering about the various kinds of
jobs<00:00:16.200> that<00:00:16.380> maybe<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.800> could<00:00:16.950> get<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.840> suppose<00:00:18.840> I
