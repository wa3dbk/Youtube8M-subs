00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
like normal mainstream it wasn't coming

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.089 
like normal mainstream it wasn't coming
fully<00:03:08.030> together<00:03:08.450> all<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.049> time<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.799> ends

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
fully together all the time and it ends

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.520 
fully together all the time and it ends
up<00:03:10.159> being<00:03:10.400> sort<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.000> idea<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.109> doesn't

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
up being sort of this idea that doesn't

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.159 
up being sort of this idea that doesn't
ever<00:03:12.799> fully<00:03:13.400> form<00:03:14.000> into<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.480> cohesive<00:03:14.959> story

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.169 
ever fully form into a cohesive story

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.800 
ever fully form into a cohesive story
but<00:03:16.010> there<00:03:16.220> are<00:03:16.340> elements<00:03:16.669> there<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:17.269> kind

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
but there are elements there that kind

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.520 
but there are elements there that kind
of<00:03:18.069> make<00:03:19.069> sense<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.910> keeps<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.440> trying<00:03:21.440> to

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
of make sense it keeps you trying to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.530 
of make sense it keeps you trying to
figure<00:03:21.769> out<00:03:21.829> what<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.459> connections<00:03:22.970> are<00:03:23.180> and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
figure out what the connections are and

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.960 
figure out what the connections are and
how<00:03:24.079> it<00:03:24.500> all<00:03:24.650> comes<00:03:24.950> together<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.639> really

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970
