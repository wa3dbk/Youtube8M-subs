00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.890 
off this is obviously not advisable
rather<00:03:23.549> what<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.970> should<00:03:24.180> remember<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.690> that

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
rather what you should remember is that

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.330 
rather what you should remember is that
the<00:03:25.049> throttle<00:03:25.380> should<00:03:25.560> be<00:03:25.650> gently<00:03:25.980> squeezed

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
the throttle should be gently squeezed

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.789 
the throttle should be gently squeezed
not<00:03:26.940> pulled<00:03:27.299> as<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:28.109> will<00:03:28.260> give<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.500> greater

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
not pulled as this will give you greater

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.199 
not pulled as this will give you greater

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
control of the PWC

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.309

and<00:03:30.390> reduce<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.230> risk<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.500> injury

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
and reduce the risk of injury

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.770 
and reduce the risk of injury
it's<00:03:32.950> also<00:03:33.159> equally<00:03:33.700> important<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.540> remember

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
it's also equally important to remember

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.099 
it's also equally important to remember

to throttle off smoothly also the second

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.750 
to throttle off smoothly also the second
thing<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.379> remember<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.890> as<00:03:39.159> strange<00:03:39.519> as<00:03:39.670> it

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760

stop<00:04:42.479> second<00:04:43.479> thing<00:04:43.630> is<00:04:43.720> move<00:04:43.960> your<00:04:44.080> feet<00:04:44.440> as
