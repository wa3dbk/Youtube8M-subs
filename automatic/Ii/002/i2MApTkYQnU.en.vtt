00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.760
HELLO welcome this video tutorial
I'm Claudia

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.710
Today I'm going to show you how to make a
collage of images

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.389
this is our final work

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.529
I'm going to try to explain as much
simple

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.149
let us begin

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.959
here I already have the three capable

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.429
or three open images, in this case
our main and the bottom line is this

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.699
I took over

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.669
on the image of the model with a click
left

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.839
only jalo

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.560
and it matters

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.879
in this case I have the reverse and as
I want to use it then it's edition

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.590
transform

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.130
flip horizontal

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.820
control + t, jalo

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.850
there is more or less left

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.960
the proportion

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.980
I give him an enter

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.370
with magic wand tool I
Positioned on the image

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.550
and this is what is left over then
of I suppress

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.470
and I have left

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.450
selection

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.060
of selected

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.120
and there it is

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.930
now I'm going to those who the image of the
boyfriends

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.030
maximixe here for a matter of time

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.760
pen tool

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.740
I marked everything that is the 
outline because this is what I do not want

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.590
then I will eliminate

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.409
once I have everything marked

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.720
with pen tool

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.930
left click

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.400
make selection

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.890
I give him ok

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.120
and there it is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.520
selection invest

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.370
suppress

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.140
select selection

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.570
and there I left the image clean

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.210
only

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.400
remove with the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.240
barite tool what in this
overrun

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.860
I really care a lot because
right now with the gradient

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.560
they will not be noticed

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.690
select selection

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.910
maximize

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.439
left cliq I possession on the
image

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.979
He pulled towards my country

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.139
same control + t

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.809
I'm going to put a little bit bigger

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.759
to give

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.639
a little bit more

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.229
they are there

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:30.149
now if we go to what is the 
degraded to be able

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.349
merge if the image

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.069
he took over the layer

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.369
in this case the model

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.009
and down here

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.139
the second button

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.539
from left to right

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.449
I give a click and a
white box in this

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:47.129
in this area

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.969
with the tool to degrade and fixing that in this part always be

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.349
the black

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.709
as as frontal color

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.559
if we look if we use what is
gradient from black to white

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.380
we take over the envelope 
image

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.099
and well I in this case I want

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.679
so be it

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.599
they are there

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.329
they are fixed and it became transparent all the
image

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.459
the same thing we do we position ourselves in the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.959
in the layer of the couple

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.039
click of equal layer mask does not come out
white box here

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:29.779
it's not that we fix that this one

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.469
black on white

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.019
degraded

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.959
black gradient towards white

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.939
and he took my place

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.319
where I want it to be

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.819
that the image is diluted a bit

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:45.879
in a little bit more

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.869
so here

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.909
we have to look for more or less

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.989
what is the perspective we want to give you

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.989
in this case I think that there

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:13.469
I think that's fine

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.509
there gives me more light, then no

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.340
it's a question of going looking for

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.539
it does not disappear

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.080
so I think there is the right thing

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.289
so now I can maximize

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.110
and there it is

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.330
if you want to put some kind of
text

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.460
in his good image then

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.469
in this case we use

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.340
box

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.080
tool of

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.419
square

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.379
I'm going to look for a more or less
similar to him

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:01.539
our background

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:02.960
edition

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960
Fill

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.980
frontal color

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.279
and there it is

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.159
select selection

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.990
and I'm going to put another one in the bottom
the point is that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.029
want to put some publicity
phone address and all that

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:25.029
box tool

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.229
equally edition

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.599
Fill

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.120
front color and enter

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.680
select to select her I have them

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.150
I already have them here

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.080
now there are good ones and who of any
shape

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.219
in this case it would be edition

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.229
transform

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.639
and here

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.870
can you make believe

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.639
the figure they like the most

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.400
I'm going to lower it more

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.930
I give it to you and I'm ready

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.949
my case that

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.259
want to give a texture

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.490
in this case I go

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.939
to join control + e

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:09.249
and the two layers are already joined

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.150
the two layers

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.400
here it is

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.509
filter

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:23.119
interpret no forgiveness forgiveness forgive
forgiveness texture

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:25.699
and let's texturize

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.080
Here I choose ls texture that more
I like it, you can observe several

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.699
but good is what it is

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.830
what I want is this

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.119
and here

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.169
let's go up a little bit

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.259
the climbing

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.439
with an 88 is ok I give ok

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:49.889
and so we have left

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:50.749
percent

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:52.259
once this is over

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.999
to merge them and layers and save them
file save as

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:01.099
in this case I have it as
landscapes

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:06.099
and I want to save it as psd for
what if I want to make some change

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:07.699
they can do it

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.800
if I want it and save as an image
after that procedure in this

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.029
flechita

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:14.719
couple able

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:16.389
and everything is done

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:19.379
in a single layer joins me

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:21.339
I give him save as

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:23.129
and in this part

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:30.129
jpg

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:38.379
says there is a moment I'm not going to
replace

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.050
I went down a little and nothing

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.119
the quality

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:43.939
and that's it, I hope you liked it.
