00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.880
 pack to see a little what there 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.210

 inside of acer liquid and one is the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.630
 new mid-range smartphone at home 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.570
 acer 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.770
 so let's say a bit of a new beginning 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.180
 in the smartphone family there is 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.180
 was a bit of a settling moment 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.020
 acer back to great in this is one 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.760
 dual core 1 gigahertz processors a 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.910
 gigabytes of ram 4 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.750
 internal 4-inch screen and 5 with 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.789
 resolution 540 x 960 then qhd 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.350
 5 megapixel main camera 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.140
 front camera 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.050
 android is already updated to jelly beans 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.609
 4.1 this is the smartphone we move it 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.430
 let's see what's in the 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.290
 pack there is this feeder that is 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.350
 the fact is quite small and curious 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.760
 that the door is on the side this is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.090
 the battery we breed because we will need it 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:20.119
 to turn on the phone micro usb cable 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:24.700
 usb standard stereo earphones and here 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.930
 under the bottom of the manuals then 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.490
 let's get a little loose 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.750
 everything in here we move the box 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.020
 we bring before our eyes 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.280
 this liquid is 1 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.280
 take advantage we show 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.149
 the insertion of the battery so it touches 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.539
 really very well assembled double 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.610
 sim 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.259
 the new acer smartphones are double sim 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.700
 and slot for micro sd 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.170
 we had forgotten this little one 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.359
 but fundamental factor and the speaker 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.210
 as you see to keep the 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:08.539
 symmetry but to guarantee an effect 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.710
 dolby and dts 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.790
 there are two speakers so perfectly 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.220
 we say symmetrical if we can say so 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.710
 a part other a lower part the cover 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.310
 which hooks up very very well of 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.050
 slightly rough rubber barbell of the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.090
 volume on the right side of the camera with 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.180
 led flash 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.670
 the two speakers saw audio jack a 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.400
 tremezzo red power button door 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.170
 micro usb on the side and below that again 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.780
 the downstairs didn't close properly 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.660
 clean sorry these two these two 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.400
 very beautiful red inserts for 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.780
 guarantee the symmetry below is there 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.370
 speaker down here but not really 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.780
 there should be nothing 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.239
 we turn on the phone not 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.160
