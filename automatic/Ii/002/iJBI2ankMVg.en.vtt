00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

the proper review for you guys so I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.779 
the proper review for you guys so I
thought<00:00:48.780> I'd<00:00:48.960> test<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> week<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.309> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
thought I'd test it out for a week and I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.799 
thought I'd test it out for a week and I
find<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> isn't<00:00:51.660> waterproof<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
find that it isn't waterproof and it

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.910 
find that it isn't waterproof and it
doesn't<00:00:54.809> matter<00:00:54.989> how<00:00:55.140> long<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
doesn't matter how long you have it on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.330 
doesn't matter how long you have it on
for<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.180> did<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.800> put<00:00:59.070> swype

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
for if you did like if I just put swype

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910 
for if you did like if I just put swype
on<00:00:59.609> it's<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.510> waterproof<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.350> boss<00:01:01.559> swype

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
on it's not waterproof if I boss swype

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
on it's not waterproof if I boss swype
on<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> leave<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.550> 10<00:01:03.030> minutes<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.600> not

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
on and leave it for 10 minutes it's not

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.020 
on and leave it for 10 minutes it's not
waterproof<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.860> put<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.820> leave<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
waterproof if I put it on and leave it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.020 
waterproof if I put it on and leave it
for<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.390> whole<00:01:06.570> day<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.110> not<00:01:07.619> waterproof<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
for the whole day it's not waterproof so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
for the whole day it's not waterproof so
and<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.229> might<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.619> me<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.070> just

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and that just might be me that just

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
and that just might be me that just
might<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.180> wearing<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:12.840> whatever

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
might be how I'm wearing it or whatever

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.670 
might be how I'm wearing it or whatever
but<00:01:13.590> i<00:01:13.860> find<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.420> waterproof<00:01:15.869> me

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
but i find this it is not waterproof me

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.899 
but i find this it is not waterproof me
and<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:19.439> longer<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.130> leave<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.610> dry<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and the longer you leave it to dry the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.539 
and the longer you leave it to dry the
more<00:01:21.689> smudge<00:01:22.259> proof<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.710> becomes<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
more smudge proof it becomes so if you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.910 
more smudge proof it becomes so if you
put<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.939> any<00:01:24.270> smudge<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> easy<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
put it on any smudge it is easy to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.980 
put it on any smudge it is easy to
smudge<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.460> come<00:01:26.700> smudge<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
smudge you come smudge it but if you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.960 
smudge you come smudge it but if you
leave<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:29.700> wait

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
leave it if you put it on and then wait

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.719 
leave it if you put it on and then wait
I<00:01:30.210> don't<00:01:30.509> know<00:01:30.600> 10<00:01:30.960> 15<00:01:31.110> minutes<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> try

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I don't know 10 15 minutes and you try

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.330 
I don't know 10 15 minutes and you try
and<00:01:32.759> smudge<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.869> find<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> very

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and smudge it it I find that it is very

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.020 
and smudge it it I find that it is very
very<00:01:35.460> hard<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.119> smudge<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.430> where<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> says

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
very hard to smudge it so where it says

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.330 
very hard to smudge it so where it says
much<00:01:39.360> proof<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> website<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.189> much

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
much proof on the website is so much

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.100 
much proof on the website is so much
proof<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.270> leave<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.720> long<00:01:43.079> enough

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
proof if you leave it on for long enough

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.760 
proof if you leave it on for long enough
and<00:01:44.240> as<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.509> butch<00:01:45.720> proof<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.229> find<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.649> if

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and as for butch proof I find that if

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
and as for butch proof I find that if
you<00:01:46.860> put<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> waterline<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.450> not

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you put it on the waterline it will not

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200

have had this on for the whole day and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:08.609 
have had this on for the whole day and

it is now it's now 20 passed four

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.990 
it is now it's now 20 passed four
I've<00:02:08.649> had<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:08.979> on<00:02:09.190> since<00:02:09.519> about<00:02:09.640> nine

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
I've had this on since about nine

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.430 
I've had this on since about nine
o'clock<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.840> um<00:02:12.030> if<00:02:13.030> you're<00:02:13.510> an<00:02:14.110> Afghan

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
o'clock so um if you're an Afghan

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.140 
o'clock so um if you're an Afghan
running<00:02:14.709> evidence<00:02:15.129> so<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.489> you're<00:02:15.700> going<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
running evidence so if you're going to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.149 
running evidence so if you're going to
score<00:02:16.510> or<00:02:16.629> anything<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.319> think<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
score or anything I think this is a

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.089 
score or anything I think this is a
really<00:02:18.340> good<00:02:18.610> eyeliner<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.739> because<00:02:20.739> it

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
really good eyeliner and because it

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.890 
really good eyeliner and because it
lasts<00:02:21.430> all<00:02:21.610> day<00:02:21.640> or<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.180> you're<00:02:22.330> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.750> work

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
lasts all day or if you're going to work

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.649 
lasts all day or if you're going to work
is<00:02:23.260> good<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.280> lasts<00:02:24.640> all<00:02:24.730> day<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.239> lasts<00:02:25.540> all

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
is good it lasts all day it lasts all

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.199 
is good it lasts all day it lasts all
night<00:02:25.690> as<00:02:26.079> well<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.650> without<00:02:27.459> sweating<00:02:27.940> off

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
night as well and without sweating off

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.789 
night as well and without sweating off
your<00:02:28.360> face<00:02:28.629> which<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.049> really<00:02:29.290> really<00:02:29.440> good

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
your face which is really really good

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.280 
your face which is really really good
and<00:02:30.159> but<00:02:30.819> maybe<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:31.750> because<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.110> use<00:02:32.260> a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
and but maybe that's because I use a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.170 
and but maybe that's because I use a
primer<00:02:32.650> before<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.159> put<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.459> on<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:33.819> don't<00:02:34.060> know

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
primer before I put it on I don't know

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.660 
primer before I put it on I don't know
how<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:34.750> would<00:02:34.900> work<00:02:34.930> without<00:02:35.349> a<00:02:35.500> primer<00:02:35.860> but

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
how it would work without a primer but

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.430 
how it would work without a primer but
I'm<00:02:36.909> typically<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:37.599> I'm<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.989> where<00:02:38.140> I'm

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
I'm typically if I'm going to where I'm

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.920 
I'm typically if I'm going to where I'm
going<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.709> wear<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.159> primer<00:02:39.519> under<00:02:40.239> my<00:02:40.360> eyes<00:02:40.540> so

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
going to wear a primer under my eyes so

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.000 
going to wear a primer under my eyes so
um<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:43.060> very<00:02:43.299> creamy<00:02:43.720> I'll<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.560> watch<00:02:44.829> for

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
um it's very creamy I'll just watch for

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.860 
um it's very creamy I'll just watch for
you<00:02:45.129> guys<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.910> see<00:02:46.299> kind<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.810> how

you guys so that you can see kind of how

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.589 
you guys so that you can see kind of how
it<00:02:47.079> looks<00:02:47.109> like<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.739> color<00:02:47.950> payoff<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.599> I

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
it looks like in the color payoff and I

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.119 
it looks like in the color payoff and I
used<00:02:50.489> great<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:52.140> use<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> small<00:02:53.560> brush<00:02:53.590> like<00:02:54.099> this

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
used great I use a small brush like this

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.610 
used great I use a small brush like this
one<00:02:54.549> right<00:02:54.670> here<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.810> fight<00:02:56.049> on<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.379> my<00:02:56.500> eyes

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
one right here to fight on to my eyes

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.800 
one right here to fight on to my eyes
because<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:56.950> find<00:02:57.129> it<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.310> lot<00:02:57.459> easier<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.480> I'll

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
because I find it a lot easier so I'll

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.470 
because I find it a lot easier so I'll
do<00:02:59.079> online<00:02:59.349> and<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.190> can<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:01.239> very

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
do online and you can see that it's very

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.539 
do online and you can see that it's very
very<00:03:01.720> pigmented<00:03:02.109> which<00:03:02.859> is<00:03:03.040> something<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.400> I

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
very pigmented which is something that I

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.940 
very pigmented which is something that I
really<00:03:03.790> really<00:03:03.909> like<00:03:04.269> about<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.079> you

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
really really like about this and you

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.599 
really really like about this and you
don't<00:03:06.400> need<00:03:06.609> that<00:03:06.790> much<00:03:07.120> at<00:03:07.329> all<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:08.609> that

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
don't need that much at all and that

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.629 
don't need that much at all and that
color<00:03:10.060> payoff<00:03:10.299> stays<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:11.049> all<00:03:11.319> day<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:12.099> doesn't

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
color payoff stays on all day it doesn't

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.690 
color payoff stays on all day it doesn't
come<00:03:13.239> off<00:03:13.269> your<00:03:13.660> eyes<00:03:13.959> unless<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.859> obviously

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
come off your eyes unless you obviously

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.479 
come off your eyes unless you obviously
rub<00:03:15.940> your<00:03:16.120> eyes<00:03:16.209> but<00:03:16.690> if<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.959> leave<00:03:17.139> your<00:03:17.200> eyes

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
rub your eyes but if you leave your eyes

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.330 
rub your eyes but if you leave your eyes
alone<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:19.120> does<00:03:19.359> not<00:03:19.510> come<00:03:19.720> off<00:03:19.810> at<00:03:20.049> all<00:03:20.109> and<00:03:20.650> it

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
alone it does not come off at all and it

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.949 
alone it does not come off at all and it
does<00:03:21.519> come<00:03:21.760> with<00:03:21.940> an<00:03:22.090> angled<00:03:22.480> brush<00:03:22.480> like<00:03:22.930> this

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
does come with an angled brush like this

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.690 
does come with an angled brush like this
or<00:03:23.470> mine<00:03:23.799> came<00:03:24.099> with<00:03:24.129> it<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.400> don't<00:03:24.609> know

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
or mine came with it I don't know

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.759 
or mine came with it I don't know
whether<00:03:24.879> it<00:03:25.060> comes<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.629> still<00:03:25.959> but<00:03:26.590> mine

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
whether it comes to it still but mine

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.860 
whether it comes to it still but mine
came<00:03:27.040> with<00:03:27.069> an<00:03:27.310> angled<00:03:27.760> brush<00:03:27.760> like<00:03:28.239> this<00:03:28.269> and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
came with an angled brush like this and

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.020 
came with an angled brush like this and
I<00:03:29.290> find<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:29.829> is<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.069> lot<00:03:30.250> easier<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.700> use

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
I find that this is a lot easier to use

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.420 
I find that this is a lot easier to use
for<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.419> waterline<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.200> don't<00:03:32.769> like<00:03:32.829> using<00:03:33.160> it

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
for the waterline I don't like using it

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.949 
for the waterline I don't like using it
to<00:03:33.549> tie<00:03:33.639> in<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.819> top<00:03:34.030> lash<00:03:34.329> line<00:03:34.359> because<00:03:34.870> i

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
to tie in the top lash line because i

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.860 
to tie in the top lash line because i
find<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.440> m<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:37.030> one<00:03:37.269> works<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.690> lot

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
find that the m this one works a lot

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.860 
find that the m this one works a lot
