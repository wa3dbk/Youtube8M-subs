00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.540
 I can't see anything , don't leave Reimu 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.590
 I have a room in such a place Marisa 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:38.200
 Where's the switch for electricity in this room? 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.530
 How do I gonna look in the eyes of my heart I look for the keys that you that is also good acceleration and dark even though in such a 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.079
 The 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.179
 It's so dark and you can't see anything 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.179
 Even the sense of direction does not remain 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:56.820
 Chest are arranged also three at Akon'na 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.820
 You'll smell the treasure is now there ze want the car keys from your treasure 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:05.210
 Scattered in the chest Do It looks like there was nothing 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.520
 I'm sorry I'm a line that says an idiot It 's a line I say today 空 き 空 き ベ タ ベ タ ベ タ 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.520
 I 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:17.150
 Oh note block mean that ze was nervous Seriously the concert of I I the other day there is a Depoko 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:22.490
 If you haven't seen the Nyan concert yet, you're going to be clear? 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.070
 It's like I'm going to do it until it doesn't taste, so it 's the usual Poconyan from the viewer 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.020
 You're told it's not like editing 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.579
 Suddenly , I threw in the story I wanted to see 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:37.070
 For example , those who go to see Mickey Mouse do not go to see people inside 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.070
 Mama certainly the same thing with it 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:48.560
 No, it's completely different. It's dangerous for a while, but I've been attacking the rat for a moment , but it's not at all comparable. 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:50.150
 Enjoying That is the most important thing for us is to see a lot of viewers who are moving even one person 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.320
 It's about making me 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:02:00.050
 Is not it say a suddenly serious thing in the habit had been defeated blur until a little while ago 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.520
 By the way it is but underlying motive I would cheat by changing the story that is not continued in the corridor forever here there 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.000
 Really 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.180
 Probably an infinite loop 1 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.810
 Let's go back once, it's Aura Amari's strong 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:16.680
 Here afraid Nante ze turn back as usual easy-to-understand too I I So once there is no 4 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.870
 I would like to go back to where the lights are 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.659
 I'm back at the first entrance, but I'm relieved that the light areas are calming down 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.360
 I have a lot of rooms I have not checked yet 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:32.760
 Yeah 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.390
 Well here I was from the other side but I can't put it on sale Let's check another room 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.230
 Let's go 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.230
 Yeah it looks like 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:45.180
 It 's there is a door here as well I wonder what is here in the room 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:50.400
 Oh here was open a lot of this is seems Library 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.780
 No matter what curl on top of the desk is this blue object would be what something 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.200
 It is written as a beacon 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:01.780
 Oh contents I'll here there is also a chest's What 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.890
 I do not know the contents of the chest is a solid fuel, but I will not get it for the time being. 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.900
 Mari of telling Do'll do not tell gotten to not know whether you have things 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.770
 Even if it is necessary, I will not bring things of the person's house 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.920
 This ward refuted in Reimu by positive theory 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.410
 Section 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.750
 It seems that this beacon is locked, but now it may not be related yet 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:28.870
 It is unlikely noticeable thing is the eyes 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:33.310
 It 's a shameful thing as if an empty nest is attached to the board completely and the mouth is over and it is reduced 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.940
 I'm not giving up at all 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.430
 I am tired when I do a Reimu counterpart 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.430
 So I can not give up film thickness 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.470
 Reimu Here's a strange outcry, no matter where 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.709
 It's really here something 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.840
 Read Nechotto like a note of something Mitekure 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.840
 Yeah I understand, wait a minute 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:05.800
 In order to break the infinite darkness, we have to find those who are generating darkness 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.010
 They are often disguised as flying spears on walls and floors 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:14.140
 The truth appears If you put a person or corresponding to Honyarara 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.600
 Infinite darkness is like pointing to the corridor of the endless loop that you just passed through 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.850
 It's like that, but it 's kind of cool about them 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:27.980
 I don't know, but if you don't find those, you can find the corridors of the dark just before 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.910
 I can not go forward I remember this note is information that will be a clue later 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.340
 I have no idea 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:37.590
 Well I remember with Marisa Chan I wonder if there is nothing else hinting 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.400
 Let's explore this room a little more 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.400
 Let's do it 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.400
 Nothing I is unlikely in particular in addition to a bookcase and desk and chair to say the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:00.169
 Not that great there'll OH DEAR Marisa something here 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:05.229
 It's definitely because I want to say goodbye to places like this, because the line is over 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:08.160
 If you want to go home early, you can get caught up in the track and become a part of this eye that looks like this 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.569
 First of all I will read a note 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.199
 Ask 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:17.580
 I need some items to light the fireplace 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:22.559
 The first is the day to make wood and other burning things the second the heat source 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:27.749
 The third is fuel such as oil Well this is also unknown now 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:28.229
 By the way, I found notes one after another from Marisa earlier, but in fact it was gugging 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:29.560
 Absent 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.590
 Woman doctor not Gugutsu 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.550
 Eight people who come across the strong expression of a little world view 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:41.919
 I can't find the key of my car 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.060
 Setting viewer who said that looking for Reimu nice follow car key was completely forgotten 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.190
 It will be because 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.580
 But the key was not found from some notes Yeah it 's hint was obtained 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.289
 What kind of people are 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.550
 I can not choose 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:59.599
 But because I'm a much say what of the wonder I beacon this blue beacon 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:04.520
 It may be something to receive some radio waves 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:09.949
 This room is it the place it 's not likely to use just yet 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.770
 I guess I've checked about it once , so let's explore twice 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.060
 That's right 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.060
 It must not have any Marisa 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.979
 I wait a little I'll Teku at Marisa 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.030
 Oh it 's there is something like a statue of a knight 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.030
 It looks like it will move 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.979
 Order So the 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:38.000
 You can turn around even if you thought the heart stopped 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:41.639
 You don't have a heart because it is steamed 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.479
 What is this feeling of defeat again 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:51.590
 Marisa destination Ide What is Bibi because it is likely to have been hit by out movement at any moment what playing is at No by Yea something 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:57.880
 I'm sorry I'm sorry I hurry up 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.880
 There it will be what I'll have become birch wood only this wall
