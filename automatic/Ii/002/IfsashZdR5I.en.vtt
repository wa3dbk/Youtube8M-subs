00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.590
 ecological and low - emission car 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.840
 All manufacturers try to achieve 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.820
 that goal 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.849
 audi took a step in that direction and 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.710
 presented the a3 e tron ​​is the first 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.519
 Brand model with technology 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.519
 plug-in hybrid 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.040
 because to use a hybrid car well 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.100
 there are a couple of reasons the first 80% 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.470
 of motorists are less than 50 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.930
 kilometers per day this car has a 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.570
 50 km range with a load 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.840
 battery is not to say that more 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.420
 you need the second 50 costs 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.989
 kilometers with a gas car 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.580
 they cost about 450 euros with this car and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.690
 at the current price of the current 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:04.399
 electric only one euro and 75 focus on 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.399
 game in zones of six end 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 there is also a button here with which 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.190
 I can choose between different modes by 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.290
 very silent electric solo example 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.130
 I can also keep the burden of the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.630
 battery or I can increase that is 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.070
 important when you plan to walk in the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.730
 city emit little co2 and do little 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.490
 in engadget corruption gives you this audi 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.010
 a3 e tron ​​is a plug-in hybrid is 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.720
 say I can recharge the battery in 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.080
 all electrical outlet 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.690
 I open here and put the plug the recharge 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.440
 It takes about three hours with current 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.890
 220 volts with menchov and industrial 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.390
 only two hours and 15 minutes giving 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.940
 current tones in this menu 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.860
 to move from the electrical attraction to 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.729
 the combustion without solution 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 continuity 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.729
 the engineers had to develop 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.729
 new ideas 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.770
 we solve it by integrating the motor 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.750
 electric between the combustion and 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.700
 transmission in grisham as it looks 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.890
 everything is very compact or compact 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.020
 this is the electric motor that is 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.020
 located between the flywheel of 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.360
 double mass and a new clutch that 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.739
 separates the combustion engine from 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.590
 electric then comes a box of 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.890
 normal changes s six-speed tronic 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.800
 with two clutches to control 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.880
 the two partial transmissions I understand 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.340
 my flex by side tribute in sucker in 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.780
 electric mode the a3 e tron ​​accelerates in 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.790
 49 seconds from 0 100 maximum speed 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.370
 130 kilometers per hour in combination 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.690
 with the combustion engine 222 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.510
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.030
 average consumption approved 15 liters 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.459
 every 100 kilometers taking advantage of 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.730
 maximum electric motor and walking very 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.290
 disciplined 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.410
 for fans of the technique the system 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.470
 generates a combined power of 350 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.020
 newtons metro to walk relaxed in 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.960
 expansion 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.660
 the hybrid a3 differs 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.580
 externally of the normal a3 only by 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.580
 wolves in the front and the saga 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.430
 inside the logos and tron ​​diverse 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.930
 chrome and matt surfaces give the a3 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.930
 hybrid a futuristic touch 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.370
 i 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.150
 and there is something special an application 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.210
 allows in combination with a smartphone 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.250
 consult vehicle data is also 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.010
 can turn on the air conditioner or the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.049
 heating from the office or see the 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.060
 Level of battery charge 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.790
 here we still have a range of 13 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.200
 kilometers of haydn kilometer waters 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.480
 blue 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.770
 the trunk is spacious it was only 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.120
 sacrificed the spare wheel 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.460
 the gas tank is 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.080
 normally where the battery is now 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.540
 which we put a little behind 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.850
 this is a pressure tank in the 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.350
 gasoline tank vapors are generated 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.670
 when you walk a lot alone electrically 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.580
 sometimes starts the combustion engine 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.460
 to consume those vapors because if not 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.880
 they generate too much pressure their filter in 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.770
 Frankenstein does not consume gas is because 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.770
 therefore impossible to conclude 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.520
 my conclusion I am pleasantly 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.880
 surprised at how well this works 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.700
 pretty complicated technique for 37 thousand 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.310
 900 euros the technique is received more 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.270
 modern and I think it's money very well 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.970
 invested 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:28.040
 kurt angle ect the audi a3 e tron comes out 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.040
 market in germany this autumn
