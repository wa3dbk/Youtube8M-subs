00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
I'm playing and you can't really get

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.350 
I'm playing and you can't really get
that<00:00:48.180> close<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:49.620> you've<00:00:50.219> got<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.969> number

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that close if you've got some number

that close if you've got some number
keys<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.780> end<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.430> it's<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
keys on the end of it it's just one of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.360 
keys on the end of it it's just one of
those<00:00:53.820> things<00:00:54.110> this<00:00:55.110> seems<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.920> best

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
those things this seems to be the best

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.420 
those things this seems to be the best
keyboard<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:57.059> me<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.809> opinion<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
keyboard for me in my opinion so you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
keyboard for me in my opinion so you
know<00:00:59.550> keep<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.120> mind<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.710> keyboards

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
know keep this in mind that keyboards

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939 
know keep this in mind that keyboards
are<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.789> same<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.090> mice<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:04.080> many<00:01:04.320> ways<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> mean

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
are the same as mice in many ways I mean

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.429 
are the same as mice in many ways I mean
build<00:01:05.280> quality<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.080> tactile

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
build quality and just the tactile

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.899 
build quality and just the tactile
feedback<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> blue<00:01:08.310> switches<00:01:08.549> give<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
feedback that the blue switches give you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.260 
feedback that the blue switches give you
in<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.180> keyboard<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.490> they<00:01:11.490> seem<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
in this keyboard and they seem to be you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
in this keyboard and they seem to be you
know<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.420> best<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.840> me<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.530> lot<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.950> people<00:01:14.189> do

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
know the best for me a lot of people do

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
know the best for me a lot of people do
prefer<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.729> red<00:01:14.850> switches<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.630> FPS

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
prefer the red switches for like FPS

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.300 
prefer the red switches for like FPS
game<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.530> stuff<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.070> that's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
game and and stuff like that and that's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.960 
game and and stuff like that and that's
purely<00:01:17.610> down<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.090> having<00:01:18.960> less<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.740> time<00:01:20.640> for

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
purely down to having less of time for

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.429 
purely down to having less of time for
the<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.330> heater<00:01:21.540> bottom<00:01:21.840> out<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the the heater bottom out on the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.710 
the the heater bottom out on the
keyboard<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.549> think<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> only<00:01:24.210> need<00:01:24.450> like

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
keyboard I think you only need like

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.010 
keyboard I think you only need like
something<00:01:25.680> stupid<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.340> 10<00:01:26.670> grams<00:01:27.119> something

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
something stupid like 10 grams something

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
something stupid like 10 grams something
like<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.500> weight<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.340> articulate<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
like that of weight to articulate the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
like that of weight to articulate the
key<00:01:30.299> which<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.659> ridiculously<00:01:31.380> small<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
key which is ridiculously small I

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.300 
key which is ridiculously small I
believe<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.780> 30<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.229> blue<00:01:34.530> switches<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.250> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
believe it's 30 on blue switches but I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.050 
believe it's 30 on blue switches but I
could<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.610> wrong<00:01:35.960> as<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.020> am<00:01:37.200> NOT<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.530> an<00:01:38.189> expert

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
could be wrong as I am NOT a an expert

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
could be wrong as I am NOT a an expert
reviewer<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.950> my<00:01:41.130> thoughts

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
reviewer so these are just my thoughts

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.940 
reviewer so these are just my thoughts
and<00:01:41.640> opinions<00:01:42.200> these<00:01:43.200> are<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> moments<00:01:43.770> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and opinions these are the moments that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.620 
and opinions these are the moments that
you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.329> mode

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
you can go through by the way this mode

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020 
you can go through by the way this mode
is<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.560> basically<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.790> click

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
is just basically what it is you click

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
is just basically what it is you click
on<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.509> pulsates<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.320> both<00:01:49.860> directions

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
on it and it pulsates in both directions

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.819 
on it and it pulsates in both directions
from<00:01:50.700> where<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> press<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> key<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
from where if you press the key it's a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.350 
from where if you press the key it's a
pretty<00:01:52.979> cool<00:01:53.250> mode<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.640> believe<00:01:53.970> there's<00:01:54.180> about

addition<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.310> spacebar<00:02:26.730> actually

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
addition to it the the spacebar actually

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.860

has<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.300> red<00:02:27.690> blue<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.140> green<00:02:29.360> LEDs<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.720> it

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
has a red blue and green LEDs in it

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.420 
has a red blue and green LEDs in it
which<00:02:31.050> means<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.440> pulsates<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.250> can

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
which means that it pulsates it can

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.160 
which means that it pulsates it can
pulsate<00:02:32.820> from<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.510> know<00:02:33.600> different<00:02:33.810> colors
