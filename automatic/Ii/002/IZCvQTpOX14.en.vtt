 welcome back here with the fourth comic book not 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.010
 I was joking about the third episode of the series 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.340
 live with the viewfinder we are south today and shearing 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.900
 teams as always with a gap 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.110
 against the rennes of them that it seems 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.730
 be a good sniper and I'm just here 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.950
 in four of them here is also the fifth and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.690
 the sixth of here I can not straight 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.050
 to straight though knowing that though if 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.280
 there is no one who will not go to work in between 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.190
 anyway guys like you can see 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.690
 I believe but is back and I would finally say the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.989
 connection that I didn't have by now 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.640
 week so I can register a 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.600
 play I can get the channel back 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.600
 quiet as it was before 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:57.120
 wait a moment for a line 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 cerali the ICTY perfect then stopped and 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.559
 guys never liked it 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.149
 particularly as a map today 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 when for nuclear then today 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.119
 the goal is the other thing there 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.259
 connection is back but today it will be that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.799
 they are all at home and therefore probably 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.799
 they are 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.440
 they are exploiting it will be that it will be 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.320
 starting from 80 hp the thing to kill 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.740

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.680

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:38.830
 we are approaching the flight 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:43.130
 of the friend vital earth of sator ready 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:51.770

 is unknown orbital ally online act e 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.910
 let's go get this back here 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.210
 which does not seem to play missile el storm 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.020
 ally on arrival perfect disturbance in 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.360
 waiting for orders 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.530
 if i fenix the audio then i don't have in 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:11.360
 arrival you are a tourist playing a game in 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:15.080
 perfect series arrone of allied attack 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.010
 wait long enough in action 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.270
 well the enemy has destroyed yours 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.700
 men charge 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:42.120
 immediately for another view orbital touch 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:45.060
 ready bad online detachable 21 was there 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.130
 one who spoke for this let's go to 23 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.420
 of both for nuclear then the team 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.420
 47 the others are at 9 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.570
 so i'd say its if i play it 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.040
 well I can do it pavia 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.420
 ron and attack in action 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.500
 it is enough that comrades do not put themselves on now 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:09.830
 to steal all the sluices I took charge 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.830
 the weapon 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.270
 pig just enough you could very well 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.810
 see how I died with istat 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.790
 Active'm quiet because then I break 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.560
 I'm not a good believer 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.720
 so it will be that Ramadan- only bullshit 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.850
 it is possible to die at 26 in that bite 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.989
 blow made the visitor shy little 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.390
 from the new clio but ok it happens look at me 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.000
 I 'm not even more surprised by now 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.100
 part dead remember there are companions 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.300

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.420
 call that steals nakheel behind 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.120
 the other is a bit in the ass like what but 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.010
 let alone however think in my opinion 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.680
 see why the game is donating 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.640
 half of those that last in others 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.640
 this half I did 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.400
 in here it is not true there is not therefore 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:23.010
 on the 1 and allies we are at 67 or 30 a 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:25.280
 reasoning coming soon there is one 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.280
 one 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:42.720
 killing confirmed poor disturbance in 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:43.949
 I usually did 40 40 girls 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.210
 goes to all those who say that I 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.350
 game only for with the connection is 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.580
 good if you see a little and then change your mind 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.870
 it takes too many with the limits of a 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.039
 enemy anyway here is 35 day 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.630
 at half age guys with even the 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.460
 risk of artic wolves I hope the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.050
