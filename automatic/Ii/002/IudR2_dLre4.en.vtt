00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
about 20 or 30 minutes and we're in the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.970 
about 20 or 30 minutes and we're in the
basement<00:03:01.569> because<00:03:01.660> when<00:03:02.019> Charlie<00:03:02.410> catches<00:03:02.799> it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
basement because when Charlie catches it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.680 
basement because when Charlie catches it
he<00:03:03.250> hauls<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.730> down<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:04.030> stairs<00:03:04.299> so<00:03:04.599> we

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
he hauls it down the stairs so we

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.860 
he hauls it down the stairs so we
started<00:03:05.079> in<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.290> living<00:03:05.590> room<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:07.299> then<00:03:07.599> he

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
started in the living room and then he

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.100 
started in the living room and then he
hauled<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.230> down<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.560> stairs<00:03:08.829> just<00:03:13.019> get<00:03:14.019> him

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
hauled it down the stairs just get him

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:22.110 
hauled it down the stairs just get him
guess<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:17.260> thing<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.590> all<00:03:19.049> messed<00:03:20.049> up<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.819> Amy

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
guess the thing is all messed up so Amy

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.440 
guess the thing is all messed up so Amy
keeps<00:03:22.360> telling<00:03:22.690> him<00:03:23.160> no<00:03:24.160> because<00:03:24.670> she<00:03:25.269> doesn't

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
keeps telling him no because she doesn't

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:34.190 
keeps telling him no because she doesn't
want<00:03:25.720> him<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.870> haul<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.200> away<00:03:32.730> yeah

want him to haul it away yeah
that's<00:03:35.200> kind<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.440> like<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.769> frisbee<00:03:36.310> thing

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
that's kind of like the frisbee thing

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.990 
that's kind of like the frisbee thing
with<00:03:36.670> dogs<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:37.180> don't<00:03:37.359> know<00:03:37.450> what<00:03:37.630> if<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:42.000> but

then again if they if they were out in

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.349 
then again if they if they were out in
the<00:03:47.440> wild<00:03:47.620> they<00:03:47.950> might<00:03:48.160> probably<00:03:49.090> wouldn't<00:03:49.269> be

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
the wild they might probably wouldn't be

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.349 
the wild they might probably wouldn't be
this<00:03:49.980> long<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.280> an<00:03:51.400> interaction<00:03:51.849> that<00:03:52.150> bird
