00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.390
 Using Dr. Slick 's Line Clipper 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.519
 I would like to pass the nail 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.970
 Because the clipper has more tools than nails 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.760
 Open like this 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:24.520
 Make it exactly 180 degrees 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.520
 The leader's bat part is thicker 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.470
 In this groove 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.470
 I will put it in the cavity 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.290
 Suddenly so you come out forecast is on this side 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.860
 Pull it up 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:48.130
 It'll be over the top to be 90 degrees 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:52.080
 After this there is a place where just the leader gets caught 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.080
 Here is 1 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.750
 Does to 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:03.290
 High rotation It is okay at this time not to pack the density so much 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.300
 After 5 turns , I'll push it up with this surol 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.540
 Density increases 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.540
 It is more of a thin part destination of the leader after the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.300
 I will pass through 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.760
 At this point it 's like it was before hunting for nail notes, so it won't move 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.630
 after that 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.690
 Fly line 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.740
 Even though it does not it dark of today 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.740
 line The nurse is in competition 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.600
 I will give something to you 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.030
 Just after this girl's daughter 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.400
 To give out about much of the tip 1 cm can be 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.400
 Then I will push it up again with this tool 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.250
 Then I think so firmly like this 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.510
 Pull up the Rhine river fly line 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:20.450
 If you put it out to the tip of the leader 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:22.989
 It will not be able to say firmly and I have to in the first and take from here 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.989
 after that 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.090
 Yeah leader 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.090
 Please cut it up and use it
