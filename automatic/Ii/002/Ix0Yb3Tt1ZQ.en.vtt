00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
TP 54 now those tracks are shorter and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.340 
TP 54 now those tracks are shorter and
they<00:01:15.789> come<00:01:15.970> with<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.179> different<00:01:16.330> hardware<00:01:17.080> and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
they come with a different hardware and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.770 
they come with a different hardware and
that<00:01:17.429> hardware<00:01:18.429> is<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:18.610> hidden<00:01:19.030> type<00:01:19.330> hardware

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
that hardware is a hidden type hardware

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.859 
that hardware is a hidden type hardware
designed<00:01:20.170> for<00:01:20.619> mounting<00:01:21.430> into<00:01:22.000> sheet<00:01:22.509> metal

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
designed for mounting into sheet metal

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.980 
designed for mounting into sheet metal
actually<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.560> top<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.810> vehicle<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
actually to the top of a vehicle the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.870 
actually to the top of a vehicle the
roof<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.439> vehicle<00:01:26.950> when<00:01:27.100> you're<00:01:27.610> not<00:01:27.729> going

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
roof of a vehicle when you're not going

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.850 
roof of a vehicle when you're not going
to<00:01:27.939> have<00:01:28.090> underside<00:01:28.659> access<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:29.439> only<00:01:29.590> get

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
to have underside access so only get

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.170 
to have underside access so only get
those<00:01:30.070> if<00:01:30.340> you're<00:01:30.430> mounting<00:01:30.759> into<00:01:30.939> sheet

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
those if you're mounting into sheet

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.270 
those if you're mounting into sheet
metal<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:32.049> need<00:01:32.259> that<00:01:32.470> Hardware<00:01:32.950> system

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
metal and you need that Hardware system

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.819 
metal and you need that Hardware system
so<00:01:34.119> here<00:01:34.299> we<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.570> TV<00:01:34.750> 69<00:01:35.439> into<00:01:35.799> a

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
so here we have the TV 69 into a

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.910 
so here we have the TV 69 into a
fiberglass<00:01:36.310> cap<00:01:37.119> you<00:01:37.869> can<00:01:38.110> determine<00:01:38.350> exactly

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
fiberglass cap you can determine exactly

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.469 
fiberglass cap you can determine exactly
where<00:01:39.189> you<00:01:39.340> want<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.759> generally<00:01:40.150> you<00:01:40.210> want<00:01:40.390> a

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
where you want it generally you want a

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.090 
where you want it generally you want a
little<00:01:40.750> more<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.079> the<00:01:41.170> outside<00:01:41.560> where<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.920> cap

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
little more to the outside where the cap

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.429 
little more to the outside where the cap
starts<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.579> bend<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.909> little<00:01:43.060> bit<00:01:43.439> doing

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
starts to bend a little bit doing

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.130 
starts to bend a little bit doing
there's<00:01:44.740> more<00:01:45.090> fiberglass<00:01:46.090> laid<00:01:46.630> out<00:01:46.840> here

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
there's more fiberglass laid out here

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.010 
there's more fiberglass laid out here
and<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.710> cap<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:48.130> stronger<00:01:48.960> once<00:01:49.960> you

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
and the and the cap is stronger once you

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.600 
and the and the cap is stronger once you
have<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.200> track<00:01:50.439> down<00:01:50.470> then<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.040> mount<00:01:51.340> a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
have to track down then you can mount a

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.719 
have to track down then you can mount a
Thule<00:01:52.180> based<00:01:52.540> system<00:01:53.079> on<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.500> track<00:01:53.860> the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
Thule based system on this track the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.660 
Thule based system on this track the
proper<00:01:55.149> base<00:01:55.390> system<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:55.960> 430<00:01:56.439> tracker<00:01:56.860> and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
proper base system is a 430 tracker and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.050 
proper base system is a 430 tracker and
what<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.750> consists<00:01:59.290> of<00:01:59.670> it's<00:02:00.670> three

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
what that consists of it's three

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.080 
what that consists of it's three
components<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:01.810> have<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.079> 430<00:02:02.560> foot<00:02:03.090> you

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
components you have the 430 foot you

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.880 
components you have the 430 foot you
have<00:02:04.119> what's<00:02:04.479> called<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.810> key<00:02:05.020> K<00:02:05.290> or<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.590> tracker

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
have what's called a key K or a tracker

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.969 
have what's called a key K or a tracker
kit<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.729> then<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.390> have<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:08.440> correct<00:02:08.649> bar

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
kit and then you have the correct bar

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.979 
kit and then you have the correct bar
link<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.459> you're<00:02:09.610> going<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.790> need<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.720> first

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
link that you're going to need the first

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.199 
link that you're going to need the first
thing<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.380> need<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.560> do<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.910> actually

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
thing you need to do is to actually

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.110
