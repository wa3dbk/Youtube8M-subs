00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
away because the loop penalty that'll

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.540 
away because the loop penalty that'll
make<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.149> only<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.570> able<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.010> loot<00:00:50.010> level<00:00:50.370> 9

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.100 
and level tins without a penalty to your
loot<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.850> might<00:00:54.000> even<00:00:54.210> change<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.840> like

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
loot or they might even change that like

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.119 
loot or they might even change that like
what<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.500> change<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.890> would<00:00:56.070> be

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
what if they change that that would be

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
what if they change that that would be
so<00:00:56.309> awesome<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.449> could<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.780> able<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
so awesome but then we could be able to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
so awesome but then we could be able to
pick<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.680> lower<00:00:58.859> guys<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.699> wouldn't

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
pick on the lower guys and that wouldn't

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.650 
pick on the lower guys and that wouldn't
really<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.359> fair<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> they<00:01:03.090> probably<00:01:03.300> won't<00:01:03.480> do

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
really be fair so they probably won't do

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
really be fair so they probably won't do
that<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.199> might<00:01:04.350> add<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.189> how

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that but they might add you know how

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.609

getting like 3,000 resources of each

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.700 
getting like 3,000 resources of each
except<00:01:22.200> dark<00:01:22.380> elixir<00:01:22.939> at<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.659> tournament<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
except dark elixir at the tournament I

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
except dark elixir at the tournament I
that<00:01:25.860> I'm<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.820> MIT<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.299> might<00:01:27.540> raise<00:01:27.780> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that I'm in so MIT they might raise that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.719 
that I'm in so MIT they might raise that
they<00:01:28.350> might<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:29.130> that'd<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.610> cool

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
they might because that'd be really cool

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.050 
they might because that'd be really cool
I<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.659> that'd<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:31.369> really<00:01:32.369> great<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I think that that'd be really great and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.719 
I think that that'd be really great and
really<00:01:33.479> needed<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.189> could<00:01:35.400> pick

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
really needed because then we could pick

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.679 
really needed because then we could pick
on<00:01:35.880> lower<00:01:36.090> guys<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:38.420> loot<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.570> we

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
on lower guys and get the loot that we

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
on lower guys and get the loot that we
would<00:01:39.869> always<00:01:40.079> guarantee<00:01:41.119> anyway<00:01:42.119> leave<00:01:42.930> a
