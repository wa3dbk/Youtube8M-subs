00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
was one of the best cars in the segment

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.490 
was one of the best cars in the segment
now<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.940> car<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.139> lot<00:00:13.410> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
now in this car here we have a lot of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.460 
now in this car here we have a lot of
systems<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.639> know<00:00:14.910> from<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.690> s-class<00:00:16.080> so

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
systems that I know from the s-class so

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.769 
systems that I know from the s-class so
the<00:00:16.800> question<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.279> whether<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.910> new<00:00:18.119> c-class<00:00:18.480> is

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the question is whether a new c-class is

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.429 
the question is whether a new c-class is
a<00:00:18.869> smaller<00:00:19.650> s-class<00:00:20.340> or<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> bigger<00:00:21.570> a-class<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
a smaller s-class or a bigger a-class a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.700 
diesel earlier today I drove the 250
petrol<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.040> 250<00:00:44.789> petrol<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.350> awful<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> was

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
petrol the 250 petrol was awful it was

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.209 
petrol the 250 petrol was awful it was
underpowered<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.690> had<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> rev<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.920> all

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
underpowered you just had to rev it all

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.000 
underpowered you just had to rev it all
the<00:00:50.610> way<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> way<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.570> probably<00:00:52.440> four<00:00:52.980> or

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the way all the way to probably four or

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.639 
the way all the way to probably four or
five<00:00:53.129> thousand<00:00:53.670> rpm<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:55.260> wouldn't<00:00:55.559> do

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
five thousand rpm and it wouldn't do

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.639 
five thousand rpm and it wouldn't do
anything<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:58.219> boat<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.840> it<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:01.109> heavy

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
anything it was boat like it was heavy

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.189 
anything it was boat like it was heavy
it<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.609> didn't<00:01:03.030> feel<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.390> car<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.899> want

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
it just didn't feel like a car you want

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.530 
it just didn't feel like a car you want
to<00:01:04.260> drive<00:01:04.610> surprisingly<00:01:05.610> enough<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.150> diesel

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to drive surprisingly enough the diesel

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.679 
to drive surprisingly enough the diesel
is<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:08.369> better<00:01:08.790> choice<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.390> thought

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
is the much better choice I thought

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.350 
is the much better choice I thought
these<00:01:10.010> turbocharged<00:01:11.010> petrol<00:01:11.430> engines<00:01:11.820> would

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
these turbocharged petrol engines would

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.810 
these turbocharged petrol engines would
do<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> job<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.070> need<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> diesel<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
do the job now you need the diesel and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.550 
do the job now you need the diesel and
probably<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.900> 220<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.560> 250<00:01:17.130> diesel<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
probably at 220 or 250 diesel is the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
probably at 220 or 250 diesel is the
stuff<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.710> want<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.509> are

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
stuff you want to go for so here we are

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.200 
stuff you want to go for so here we are
in<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.930> car<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.920> bit<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.610> nose<00:01:23.909> heavy

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
in this car it's a bit more nose heavy

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.080 
in this car it's a bit more nose heavy
but<00:01:24.540> at<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> same<00:01:25.049> time<00:01:25.290> more<00:01:25.979> involving<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but at the same time more involving to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.679 
but at the same time more involving to
drive<00:01:27.770> which<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.520> nice<00:01:30.060> change<00:01:30.360> from<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
drive which is a nice change from the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.350 
drive which is a nice change from the
petrol<00:01:31.470> car<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:31.890> driving<00:01:31.920> before<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
petrol car I was driving before the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.170 
petrol car I was driving before the
petrol<00:01:34.049> version<00:01:34.439> had<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.159> slightly<00:01:35.579> higher

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
petrol version had a slightly higher

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.410 
petrol version had a slightly higher
profile<00:01:36.869> tires<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.829> may<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.549> been<00:01:38.700> tad

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
profile tires so it may have been tad

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.990 
profile tires so it may have been tad
more<00:01:39.720> comfortable<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.680> car<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.280> still

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
more comfortable than this car but still

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.810 
more comfortable than this car but still
the<00:01:42.180> suspension<00:01:42.689> soaks<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.430> bumps

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the suspension soaks up all the bumps

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.740 
the suspension soaks up all the bumps
nicely<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:46.189> it's<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.939> good<00:01:48.299> comfortable

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
nicely and it's a it's good comfortable

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
well and it was much more toned down it

were a revolution for Mercedes unlike

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.470 
were a revolution for Mercedes unlike
this<00:06:44.860> very<00:06:45.430> attractive<00:06:45.940> and<00:06:46.060> very<00:06:46.180> modern

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
this very attractive and very modern

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.470 
this very attractive and very modern
c-class<00:06:47.020> despite<00:06:47.800> its<00:06:48.010> looks<00:06:48.250> it's<00:06:48.940> more<00:06:49.270> of

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
c-class despite its looks it's more of

c-class despite its looks it's more of
an<00:06:49.720> evolution<00:06:50.230> than<00:06:51.010> a<00:06:51.040> revolution<00:06:51.820> it's<00:06:52.300> more

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
an evolution than a revolution it's more

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.110 
an evolution than a revolution it's more
like<00:06:52.810> a<00:06:52.840> smaller<00:06:53.650> s-class<00:06:54.310> something<00:06:54.940> that

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
like a smaller s-class something that

dynamically so would I choose it no I

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.160 
dynamically so would I choose it no I
would<00:07:03.640> definitely<00:07:04.240> not<00:07:04.360> I<00:07:04.420> would<00:07:04.720> go<00:07:04.870> for<00:07:05.050> the
