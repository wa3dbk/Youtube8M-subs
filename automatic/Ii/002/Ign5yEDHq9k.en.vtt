00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
the bread was too moist and so I taught

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.729 
the bread was too moist and so I taught
her<00:02:10.549> that<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.540> edge<00:02:11.720> there's<00:02:12.409> a<00:02:12.470> little

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
her that on the edge there's a little

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.440 
her that on the edge there's a little
bit<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.099> crust<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.970> maybe<00:02:14.150> she<00:02:14.420> could

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
bit of a crust and that maybe she could

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.140 
bit of a crust and that maybe she could
enjoy<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:15.200> she<00:02:16.069> also<00:02:16.190> thought<00:02:16.489> maybe<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
enjoy that she also thought maybe the
