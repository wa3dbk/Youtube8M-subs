00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
hi my name is Scottie Anderson and I

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.509 
hi my name is Scottie Anderson and I
just<00:00:06.870> made<00:00:07.080> three<00:00:07.379> pneumatic<00:00:08.040> tennis<00:00:08.340> ball

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
just made three pneumatic tennis ball

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.820 
just made three pneumatic tennis ball
launchers<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.330> made<00:00:09.540> these<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.410> get<00:00:10.590> out<00:00:10.740> of

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
launchers and I made these to get out of

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.709 
launchers and I made these to get out of
dipole<00:00:11.250> antenna<00:00:11.639> very<00:00:12.059> high<00:00:12.300> up<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.690> tree

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
dipole antenna very high up in a tree

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.259 
dipole antenna very high up in a tree
this<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> first<00:00:14.130> one<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.400> hear<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
this is the first one I hear we have the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.779 
this is the first one I hear we have the
pressure<00:00:15.960> chamber<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
pressure chamber and here we have the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.670 
pressure chamber and here we have the
barrel<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.480> put<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.960> handle<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.470> that

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
barrel and I put on the handle here that

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
barrel and I put on the handle here that
you<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.279> aim<00:00:20.430> shoot<00:00:20.789> I've<00:00:21.600> put<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
you can see the aim shoot I've put a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.230 
you can see the aim shoot I've put a
coupler<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> sprinkler

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
coupler on here and I have a sprinkler

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720 
coupler on here and I have a sprinkler
valve<00:00:24.269> which<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.080> slightly<00:00:25.380> modified<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
valve which is slightly modified with a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.390 
valve which is slightly modified with a
little<00:00:27.420> valve<00:00:28.140> right<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.920> shoots<00:00:29.160> it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
little valve right here that shoots it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.150 
little valve right here that shoots it
basically<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.570> fill<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.900> full<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.109> air<00:00:31.320> no

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
basically you fill it full of air no

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.319 
basically you fill it full of air no
more<00:00:32.399> than<00:00:32.640> 80<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.090> 100<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.750> usually<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.260> 80<00:00:34.500> psi

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
more than 80 to 100 I usually do 80 psi

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.790 
more than 80 to 100 I usually do 80 psi
both<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.719> pressure<00:00:36.960> chamber<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> tube

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
both the pressure chamber in the tube

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.310 
both the pressure chamber in the tube
saying<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.030> gas<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.870> I'm<00:00:40.110> not

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
saying on it not for gas so I'm not

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.459 
saying on it not for gas so I'm not
recommending<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.920> use<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.660> stay

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
recommending you use it but if you stay

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
recommending you use it but if you stay
within<00:00:43.680> 80<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> 100<00:00:44.430> psi<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.879> don't<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
within 80 to 100 psi I don't think it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.310 
within 80 to 100 psi I don't think it
will<00:00:45.690> explode

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
will explode

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.080 
will explode
the<00:00:46.680> operating<00:00:47.100> pressure<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.850> around

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the operating pressure here is around

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.799 
the operating pressure here is around
250<00:00:48.809> psi<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.430> basically<00:00:50.879> you'd<00:00:51.329> hold<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> up

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
250 psi so basically you'd hold it up

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.200 
250 psi so basically you'd hold it up
like<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.100> put<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.520> tennis<00:00:53.820> ball<00:00:54.030> in

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
like this and you put the tennis ball in

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.090 
like this and you put the tennis ball in
here<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.840> ramrod<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
here like this and ramrod it down and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.060 
here like this and ramrod it down and
then<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.210> fold<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
then you just fold this right here and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.520 
then you just fold this right here and
you<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.430> shoot<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.850> as<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.960> second

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you just shoot it as it's my second

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.689 
you just shoot it as it's my second

in<00:01:02.910> fact<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.480> look<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> internet<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
in fact if you look on the internet and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
in fact if you look on the internet and
Google<00:01:04.650> pneumatic<00:01:05.369> tennis<00:01:05.670> ball<00:01:05.850> launcher<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
Google pneumatic tennis ball launcher I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.240 
Google pneumatic tennis ball launcher I
got<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> idea<00:01:07.049> from<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.409> couple<00:01:07.619> guys<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
got the idea from a couple guys on the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
got the idea from a couple guys on the
internet<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.880> I'd<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> give<00:01:09.450> them<00:01:09.630> credit

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
internet so I'd like to give them credit

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.649 
internet so I'd like to give them credit
it's<00:01:10.590> definitely<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.189> my<00:01:11.430> idea<00:01:11.850> here's<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's definitely not my idea here's a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.120 
it's definitely not my idea here's a
little<00:01:12.960> bit<00:01:13.049> different<00:01:13.409> design<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.950> actually

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
little bit different design I actually

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.830 
little bit different design I actually
painted<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.850> cuz<00:01:14.970> they<00:01:15.090> made<00:01:15.240> some<00:01:15.479> mistakes

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
painted it cuz they made some mistakes

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
painted it cuz they made some mistakes
and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.350> together<00:01:16.520> here<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and I put it together here we have the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789 
and I put it together here we have the
pressure<00:01:18.150> chamber<00:01:18.450> underneath<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
pressure chamber underneath we have the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
pressure chamber underneath we have the
barrel<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.240> here's<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.780> release

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
barrel up here and here's the release

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
barrel up here and here's the release
that<00:01:22.560> actually<00:01:22.890> fires<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:24.030> again<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that actually fires it this again is a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
that actually fires it this again is a
different<00:01:24.810> type<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> sprinkler<00:01:25.409> valve<00:01:25.590> they

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
different type of sprinkler valve they

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.280 
different type of sprinkler valve they
call<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:26.250> anti<00:01:26.640> siphon<00:01:27.090> sprinkler<00:01:27.509> valve<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
call an anti siphon sprinkler valve and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.810 
call an anti siphon sprinkler valve and
I<00:01:28.439> did<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.400> wouldn't<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.759> any

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
I did it this way so I wouldn't have any

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390 
I did it this way so I wouldn't have any
couplers<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.259> tried<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
couplers in here and I tried to make it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
couplers in here and I tried to make it
with<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> least<00:01:32.970> amount<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.360> parts<00:01:33.659> possible

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
with the least amount of parts possible

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.890 
with the least amount of parts possible
so<00:01:34.770> basically<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.880> fill<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.240> full<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.420> air<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so basically you fill it full of air and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
so basically you fill it full of air and
let's<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.200> where's<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> knob<00:01:37.740> right<00:01:38.610> here

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
let's see where's the knob right here

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.690 
let's see where's the knob right here
and<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.960> could<00:01:40.079> use<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> bicycle<00:01:40.619> air<00:01:41.130> pump<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and you could use a bicycle air pump and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.050 
and you could use a bicycle air pump and
I<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.680> co2<00:01:43.680> canister<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.549> fill<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> with

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
I have a co2 canister I fill it with

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
I have a co2 canister I fill it with
this<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> pressure<00:01:45.960> gauge<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.530> tells<00:01:46.710> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
this is a pressure gauge that tells you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.850 
this is a pressure gauge that tells you
don't<00:01:47.070> fill<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> above<00:01:47.700> 80<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.090> 100<00:01:48.450> psi<00:01:48.860> again

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
don't fill it above 80 to 100 psi again

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.830 
don't fill it above 80 to 100 psi again
you<00:01:50.130> put<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> tennis<00:01:50.670> ball<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> ramrod<00:01:51.720> it

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you put the tennis ball in and ramrod it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.630 
you put the tennis ball in and ramrod it
down<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> hold<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
down and you hold it up here and you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.630 
down and you hold it up here and you
just<00:01:53.670> aim<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.079> fire

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
just aim it like that and you just fire

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.399 
just aim it like that and you just fire
my<00:01:56.640> third<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.149> final<00:01:57.180> pneumatic<00:01:57.930> else<00:01:58.170> ball

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
my third and final pneumatic else ball

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.109 
my third and final pneumatic else ball
launcher<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> shortest<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
launcher it is the shortest and the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.700 
launcher it is the shortest and the
lightest<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> shoots<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
lightest and actually it shoots the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.410 
lightest and actually it shoots the
farthest

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
farthest

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.580 
farthest
basically<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.020> pressure<00:02:04.290> chamber

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
basically you have the pressure chamber

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.609 
basically you have the pressure chamber
up<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.579> the

pull<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.860> up<00:02:27.950> there<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.580> fire<00:02:28.880> again<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.959> would

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
pull it up there and fire again I would

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.309 
pull it up there and fire again I would
use<00:02:30.769> no<00:02:30.980> more<00:02:31.190> than<00:02:31.370> 80<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.819> 100<00:02:32.300> pounds<00:02:33.080> per

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
use no more than 80 to 100 pounds per

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.850 
use no more than 80 to 100 pounds per
square<00:02:33.349> inch<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:34.370> is<00:02:34.430> rated<00:02:34.930> 260<00:02:35.930> psi<00:02:36.410> but

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
square inch this is rated 260 psi but

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.199 
square inch this is rated 260 psi but
it's<00:02:37.010> rated<00:02:37.280> for<00:02:37.310> liquid

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
it's rated for liquid

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.390 
it's rated for liquid
now<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.930> explodes<00:02:39.530> with<00:02:39.709> liquid<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.220> it's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
now this explodes with liquid in it it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.370 
now this explodes with liquid in it it's
just<00:02:40.459> gonna<00:02:40.700> spring<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> leak<00:02:41.239> if<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.959> explodes

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
just gonna spring a leak if it explodes

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.140 
just gonna spring a leak if it explodes
with<00:02:42.470> pressure<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.700> gonna<00:02:43.880> blow<00:02:44.120> up

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
with pressure in it it's gonna blow up

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.270 
with pressure in it it's gonna blow up
and<00:02:44.420> shrapnel<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.200> again<00:02:45.440> be<00:02:45.620> very<00:02:45.860> careful

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
and shrapnel so again be very careful

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.250 
and shrapnel so again be very careful
and<00:02:46.430> don't<00:02:46.640> inflate<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.060> too<00:02:47.209> much<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.930> second

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
and don't inflate it too much the second

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.960 
and don't inflate it too much the second
thing<00:02:48.410> I'd<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.739> caution<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.640> don't

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
thing I'd like to caution you is don't

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.300 
thing I'd like to caution you is don't
use<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.660> cold<00:02:50.930> weather<00:02:51.230> because<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:52.040> cold

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
use this in cold weather because in cold

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.140 
use this in cold weather because in cold
weather<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.790> lowers<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.510> operating

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
weather that lowers the operating

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.520 
weather that lowers the operating
parameters<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.599> if<00:02:57.200> it's<00:02:57.380> 30

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
parameters of this and if it's 30

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.289 
parameters of this and if it's 30
degrees<00:02:57.739> out<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.340> put<00:02:58.519> too<00:02:58.730> much<00:02:58.880> air<00:02:59.150> in

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
degrees out and you put too much air in

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.970 
degrees out and you put too much air in
here<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.750> could<00:02:59.959> blow<00:03:00.140> up<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.440> really<00:03:00.680> hurt

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
here it could blow up and really hurt

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.039 
here it could blow up and really hurt
yourself<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:01.519> be<00:03:01.910> careful<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.540> don't<00:03:02.900> use

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
yourself so be careful of that don't use

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.839 
yourself so be careful of that don't use
it<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.290> very<00:03:03.500> cold<00:03:03.739> temperatures<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.640> don't

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
it in very cold temperatures and don't

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.150 
it in very cold temperatures and don't
over<00:03:05.150> inflate<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.660> other<00:03:06.200> than<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.830> seems

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
over inflate it other than that it seems

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.240 
over inflate it other than that it seems
to<00:03:07.250> be<00:03:07.340> perfectly<00:03:07.730> safe<00:03:08.860> there's<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.950> tennis

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
to be perfectly safe there's a tennis

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.849 
to be perfectly safe there's a tennis
ball<00:03:10.430> what<00:03:11.150> I've<00:03:11.269> done<00:03:11.420> is<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.810> put<00:03:12.049> 20<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.620> piñas

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
ball what I've done is I put 20 to piñas

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.009 
ball what I've done is I put 20 to piñas
in<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.310> if<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.850> google<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.269> on<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.570> internet

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
in it if you google this on the internet

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.199 
in it if you google this on the internet
you<00:03:15.260> can<00:03:15.470> see<00:03:15.709> where<00:03:15.920> they<00:03:15.980> say<00:03:16.220> 22<00:03:16.670> pennies<00:03:17.030> is

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
you can see where they say 22 pennies is

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.090 
you can see where they say 22 pennies is
the<00:03:17.390> maximum<00:03:18.200> amount<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.530> want<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.769> put<00:03:18.890> in<00:03:19.010> to
