even paired it can also take care of the

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.470 
even paired it can also take care of the
pairing<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:06.580> move<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:06.970> here<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.450> will

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
pairing so move it here you will

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.400 
pairing so move it here you will
recognize<00:02:08.379> the<00:02:08.679> device<00:02:09.159> in<00:02:09.519> tag<00:02:10.030> if<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.140> first

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
recognize the device in tag if you first

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.870 
recognize the device in tag if you first
start<00:02:11.650> by<00:02:11.830> pairing<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.400> will<00:02:12.550> take<00:02:12.700> few

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
start by pairing it will take few

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.430 
start by pairing it will take few
seconds<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:13.750> connect

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
seconds and then connect

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.850 
seconds and then connect
to<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.710> device<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.480> now<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:16.900> have<00:02:17.230> device

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
to the device and now we have device

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
disconnect so excusing it to food also

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.300 
disconnect so excusing it to food also
disconnect<00:02:42.460> that<00:02:42.580> from<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.480> speaker<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
disconnect that from the speaker and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.740 
disconnect that from the speaker and
Google's<00:02:45.310> ohms<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.820> clear<00:02:46.030> will<00:02:46.240> stop<00:02:46.480> their

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
Google's ohms it clear will stop their

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.900 
Google's ohms it clear will stop their
playing<00:02:46.960> when<00:02:47.260> it's<00:02:47.410> disconnected<00:02:47.740> but<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.280> can

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
playing when it's disconnected but I can

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.610 
playing when it's disconnected but I can
also<00:02:49.030> use<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.330> other<00:02:49.450> way<00:02:49.630> around<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.260> now<00:02:50.440> I'm

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
also use the other way around so now I'm

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.160 
also use the other way around so now I'm
using<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.100> Speaker<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> phone<00:02:52.150> itself

connect<00:03:11.440> same<00:03:11.680> way<00:03:12.480> some<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.570> takes<00:03:13.780> longer

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
connect same way some this takes longer

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.100 
connect same way some this takes longer
time<00:03:14.170> on<00:03:14.200> your<00:03:14.380> screen<00:03:14.970> it's<00:03:15.970> for<00:03:16.660> same<00:03:16.900> way<00:03:17.080> I

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
time on your screen it's for same way I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.940 
time on your screen it's for same way I
can<00:03:17.290> put<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.680> music<00:03:17.800> back<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.860> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
can put the music back on this is the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.410 
can put the music back on this is the
quite<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.459> doesn't<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.970> name<00:03:22.120> so

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
quite it just doesn't have the name so

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.880 
quite it just doesn't have the name so
it<00:03:22.540> says<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.590> device<00:03:23.890> but<00:03:23.920> same<00:03:24.760> way

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.360 

that's<00:03:30.100> that's<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.340> demo<00:03:31.640> for<00:03:31.850> now<00:03:32.140> so<00:03:33.370> tell

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
that's that's the demo for now so tell

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.130 
that's that's the demo for now so tell
some<00:03:34.520> limitations<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.270> only<00:03:35.450> now<00:03:35.630> works<00:03:35.870> for

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
some limitations this only now works for

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.970 
some limitations this only now works for
that<00:03:36.320> audio<00:03:37.310> speakers<00:03:38.470> next<00:03:39.470> step<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.740> to<00:03:39.860> get

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
that audio speakers next step is to get

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.460 
that audio speakers next step is to get

it working also with headsets there's a

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.170 
it working also with headsets there's a
different<00:03:42.860> API<00:03:43.160> have<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.430> go<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:43.850> it's<00:03:44.060> not

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
different API have to go so it's not

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.410 
different API have to go so it's not
working<00:03:44.510> yet<00:03:44.750> also<00:03:45.680> Telepan<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.910> support

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
something fancier so toasty things I

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.910 
something fancier so toasty things I
have<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.370> add<00:04:10.489> steel<00:04:10.850> but<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.620> think<00:04:12.620> this<00:04:12.739> is

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
have to add steel but I think this is

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.409 
have to add steel but I think this is
pretty<00:04:13.580> solid<00:04:13.850> software<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:15.160> should<00:04:16.160> be

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
pretty solid software and should be

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:23.440 
pretty solid software and should be
pretty<00:04:17.419> safe<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.810> put<00:04:18.140> it<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.350> market<00:04:22.450> just

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
pretty safe to put it to the market just

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:36.410 
pretty safe to put it to the market just
to<00:04:23.690> see<00:04:23.840> if<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.110> can<00:04:24.290> get<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.560> fresh
