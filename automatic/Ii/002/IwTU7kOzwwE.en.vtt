 take today to talk about my 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.570

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.270
 happened to a time when the rate 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.640
 early I had called the chru for their 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.859

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.289
 folder in a third of how I 'm going 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.550
 to do that in fact it was in a folder 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.950
 like that here you have to be received by 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.550

 had to fill in and send back 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.739
 in short everything was full of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.050
 stuff in it 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.670
 so there were papers that I 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.739
 had to complete and return word game 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.550
 if he sent a check in the amount of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.620
 115 euros 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.629
 I will send them envelopes already 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.309

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.359
 return these data the document has 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.100
 actually sent so I sent them back 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.080
 dropped after ten days at least he 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.820
 sent me a paper that told me 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.549
 that they had received well that they accuse 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 tunes and receiving my record 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.350
 then he sent me a summons 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.869
 for us 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.820
 for the oral the generous provocation if to 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.340
 about three weeks to a month before 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.020
 the deadline therefore makes how 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.000
 I was dressed that day there I put 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.619

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.570

 white shirt with a drop standards 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.770
 that was nice that day I was not

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.270
 also happened at the place of their age 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.159
 tells that she actually talks about people 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.840
 they get bored in classic fashion 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.369
 hoarau everyday jean t-shirt 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.130
 leggings basket we will already establish the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.240
 bank the quad came out a little widow 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.310
 who wants to do too much but good 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.409
 in my defense I did not know how 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.810
 had he introduced himself to this kind of 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.569
 thing in fact so how did it go 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.020
 I arrived at 2 pm I believe that 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.850
 40 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.039
 never meet again at 2:45 pm 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.810
 charest but in a kind of all in 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.119
 made to spatial they have transformed 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.880
 in hall and at windham who i gave my 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.140
 convocation imams the identities and 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.580
 premeditated and reverdy mouth that it was 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.780
 me that it was true that it was not 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.260
 someone else who had come to 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.000
 present at the exam instead then 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.590
 I waited I think maybe five 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.820
 minutes and got us into a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.010
 room we were 5 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.360
 finally he will return by five in fact 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.459
 everything happens in groups of five in 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.109
 any case candles you are at the beginning by 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.959
 sat in a room there is a big 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.390
 square table with the topics that was 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.370
 already asked me back and we could 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680
 see with rough leaves a 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.090
 pencil finally everyone defeat and not a 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.609
 pencil sharpener and eraser 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.049
 so she explains to us that we are going to be 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.570
 in the room for ten minutes we go 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.410
 to answer the subject and that all that is related 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.760
 in the end she came back us up 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.970
 remy we look we are still at the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.030
 wait in the patio and we were caught 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.070
 manara for maintenance maintenance 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.500
 with young people so how did 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.930
 spent at least maintenance already with 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.580
 two people a woman and a man 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.530
 the man was a psychologist 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.450
 friends are finally short a weird thing 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.510
 like that and the lady she was 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.560
 trainer in training aids 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.350
 So the caregivers that the lam 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.520
 is called the interview lasted 30 minutes 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.620
 in the beginning when I arrived they got 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.540
 are presented and immediately after 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.560
 they really about me by my name 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.290
 when tonight I immediately 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.380
 started with what I had answered from 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.600
 subject it lasts and I spoke fast enough 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.460
 so I think it lasted not 5 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.960
 6 minutes because I'm my door I 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.100
 did not stress the cities I knew 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.050
 what I meant was one and 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.760
 easily in fact and after they go 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.190
 ask questions at your age your 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.390
 school curriculum why be alone in 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.860
 the world you know about the job 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.750
 caregiver that this level of 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.650
 training 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.710
 how are you financial your 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.530
 training all that I made them me 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.390
 I answered questions they did not 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.830
 asked why see the question that I 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.810
 thought they would absolutely ask 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.340
 because you have a bac 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.810
 why not have chosen training 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.400
 nurses but they did not ask 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.740
 because I answered indirectly 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.500
 made to another question at more 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.540
 which I replied I governed 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.709
 answer this question 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.540
 then the subject on which I am 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.570
 fell I fall on the subject of death 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.130
 should death be explained to children in 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.390
 same time in the hell of the text he 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.480
 was really close to doing what 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.440
 maybe 400 lines maximum and actually 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.210
 he was talking in the island 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.520
 exit with illustrations that has 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.530
 explained the deaths to the children and ask 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.030
 our opinion on the book is safe is it 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.150
 that we must talk about death to children 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.090
 so I answered as I thought 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.060
 do it I said yes so it takes 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.270
 to speak but it depends on the maturity of 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.130
 the child also depends if not angry 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.720
 I 'm ok I refuse it's a fact 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.070
 exactly what I said but basically 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.930
 I said yes we have to talk to them 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.060
 it depends on the maturity of the child and 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.740
 concerning books with 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.940
 illustrations 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.650
 I said no to me it's not a 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.950
 good idea to serve only that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.240
 why not build in addition 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.490
 a discussion with the child why 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.040
 not if it 's hard to find the words 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.190
 or stuff like that so for the subject 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.540
 that was it after it happened after 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.540
 we go after they gave me a little 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.100
 paper to fill in to find out how 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.140
 I was going to finance the training if 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.090
 it was me these regional pole 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.360
 job where I was myself who are funding 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.220
 the information is so good it was 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.640
 finished like that it lasted an hour stack 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.970
 hair 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.300
 that is to say, I returned at 2:45 pm to 3:45 pm 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.710
 I was out then what is 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.800
 go to a very good ben now after 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.020
 that's so I passed and I pass he comes 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.150
 to go in the video I spent 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.380
 the oral 9 April and I will have the answer 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.249
 June 2 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.289
 so that but 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:51.759
 two months it does not bother me too much 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.559
 in the sense that for once that's 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.209
 done it's done and last goal nothing 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:57.369
 do all this without soul to wait 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:59.709
 so I'm waiting a month or two but 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:03.219
 it does not change much for me here 

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:05.859
 if I'm taken well I'll start 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:08.799
 early September the exact date 

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:11.789
 I think it's Monday, September 1st 

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:13.779
 Monday, September 3rd reminds me that 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.289
 I try to find that in doubt 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.289
 fear face 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.389
 it's monday september 1st and if i am 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.120
 not curly will make me look for a 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:31.120
 work and we will retry competition 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.430
 next year so I think I 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.980
 you told me everything about my outfit how 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:40.510
 happened the subjects the juries so 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.590
 it was pretty fast pretty simple 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:46.300
 it was really saying that it was enough 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.160
 cool what was not too stressful the 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.169
 jurors also at the beginning when they are 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.200
 came to fetch me in yola space there 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.820
 was nice enough I had headphones 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.130
 scooter and ideals scooter lights 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.590
 which moult it's going to be nice 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.419
 he was not the kind of super villain 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.070
 super cold on the contrary and I 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:05.830
 think at the beginning but also of me 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.940
 put at ease for that for the for 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.690
 that I can speak so 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.880
 casual 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.570
 So here I think I told you everything 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.700
 what other questions do you have 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.900
 much more accurate on for example 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.340
 the subjects or anything I 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.530
 would prefer to be asked is a 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.270
 private message like that I'll take the 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.910
 time to answer you that specifically 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.620
 about the questions you will ask me and 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:28.180
 if these are much more questions 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.710
 simple it's me much more general 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.720
 you can put me back in 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.510
 comments and of course I will answer them 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.200
 so here is I story that this video 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.880
 will help you help people who have
