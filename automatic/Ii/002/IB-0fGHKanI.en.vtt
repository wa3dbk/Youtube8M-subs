00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.620
 hello I'm sarah facilitos in a new 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.790
 video of minecraft in destroys nexuses and 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.919
 first of all I send a greeting 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.919
 fear of aileen mendoza to lick pandi 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.860
 and today's video is going to be about 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.009
 defenses of compositions and envelope 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.310
 Tickets to link in costal it 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:30.000
 first of all I recommend them with 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.199
 defense defense compositions 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.190
 poison compositions that do 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:41.570
 poison positions 2 about 2 and one of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.050
 poison because because of the poison 2 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.330
 they serve more or less to tinkle tubs 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.790
 someone exactly in the face by 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.180
 new plot example 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.960
 good 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.590
 As you can see, it fills me with 16 seconds and 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.089
 goes down all life all the whole life 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.360
 in just 17 seconds and when you 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.150
 hit the enemy because he will die if 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.000
 you're stuck one last heist because of course not 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.320
 is going to die of poison instead if the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.950
 option of poison 2 is thrown right to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.770
 one side as well as the poison 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.590
 only going to last 2 seconds to 3 and not 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.080
 he's going to go down all his life instead 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.810
 if you are hit with a poison deposit 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.770
 one of a minute and a half that is with 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.990
 rest without taking off like this directly then 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.060
 he's going to lose his whole life and he's going to 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.970
 last a minute or so it's going to 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.690
 go down all minute however this one does not 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.190
 it works very well if the enemy has 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.400
 recovery options or positions of 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.230
 lifetime 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.150
 in fact the two hands work very 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.940
 well if you have possible recovery 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.690
 but if it does not have the same then they are lowered 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.730
 all 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.520
 I should have about three 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.560
 life positions and a two of 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.350
 recovery to be able to counteract 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.350
 this but for example I throw it here 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.900
 Well, if I throw it at him if he has the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.870
 position near the enemy for example 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.880
 there, then, the position will have a 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.380
 effect like 40 seconds and in those 40 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.580
 seconds in the position of poison to one 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.580
 they will go down all their lives 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.170
 so good continuing with the other 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:46.459
 part with the part of the inputs to 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.459
 nexos in costal then just this is what 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.390
 they make a little way around here 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.380
 break that part 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.390
 I think being part of 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.519
 today I think I'm seeing 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:20.230
 that is to say on that part to see I think it was 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.269
 below if nothing else below 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.319
 and we would have what would be an entrance 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.260
 annexed 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.620
 and here they can defend, I think 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.099
 another had before here but I think 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.099
 they are no longer 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.349
 and the one here is not 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.129
 and effectively no longer is there no 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.129
 more is is 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.920
 so I 'm sarah cupcakes 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.530
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.130
 see you if they have some trick or some 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.180
 suggestion can send me 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.180
 and they take care of themselves
