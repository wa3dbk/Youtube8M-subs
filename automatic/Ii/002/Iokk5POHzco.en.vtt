00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:21.869 
in the short program and probably was

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:23.629 
in the short program and probably was
lucky<00:05:22.079> to<00:05:22.259> get<00:05:22.379> away<00:05:22.619> with<00:05:22.829> sixth<00:05:23.129> place<00:05:23.339> but

certain to get on the podium now the

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.859 
certain to get on the podium now the
question<00:05:30.779> is<00:05:31.019> which<00:05:31.259> place<00:05:31.589> will<00:05:31.859> it<00:05:31.979> be

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:32.869 
question is which place will it be

question is which place will it be
wasn't<00:05:33.869> that<00:05:33.899> great<00:05:34.319> from<00:05:34.649> Masada<00:05:35.039> it<00:05:35.429> really

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
wasn't that great from Masada it really

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.639 
wasn't that great from Masada it really
was<00:05:35.999> he<00:05:36.179> could<00:05:36.329> sense<00:05:36.809> the<00:05:36.989> tension<00:05:37.289> at<00:05:37.559> the

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:37.649 
was he could sense the tension at the

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:39.709 
was he could sense the tension at the
beginning<00:05:38.009> of<00:05:38.069> the<00:05:38.189> program<00:05:38.369> she<00:05:38.849> was<00:05:39.029> very

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
beginning of the program she was very

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.459 
beginning of the program she was very
very<00:05:40.199> nervous<00:05:41.539> really<00:05:42.539> really<00:05:42.719> attack<00:05:43.199> that

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:43.469 
very nervous really really attack that

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:45.439 
very nervous really really attack that
triple<00:05:43.859> axel<00:05:44.219> pretty<00:05:44.699> sure<00:05:44.999> she<00:05:45.179> made<00:05:45.329> the

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
triple axel pretty sure she made the

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.419 
triple axel pretty sure she made the
rotation<00:05:45.929> on<00:05:46.019> it<00:05:46.169> didn't<00:05:46.739> stop<00:05:47.099> the<00:05:47.279> rotation

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:47.429 
rotation on it didn't stop the rotation

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:50.269 
rotation on it didn't stop the rotation
very<00:05:48.029> well<00:05:48.299> so<00:05:48.869> the<00:05:49.079> grade<00:05:49.469> of<00:05:49.499> execution<00:05:50.129> will

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
very well so the grade of execution will

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.179 
very well so the grade of execution will
go<00:05:50.429> down<00:05:50.669> but<00:05:50.969> the<00:05:51.179> key<00:05:51.449> thing<00:05:51.479> is<00:05:51.779> for<00:05:52.619> her<00:05:52.829> she

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.189 
go down but the key thing is for her she

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.209 
go down but the key thing is for her she
wants<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:53.789> get<00:05:53.969> that<00:05:54.239> base<00:05:55.110> value<00:05:55.649> she<00:05:55.919> wants

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
wants to get that base value she wants

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.489 
wants to get that base value she wants
to<00:05:56.339> make<00:05:56.549> the<00:05:56.579> rotation<00:05:57.360> count<00:05:57.659> eight<00:05:58.079> and<00:05:58.439> a

00:05:58.489 --> 00:05:58.499 
to make the rotation count eight and a

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.549 
to make the rotation count eight and a
half<00:05:58.529> points<00:05:59.339> is<00:06:00.299> the<00:06:00.360> base<00:06:00.689> value<00:06:00.809> for<00:06:01.469> that

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:01.559 
half points is the base value for that

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:03.820 
half points is the base value for that
triple<00:06:01.919> axel

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
triple axel

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.390 
triple axel
kosta<00:06:04.640> remember<00:06:05.210> got<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.440> hundred<00:06:07.130> and

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
kosta remember got a hundred and

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.840 
kosta remember got a hundred and
thirty-one<00:06:08.230> just<00:06:09.230> over<00:06:09.590> and<00:06:09.800> she's<00:06:10.550> around

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
thirty-one just over and she's around

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.690 
thirty-one just over and she's around
for<00:06:11.150> half<00:06:11.420> points<00:06:11.870> in<00:06:12.020> front<00:06:12.500> of<00:06:12.890> asada<00:06:13.310> going

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
for half points in front of asada going

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.860 
for half points in front of asada going
in<00:06:13.850> so<00:06:14.090> a<00:06:14.330> sudden<00:06:14.840> he's<00:06:14.990> something<00:06:15.350> like<00:06:15.610> 136

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
in so a sudden he's something like 136

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.690 
in so a sudden he's something like 136
has<00:06:17.870> she<00:06:18.170> got<00:06:18.380> it<00:06:18.530> it<00:06:18.710> would<00:06:18.890> be<00:06:19.040> a<00:06:19.070> career-best

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
has she got it it would be a career-best

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.840 
has she got it it would be a career-best
if<00:06:20.570> she<00:06:20.780> does<00:06:20.930> his<00:06:21.140> the<00:06:21.350> axle<00:06:21.770> does<00:06:22.400> she<00:06:22.640> make

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
if she does his the axle does she make

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.450 
if she does his the axle does she make
it<00:06:23.030> round<00:06:23.260> well<00:06:24.260> I<00:06:24.500> give<00:06:24.890> her<00:06:24.980> that<00:06:25.130> to<00:06:25.340> be

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
it round well I give her that to be

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.740 
it round well I give her that to be
honest<00:06:25.700> with<00:06:25.790> you<00:06:25.850> it<00:06:26.090> was<00:06:26.210> double<00:06:26.540> footed

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
honest with you it was double footed

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.480 
honest with you it was double footed
landings<00:06:26.900> she<00:06:27.230> stepped<00:06:27.530> out<00:06:27.710> of<00:06:27.890> it<00:06:28.010> but<00:06:28.430> I

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
landings she stepped out of it but I

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.770 
landings she stepped out of it but I
think<00:06:28.580> she'd<00:06:29.090> made<00:06:29.300> that<00:06:29.480> the

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
think she'd made that the

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.930 
think she'd made that the
three-and-a-half<00:06:30.400> rotations<00:06:31.400> got<00:06:31.610> into<00:06:31.820> that

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
three-and-a-half rotations got into that

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.510 
three-and-a-half rotations got into that
last<00:06:32.210> quarter<00:06:32.660> it's<00:06:32.990> a<00:06:33.170> close<00:06:33.470> one<00:06:33.740> here's<00:06:34.310> the

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
last quarter it's a close one here's the

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.700 
last quarter it's a close one here's the
flip<00:06:34.820> that's<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.960> one<00:06:36.080> she<00:06:36.290> was<00:06:36.380> looking<00:06:36.680> to

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
flip that's the one she was looking to

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.440 
flip that's the one she was looking to
put<00:06:36.920> the<00:06:37.040> loop<00:06:37.250> on<00:06:37.460> could<00:06:37.880> have<00:06:37.970> been<00:06:38.060> a<00:06:38.120> triple

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
put the loop on could have been a triple

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.160 
put the loop on could have been a triple
loop<00:06:38.570> on<00:06:38.720> the<00:06:38.810> end<00:06:38.840> of<00:06:39.020> that<00:06:39.080> even<00:06:39.410> but<00:06:41.170> aborted

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
loop on the end of that even but aborted

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.020 
loop on the end of that even but aborted
it<00:06:42.260> there<00:06:42.500> but<00:06:42.860> she<00:06:43.010> got<00:06:43.190> a<00:06:43.220> combinations<00:06:43.880> in

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
it there but she got a combinations in

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.330 
it there but she got a combinations in
later<00:06:44.450> in<00:06:44.660> the<00:06:44.750> program<00:06:45.170> there's<00:06:45.950> the<00:06:46.130> looks

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
later in the program there's the looks

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.890 
later in the program there's the looks
bit<00:06:46.550> of<00:06:46.640> a<00:06:46.700> change<00:06:46.880> of<00:06:47.030> edge<00:06:47.180> going<00:06:47.420> into<00:06:47.750> that

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
bit of a change of edge going into that

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.360 
bit of a change of edge going into that
so<00:06:48.080> she's<00:06:48.230> gonna<00:06:48.320> get<00:06:48.500> an<00:06:48.620> edge<00:06:48.740> deduction<00:06:49.280> on

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
so she's gonna get an edge deduction on

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.910 
so she's gonna get an edge deduction on
it<00:06:49.520> and<00:06:49.700> that<00:06:49.840> here<00:06:50.840> the<00:06:51.020> big<00:06:51.290> combination

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
it and that here the big combination

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.650 
it and that here the big combination
double<00:06:52.340> axel<00:06:53.830> checks<00:06:54.830> that<00:06:55.070> left<00:06:55.340> arm

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
double axel checks that left arm

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.960 
double axel checks that left arm
beautiful<00:06:56.660> triple<00:06:57.020> toe<00:06:57.170> on<00:06:57.350> the<00:06:57.380> end

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
beautiful triple toe on the end

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.490 
beautiful triple toe on the end
absolutely<00:06:58.970> magnificent<00:06:59.630> that<00:06:59.780> really<00:07:00.260> was

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
absolutely magnificent that really was

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.230 
absolutely magnificent that really was
the<00:07:00.800> confidence<00:07:01.490> booster<00:07:02.150> that<00:07:02.330> built<00:07:02.960> to<00:07:03.260> a

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
the confidence booster that built to a

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.240 
the confidence booster that built to a
fantastic<00:07:05.240> end<00:07:05.480> to<00:07:05.630> the<00:07:05.750> program<00:07:06.170> well<00:07:07.100> when

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
fantastic end to the program well when

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.910 
fantastic end to the program well when
we<00:07:07.400> came<00:07:07.670> here<00:07:08.000> we<00:07:08.320> thought<00:07:09.320> it<00:07:09.470> was<00:07:09.620> either<00:07:09.770> a

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920 
we came here we thought it was either a

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.040 
we came here we thought it was either a
solder<00:07:10.250> or<00:07:10.400> Kim<00:07:10.760> we<00:07:11.120> didn't<00:07:11.480> really<00:07:11.720> think

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
solder or Kim we didn't really think

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.540 
solder or Kim we didn't really think
Costner<00:07:12.470> would<00:07:12.620> have<00:07:12.770> it<00:07:12.860> in<00:07:12.980> her<00:07:13.100> to<00:07:13.130> produce

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
Costner would have it in her to produce

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.290 
Costner would have it in her to produce
the<00:07:13.880> kind<00:07:14.090> of<00:07:14.180> performances<00:07:14.750> that<00:07:14.960> she's<00:07:15.200> done

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
the kind of performances that she's done

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.020 
the kind of performances that she's done
has<00:07:17.300> asada<00:07:17.830> leapfrog<00:07:18.830> over<00:07:19.010> her<00:07:19.310> from<00:07:19.550> six

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
has asada leapfrog over her from six

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.230 
has asada leapfrog over her from six
place

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.050 

I<00:07:24.360> think<00:07:24.870> it's<00:07:24.990> gonna<00:07:25.139> be<00:07:25.319> very<00:07:25.349> very<00:07:26.069> close<00:07:29.060> so

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
I think it's gonna be very very close so

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:43.870 
I think it's gonna be very very close so
she<00:07:30.120> needs<00:07:30.479> around<00:07:31.310> 136<00:07:34.520> would<00:07:35.520> you<00:07:35.610> press<00:07:35.849> I

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:43.880 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.450 

don't<00:07:44.880> think<00:07:45.000> it's<00:07:45.479> quite<00:07:45.690> enough<00:07:46.460> goodness

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 
don't think it's quite enough goodness

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:53.890 
don't think it's quite enough goodness
she's<00:07:48.360> beaten<00:07:48.810> costner<00:07:49.289> but<00:07:49.830> not<00:07:50.250> by<00:07:50.729> enough

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:53.900 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.980 

in<00:07:54.900> his<00:07:55.110> second<00:07:55.680> place<00:07:55.919> yeah<00:07:56.690> Costner<00:07:57.690> still

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:57.990 
in his second place yeah Costner still

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.140 
in his second place yeah Costner still
needs<00:07:58.319> a<00:07:58.740> sod<00:07:59.490> a<00:07:59.520> second<00:08:01.370> they<00:08:02.370> could<00:08:02.580> both<00:08:02.789> be

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.150 
needs a sod a second they could both be

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:08.270 
needs a sod a second they could both be
on<00:08:03.180> the<00:08:03.300> podium<00:08:04.490> and<00:08:05.490> they<00:08:05.970> may<00:08:06.270> be<00:08:07.280> Costner

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 
on the podium and they may be Costner

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.419 
on the podium and they may be Costner
may<00:08:08.490> be<00:08:08.550> at<00:08:08.729> the<00:08:08.849> top<00:08:09.030> of<00:08:09.090> the<00:08:09.240> podium
