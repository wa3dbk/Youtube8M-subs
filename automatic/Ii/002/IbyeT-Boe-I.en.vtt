00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.310
 I teach you how to do this nice tutorial 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.539
 that Patxi came here again here 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.070
 they found super world of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.869
 tutorials states I find a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.460
 I love tennis and how they saw in the intro 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.890
 let's do what is a barbecue 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.990
 are these little tutorials so that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.230
 you have a decoration in the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.149
 patio I make it simple so that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.480
 you do not complicate this either 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.390
 and so for the people 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.420
 You can do it without complexity without 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.910
 nothing to get the materials not the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.710
 that nickname of a nurse section I 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.410
 helped to do a lot of things we were 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.079
 testing whether to make windows or boats already 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.110
 then we upload them bricks materials 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.989
 black wool rails cobweb stone 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.360
 and moss stone fences to it would look 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.300
 all right 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.950
 and muscular son without moss ok let's go to 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.140
 place what are two in pillar of 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.680
 brick we leave two spaces and we do 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.680
 the same 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.960
 we put in the middle 2 black color and 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.160
 we cover the roof with stone slab 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.160
 from brick to brick 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.080
 we place the rails on top of what is 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 the black and in the back we close 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.310
 with the same bricks so you do not 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.159
 see 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.659
 so one seems if it is here or that already 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.280
 that is already finished we will place 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.810
 two other lights in the middle part 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.330
 to give it an effect here like 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.610
 circular 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.290
 and then the only thing that we lack is the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.120
 tube from where the smoke comes out for that what 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.640
 placed in the back can be 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.150
 of 1 or can you put 2 as I am going to 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.700
 put here now if the smoke the smoke is 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.470
 the coolest effect here that makes it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.690
 see pro so let's place 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.420
 cobwebs as well as stay 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:58.049
 viborite so you can see better not 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.960
 be a little lower yes and already 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.670
 we started to climb and ready we removed this 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.140
 so that we close but remember that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
 they have to leave spaces that are based 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.090
 that the smoke is coming out after nothing 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.100
 this is the band tutorial is simple 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.180

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.060
 minutes let me know and then we started 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.300
