one<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> glitch<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
one is going to be a glitch and the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
other is going to be completely normal

other is going to be completely normal
the<00:00:40.980> first<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.399> will<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> glitch<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the first way will be the glitch and to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.600 
the first way will be the glitch and to
start<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> earth<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
start this go to the earth and go to the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
start this go to the earth and go to the
mission<00:00:45.000> called<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.050> dark<00:00:46.289> within<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
mission called the dark within and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.600 
mission called the dark within and
launch<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.739> also<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.160> set<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
launch it and also you can set this to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
launch it and also you can set this to
any<00:00:50.789> difficulty<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> want<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.170> depends

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
any difficulty you want it just depends

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.130 
any difficulty you want it just depends
what<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.190> personal<00:00:53.670> preference<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:57.140> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
what your personal preference is and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.630 
what your personal preference is and
once<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> guys<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.859> spawn<00:00:59.160> into<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
once you guys have spawn into the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.720 
once you guys have spawn into the
ignition<00:00:59.780> just<00:01:00.780> follow<00:01:01.109> exactly<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:02.039> i<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
ignition just follow exactly as i do and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.590 
ignition just follow exactly as i do and
also<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.930> tip<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.949> way<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.640> exactly<00:01:06.240> how<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
also a tip this way is exactly how the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.590 
also a tip this way is exactly how the
mission<00:01:07.110> originally<00:01:07.650> makes<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.390> if

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
mission originally makes you do it so if

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.539 
mission originally makes you do it so if
you<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.960> follow<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.350> mission<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.830> until<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you just follow the mission up until you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.840 
you just follow the mission up until you
go<00:01:11.700> inside<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.119> building<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.140> fine

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
go inside this building you will be fine

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.370 
go inside this building you will be fine
try<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.360> off<00:01:15.509> your<00:01:15.659> Sparrow<00:01:15.930> because

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.039 

the<00:01:47.909> next<00:01:48.180> part<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> glitch<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.630> probably

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the next part of the glitch is probably

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289 
the next part of the glitch is probably
the<00:01:49.140> trickiest<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.149> have

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to run and slide under this little block

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
respawning every three seconds this is

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.929 
respawning every three seconds this is
really<00:03:07.799> good<00:03:08.069> for<00:03:08.219> farming<00:03:08.400> because<00:03:08.699> you<00:03:08.790> can

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
really good for farming because you can

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.069 
really good for farming because you can
just<00:03:08.969> keep<00:03:09.269> killing<00:03:09.719> it<00:03:09.840> over<00:03:10.199> and<00:03:10.349> over<00:03:10.500> again

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
the best way to take advantage of this

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.159 
the best way to take advantage of this
is<00:03:14.639> to<00:03:14.939> keep<00:03:15.120> killing<00:03:15.510> them<00:03:15.540> over<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.049> over

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.210 
prefer more I do not like the glitch one
because<00:03:27.599> it's<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:27.959> perfect<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.889> doesn't

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
because it's not perfect and it doesn't

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.890 
because it's not perfect and it doesn't
give<00:03:29.370> as<00:03:29.549> many<00:03:29.790> Ingram's<00:03:30.359> as<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.689> one<00:03:30.870> does

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
give as many Ingram's as this one does

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.020 
give as many Ingram's as this one does
so<00:03:31.409> you<00:03:31.470> want<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.769> go<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:31.979> Venus<00:03:32.310> patrol<00:03:32.819> and

so you want to go to Venus patrol and
launch<00:03:33.989> yourself<00:03:34.169> there<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.939> once<00:03:35.939> you<00:03:36.180> are

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
launch yourself there and once you are

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.509 
launch yourself there and once you are
there<00:03:36.389> you<00:03:37.139> want<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.470> follow<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.979> exact<00:03:38.310> route

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
there you want to follow the exact route

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.270 
there you want to follow the exact route
I<00:03:38.639> go<00:03:39.169> all<00:03:40.169> right<00:03:40.409> let's<00:03:40.590> see<00:03:40.889> what<00:03:40.919> we<00:03:41.069> can

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
and as you can see it is very very

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.700 
and as you can see it is very very
effective<00:04:39.490> in<00:04:39.669> just<00:04:40.389> five<00:04:40.750> minutes<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.410> doing

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
effective in just five minutes of doing

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.100 
effective in just five minutes of doing
this<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:42.130> got<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.910> blue<00:04:43.120> in<00:04:43.300> grams<00:04:43.539> and<00:04:43.780> many

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
this I got to blue in grams and many

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.409 
this I got to blue in grams and many
greening<00:04:44.590> grams<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.250> is<00:04:45.370> also<00:04:45.699> a<00:04:45.970> really

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
greening grams that is also a really

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.820 
greening grams that is also a really
good<00:04:46.570> thing<00:04:46.600> about<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:47.080> compared<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.650> the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
good thing about this compared to the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.800 
good thing about this compared to the
other<00:04:47.979> glitch<00:04:48.340> one<00:04:48.610> because<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.479> my<00:04:49.660> opinion

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
other glitch one because in my opinion

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.040 
other glitch one because in my opinion
it<00:04:50.229> gives<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.530> lot<00:04:50.800> more<00:04:51.250> in<00:04:51.760> grams<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:52.690> items

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
it gives a lot more in grams and items

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.390 
it gives a lot more in grams and items
and<00:04:53.260> stuff<00:04:53.320> like<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.590> so<00:04:53.860> hope<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:54.280> guys
