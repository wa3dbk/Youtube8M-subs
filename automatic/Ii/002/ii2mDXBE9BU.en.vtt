while<00:01:08.390> i'm<00:01:08.570> free<00:01:08.810> jumping<00:01:09.260> Marley<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:09.950> tried<00:01:10.850> to

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
while i'm free jumping Marley I tried to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.760 
while i'm free jumping Marley I tried to
have<00:01:11.240> him<00:01:11.480> jump<00:01:11.690> as<00:01:11.900> if<00:01:12.200> there<00:01:12.410> were<00:01:12.500> someone

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
have him jump as if there were someone

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.290 
have him jump as if there were someone
on<00:01:13.040> his<00:01:13.220> back<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:14.170> look<00:01:15.170> for<00:01:15.440> steadiness<00:01:15.890> in

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
on his back I look for steadiness in

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.360 
on his back I look for steadiness in
fluidity<00:01:17.300> as<00:01:17.540> well<00:01:18.230> as<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.410> nice<00:01:18.680> takeoff<00:01:19.130> and

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
fluidity as well as a nice takeoff and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.570 
fluidity as well as a nice takeoff and
landing<00:01:20.080> my<00:01:21.080> primary<00:01:21.380> concern<00:01:21.890> though<00:01:22.400> is

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
landing my primary concern though is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.930 
landing my primary concern though is
that<00:01:23.030> when<00:01:23.450> Marley<00:01:23.900> jumps<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.530> jump<00:01:24.830> after<00:01:25.820> he

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
that when Marley jumps the jump after he

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.680 
that when Marley jumps the jump after he
lands<00:01:26.390> he<00:01:26.870> wants<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.290> come<00:01:27.440> back<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.860> me<00:01:28.690> this

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
lands he wants to come back to me this

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.050 
lands he wants to come back to me this
tells<00:01:30.050> me<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:30.860> I<00:01:30.890> didn't<00:01:31.310> cause<00:01:31.520> him<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:31.910> be

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
tells me that I didn't cause him to be

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.480 
tells me that I didn't cause him to be
afraid<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.420> me<00:01:32.780> by<00:01:33.470> chasing<00:01:33.920> them<00:01:34.040> towards<00:01:34.340> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
afraid of me by chasing them towards the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.270 
afraid of me by chasing them towards the
jump<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:36.170> also<00:01:36.530> gives<00:01:36.740> me<00:01:36.950> some<00:01:37.160> more

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
jump it also gives me some more

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.280 
jump it also gives me some more
information<00:01:37.670> about<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.570> state<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.840> his<00:01:39.050> mind

information about the state of his mind

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.500 
information about the state of his mind
when<00:01:39.470> he<00:01:39.500> lands<00:01:39.980> is<00:01:40.130> he<00:01:41.030> thinking<00:01:41.390> about

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
when he lands is he thinking about

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.630 
when he lands is he thinking about
taking<00:01:41.930> off<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.530> running<00:01:42.920> for<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.340> next
