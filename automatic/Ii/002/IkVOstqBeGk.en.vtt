00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
switch to this tool right here that one

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.179 
switch to this tool right here that one
and<00:00:21.740> so<00:00:22.740> now<00:00:23.390> you're<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.960> we're<00:00:25.890> going

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
to need to make a platform so we're

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.070 
to need to make a platform so we're
going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> make<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> cube<00:00:29.779> I'm<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> zoom

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
going to make a cube I'm going to zoom

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.250 
going to make a cube I'm going to zoom
in<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> cube<00:00:31.890> okay<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:34.850> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
in on the cube okay it's right there and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.959 
in on the cube okay it's right there and
so<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.309> change<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
so you're going to want to change the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.900 
so you're going to want to change the
exposition<00:00:39.960> 20<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.579> Y<00:00:41.850> position<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:43.050> zero<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
exposition 20 the Y position to zero and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.360 
exposition 20 the Y position to zero and
the<00:00:44.910> z-position<00:00:45.480> 20<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.770> about<00:00:50.190> right

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the z-position 20 so it's about right

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.369 
the z-position 20 so it's about right
there<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> you're<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.140> back

there so you're going to want to go back
to<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.680> tool<00:00:56.010> click<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> sphere<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.739> mean

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to this tool click on the sphere I mean

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.979 
to this tool click on the sphere I mean
the<00:00:58.829> cube<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:01.760> want<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
the cube and you're going to want to

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:12.260 
the cube and you're going to want to
make<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.260> X<00:01:04.470> around<00:01:05.220> 25<00:01:05.790> long<00:01:11.030> do<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> have

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
make the X around 25 long do you have

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
make the X around 25 long do you have
like<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:13.220> be<00:01:14.220> why<00:01:14.659> it<00:01:15.659> should<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
like that be why it should be I like to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.789 
like that be why it should be I like to
do<00:01:17.400> point<00:01:17.759> three<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.650> then<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> Z<00:01:20.100> 25<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> ends

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
do point three and then the Z 25 so ends

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.330 
do point three and then the Z 25 so ends
up<00:01:22.890> looking<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:28.350> I'm<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
up looking like this now I'm going to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.890 
up looking like this now I'm going to
add<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> texture<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.200> comes<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
add a texture to it that comes with the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.560 
add a texture to it that comes with the
just<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> little<00:01:34.409> map<00:01:34.619> texture<00:01:35.450> let's<00:01:36.450> see

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
just like a little map texture let's see

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
just like a little map texture let's see
how<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:36.990> dark<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> suction<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> doesn't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
how it's all dark and suction it doesn't

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.569 
how it's all dark and suction it doesn't
really<00:01:39.150> look<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.479> good<00:01:40.250> well<00:01:41.250> we're<00:01:41.430> going

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
really look that good well we're going

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
really look that good well we're going
to<00:01:41.640> make<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> look<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.570> bit<00:01:42.780> higher

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to make it look like a little bit higher

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.399 
to make it look like a little bit higher
quality<00:01:43.649> make<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> look<00:01:44.250> more<00:01:44.490> realistic<00:01:45.409> so

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
quality make it look more realistic so

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.800 
quality make it look more realistic so
you're<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> press<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.340> tool<00:01:47.810> now

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you're going to press this tool now

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.840 
you're going to press this tool now
you're<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> create<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:52.070> game<00:01:53.070> object<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you're going to create a game object and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.950 
you're going to create a game object and
you're<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> want<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> create<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.630> point

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you're going to want to create a point

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.929 
you're going to want to create a point
light<00:01:56.030> drag<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.270> there<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.200> light

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
light drag it up there so it's a light

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.190 
light drag it up there so it's a light
now<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> range<00:02:00.500> should<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.710> about<00:02:01.920> 30<00:02:03.200> just

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
now the range should be about 30 just

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.789 
now the range should be about 30 just
like<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:05.329> and<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
like that and so as you can see the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.790 
like that and so as you can see the
light<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> middle

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
light is in the middle

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.130 
light is in the middle
like<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:14.120> by<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.180> way<00:02:15.450> when<00:02:15.750> I'm<00:02:15.900> moving

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
like that and by the way when I'm moving

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.700 
like that and by the way when I'm moving
things<00:02:16.650> around<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.280> keep<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.330> point<00:02:18.990> but

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
things around I keep on this point but

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.890 
things around I keep on this point but
whenever<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.550> rotating<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.390> hold<00:02:21.690> down

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
whenever I'm like rotating you hold down

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.000 
whenever I'm like rotating you hold down
the<00:02:22.140> alt<00:02:22.350> button<00:02:22.670> alt<00:02:23.670> option<00:02:24.030> button<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.010> you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the alt button alt option button and you

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.900 
the alt button alt option button and you
just<00:02:26.280> move<00:02:26.670> your<00:02:26.910> mouse<00:02:28.160> while<00:02:29.160> clicking<00:02:29.520> and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
just move your mouse while clicking and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.450 
just move your mouse while clicking and
it<00:02:30.570> can<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.290> scroll<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.070> doing

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
it can you can scroll in and out doing

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.000 
it can you can scroll in and out doing
that<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.660> don't<00:02:33.840> have<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.140> keep<00:02:34.320> switching

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
that so you don't have to keep switching

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.640 
that so you don't have to keep switching
tools<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.040> once<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.520> have<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.650> i'm

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
tools so once I have it like this i'm

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.880 
tools so once I have it like this i'm
going<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.400> create<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:44.000> objects<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.510> need

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
going to create the objects that we need

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.170 
going to create the objects that we need
that<00:02:46.890> we're<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> move<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.790> I'm<00:02:47.910> going<00:02:48.120> to

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
that we're going to move so I'm going to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.790 
that we're going to move so I'm going to
make<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.660> sphere<00:02:49.110> move<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.290> have<00:02:52.500> this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
make a sphere move so we have this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:02.020 
make a sphere move so we have this
sphere<00:02:54.830> right<00:02:55.830> here<00:02:58.820> and<00:03:00.290> I'm<00:03:01.290> going<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> add<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
sphere right here and I'm going to add a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.140 
sphere right here and I'm going to add a
greenish<00:03:03.030> texture<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.960> it<00:03:04.910> feels<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
greenish texture to it feels like a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.100 
greenish texture to it feels like a
greenish<00:03:06.540> sphere<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.170> now<00:03:10.770> what<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.850> I

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
greenish sphere so now what I have is I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.870 
greenish sphere so now what I have is I
I<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.830> special<00:03:16.700> JavaScript<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.850> I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
I have this special JavaScript that I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.070 
I have this special JavaScript that I
made<00:03:20.390> for<00:03:21.390> moving<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:23.070> make<00:03:23.280> something<00:03:23.790> move

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
made for moving to make something move

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.870 
made for moving to make something move
with<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.230> arrow<00:03:25.440> keys<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.459> view<00:03:26.730> it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
with the arrow keys and you can view it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.930 
with the arrow keys and you can view it
in<00:03:27.000> third<00:03:27.239> person<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:29.220> I'm<00:03:29.340> just<00:03:29.520> going<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.730> put

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
in third person so I'm just going to put

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.699 
in third person so I'm just going to put
this<00:03:29.970> up<00:03:30.300> on<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.510> screen<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.320> need<00:03:31.590> to

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
this up on the screen so you need to

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:49.230 
this up on the screen so you need to
copy<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.390> script

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:04:05.000 

you

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:21.840 

it's<00:04:06.010> this<00:04:06.400> program<00:04:07.000> right<00:04:07.180> there

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.060 

okay<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.820> here<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.210> here's<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.230> script<00:04:26.620> it's

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
okay so here the here's the script it's

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.230 
okay so here the here's the script it's
called<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.820> move<00:04:28.060> around<00:04:28.420> script<00:04:30.000> at<00:04:31.000> least

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
called the move around script at least

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.810 
called the move around script at least
that's<00:04:31.450> what<00:04:31.630> I've<00:04:31.720> named<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:33.760> is

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
that's what I've named it and so this is

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.040 
that's what I've named it and so this is
what<00:04:34.480> you<00:04:34.600> need<00:04:36.480> I'm<00:04:37.480> just<00:04:37.630> going<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.900> copy

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
this right now so when it gets on

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.200 
this right now so when it gets on
youtube<00:04:40.450> i'll<00:04:40.600> put<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.930> in<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.050> description

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
youtube i'll put it in the description

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.610 
youtube i'll put it in the description
we<00:04:43.210> have<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.480> make<00:04:43.660> sure<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.930> looks<00:04:43.990> like<00:04:44.380> this

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
we have to make sure it looks like this

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.080 
we have to make sure it looks like this
because<00:04:44.800> when<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.100> paste<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.760> might<00:04:45.910> not

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
because when you paste it it might not

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.010 
because when you paste it it might not
look<00:04:46.300> like<00:04:46.360> this<00:04:51.000> so<00:04:52.000> anyway<00:04:52.420> once<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.840> get

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
look like this so anyway once you get

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.540 
look like this so anyway once you get
back<00:04:53.170> here<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.560> take<00:04:53.920> that<00:04:54.100> move<00:04:54.340> around

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
back here you take that move around

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.790 
back here you take that move around
script<00:04:56.370> you're<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.400> project<00:04:57.970> click<00:04:58.180> it<00:04:58.390> then

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
script you're a project click it then

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.290 
script you're a project click it then
you're<00:04:59.800> going<00:04:59.980> to<00:05:00.100> drag<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.820> move<00:05:01.030> around

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
you're going to drag the move around

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.750 
you're going to drag the move around
script<00:05:01.810> on<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.860> sphere<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.340> sphere

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
script on to the sphere so the sphere

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.290 
script on to the sphere so the sphere
gets<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.480> script<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:11.580> so<00:05:12.580> when<00:05:12.850> you<00:05:13.000> press

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
gets that script and so when you press

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.760 
gets that script and so when you press
play<00:05:17.670> you<00:05:18.670> can<00:05:18.790> see<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.150> spheres<00:05:19.510> moving<00:05:20.080> but

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
play you can see the spheres moving but

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.460 
play you can see the spheres moving but
you<00:05:20.890> can't<00:05:21.160> tell<00:05:21.480> where<00:05:22.480> it<00:05:22.660> is<00:05:22.750> because<00:05:23.080> this

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
you can't tell where it is because this

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.290 
you can't tell where it is because this
because<00:05:24.070> you<00:05:24.220> can't<00:05:24.460> tell<00:05:24.700> where<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.030> front

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
because you can't tell where the front

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.020 
because you can't tell where the front
of<00:05:25.420> the<00:05:25.600> sphere<00:05:25.990> is<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.520> also<00:05:27.520> another<00:05:27.910> thing

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
of the sphere is and also another thing

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.210 
of the sphere is and also another thing
is<00:05:28.390> that<00:05:28.420> the<00:05:28.630> camera<00:05:28.990> isn't<00:05:29.290> following<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:30.010> so

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
is that the camera isn't following it so

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.340 
is that the camera isn't following it so
I'm<00:05:30.310> going<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.520> teach<00:05:30.700> you<00:05:30.880> how<00:05:30.940> to<00:05:31.090> do<00:05:31.240> that<00:05:33.000> so

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
I'm going to teach you how to do that so

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.600 
I'm going to teach you how to do that so
you're<00:05:35.350> going<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.590> go<00:05:35.650> back<00:05:35.890> to<00:05:35.920> scene<00:05:36.340> view

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
you're going to go back to scene view

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.140 
you're going to go back to scene view
and<00:05:37.890> as<00:05:38.890> you<00:05:39.070> can<00:05:39.190> see<00:05:39.220> there's<00:05:39.640> this<00:05:39.850> main

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
and as you can see there's this main

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.500 
and as you can see there's this main
camera<00:05:40.570> right<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:42.400> camera<00:05:42.760> that<00:05:42.910> you<00:05:43.210> view

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
camera right the camera that you view

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.420 
camera right the camera that you view
through<00:05:43.840> so<00:05:44.440> you're<00:05:44.560> going<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:44.920> go<00:05:45.010> to<00:05:45.160> your

through so you're going to go to your

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.130 
through so you're going to go to your
project<00:05:45.970> and<00:05:46.090> you're<00:05:46.240> going<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.390> search<00:05:46.660> for<00:05:47.350> a

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
project and you're going to search for a

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.280 
project and you're going to search for a
another<00:05:50.140> script<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:51.010> comes<00:05:51.750> with<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.930> unity

another script that comes with the unity

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.080 
another script that comes with the unity
it's<00:05:53.470> called<00:05:53.740> smooth<00:05:54.250> follow<00:05:56.790> you're<00:05:57.790> going

it's called smooth follow you're going
to<00:05:58.240> drag<00:05:58.570> that<00:05:58.930> into<00:05:59.170> the<00:05:59.770> main<00:06:00.070> camera<00:06:00.990> and<00:06:02.790> it

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
to drag that into the main camera and it

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.420 
to drag that into the main camera and it
says<00:06:04.000> target<00:06:04.570> right<00:06:04.780> here<00:06:05.130> you're<00:06:06.130> going<00:06:06.310> to
