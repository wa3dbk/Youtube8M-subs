thought<00:00:21.050> what<00:00:21.980> is<00:00:22.220> a<00:00:22.250> plastic<00:00:23.050> if<00:00:24.050> we<00:00:24.230> zoom<00:00:24.500> in

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
thought what is a plastic if we zoom in

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.890 
thought what is a plastic if we zoom in
really<00:00:25.040> close<00:00:25.220> on<00:00:25.610> a<00:00:25.670> plastic<00:00:26.180> we<00:00:26.450> would<00:00:26.630> find

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
really close on a plastic we would find

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.480 
really close on a plastic we would find
that<00:00:27.200> it<00:00:27.320> looks<00:00:27.500> like<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:27.710> chain<00:00:28.100> of<00:00:28.340> small

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
stuff that makes the gas we use in our

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.410 
stuff that makes the gas we use in our
cars<00:00:54.040> well<00:00:55.040> how<00:00:55.190> long<00:00:55.460> does<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:55.820> take<00:00:56.120> all<00:00:56.360> of

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
cars well how long does it take all of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.650 
cars well how long does it take all of
this<00:00:56.720> plastic<00:00:57.020> we<00:00:57.410> use<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:58.309> break<00:00:58.520> down<00:00:58.820> it

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
this plastic we use to break down it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.600 
this plastic we use to break down it
takes<00:00:59.899> a<00:01:00.079> thousand<00:01:00.710> years<00:01:00.890> or<00:01:01.040> more<00:01:01.550> for

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
takes a thousand years or more for

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.520 
takes a thousand years or more for
plastic<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.390> break<00:01:02.600> down<00:01:02.809> when<00:01:03.050> we<00:01:03.200> throw<00:01:03.410> it

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
plastic to break down when we throw it

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.550 
plastic to break down when we throw it
away<00:01:04.210> what<00:01:05.210> if<00:01:05.299> we<00:01:05.479> could<00:01:05.659> engineer<00:01:05.960> new

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
away what if we could engineer new

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.969 
away what if we could engineer new
materials<00:01:07.159> that<00:01:07.369> could<00:01:07.759> break<00:01:07.999> down<00:01:08.030> easier

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
materials that could break down easier

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.219 
materials that could break down easier
well<00:01:09.979> fruits<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.490> vegetables<00:01:10.999> break<00:01:11.450> down<00:01:11.719> or

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
well fruits and vegetables break down or

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.289 
well fruits and vegetables break down or
rot<00:01:12.619> very<00:01:13.130> easily<00:01:13.399> when<00:01:13.789> they're<00:01:13.939> left<00:01:14.090> out

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
rot very easily when they're left out

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.779 
rot very easily when they're left out
over<00:01:14.659> time<00:01:14.899> in<00:01:15.139> fact<00:01:15.560> they<00:01:16.100> only<00:01:16.130> take<00:01:16.549> three

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
over time in fact they only take three

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.279 
over time in fact they only take three
to<00:01:16.909> four<00:01:17.090> weeks<00:01:17.359> to<00:01:17.539> break<00:01:17.749> down<00:01:17.899> when<00:01:18.139> they're

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
to four weeks to break down when they're

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.559 
to four weeks to break down when they're
thrown<00:01:18.530> away<00:01:18.709> what<00:01:19.700> if<00:01:19.880> we<00:01:20.060> could<00:01:20.329> make

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
thrown away what if we could make

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.980 
thrown away what if we could make
plastic<00:01:21.350> out<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.619> fruits<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.310> vegetables<00:01:22.990> so

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
plastic out of fruits and vegetables so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.080 
plastic out of fruits and vegetables so
today<00:01:24.319> we're<00:01:24.530> going<00:01:24.679> to<00:01:24.829> make<00:01:24.979> potato<00:01:25.219> plastic

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
today we're going to make potato plastic

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.539 
today we're going to make potato plastic
we're<00:01:26.990> going<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.289> make<00:01:27.469> it<00:01:27.619> in<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.829> lab<00:01:28.009> here

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
we're going to make it in the lab here

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.980 
we're going to make it in the lab here
but<00:01:28.819> these<00:01:28.909> are<00:01:28.969> all<00:01:29.209> ingredients<00:01:29.389> that<00:01:29.869> you

do this at home make sure you have an

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.639 
do this at home make sure you have an
adult<00:01:36.889> supervisor<00:01:37.539> this<00:01:38.539> is<00:01:38.719> our<00:01:38.869> starch<00:01:39.170> this

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
adult supervisor this is our starch this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.550 
adult supervisor this is our starch this
will<00:01:39.859> be<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:40.729> backbone<00:01:41.149> of<00:01:41.359> our<00:01:41.659> plastic<00:01:42.079> it

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
will be the backbone of our plastic it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.859 
will be the backbone of our plastic it
is<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:43.189> molecule<00:01:43.819> as<00:01:43.969> made<00:01:44.209> of<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.450> chain<00:01:44.689> or

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
is a molecule as made of the chain or

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.599 
is a molecule as made of the chain or
sugars<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.560> can<00:01:45.740> get<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:46.340> from

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
sugars and you can get this from

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.399 
sugars and you can get this from
potatoes<00:01:47.179> when<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:47.599> boil<00:01:47.840> them<00:01:48.109> it's<00:01:48.319> that

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
potatoes when you boil them it's that

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.529 
potatoes when you boil them it's that
milky<00:01:48.920> white<00:01:49.130> water<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:50.060> can<00:01:50.179> also<00:01:50.299> find

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
milky white water you can also find

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.980 
milky white water you can also find
starch<00:01:50.869> in<00:01:51.109> corn<00:01:51.139> rice<00:01:51.799> or<00:01:52.099> tapioca<00:01:52.990> we're

starch in corn rice or tapioca we're

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.599 
starch in corn rice or tapioca we're
going<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.259> use<00:01:54.409> water<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.770> mix<00:01:55.189> up<00:01:55.369> all<00:01:55.549> the

biodegradable<00:06:11.909> to<00:06:12.909> do<00:06:13.030> this<00:06:13.210> in<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.419> lab

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
biodegradable to do this in the lab

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.450 
biodegradable to do this in the lab
we'll<00:06:13.780> need<00:06:13.990> amylase<00:06:14.409> enzyme<00:06:14.590> which<00:06:15.310> will

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
we'll need amylase enzyme which will

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.010 
we'll need amylase enzyme which will
help<00:06:15.610> break<00:06:15.819> down<00:06:15.849> the<00:06:16.210> starch<00:06:16.449> into<00:06:16.719> simple

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
help break down the starch into simple

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.619 
help break down the starch into simple
sugars<00:06:17.310> this<00:06:18.310> is<00:06:18.490> actually<00:06:18.819> a<00:06:18.849> concentrated

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
sugars this is actually a concentrated

your<00:06:21.639> own<00:06:21.759> spit<00:06:22.270> add<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.469> amylase<00:06:23.830> enzyme<00:06:23.979> to

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
your own spit add the amylase enzyme to

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.420 
your own spit add the amylase enzyme to
water<00:06:26.340> give<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:27.550> mixture<00:06:27.699> a<00:06:27.879> stir<00:06:28.270> and

finally<00:06:30.430> add<00:06:30.580> the<00:06:30.759> potato<00:06:31.060> plastic<00:06:31.509> to<00:06:31.629> the

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
finally add the potato plastic to the

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.129 
finally add the potato plastic to the
mixture<00:06:32.939> we<00:06:33.939> left<00:06:34.180> the<00:06:34.330> sample<00:06:34.719> overnight

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
mixture we left the sample overnight

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.230 
mixture we left the sample overnight
along<00:06:35.860> with<00:06:36.009> a<00:06:36.039> control<00:06:36.460> sample<00:06:36.879> with<00:06:36.999> just

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
along with a control sample with just

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.719 
along with a control sample with just
water<00:06:37.419> the<00:06:38.080> control<00:06:38.469> is<00:06:38.650> there<00:06:38.889> to<00:06:39.279> see<00:06:39.490> if

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
water the control is there to see if

water the control is there to see if
water<00:06:39.939> alone<00:06:40.330> breaks<00:06:40.810> up<00:06:40.960> the<00:06:40.990> sample<00:06:41.469> notice

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
water alone breaks up the sample notice

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.360 
water alone breaks up the sample notice
how<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.639> plastic<00:06:43.180> in<00:06:43.330> the<00:06:43.419> amylase<00:06:43.840> breaks<00:06:43.870> up

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
how the plastic in the amylase breaks up

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:53.950 
how the plastic in the amylase breaks up
here<00:06:45.370> let's<00:06:45.639> take<00:06:45.789> a<00:06:45.819> closer<00:06:46.090> look

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.930 

this<00:06:54.530> is<00:06:54.710> what<00:06:54.889> our<00:06:54.919> plastic<00:06:55.490> looked<00:06:55.759> like

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
this is what our plastic looked like

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.020 
this is what our plastic looked like
before<00:06:56.300> we<00:06:56.630> biodegraded<00:06:57.470> them<00:06:57.620> and<00:06:57.860> this<00:06:58.850> is

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
before we biodegraded them and this is

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.999 
before we biodegraded them and this is
what<00:06:59.180> they<00:06:59.330> look<00:06:59.539> like<00:06:59.720> after<00:06:59.930> we<00:07:00.380> biodegraded

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009 
what they look like after we biodegraded

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.580 
what they look like after we biodegraded
them<00:07:01.160> again<00:07:02.150> notice<00:07:02.780> how<00:07:02.810> the<00:07:02.990> sample<00:07:03.470> that

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
them again notice how the sample that

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.620 
them again notice how the sample that
was<00:07:03.710> in<00:07:03.889> the<00:07:04.099> amylase<00:07:04.490> enzyme<00:07:04.520> broke<00:07:05.300> apart

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
was in the amylase enzyme broke apart

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.540 
was in the amylase enzyme broke apart
and<00:07:05.840> degraded<00:07:06.199> much<00:07:06.410> faster<00:07:06.979> than<00:07:07.280> the

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
and degraded much faster than the

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.180 
and degraded much faster than the
plastic<00:07:07.759> that<00:07:08.060> was<00:07:08.180> just<00:07:08.539> in<00:07:08.690> water<00:07:08.949> so<00:07:09.949> we've

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
plastic that was just in water so we've

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.800 
plastic that was just in water so we've
just<00:07:10.460> demonstrated<00:07:10.610> that<00:07:11.270> we<00:07:11.449> can<00:07:11.599> make<00:07:11.780> a

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
just demonstrated that we can make a

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.510 
just demonstrated that we can make a
plastic<00:07:12.289> that<00:07:12.440> degrades<00:07:12.889> in<00:07:13.099> a<00:07:13.220> matter<00:07:13.430> of

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
plastic that degrades in a matter of

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.629 
plastic that degrades in a matter of
days<00:07:13.880> as<00:07:14.210> opposed<00:07:14.780> to<00:07:14.870> thousands<00:07:15.470> of<00:07:15.620> years<00:07:15.949> so

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 
days as opposed to thousands of years so

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.309 
days as opposed to thousands of years so
with<00:07:16.789> a<00:07:16.819> little<00:07:17.150> bit<00:07:17.270> of<00:07:17.389> thought<00:07:17.569> it's

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 
with a little bit of thought it's

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.260 
with a little bit of thought it's
possible<00:07:18.830> for<00:07:19.039> us<00:07:19.099> to<00:07:19.250> engineer<00:07:19.580> better

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
possible for us to engineer better

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:29.080 
possible for us to engineer better
plastics<00:07:20.810> for<00:07:21.020> our<00:07:21.199> planet
