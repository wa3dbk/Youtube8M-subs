00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.280
 to the girls that such sizes but that 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.469
 I'm all very well and good between a 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.530
 video here to the natural you know why you 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.650
 I want to teach a homemade trick 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:24.010
 what is how to make your tabs to see 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.890
 this trick this homemade trick we're going to 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.770
 use when we go out when I 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.360
 be a special day or something not always 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:38.829
 ok then we're going to need the coffee 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.579
 Lacquer worth an eyelash curler this is 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:46.060
 thermally from the other normals and by 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.690
 your lucid ones worth powders 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.690
 translucent 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.329
 so first of all how you have not 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.159
 put to heat the curler first 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:03.450
 that I'm going to make bases on the index finger 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.489
 I'm going to take some lacquer vale 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.980
 and what I'm going to do is close the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.980
 eye and apply me like that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.430
 I will explain it to you 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.570
 OK 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.820
 and we hope some oil you have to 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.460
 be careful because he was trained in 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.870
 the eye and give it very carefully what 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.870
 disgust I say to the sticky eye 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.040
 then now with the curler 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.440
 lashes to make the eyelashes 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.440
 and I'll keep it there a little bit 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.300
 so what I give a little 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.830
 and what is governed by it? 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 and now with a little bit of powder 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.450
 translucent with a little bit this little bit 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.990
 we close the eye and apply it like this 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.400
 OK 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.400
 and it is we have 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.840
 it's worth when 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.969
 when makeup and others and nothing and then 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.689
 You throw the mascara as I usually do not 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:39.879
 I know if you notice the difference look and I 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.859
 does mascara season anyway 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.810
 now you do with a picture so nothing 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.659
 this is a trick to perform the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.049
 tabs with a new section that I'm going to 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.340
 open here on youtube and nothing I hope that 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.540
 you like it and see you in the next 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.540
 video I need
