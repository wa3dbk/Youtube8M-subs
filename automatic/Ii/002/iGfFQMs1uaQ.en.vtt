what<00:01:29.690> we<00:01:29.810> call<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.170> foundation<00:01:31.150> stamina<00:01:32.150> is

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
what we call the foundation stamina is

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.420 
what we call the foundation stamina is
when<00:01:32.540> we<00:01:32.690> begin<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.049> train<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.530> little<00:01:33.890> faster

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
when we begin to train a little faster

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.120 
when we begin to train a little faster
now<00:01:34.640> we're<00:01:35.509> teaching<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.960> body<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.770> go<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
now we're teaching the body to go the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.980 
now we're teaching the body to go the
distance<00:01:37.369> but<00:01:38.030> go<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.359> distance<00:01:38.780> more

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
distance but go the distance more

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.580 
distance but go the distance more
quickly<00:01:40.180> strength<00:01:41.180> is<00:01:41.390> built<00:01:41.719> in<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.020> gym

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
quickly strength is built in the gym

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.499 
quickly strength is built in the gym
as<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.100> saw<00:01:43.369> we<00:01:43.579> did<00:01:43.759> resistance<00:01:44.270> training

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
as you saw we did resistance training

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.510 
as you saw we did resistance training
with<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.960> weights<00:01:45.380> okay<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.159> builds

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
with the weights okay this builds

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.700 
with the weights okay this builds
muscular<00:01:47.030> strength<00:01:47.359> and<00:01:47.719> it<00:01:48.049> also<00:01:48.200> builds

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
muscular strength and it also builds

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.270 
muscular strength and it also builds
muscular<00:01:49.159> endurance<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.049> last<00:01:51.049> is<00:01:51.649> speed

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
muscular endurance and last is speed

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.300

okay<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.240> speed<00:01:53.689> is<00:01:54.020> done<00:01:54.380> by<00:01:55.009> running

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
okay and speed is done by running

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.959 
okay and speed is done by running
quickly

we run segments and we have a whole
segment<00:01:59.299> on<00:01:59.689> speed<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.499> we're<00:02:00.710> gonna<00:02:00.829> get<00:02:01.070> to

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
segment on speed so we're gonna get to

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.800 
segment on speed so we're gonna get to

stamina<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.020> done<00:02:42.650> by<00:02:43.540> developing<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
stamina is done by developing the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.720 
stamina is done by developing the
endurance<00:02:45.319> system<00:02:45.770> so<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.190> body<00:02:46.400> grows

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
endurance system so that the body grows

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.199 
endurance system so that the body grows
stronger<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.599> now<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.260> body<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:49.220> run<00:02:49.459> faster

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
stronger and now the body can run faster

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.930 
stronger and now the body can run faster
with<00:02:50.690> stamina<00:02:51.110> we<00:02:51.410> must<00:02:51.800> build<00:02:52.069> stamina<00:02:52.580> in

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
with stamina we must build stamina in

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.720 
with stamina we must build stamina in
order<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.989> improve<00:02:54.380> ok<00:02:54.950> stamina<00:02:55.520> is<00:02:55.700> a

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
order to improve ok stamina is a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.120 
order to improve ok stamina is a
component<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.380> aerobic<00:02:57.890> arena<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:59.390> other

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
component in the aerobic arena the other

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.840 
component in the aerobic arena the other
component<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.160> we're<00:03:01.340> talking<00:03:01.400> about<00:03:01.580> is

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
component that we're talking about is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.150 
component that we're talking about is
strength<00:03:02.300> strength<00:03:03.050> training<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.680> gym<00:03:03.920> as

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
strength strength training in the gym as

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.770 
strength strength training in the gym as
you<00:03:04.459> saw<00:03:04.760> we<00:03:04.970> did<00:03:05.120> resistance<00:03:05.630> training

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
you saw we did resistance training

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.570 
you saw we did resistance training
resistance<00:03:06.380> training<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.830> very<00:03:07.069> important

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
resistance training is very important

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.860 
resistance training is very important
number<00:03:08.060> one<00:03:08.209> we<00:03:08.810> want<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.700> keep<00:03:10.700> injuries<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.840> a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
number one we want to keep injuries to a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.009 
number one we want to keep injuries to a
minimum<00:03:12.349> sometimes<00:03:13.040> injuries<00:03:13.610> happen<00:03:14.360> but

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
minimum sometimes injuries happen but

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.280 
minimum sometimes injuries happen but
the<00:03:15.290> stronger<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.430> muscle<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.690> less<00:03:17.989> it

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
the stronger a muscle it is the less it

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.440 
the stronger a muscle it is the less it
is<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.950> fit<00:03:19.130> less<00:03:19.400> resistant<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.209> to

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
is to fit less resistant it is to

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.449 
is to fit less resistant it is to
fatigue<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:21.380> we<00:03:21.530> really<00:03:21.799> want<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.010> strengthen

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
fatigue so we really want to strengthen

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.360 
fatigue so we really want to strengthen
the<00:03:22.549> body<00:03:22.760> ok<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.450> very<00:03:23.840> important<00:03:24.370> principle

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
the body ok a very important principle

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.490 
the body ok a very important principle
is<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.120> strength<00:03:26.480> training<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:27.019> component

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
is the strength training that component

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.160 
is the strength training that component
we<00:03:28.040> really<00:03:28.370> want<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.670> do<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.360> other<00:03:29.510> component

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
we really want to do the other component

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.140 
we really want to do the other component
is<00:03:30.260> speed<00:03:30.739> if<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:31.459> want<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.730> improve<00:03:31.970> your

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
is speed if you want to improve your

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.900 
is speed if you want to improve your
time<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:33.019> have<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.650> train<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> little<00:03:34.430> faster

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
time you have to train a little faster

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.390 
time you have to train a little faster
so<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:35.269> do<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.630> speed<00:03:35.989> work<00:03:36.230> speed<00:03:37.010> work<00:03:37.220> is

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
so we do the speed work speed work is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.039 
so we do the speed work speed work is
good<00:03:37.580> for<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.850> body<00:03:37.970> but<00:03:38.150> we<00:03:38.420> have<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.750> keep<00:03:38.870> it

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
good for the body but we have to keep it

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.690 
good for the body but we have to keep it
to<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.170> minimum<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:39.769> we<00:03:39.799> don't<00:03:40.130> overtrain

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
to a minimum so we don't overtrain

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.479 
to a minimum so we don't overtrain
we<00:03:41.330> only<00:03:41.690> recommend<00:03:42.260> once<00:03:42.830> or<00:03:43.040> twice<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.310> week

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
we only recommend once or twice a week

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.390 
we only recommend once or twice a week

off a byproduct called lactic acid these

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.690 
off a byproduct called lactic acid these
runs<00:04:31.840> develop<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.050> kind<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.620> stamina<00:04:34.430> and

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
runs develop the kind of stamina and
