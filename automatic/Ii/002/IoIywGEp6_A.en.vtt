00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hey guys Carolina gamer here he's going

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:12.680 
hey guys Carolina gamer here he's going
to<00:00:03.030> show<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:05.060> what<00:00:06.060> we<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:11.360> as<00:00:12.360> you

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
to show you what we have going on as you

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.509 
to show you what we have going on as you
notice<00:00:12.990> there's<00:00:13.259> an<00:00:13.380> hdmi<00:00:13.530> console

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
notice there's an hdmi console

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.279 
notice there's an hdmi console
we've<00:00:15.089> got<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:16.850> LP<00:00:17.850> t<00:00:18.000> port<00:00:18.240> wired<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.640> the

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
we've got the LP t port wired up and the

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:30.780 
we've got the LP t port wired up and the
diodes<00:00:22.880> are<00:00:23.880> wired<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:25.970> jumper

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.240 

diode<00:00:32.650> this<00:00:33.650> is<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.280> know<00:00:34.570> Zephyr<00:00:36.040> it<00:00:37.040> also

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
diode this is you know Zephyr it also

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.220 
diode this is you know Zephyr it also
works<00:00:37.550> on<00:00:37.640> Falcons<00:00:38.150> this<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.660> exact<00:00:38.900> same<00:00:39.050> way

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
works on Falcons this is exact same way

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.530 
works on Falcons this is exact same way
for<00:00:39.410> Falcons<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:39.920> office<00:00:40.309> office<00:00:41.300> whatever

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
for Falcons and office office whatever

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.479 
for Falcons and office office whatever
you<00:00:41.870> call<00:00:42.080> it

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
you call it

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.830 
you call it
you'll<00:00:43.489> have<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.850> connect<00:00:44.360> up<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.540> here<00:00:44.750> you

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
you'll have to connect up to here you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.970 
you'll have to connect up to here you
can<00:00:44.989> actually<00:00:45.110> connect<00:00:45.470> on<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.650> bottom<00:00:45.890> of

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
can actually connect on the bottom of

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.080 
can actually connect on the bottom of
the<00:00:46.040> board<00:00:46.250> as<00:00:46.520> well<00:00:48.370> but<00:00:49.370> it's<00:00:49.640> got<00:00:49.790> all<00:00:49.879> the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
the board as well but it's got all the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.200 
the board as well but it's got all the
same<00:00:50.330> features<00:00:50.750> as<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:50.960> xenon<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.650> I<00:00:51.680> can<00:00:51.980> tell

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
same features as a xenon that I can tell

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.000 
same features as a xenon that I can tell
it<00:00:53.210> will<00:00:53.360> plug<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.840> our<00:00:54.110> USB<00:00:56.590> will<00:00:57.590> come<00:00:57.890> over

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
it will plug in our USB will come over

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.870 
it will plug in our USB will come over
here<00:00:58.100> to<00:00:58.250> our<00:00:58.280> controller<00:00:58.780> power<00:00:59.780> on<00:01:00.790> look<00:01:01.790> at

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
here to our controller power on look at

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.040 
here to our controller power on look at
the<00:01:02.000> flashing<00:01:02.420> light<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:04.600> then<00:01:05.600> that's<00:01:05.840> what

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
the flashing light and then that's what

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.900 
the flashing light and then that's what
I<00:01:06.140> want<00:01:06.910> then<00:01:07.910> we'll<00:01:08.090> come<00:01:08.240> up<00:01:08.270> here<00:01:09.880> yeah<00:01:10.880> I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
Zephyr now majority of all consoles can

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.930 
Zephyr now majority of all consoles can
be<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:46.470> know<00:02:46.580> able<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.640> run<00:02:47.820> Zell<00:02:48.120> Linux<00:02:49.940> and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
be you know able to run Zell Linux and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.810 
be you know able to run Zell Linux and
go<00:02:51.060> it's<00:02:51.209> still<00:02:51.450> going<00:02:52.640> but<00:02:53.640> yes<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:56.340> console

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
go it's still going but yes the console

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.470 
go it's still going but yes the console
and<00:02:57.390> again<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.410> zephyr<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.580> you<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.209> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and again this is a zephyr so you know I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.650 
and again this is a zephyr so you know I
have<00:03:01.230> some<00:03:01.440> better<00:03:01.680> pictures<00:03:02.660> installed

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
have some better pictures installed

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.970 
have some better pictures installed
pictures<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.700> later<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:06.980> everything

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
pictures of this later on everything

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.710 
pictures of this later on everything
else<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.340> same<00:03:08.400> way<00:03:08.760> LPT<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.480> doesn't

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
else is the same way LPT so it doesn't

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.880 
else is the same way LPT so it doesn't
send<00:03:09.810> me<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.050> play<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.410> right<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.800> the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
send me I play this right here is the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.130 
send me I play this right here is the
only<00:03:11.010> difference<00:03:11.750> there<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:12.959> go<00:03:13.080> to

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
only difference there just go to

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.060 
only difference there just go to
different<00:03:13.350> points<00:03:15.320> but<00:03:16.320> yeah<00:03:16.530> there<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.890> go
