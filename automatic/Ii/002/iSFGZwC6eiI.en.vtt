00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:08.144
- Nikki, darling, what
are we making today?

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:10.536
- Today we're making a coco-something.

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:12.324
(Skyy laughs)

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:16.085
- It's one of the most
popular drinks in Puerto Rico.

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:18.304
It's a Coquito, right?

00:00:18.304 --> 00:00:19.651
- [Nikki] Coquito!
- [Skyy] Exactly.

00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:21.857
Coquito, super Puerto Rican.

00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:25.038
For years, every winter, Puerto
Ricans send me this recipe,

00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:26.686
and I've never done it, okay?

00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:28.683
But finally, I've come around.

00:00:28.683 --> 00:00:30.239
I've listened to some Reggaeton,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.619
and it's time for us to
make a Coquito, let's do it.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:36.823
Evaporated milk, pour it in our pot.

00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:38.679
- Okay.

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:43.208
- Now you also hit that
with these beaten egg yolks.

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:45.159
- Oh, gross.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.923
- [Skyy] You feel like a chef?
- [Nikki] Yeah, I do.

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:49.338
♫ I'm a survivor
- That's Destiny's Child.

00:00:49.338 --> 00:00:51.707
♫ I'm a survivor I'm not gonna...♫

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:52.868
- Remember..

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:54.145
♫ Say my name say my name

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:55.932
♫ If no one is around you

00:00:55.932 --> 00:00:57.883
♫ Say baby I love you

00:00:57.883 --> 00:00:59.694
♫ If no one is around you

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:02.155
♫ Say baby I love you

00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:03.780
- Wow, you sound just like her.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.104
♫ If you ain't runnin' games

00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:07.658
♫ Say my name say my name ♫

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:09.908
- It's nice and thick.

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:15.249
Condensed milk, pour.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.727
Nice and thick.

00:01:16.727 --> 00:01:18.561
This is a super super sweet drink,

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:19.815
so just be aware of that.

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:22.367
Now we can hit that

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.109
with Cream of Coconut, okay?

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.316
So it's got...
- [Nikki] Dang.

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:27.895
Sweet milk and cream of coconut.

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:30.950
So throw in a half cup of water.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.527
And now we hit this...
- [Nikki] And now alcohol.

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:36.884
- With a half cup of white rum.

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:38.695
We can go a little heavier than half cup.

00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:40.367
We can go about a cup, okay?

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.198
'Cause this is America.
(Nikki laughs)

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:46.311
Teaspoon of vanilla extract, darling.

00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:48.344
- [Nikki] Okay...
- [Skyy] Perfect.

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:51.291
Quarter teaspoon of ground cloves.

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:56.516
And now we got a half
teaspoon of cinnamon.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:58.886
(Skyy laughs)

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.256
- [Nikki] Ghetto!

00:02:00.256 --> 00:02:02.880
(Nikki laughs)
- Yeah, that's about right.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.062
(Skyy laughs)

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:12.957
- [Nikki] We did add quite a bit of rum.

00:02:12.957 --> 00:02:14.814
Double the amount they asked for.

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:16.370
You're so artistic, Skyy.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.809
- I wish, I wish, I wish.

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.458
- You're like Martha Stewart.

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:20.572
- The black Martha Stewart.

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:22.500
Hit that with a little cinnamon stick

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.800
and a little dab of cinnamon.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.682
- Dang.

00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:26.609
- Just for beauty purposes, all right.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.119
And there you have it!

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.092
La Coquito!

00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:31.950
All right, now, naturally Puerto Ricans,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.527
I'm sure your grandmother
have her own special

00:02:34.527 --> 00:02:35.897
way of doing things, okay?

00:02:35.897 --> 00:02:37.861
This might be generic
compared to what you do,

00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:39.184
'cause you from there.

00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:40.438
But this recipe still works.

00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:41.204
Go ahead, Nikki.

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:44.571
- This is unique, also...

00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.057
- Go ahead, tell me what you taste.

00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:47.495
- Okay.

00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:52.280
First of all, it's very thick.
- Uh-huh.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.091
- It's like, it's like...

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.365
Very foamy, not like
too thick, but like...

00:02:57.365 --> 00:02:59.477
It's a thick drink, it's a thick drink.

00:02:59.477 --> 00:03:00.615
It's like foam.

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.022
It's good, it tastes like warm...

00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:03.554
You know, when you used
to have a tummy ache,

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:05.203
and your mom would make
you warm milk and honey?

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:06.549
- Uh-huh.
- It tastes like that with

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.707
cinnamon and spices.

00:03:09.707 --> 00:03:12.075
- 'Cause cream of coconut is a winner,

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.520
whatever you put that in,
and that's a whole can,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.746
so this is really really
really really good.

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:19.370
- Dang, dude, it's really good.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.247
(speaks Spanish)

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:29.793
- Okay, hola.
(both laugh)

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:33.626
- Like you can really taste
the Christmas spice, man.

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:34.996
It tastes like Santa Claus!

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:36.389
- It tastes like Christmas spirit.

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.408
- Seriously, if you've ever
nibbled on Santa Claus's ears,

00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:40.406
that's what it tastes like.

00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:41.729
- Don't, we don't need to know

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.390
what you got into when you were a child.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.876
- By the way, you know
most of the mall Santas

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.571
are pedophiles, right?

00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:49.498
- Yeah.
(Skyy laughs)

00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:50.821
- That's not true, I'm kidding.

00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:53.283
'Cause one of your dad's
probably a mall Santa.

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:56.185
- (laughs) "One of your
dad's probably a mall Santa."

00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:57.183
- He's the exception.

00:03:57.183 --> 00:04:00.573
- Does trannies count? (laughs)

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.709
- You know what, I don't
know why I ask you stuff,

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.637
because it always goes into some

00:04:04.637 --> 00:04:06.401
weird frickin' region.

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.722
Nikki, darling, what are we making today?

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:11.045
- The Killer Puddytat.

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:12.136
- [Skyy] Exactly, it ain't "Puddytat".

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:14.133
Cherry vodka, citrus vodka, pour!

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.920
- Well, we could always use...
- Stop, stop!

00:04:18.104 --> 00:04:20.044
(screams orgasmically)

00:04:20.044 --> 00:04:22.320
Okay, that's enough, that's
enough, is that too sexy?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.317
Oh, Skyy, you're so big, you're so huge!

00:04:25.317 --> 00:04:27.511
- There's a difference
between guys saying it

00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:29.925
and guys being like, "Oh my god.

00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:31.859
"I want you to move in with me."
