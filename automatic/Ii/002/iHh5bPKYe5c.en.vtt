put the lid on as tight as it will go

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.190 
put the lid on as tight as it will go
you<00:01:05.970> don't<00:01:06.150> want<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.390> make<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> mess<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.870> make

you don't want to make a mess and make
your<00:01:07.380> monk<00:01:07.560> cross<00:01:08.900> tilt<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> bottle<00:01:10.290> from

your monk cross tilt the bottle from

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.940 
your monk cross tilt the bottle from
side<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.800> side<00:01:11.180> watch<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:13.200> water<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:13.650> all<00:01:13.740> do

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
side to side watch the water and all do

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
side to side watch the water and all do
not<00:01:14.070> mix<00:01:14.250> together<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.150> instead<00:01:15.480> they<00:01:15.660> form

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
not mix together but instead they form

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.470 
not mix together but instead they form
layers<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:17.280> oil<00:01:17.430> floats<00:01:17.730> on<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:17.940> water<00:01:18.030> which

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
layers the oil floats on the water which

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.350 
layers the oil floats on the water which
makes<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.870> move<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> wave<00:01:20.060> step<00:01:21.060> four

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
makes it move like a wave step four

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.800 
makes it move like a wave step four
conclusion<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.100> why<00:01:23.250> did<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.610> happen<00:01:24.000> oil

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
conclusion so why did this happen oil

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
conclusion so why did this happen oil
sits<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.290> top<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.500> water<00:01:25.800> because<00:01:26.190> oil<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.490> less

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
sits on top of water because oil is less

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.000 
sits on top of water because oil is less
dense<00:01:26.940> but<00:01:27.930> some<00:01:28.110> liquids<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.650> different

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
dense but some liquids with different

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.250 
dense but some liquids with different
densities<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.460> mix<00:01:29.850> together<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.960> why<00:01:31.110> not

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
densities can mix together so why not

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.650 
densities can mix together so why not
these<00:01:31.440> two<00:01:31.850> for<00:01:32.850> liquids<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.330> mix<00:01:33.510> together

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
these two for liquids to mix together

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.480 
these two for liquids to mix together
their<00:01:34.020> molecules<00:01:34.500> need<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> make<00:01:35.010> new<00:01:35.160> bonds

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
their molecules need to make new bonds

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.640 
their molecules need to make new bonds
with<00:01:35.610> each<00:01:35.670> other<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.810> oil<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.110> water<00:01:37.229> cannot

with each other the oil and water cannot
mix<00:01:37.860> together<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:38.700> water<00:01:38.940> molecules

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
mix together because water molecules

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
mix together because water molecules

are of a different polarity to the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
strong enough to break the waters

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.820 
strong enough to break the waters
hydrogen<00:01:50.910> bonds<00:01:51.300> so<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.380> water<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> oil
