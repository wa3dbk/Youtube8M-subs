00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.330
 well here pts look what else 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.660
 fun I find myself in the box a 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.660
 second 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.560
 in the first time that I get to throw a 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.960
 number or return I leave the box 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.450
 because I have something super cool that 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.360
 show you the nokia lumia 925 I could already 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.220
 try in london and I made a video by 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.290
 course but now I have it over 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.220
 from my unboxing table good call table 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.440
 this the truth is that it is quite 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.490
 optimistic but it does not matter the box in the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.740
 I open the boxes 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.250
 and bad things, well, this is the box 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.480
 of the Nokia Lumia 925 ahead we already see 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.480
 more or less how will it be 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.200
 from the sides we see what the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 smartphone and in the back we 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.120
 we found a series of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.949
 Specifications 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.470
 we have for example that is technology 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.590
 from the camera 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.970
 the connectors that have signature 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.890
 good postcard and that the packaging is 100% 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.890
 recycled but let's open it 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.000
 we are here and already 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.390
 we have the lumia 925 that I'm going to leave 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.190
 here 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.310
 and so let's see what else in the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.080
 Well, here we have the pinchito for 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.120
 take out the microsim card 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.700
 but I'm going to need a pinchito to 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.960
 take out the pinchito here 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.960
 is this 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.640
 if we remove the top part 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.140
 we are then with the box where 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.740
 we have the welcome paper 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.570
 how to use it et cetera everything 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.870
 classic that there are more things we have in the 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.870
 box 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.300
 because the usb cable micro usb another classic 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.640
 we have also 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.500
 the charger 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.140
 to the power grid that has a 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.610
 prestige here and here the cable would go 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.450
 I just gave you a signal to be able to 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.490
 reload it finally we have here the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.819
 headphones that are white so that 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.100
 go with the terminal are they have 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.380
 here then the different adapters for 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:34.850
 can put it with your ear size and 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.600
 around here the white headphones 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.090
 sparkly 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.030
 with a pretty original shape and hands 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.060
 free are comfortable 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.200
 and in the box, there is nothing left 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.200
 I take the box 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.380
 and here we have the terminal that I'm going 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.180
 to remove the plastic 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.180
 so as not to lose anything 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.910
 and here we have the nokia lumia 925 which is 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.190
 very different because that first lumia 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.360
 that to begin with has aluminum already 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.560
 you know that to date they were 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.510
 polycarbonate that made it very 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.320
 resistant but this time they have 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.350
 Dear 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.880
 put this aluminum edge that the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.500
 it's true that it looks much better 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.790
 than the previous ones within the design 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.530
 besides putting this aluminum frame 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.020
 they have thinned it as they have thinned it 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.390
 because now it weighs 139 grams 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.360
 forty-something grams less than the 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.490
 Lumia 920 what you notice but a lot 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.840
 much much that they have had to 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.440
 sacrifice because they have had to 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.510
 sacrifice the wireless recharge 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.070
 integrated now you can continue using 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.870
 the wireless charging but for that 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.610
 you will have to use a series of 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.250
 Cases that you have to buy separately 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.230
 in those cases is where you're going to 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.260
 find the colors if you like the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.090
 colorines yellow or red and so on 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.890
 because this terminal is only going to be in 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.750
 white in black in gray that is the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.800
 super classic colors that you can then 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.380
 combine with the housings 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.010
 wireless recharge here we have 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.330
 pins by where and as would overload 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.040
 you see also you can not remove the lid 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.750
 with which we can not extract the 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.510
 battery in the bottom we have the 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.730
 speaker the speaker has here two 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.460
 small projections that make when 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.100
 you put the speaker on the table 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.310
 do not get covered and the table can make a 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.080
 little bit of resonance box this in 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.520
 the theory is very cool and the truth is 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.500
 that works better than other terminals 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.110
 that has the speaker below but the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.610
 practice is not that that sounds 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.050
 infinitely more the truth is that 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.780
 it would emulate much more than the loudspeaker 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.230
 was in the front but the 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.330
 truth is that design I think it is 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.790
 a very nice terminal if we look at it 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.380
 the lateral ones we do not find you with the 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.580
 mini connection there with the connection 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.100
 microusb with the slot for cards 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.420
 microsim and on this side we have the 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.640
 volume control the power button 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.800
 off and a dedicated button for the 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.840
 camera that is quite comfortable for 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.750
 inside of course operating system 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.490
 windows phone 8 the camera with respect 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.509
 to line 920 amia 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:22.139
 and now spears view 2 with carl optics 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:25.440
 zeiss and with an 87-megapixel sensor 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.780
 dual flash led and if we have behind 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.319
 the polycarbonate finish on the front 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.990
 we have the glass that protects our 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:38.340
 4.5 inch screen and 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.319
 resolution of 1280 x 768 pixels very 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.990
 bright colorful but lift up for 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:45.030
 show you what we better leave it 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.970
 for the videogram this has been the 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.970
 unboxing of the lumia to 925 to 10 pts
