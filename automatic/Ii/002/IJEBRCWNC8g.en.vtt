hey<00:00:00.240> viewers<00:00:00.410> tonight<00:00:01.410> I'm<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.920> talk

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hey viewers tonight I'm going to talk

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.420 
hey viewers tonight I'm going to talk
about<00:00:02.100> and<00:00:02.669> show<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.090> how<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.360> install<00:00:03.810> a

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
about and show you how to install a

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.099 
about and show you how to install a
problem-solvers<00:00:05.430> travel<00:00:06.000> agent

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
problem-solvers travel agent

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.000 
problem-solvers travel agent
what<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.099> travel<00:00:08.820> agent<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.300> used<00:00:09.630> for<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.260> to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
what a travel agent is used for is to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.220 
what a travel agent is used for is to
increase<00:00:11.550> cable<00:00:12.059> pull<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.750> allows<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
increase cable pull so it allows you to

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.939 
increase cable pull so it allows you to
use<00:00:13.440> brake<00:00:14.400> levers<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:16.529> designed<00:00:16.890> for

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
use brake levers that are designed for

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.210 
use brake levers that are designed for
like<00:00:17.160> short<00:00:17.430> pole<00:00:17.699> type<00:00:17.970> breaks<00:00:18.859> such<00:00:19.859> as<00:00:20.039> like

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
like short pole type breaks such as like

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.009 
like short pole type breaks such as like
road<00:00:20.850> breaks<00:00:21.240> or<00:00:22.160> cantilever<00:00:23.160> brakes<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
road breaks or cantilever brakes and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.359 
road breaks or cantilever brakes and
allows<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> use<00:00:25.439> those<00:00:25.800> short<00:00:26.220> pole

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
allows you to use those short pole

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.290 
allows you to use those short pole
levers<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:27.390> long<00:00:27.869> pole<00:00:28.170> breaks<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:29.490> V

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
levers with long pole breaks like V

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.630 
levers with long pole breaks like V
brakes<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.990> disc<00:00:31.289> brakes<00:00:31.529> which<00:00:31.859> require

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
brakes or disc brakes which require

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.450 
brakes or disc brakes which require
about<00:00:33.510> twice<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.079> much<00:00:34.230> cable<00:00:34.530> pull<00:00:34.890> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
about twice as much cable pull to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.360 
about twice as much cable pull to
operate<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.260> does<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.829> this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
operate and so what this does is this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.139 
operate and so what this does is this
increases<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> cable<00:00:39.809> pull<00:00:40.079> by<00:00:40.980> using<00:00:41.340> two

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
increases the cable pull by using two

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
increases the cable pull by using two
sizes<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.600> pulleys<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> cable<00:00:44.100> kind<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
sizes of pulleys so the cable kind of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.880 
sizes of pulleys so the cable kind of
comes<00:00:44.610> down<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:45.180> through<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.809> around<00:00:46.710> this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
comes down in through here around this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
comes down in through here around this
little<00:00:47.129> pulley<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.670> through<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> slot<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
little pulley up through the slot and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.360 
little pulley up through the slot and
then<00:00:48.899> around<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> big<00:00:49.350> pulley<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> cable

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
then around the big pulley so the cable

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.660 
then around the big pulley so the cable
pulls<00:00:50.690> around<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:52.020> pulley<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.670> so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
pulls around this little pulley and so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
pulls around this little pulley and so
it<00:00:54.480> pulls<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.170> bit<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.320> cable<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it pulls just a little bit of cable and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.010 
it pulls just a little bit of cable and
which<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:56.850> goes<00:00:57.000> around<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.570> around<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
which then goes around here around the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
which then goes around here around the
big<00:00:58.140> pulley<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> pulls<00:00:59.160> nearly<00:00:59.850> twice<00:01:00.239> as

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
big pulley and pulls nearly twice as

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.429 
big pulley and pulls nearly twice as
much<00:01:00.980> cable<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.550> around<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.510> around<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
much cable from around here around the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.890 
much cable from around here around the
big<00:01:04.559> pulley<00:01:04.909> this<00:01:05.909> could<00:01:06.060> also<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.659> used

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
big pulley this could also be just used

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
big pulley this could also be just used
as<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> simple<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.650> pulley<00:01:08.030> like<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
as a simple little pulley like if the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760 
as a simple little pulley like if the
cable<00:01:09.540> comes<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.840> through<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.650> goes

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
cable comes in through here it just goes

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
cable comes in through here it just goes
around<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.479> doesn't<00:01:12.720> increase<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
around here and then doesn't increase it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
around here and then doesn't increase it
all<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.560> allows<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.640> smoother

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
all but allows it like smoother

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.039 
all but allows it like smoother
operation<00:01:15.810> around<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> tight<00:01:17.009> Bend<00:01:17.479> than<00:01:18.479> say<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
operation around a tight Bend than say a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.039 
operation around a tight Bend than say a
noodle<00:01:19.470> would<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.150> v-brakes<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
noodle would and like on v-brakes this

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.910 
noodle would and like on v-brakes this
basically<00:01:22.320> replaces<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.700> noodle<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
basically replaces the noodle so what I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.469 
basically replaces the noodle so what I
would<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.130> doing<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.460> installing<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.360> my

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
would be doing is installing this on my

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.380 
would be doing is installing this on my
mountain<00:01:27.810> bike<00:01:28.220> where<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.549> B<00:01:29.759> brakes<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
mountain bike where I have B brakes and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.080 
mountain bike where I have B brakes and
the<00:01:31.380> brake<00:01:31.530> lever<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.070> designed<00:01:32.640> for

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the brake lever is designed for

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.569 
the brake lever is designed for
cantilever<00:01:33.750> brakes<00:01:34.220> okay<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.280> here's<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
cantilever brakes okay so here's the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.240 
cantilever brakes okay so here's the
bike<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.060> was<00:01:36.299> working<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.009> installed<00:01:38.009> B

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
bike I was working on I installed B

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.880 
bike I was working on I installed B
brakes<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> brake<00:01:40.229> lever<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
brakes on here but the brake lever is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
brakes on here but the brake lever is
designed<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.880> cantilever<00:01:42.450> brakes<00:01:42.720> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
designed for cantilever brakes so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
designed for cantilever brakes so
there's<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> short<00:01:43.320> pull<00:01:43.500> lever<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.100> these<00:01:44.490> are

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
there's a short pull lever and these are

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940 
there's a short pull lever and these are
long<00:01:44.790> pull<00:01:45.030> brakes<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.740> go<00:01:46.860> ahead

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
long pull brakes so like as I go ahead

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.830 
long pull brakes so like as I go ahead
and<00:01:47.310> pull<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> brake<00:01:47.909> lever<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.450> actually<00:01:48.750> in

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and pull the brake lever it actually in

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.170 
and pull the brake lever it actually in
kind<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> engages<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> rim<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:50.579> but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
kind of engages the rim right there but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.359 
kind of engages the rim right there but
I<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.420> pull<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> it'll<00:01:52.680> go<00:01:52.829> back<00:01:53.070> all

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I can pull this and it'll go back all

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.520 
I can pull this and it'll go back all
the<00:01:53.549> way<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> lever<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.380> just

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the way to lever like that it's just

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.149 
the way to lever like that it's just
because<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.719> can't<00:01:57.719> quite<00:01:58.140> pull<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.829> much

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
because this can't quite pull as much

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.440 
because this can't quite pull as much
cable<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.960> these<00:02:00.960> brakes<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.270> going

all<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.230> way<00:04:07.319> through<00:04:07.650> here

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.150 

like<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.560> again

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
like that again

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.969 
like that again
pull<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.669> cable<00:04:17.880> make<00:04:18.299> sure<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.660> that

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
pull the cable make sure that that

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.020 
pull the cable make sure that that
little<00:04:19.979> hole<00:04:20.280> there<00:04:20.489> stays<00:04:20.699> in<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.910> right

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
little hole there stays in the right

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.180 
little hole there stays in the right
position<00:04:21.449> and<00:04:21.600> it's<00:04:22.019> looking<00:04:22.260> good<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:23.070> now

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
position and it's looking good so now

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.320 
position and it's looking good so now
I'm<00:04:23.220> going<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> do<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.699> go<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.970> bottom<00:04:24.120> of

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
I'm going to do is go to the bottom of

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.900 
I'm going to do is go to the bottom of
pulley<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.870> I'm<00:04:25.199> going<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.380> take<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.340> cable

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
pulley and I'm going to take the cable

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.409 
pulley and I'm going to take the cable
and<00:04:27.030> slide<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.539> through<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> bottom<00:04:28.080> here<00:04:31.070> and

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
and slide it through the bottom here and

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.490 
and slide it through the bottom here and
out<00:04:33.419> through<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.750> hole<00:04:34.110> OOP<00:04:36.229> out<00:04:37.229> through<00:04:37.410> the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
out through the hole OOP out through the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.680 
out through the hole OOP out through the
hole<00:04:37.740> here<00:04:39.560> like<00:04:40.560> this<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.389> now<00:04:42.539> I<00:04:42.600> have

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
hole here like this and so now I have

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.680 
hole here like this and so now I have
this<00:04:42.930> all<00:04:43.250> routed<00:04:44.250> through<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.520> travel<00:04:45.300> agent

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
this all routed through the travel agent

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.659 
this all routed through the travel agent
there<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.139> I'm<00:04:46.860> going<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.010> install<00:04:47.400> the

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
there and I'm going to install the

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.850 
there and I'm going to install the
travel<00:04:48.000> agent<00:04:48.300> basically<00:04:49.229> where<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.560> noodle

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
travel agent basically where the noodle

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.490 
travel agent basically where the noodle
would<00:04:50.039> go<00:04:50.220> so<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.030> sits<00:04:51.750> right<00:04:52.020> there<00:04:52.080> like

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
would go so it sits right there like

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.560 
would go so it sits right there like
that<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:53.010> can<00:04:53.100> kind<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.250> pull<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.850> cable

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
that so I can kind of pull the cable

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.960 
that so I can kind of pull the cable
tight<00:04:54.810> there<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:56.070> notice<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.520> position

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
tight there and so notice the position

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.659 
tight there and so notice the position
of<00:04:57.060> where<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.360> cable<00:04:57.720> is<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:58.260> hole<00:04:58.500> there<00:04:58.740> so

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
of where the cable is that hole there so

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.939 
of where the cable is that hole there so
now<00:04:59.850> I<00:05:01.280> can<00:05:02.280> slide<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.610> cable<00:05:02.789> out<00:05:03.150> through

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
now I can slide the cable out through

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:11.150 
now I can slide the cable out through
the<00:05:04.949> cable<00:05:05.310> clamp<00:05:05.520> on<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.970> B<00:05:06.090> break<00:05:06.300> here<00:05:10.160> I'm

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
the cable clamp on the B break here I'm

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.390 
the cable clamp on the B break here I'm
going<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:12.139> tentatively<00:05:13.139> adjust<00:05:13.710> this<00:05:13.919> here

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
going to tentatively adjust this here

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.939 
going to tentatively adjust this here
and<00:05:14.610> see<00:05:15.570> how<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:16.020> feels<00:05:18.440> like<00:05:19.440> that<00:05:19.650> and

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
and see how it feels like that and

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.230 
and see how it feels like that and
actually<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.220> think<00:05:20.250> I<00:05:20.430> maybe<00:05:20.639> wanted<00:05:20.940> just<00:05:21.150> a

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
actually I think I maybe wanted just a

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:28.520 
actually I think I maybe wanted just a
hair<00:05:21.479> tighter<00:05:26.389> just<00:05:27.389> a<00:05:27.599> little<00:05:27.840> bit<00:05:28.020> right

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
hair tighter just a little bit right

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.000 
hair tighter just a little bit right
there<00:05:28.910> see<00:05:29.910> how<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.180> feels<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:31.830> feels

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
there see how that feels and that feels

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.230 
there see how that feels and that feels
pretty<00:05:32.190> good<00:05:32.460> though<00:05:32.610> I<00:05:32.639> think<00:05:32.760> I<00:05:32.910> might<00:05:33.060> want

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
pretty good though I think I might want

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.640 
pretty good though I think I might want
to<00:05:33.270> tight<00:05:33.419> a<00:05:33.449> little<00:05:33.570> bit<00:05:33.750> more<00:05:33.930> but<00:05:34.050> I<00:05:34.110> can<00:05:34.229> do

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
to tight a little bit more but I can do

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.950 
to tight a little bit more but I can do
that<00:05:34.800> at<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.010> barrel<00:05:35.280> adjuster<00:05:35.370> at<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.720> brake

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
that at the barrel adjuster at the brake

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.029 
that at the barrel adjuster at the brake
lever<00:05:37.199> so<00:05:37.380> I'm<00:05:37.440> going<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> tighten<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:37.860> down

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:51.490 

cut<00:05:44.039> the<00:05:44.160> cable<00:05:48.349> put<00:05:49.349> a<00:05:49.380> crimp<00:05:49.620> end<00:05:49.860> on<00:05:50.099> and

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
cut the cable put a crimp end on and

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.020 
cut the cable put a crimp end on and
then<00:05:52.500> tuck<00:05:52.740> this<00:05:52.919> back<00:05:53.190> behind<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.990> brake

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
then tuck this back behind the brake

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.000 
then tuck this back behind the brake
like<00:05:57.030> that<00:05:59.240> that<00:06:00.240> works<00:06:00.389> pretty<00:06:00.510> good

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
like that that works pretty good

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.439 
like that that works pretty good
it's<00:06:02.010> like<00:06:02.250> pull<00:06:02.490> this<00:06:02.699> and<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.090> goes<00:06:03.210> back<00:06:03.389> a

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
it's like pull this and it goes back a

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.000 
it's like pull this and it goes back a
little<00:06:03.630> bit<00:06:03.780> farther<00:06:04.020> I<00:06:04.169> want<00:06:04.530> but<00:06:04.740> what<00:06:04.860> I<00:06:04.889> can

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
little bit farther I want but what I can

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.680 
little bit farther I want but what I can
do<00:06:05.070> is<00:06:05.220> I<00:06:05.310> can<00:06:05.370> fine-tune<00:06:05.669> it<00:06:06.090> using<00:06:06.479> the

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
do is I can fine-tune it using the

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.990 
do is I can fine-tune it using the
barrel<00:06:07.020> adjuster<00:06:07.169> on<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:08.159> brake<00:06:08.340> lever<00:06:08.639> so<00:06:08.940> I

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
barrel adjuster on the brake lever so I

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.710 
barrel adjuster on the brake lever so I
can<00:06:09.120> turn<00:06:09.270> that<00:06:09.419> out<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:11.270> since<00:06:12.270> this<00:06:12.419> kind<00:06:12.659> of

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
can turn that out and since this kind of

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.290 
can turn that out and since this kind of
doubles<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.169> cable<00:06:13.500> pull<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:14.030> little<00:06:15.030> bit<00:06:15.210> of

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
doubles the cable pull a little bit of

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.890 
doubles the cable pull a little bit of
adjustment<00:06:15.840> here<00:06:16.349> is<00:06:16.500> doubled<00:06:17.430> down<00:06:17.849> here<00:06:18.479> so

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
adjustment here is doubled down here so

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.629 
adjustment here is doubled down here so
I<00:06:18.960> can<00:06:19.110> test<00:06:19.530> that<00:06:19.710> turn<00:06:20.190> this<00:06:20.310> out<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:20.520> little

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
I can test that turn this out a little

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.550 
I can test that turn this out a little
bit<00:06:20.880> and<00:06:21.450> get<00:06:21.599> it<00:06:21.630> to<00:06:21.780> where<00:06:21.870> I<00:06:21.930> want<00:06:22.020> it<00:06:22.289> to<00:06:22.349> be

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
bit and get it to where I want it to be

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.650 
bit and get it to where I want it to be
and<00:06:22.830> then<00:06:23.580> tighten<00:06:23.940> down<00:06:24.000> this<00:06:24.330> little

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
and then tighten down this little

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.530 
and then tighten down this little
locked<00:06:25.130> here<00:06:26.130> so<00:06:27.060> that<00:06:27.210> stays<00:06:27.450> right<00:06:27.660> there

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
locked here so that stays right there

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.690 
locked here so that stays right there
and<00:06:30.540> that<00:06:30.660> works<00:06:30.810> pretty<00:06:30.840> well<00:06:31.340> so<00:06:32.340> anyway

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
and that works pretty well so anyway

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.810 
and that works pretty well so anyway
that<00:06:33.420> is<00:06:33.450> how<00:06:33.690> to<00:06:33.900> install<00:06:34.410> a<00:06:34.860> problem-solvers

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
that is how to install a problem-solvers
