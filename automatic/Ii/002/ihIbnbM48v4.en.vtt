00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
will be more liquid and less thick and

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
will be more liquid and less thick and
easier<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:54.270> take<00:02:55.270> out<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.810> all<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.140> in

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
prevents the sugar from becoming too

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.080 
prevents the sugar from becoming too
cloying<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.900> that's<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.740> that's<00:03:23.920> our<00:03:24.310> mixing

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090

to stir pattern harder to get it to
dissolve<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.760> want<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.060> taste<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.570> be

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
dissolve and you want to taste it to be

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.270 
dissolve and you want to taste it to be
a<00:04:08.690> little<00:04:08.900> too<00:04:09.110> dark<00:04:09.320> a<00:04:09.440> little<00:04:09.650> too<00:04:09.800> sweet<00:04:10.010> at

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
a little too dark a little too sweet at

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.910 
a little too dark a little too sweet at
this<00:04:10.459> point<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:11.570> that<00:04:11.840> once<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.260> gets<00:04:12.500> poured

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
this point so that once it gets poured

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.210 
this point so that once it gets poured
onto<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.310> ice<00:04:13.490> it<00:04:13.820> gets<00:04:14.030> diluted<00:04:14.770> it's<00:04:15.770> going

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
onto the ice it gets diluted it's going

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.600 
onto the ice it gets diluted it's going
to<00:04:16.430> be<00:04:17.739> perfect<00:04:18.739> okay<00:04:22.330> let's<00:04:23.330> get<00:04:23.420> rice<00:04:23.660> and

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
to be perfect okay let's get rice and

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.490 
to be perfect okay let's get rice and
now<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:26.510> what<00:04:26.630> I'm<00:04:26.720> going<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:26.930> do<00:04:27.080> is<00:04:27.320> I'm<00:04:27.410> going

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
now so what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.270 
now so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:04:27.560> transfer<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.190> back<00:04:28.220> into<00:04:28.790> my<00:04:29.350> jug<00:04:30.350> here

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.960 

because<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.460> easier<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.030> pour

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.420

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
you want a full foot full of ice because

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.940

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
this is warm so it's going to melt it

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.400 
this is warm so it's going to melt it
quite<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.310> bit
