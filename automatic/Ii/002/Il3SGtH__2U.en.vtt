basic<00:00:01.170> shapes<00:00:02.959> all<00:00:03.959> right<00:00:04.200> notice<00:00:04.529> snaps<00:00:04.799> on

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
basic shapes all right notice snaps on

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.740 
basic shapes all right notice snaps on
and<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.609> could<00:00:05.759> snap<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.210> new<00:00:06.480> piece<00:00:06.720> of

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
and I could snap this new piece of

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.780 
and I could snap this new piece of
geometry<00:00:07.140> in<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.919> center<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.309> world<00:00:08.460> I'll

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
geometry in the center of the world I'll

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.129 
geometry in the center of the world I'll
probably<00:00:08.940> leave<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.389> on<00:00:09.420> for<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.809> little<00:00:09.960> bit

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
probably leave that on for a little bit

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.209 
probably leave that on for a little bit
as<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:11.070> mess<00:00:12.059> around<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.889> basic<00:00:13.889> shapes

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
as I mess around with the basic shapes

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.490 
as I mess around with the basic shapes
of<00:00:14.460> blender<00:00:16.970> all<00:00:17.970> right<00:00:18.119> box<00:00:18.510> modeling<00:00:19.050> very

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
of blender all right box modeling very

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.840 
of blender all right box modeling very
important<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.160> know<00:00:20.460> your<00:00:20.670> basic

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
important that you know your basic

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.179 
important that you know your basic
shapes<00:00:21.330> okay<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> we'll<00:00:22.710> go<00:00:22.859> through<00:00:22.890> each

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
shapes okay and we'll go through each

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.370 
shapes okay and we'll go through each
and<00:00:23.490> every<00:00:23.730> shape<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.240> feel<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.779> deem

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and every shape that I feel or deem

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.070 
and every shape that I feel or deem
important<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> I'll<00:00:27.210> show<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.480> why<00:00:27.810> they're

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
important and I'll show you why they're

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.019 
important and I'll show you why they're
important<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:29.130> start<00:00:29.400> joining<00:00:29.699> them

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
important as we start joining them

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.530 
important as we start joining them
together<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.660> form<00:00:31.109> other<00:00:31.500> shapes<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.540> it's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
together to form other shapes and it's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.889 
together to form other shapes and it's
all<00:00:33.870> about<00:00:34.140> shape<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:35.480> how<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
all about shape really how do you get a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.160 
all about shape really how do you get a
shape<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.829> cube<00:00:38.329> into<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> different

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
shape out of a cube into a different

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.049 
shape out of a cube into a different
kind<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> shape<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.950> when<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.640> build<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
kind of shape so when you do build a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.500 
kind of shape so when you do build a
mesh<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.960> very<00:00:43.200> easy<00:00:43.760> let's<00:00:44.760> say<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.270> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
mesh it's very easy let's say if I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.319 
mesh it's very easy let's say if I
wanted<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> connect<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.260> sphere<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> box

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
wanted to connect the sphere to a box

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.709 
wanted to connect the sphere to a box
you<00:00:48.329> know<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> let's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
you know how do you do that so let's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.189 
you know how do you do that so let's
look<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.050> basic<00:00:52.260> shapes<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.780> first

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
look at the basic shapes first the first

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.950 
look at the basic shapes first the first
basic<00:00:55.710> shape<00:00:55.890> we're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> look<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
basic shape we're going to look at is

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:07.160 
basic shape we're going to look at is
this<00:00:57.960> one<00:01:00.289> okay<00:01:04.850> now<00:01:05.850> obviously<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:07.049> would

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
this one okay now obviously what would

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.429 
this one okay now obviously what would
happen<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.610> took<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.090> shape<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
happen is if I took this shape and I

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.899 
happen is if I took this shape and I
tried<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> build<00:01:11.010> something<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
tried to build something out of it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.590 
tried to build something out of it
there's<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.810> problem<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there's a problem with it and the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
there's a problem with it and the
problem<00:01:15.810> lies<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.580> jump<00:01:17.909> into

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
problem lies here if I jump into

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.630 
problem lies here if I jump into
wireframe<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.340> thing

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
wireframe you can see that this thing

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.109 
wireframe you can see that this thing
ends<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> polar<00:01:21.750> cap<00:01:22.170> okay<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.130> means<00:01:23.310> all

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
ends in a polar cap okay that means all

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
ends in a polar cap okay that means all
the<00:01:24.180> vertices<00:01:24.590> toggle<00:01:25.590> into<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> center<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the vertices toggle into the center of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.990 
the vertices toggle into the center of
it<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.500> causes<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.799> extraordinary<00:01:29.369> virgin

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
it and causes some extraordinary virgin

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.539 
it and causes some extraordinary virgin
see<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> happen<00:01:33.200> okay<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.220> look<00:01:35.340> at

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
see to happen okay and you can look at

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
see to happen okay and you can look at
it<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:37.520> edit<00:01:38.520> mode<00:01:39.500> here's<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it right here in edit mode here's the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280 
it right here in edit mode here's the
extraordinary<00:01:41.340> vertice<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.020> pull<00:01:43.259> this

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
extraordinary vertice and if I pull this

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.899 
extraordinary vertice and if I pull this
up<00:01:44.000> well<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.329> i<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> take<00:01:45.930> snap<00:01:46.200> off<00:01:46.790> if<00:01:47.790> I

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
up well now i have to take snap off if I

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.569 
up well now i have to take snap off if I
pull<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.159> just

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
pull this up you can see that it is just

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.920 
pull this up you can see that it is just
a<00:01:50.670> bunch<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.939> triangles<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.479> all<00:01:51.720> meet

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
a bunch of triangles that all meet

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.410 
a bunch of triangles that all meet
together<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:53.820> good<00:01:53.939> as

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
together now this is not very good as

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.060 
together now this is not very good as
far<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:55.290> box<00:01:56.189> modeling<00:01:56.670> goes<00:01:56.850> okay<00:01:57.500> we<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.860> try

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
far as box modeling goes okay we we try

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.340 
far as box modeling goes okay we we try
to<00:01:59.130> avoid<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> plague<00:02:00.350> especially

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
to avoid this like the plague especially

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830 
to avoid this like the plague especially
triangles<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.240> there's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> reason<00:02:03.659> for<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
triangles and there's a reason for that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.080 
triangles and there's a reason for that
like<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.130> jump<00:02:05.340> into<00:02:05.460> ass<00:02:05.729> cult

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
like if you want to jump into ass cult

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.249 
like if you want to jump into ass cult
in<00:02:07.039> blender<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.399> basically<00:02:08.910> say<00:02:09.450> well<00:02:10.020> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
in blender you can basically say well I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
in blender you can basically say well I
can't<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.709> sculpt<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.610> area<00:02:11.940> very

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
can't really sculpt in this area very

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.760 
can't really sculpt in this area very
well<00:02:12.239> because<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.080> extraordinary

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
well because of this extraordinary

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.130 
well because of this extraordinary
vertice<00:02:16.580> now<00:02:17.580> there<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.940> applications<00:02:18.810> for

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
vertice now there is applications for

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.290 
vertice now there is applications for
this<00:02:19.320> design<00:02:19.740> let's<00:02:20.430> say<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.090> make

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
this design let's say if I want to make

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.990 
this design let's say if I want to make
an<00:02:21.450> eye<00:02:21.660> yes<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:23.160> already<00:02:23.640> designed

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
an eye yes it's it's already designed

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240 
an eye yes it's it's already designed
very<00:02:24.240> well<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.750> an<00:02:24.870> eye<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:25.200> fact<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.100> know

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
very well for an eye in fact you know

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.450 
very well for an eye in fact you know
from<00:02:26.760> here<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.320> would<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.070> iris

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
from here to here this would be the iris

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.000 
from here to here this would be the iris
and<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.750> rest<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.170> eyeball<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:31.920> you

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and the rest of the eyeball so if you

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.890 
and the rest of the eyeball so if you
wanted<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> make<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> quick<00:02:33.150> eyeball<00:02:33.690> in

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
wanted to make a quick eyeball in

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.310 
wanted to make a quick eyeball in
blender<00:02:34.560> yeah<00:02:35.100> great<00:02:35.700> design<00:02:35.960> but<00:02:36.960> anything

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
blender yeah great design but anything

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.650 
blender yeah great design but anything
else<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:38.190> very<00:02:38.430> practical<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> how<00:02:42.390> do<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.600> get

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
else not very practical so how do I get

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.770 
else not very practical so how do I get
that<00:02:43.350> or<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.430> into<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.320> alright<00:02:46.320> well<00:02:46.760> easy

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
that or this into that alright well easy

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.430 
that or this into that alright well easy
first<00:02:48.780> off<00:02:48.990> let's<00:02:49.290> add<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.830> modifier<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.520> it

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
first off let's add a modifier to it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.370 
first off let's add a modifier to it
multiresolution<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.570> can<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.200> hit

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
multiresolution and you can see if I hit

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.850 
multiresolution and you can see if I hit
subdivide<00:02:56.040> once<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.990> maybe<00:02:57.990> one<00:02:58.230> more<00:02:58.380> time<00:02:58.650> i

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
subdivide once and maybe one more time i

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.080 
subdivide once and maybe one more time i
get<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.670> design<00:03:01.310> now<00:03:02.310> there<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> flaw<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
get that design now there is a flaw to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.650 
get that design now there is a flaw to
multi<00:03:03.870> res<00:03:04.140> if<00:03:04.770> you<00:03:05.010> hit<00:03:05.190> tab<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:06.270> can<00:03:06.330> see

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
multi res if you hit tab you can see

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.460 
multi res if you hit tab you can see
that<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.170> goes<00:03:07.320> away<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:11.690> multi<00:03:12.690> res<00:03:12.900> cannot

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
that it goes away so multi res cannot

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.600 
that it goes away so multi res cannot
exist<00:03:14.040> with<00:03:14.340> an<00:03:14.460> edit<00:03:14.820> mode<00:03:16.280> well<00:03:17.280> how<00:03:17.430> do<00:03:17.490> I

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
exist with an edit mode well how do I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.880 
exist with an edit mode well how do I
keep<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.770> can<00:03:19.770> hit<00:03:19.890> apply<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:21.680> now<00:03:22.680> it's

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
keep it I can hit apply and now it's

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.550 
keep it I can hit apply and now it's
going<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.250> always<00:03:23.490> be<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.820> ball<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:25.110> hit<00:03:25.290> tab

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
going to always be a ball if I hit tab

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.780 
going to always be a ball if I hit tab
you<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:26.580> that's<00:03:26.850> ball<00:03:27.180> here<00:03:28.580> all<00:03:29.580> right

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
you can see that's ball here all right

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.110 
you can see that's ball here all right
now<00:03:30.240> let's<00:03:30.690> look<00:03:30.810> at<00:03:30.930> another<00:03:31.080> way<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> do<00:03:31.890> this

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.370 

create<00:03:36.120> another<00:03:36.180> box<00:03:37.850> this<00:03:38.850> time<00:03:39.200> I'm<00:03:40.200> going

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
create another box this time I'm going

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.720 
create another box this time I'm going
to<00:03:40.470> add<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> modifier<00:03:41.420> called<00:03:43.730> subdivision

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
to add a modifier called subdivision

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.970 
to add a modifier called subdivision
surface<00:03:47.150> okay<00:03:48.150> works<00:03:49.050> kind<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.560> multi

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
surface okay works kind of like multi

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.210 
surface okay works kind of like multi
res<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.520> fact<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.120> can<00:03:51.360> just<00:03:51.540> hit

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
res in the fact that I can just hit

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.400 
res in the fact that I can just hit
subdivisions<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:54.620> make<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.740> sphere<00:03:57.380> when<00:03:58.380> I

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
subdivisions and make the sphere when I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.350 
subdivisions and make the sphere when I
hit<00:03:58.650> tab<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.390> get<00:04:00.390> this<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:02.190> subdivide<00:04:02.850> surface

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
hit tab I get this so subdivide surface

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.960 
hit tab I get this so subdivide surface
basically<00:04:04.260> states<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.770> at<00:04:05.160> its<00:04:05.640> lowest

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
basically states that at its lowest

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.310 
basically states that at its lowest
you're<00:04:06.750> going<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.020> get<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.820> design<00:04:09.050> okay<00:04:10.050> and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
you're going to get this design okay and

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.190 
you're going to get this design okay and
at<00:04:11.250> its<00:04:11.550> highest<00:04:11.790> you're<00:04:12.270> going<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.480> get<00:04:12.660> the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
at its highest you're going to get the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.050 
at its highest you're going to get the
preview<00:04:14.100> quality<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.670> inside<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.810> center

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
preview quality and inside of the center

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.090 
preview quality and inside of the center
well<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.630> pretty<00:04:19.020> nifty<00:04:19.290> trick<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
well this is a pretty nifty trick in the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.400 
well this is a pretty nifty trick in the
fact<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.489> now<00:04:21.000> if<00:04:21.180> i<00:04:21.299> go<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.480> face

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.500 

and<00:04:25.500> let's<00:04:25.710> say<00:04:25.920> I<00:04:25.950> show<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.640> basic<00:04:26.910> command

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
and let's say I show you a basic command

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.330 
and let's say I show you a basic command
called<00:04:28.670> shift<00:04:29.670> II<00:04:30.530> that's<00:04:31.530> extrude<00:04:32.100> by<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
called shift II that's extrude by the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:45.980 
called shift II that's extrude by the
way<00:04:38.630> if<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.720> right<00:04:39.990> click<00:04:40.020> go<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:42.810> scale<00:04:44.990> scale

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
way if I right click go to scale scale

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.190 
way if I right click go to scale scale
it<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.320> center<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:47.180> can<00:04:48.180> see<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:49.170> is

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
it to the center you can see that it is

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.480 
it to the center you can see that it is
a<00:04:49.380> box<00:04:50.450> but<00:04:51.450> it's<00:04:51.870> subdivide<00:04:52.770> surface<00:04:53.250> on<00:04:53.400> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
a box but it's subdivide surface on the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.580 
a box but it's subdivide surface on the
inside<00:04:53.820> of<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:54.000> box<00:04:54.330> is<00:04:54.630> now<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> preview<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:58.560> a

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
inside of that box is now a preview so a

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.650 
inside of that box is now a preview so a
lot<00:04:58.830> of<00:04:58.860> people<00:04:59.070> do<00:04:59.430> model<00:04:59.850> this<00:05:00.000> way<00:05:00.270> they

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
lot of people do model this way they

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.420 
lot of people do model this way they
model<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.500> fact<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:01.860> they<00:05:02.220> have<00:05:02.400> a

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
model and the fact that they have a

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.900 
model and the fact that they have a
subdivision<00:05:03.890> modifier<00:05:04.890> on<00:05:04.920> there<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.490> they

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
subdivision modifier on there and they

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.390 
subdivision modifier on there and they
can<00:05:06.090> just<00:05:06.270> go<00:05:06.960> at<00:05:07.140> it<00:05:07.170> this<00:05:07.500> is<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.740> great<00:05:08.160> way<00:05:08.340> to

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
can just go at it this is a great way to

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:21.370 
can just go at it this is a great way to
do<00:05:08.610> organic<00:05:09.060> modeling

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.500 

okay<00:05:24.460> now<00:05:25.460> anytime<00:05:25.760> I<00:05:26.030> want<00:05:26.210> to<00:05:26.300> keep<00:05:26.450> that

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
okay now anytime I want to keep that

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.400 
okay now anytime I want to keep that
piece<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:27.230> can<00:05:27.500> just<00:05:27.710> hit<00:05:27.800> apply<00:05:28.750> aha<00:05:29.750> but<00:05:30.290> you

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
piece I can just hit apply aha but you

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.250 
piece I can just hit apply aha but you
have<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:30.650> be<00:05:30.800> an<00:05:30.950> object<00:05:31.460> mode<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:32.000> apply<00:05:32.270> it<00:05:32.330> so

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
have to be an object mode to apply it so

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.710 
have to be an object mode to apply it so
there<00:05:33.440> we<00:05:33.560> go<00:05:33.590> now<00:05:34.070> we<00:05:34.130> have<00:05:34.430> this<00:05:34.970> bowling<00:05:35.480> pin

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
there we go now we have this bowling pin

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.400 
there we go now we have this bowling pin
thing<00:05:40.300> all<00:05:41.300> right<00:05:41.450> we'll<00:05:41.600> get<00:05:41.750> into<00:05:41.930> organic

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
thing all right we'll get into organic

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.320 
thing all right we'll get into organic
modeling<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.100> little<00:05:43.310> bit<00:05:43.430> later<00:05:43.670> but<00:05:44.060> right

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
modeling a little bit later but right

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.930 
modeling a little bit later but right
now<00:05:44.660> just<00:05:45.500> know<00:05:45.770> that<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.250> premise<00:05:46.610> of<00:05:46.790> this

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
now just know that the premise of this

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.250 
now just know that the premise of this
video<00:05:47.330> is<00:05:47.630> to<00:05:47.930> be<00:05:48.290> able<00:05:48.440> to<00:05:48.800> produce<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:50.260> sphere

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
video is to be able to produce a sphere

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.950 
video is to be able to produce a sphere
that<00:05:51.890> has<00:05:52.190> good<00:05:52.730> mesh<00:05:53.590> good<00:05:54.590> resolution<00:05:55.310> in

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
that has good mesh good resolution in

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.780 
that has good mesh good resolution in
uniform<00:05:56.960> geometry<00:05:57.680> okay<00:05:58.280> so<00:05:58.340> you're<00:05:58.610> going<00:05:58.730> to

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
uniform geometry okay so you're going to

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.210 
uniform geometry okay so you're going to
hear<00:05:58.970> me<00:05:59.150> say<00:05:59.390> this<00:06:00.050> has<00:06:00.320> good<00:06:00.620> uniform

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
hear me say this has good uniform

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.750 
hear me say this has good uniform
geometry<00:06:01.820> a<00:06:01.850> lot<00:06:03.010> uniform<00:06:04.010> geometry<00:06:04.520> means

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
geometry a lot uniform geometry means

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.180 
geometry a lot uniform geometry means
that<00:06:05.090> basically<00:06:05.330> all<00:06:05.960> the<00:06:06.170> squares<00:06:06.800> or

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
that basically all the squares or

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.420 
that basically all the squares or
vertices<00:06:08.060> or<00:06:08.240> faces<00:06:09.020> have<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:10.040> kind<00:06:10.340> of

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
vertices or faces have a kind of

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.180 
vertices or faces have a kind of
relationship<00:06:11.150> together<00:06:11.330> that<00:06:12.290> is<00:06:12.500> uniformed

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
relationship together that is uniformed

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.120 
relationship together that is uniformed
ok<00:06:14.000> so<00:06:14.090> this<00:06:14.450> face<00:06:14.720> is<00:06:15.020> about<00:06:15.470> the<00:06:15.650> equal<00:06:15.950> size

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
ok so this face is about the equal size

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.250 
ok so this face is about the equal size
to<00:06:16.400> this<00:06:16.580> face<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:17.180> equal<00:06:17.480> size<00:06:17.660> to<00:06:17.900> this<00:06:18.050> face

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
to this face the equal size to this face

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.870 
to this face the equal size to this face
and<00:06:18.530> they're<00:06:19.340> all<00:06:19.520> quads<00:06:21.400> unlike<00:06:22.400> this<00:06:22.640> one

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
and they're all quads unlike this one

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.630 
and they're all quads unlike this one
that<00:06:23.720> if<00:06:24.140> you<00:06:24.350> go<00:06:26.530> you'll<00:06:27.530> notice<00:06:27.830> that<00:06:27.860> it's

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
that if you go you'll notice that it's

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.450 
that if you go you'll notice that it's
not<00:06:29.120> a<00:06:29.180> very<00:06:29.510> good<00:06:29.630> uniform<00:06:30.500> geometry<00:06:31.130> piece

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
not a very good uniform geometry piece

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.810 
not a very good uniform geometry piece
because<00:06:31.910> of<00:06:32.030> the<00:06:32.150> fact<00:06:32.330> that<00:06:33.070> quads<00:06:34.070> down<00:06:34.340> here

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
because of the fact that quads down here

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.900 
because of the fact that quads down here
start<00:06:35.690> getting<00:06:36.020> all<00:06:36.200> long<00:06:36.530> gated<00:06:36.980> by<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.640> time

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
start getting all long gated by the time

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.120 
start getting all long gated by the time
it<00:06:38.060> gets<00:06:38.150> to<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:38.540> extraordinary<00:06:39.440> vertice<00:06:39.950> and

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
it gets to the extraordinary vertice and

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.670 
it gets to the extraordinary vertice and
then<00:06:40.910> it<00:06:41.030> starts<00:06:41.330> getting<00:06:41.450> triangulated<00:06:42.200> so

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
then it starts getting triangulated so

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.310 
then it starts getting triangulated so
this<00:06:42.920> is<00:06:43.070> a<00:06:43.600> non-uniform<00:06:44.600> two<00:06:44.990> piece<00:06:45.170> of

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
this is a non-uniform two piece of

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.890 
this is a non-uniform two piece of
geometry<00:06:45.530> this<00:06:46.460> is<00:06:46.640> a<00:06:46.670> uniform<00:06:47.360> two<00:06:47.540> piece<00:06:47.750> of

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
geometry this is a uniform two piece of

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.000 
geometry this is a uniform two piece of
geometry<00:06:49.930> again<00:06:50.930> that's<00:06:51.110> very<00:06:51.470> important

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
geometry again that's very important

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:57.840 
geometry again that's very important
when<00:06:52.340> we<00:06:52.520> get<00:06:52.730> into<00:06:52.940> sculpting<00:06:53.630> later<00:06:53.840> on<00:06:56.590> ok

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
when we get into sculpting later on ok

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.250 
when we get into sculpting later on ok
so<00:06:59.080> your<00:07:00.080> first<00:07:01.750> actual<00:07:02.750> piece<00:07:02.930> of<00:07:03.110> geometry

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
so your first actual piece of geometry

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.260 
so your first actual piece of geometry
need<00:07:03.710> to<00:07:03.800> be<00:07:03.950> a<00:07:03.980> sphere<00:07:04.310> let's<00:07:04.640> move<00:07:04.850> on<00:07:05.030> to<00:07:05.240> a

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
need to be a sphere let's move on to a

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.710 
need to be a sphere let's move on to a
couple<00:07:05.690> others<00:07:05.930> in<00:07:06.110> the<00:07:06.170> next<00:07:06.440> video
