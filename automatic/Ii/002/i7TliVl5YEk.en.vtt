00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
enterprise and so we've been able to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.280 
enterprise and so we've been able to

that<00:02:43.260> we're<00:02:43.500> focusing<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.190> our<00:02:44.250> primary

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
that we're focusing on our primary

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.170 
that we're focusing on our primary
schools<00:02:45.300> because<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.790> where<00:02:47.790> parents

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
schools because that is where parents

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.610 
schools because that is where parents
are<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.360> most<00:02:48.480> incentive<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.230> send<00:02:49.470> their

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
are the most incentive to send their

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.380 
are the most incentive to send their
children<00:02:49.890> there's<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.610> an<00:02:50.790> opportunity

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
children there's really an opportunity

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.509 
children there's really an opportunity
to<00:02:51.510> get<00:02:51.600> school<00:02:51.900> kids<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.650> affect<00:02:53.310> them

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
to get school kids in and affect them

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.660 
to get school kids in and affect them
and<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.600> each<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> schools<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.340> build

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
and so each of the schools that we build

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.400 
and so each of the schools that we build
our<00:02:57.080> can<00:02:58.080> put<00:02:58.560> probably<00:02:59.570> 200<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.660> 300<00:03:01.170> kids

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
our can put probably 200 to 300 kids

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.920 
our can put probably 200 to 300 kids
through<00:03:01.950> per<00:03:02.220> year<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:02.730> over<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> five-year

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
through per year so over a five-year

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.190 
through per year so over a five-year
period<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.500> time<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:06.480> know<00:03:06.570> obviously<00:03:06.750> you

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
period of time you know obviously you

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.070 
period of time you know obviously you
multiply<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.890> out<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:08.519> exactly<00:03:09.330> 1500

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
multiply that out it's not exactly 1500

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.930 
multiply that out it's not exactly 1500
but<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.890> continue<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.459> see<00:03:11.610> what<00:03:11.790> can

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
but you can continue to see what can

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.460 
but you can continue to see what can
happen<00:03:11.970> over<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.510> long<00:03:12.660> period<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:13.050> time<00:03:13.110> and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
happen over a long period of time and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.720 
happen over a long period of time and
the<00:03:13.530> things<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:14.010> we're<00:03:14.190> really<00:03:14.430> excited

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
the things that we're really excited

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.100 
the things that we're really excited
about<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.180> we're<00:03:15.360> not<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.690> putting<00:03:15.989> up
