00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.609
 new video today I will show you what 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.830
 they are the best android games for me 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.960
 opinion the five best games for 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.120
 android in my opinion the first game and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.000
 spirit study that I think is the only one 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:21.359
 commercial among those I have that you 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 I'll show you today then let's wait at the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:41.790
 loading you have to try to do 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:46.280
 these unfortunate choices hang in the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.280
 world ahead because 53 years will become 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.410
 all those beautiful beautiful cremona 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.360
 great was so much to show this 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:31.580
 that first game one of the top five 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.270
 according to me that is on the play store 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.950
 ok then the second game was due and into 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.760
 the dead that another beautiful game 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.760
 the barriers 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.170
 here too we wait for it to load 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.320
 in practice we will be us a visual 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.480
 that we run firsthand and 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.550
 let's try to dodge these 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.440
 zombies and going forward we will also find 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.840
 of the species of parcel boxes where 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.910
 we will find the first one at an arms race 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.770
 weapon that a gun is found and then 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.040
 going forward you will also find others 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.040
 weapons 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:50.870
 here of network they must not hope these 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.760
 days we are not lucky if they are 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:12.650
 lucky to find even when stones 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:14.630
 they have it, oh same same call ok raga 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.739
 sorry really sucked but i'm 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.989
 really playing in a position 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.950
 uncomfortable I can't play I did 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.209
 400 meters does not remember type 1200 1400 e 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.220
 I know 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:31.160
 the third game is high giraud another 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:33.670
 fantastic game my opinion there 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.670
 let's wait 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.770
 ok 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.400
 ok shin do not try to break these 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.569
 red ball species without touching it 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.819
 price that vaults gym 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.819
 going ahead to the difficult 26 now 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.919
 it's 30 to 20 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.289
 ok we sucked this anyway 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.500
 here from ciro I arrived at seventh 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.770
 level there are 30 and is a pastime 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:53.440
 really fun the fourth game is the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:55.150
 soccer that I show to ha 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.780
 blocked two characters but I do it 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:03.220
 see the main character 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:09.550
 existing ok you have to try to do it 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:17.229
 with him to his gospel his double is not 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:19.590
 you want to make the ball after our ball 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.590
 goals 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:34.860
 I know I gave the special show then 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:37.069
 he did fuck then ok i do 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.069
 disgust 

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:48.520
 he worked 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.050
 i was really crap so i got 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.179
 preferred to end here because I am 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.349
 doing really sucks I'm game but ve 

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:55.689
 I said I'm really a position 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.669
 uncomfortable that front camera and 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.709
 so I can hardly play and 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.219
 the last game also in my opinion is the 

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:04.869
 best is the tree that rode 2 came out 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:09.360
 he too not but obviously the 2 more 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:12.430
 nice because there are more levels and it is 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.470
 and there are also more weapons as was the 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.390
 graphic is much improved 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.350
 so if you want to download and trigger one 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.490
 in 2000 to download the 2 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.690
 as a fairly heavy game 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.960
 we have to wait for the whole 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.960
 loading 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.800
 ok we are starting from our own 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:08.250
 hiding but let's go straight 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:10.580
 say ok i do a random mission da 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.580
 get 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.500
 because if you make it difficult way it is 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.410
 impossible to win 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.890
 ok guys only 50 minutes left 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:25.260
 of video because this camera is 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.380
 very limited with videos so I do 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.390
 see right on the fly as you do 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.830
 he plays but then I immediately remove the myth because 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.830
 don't make it to finish it 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.750
 if it moves to load maybe I can 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.750
 let you see 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:51.020
 ok this is the graphic as you see one 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.020
 beautiful graphics 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.199
 you have to show it to the zombies 

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:07.660
 if you want with them 

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.520
 ok guys showed up on the fly 

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.990
 I only eat five seconds so vi 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.990
 greeting and beautiful girl
