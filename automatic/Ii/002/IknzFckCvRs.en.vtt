coming out by April paper with this
macro<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.340> mean<00:01:29.549> he<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.909> also<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> no<00:01:30.299> problem

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
macro I mean he can also to no problem

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.440 
macro I mean he can also to no problem
so<00:01:30.750> many<00:01:30.930> bases<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.439> now<00:01:32.090> has<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> terror

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so many bases right now has a terror

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.300 
so many bases right now has a terror
only<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.900> three<00:01:34.200> mining<00:01:34.530> basis<00:01:34.860> making<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
only on three mining basis making a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.030 
only on three mining basis making a
fourth<00:01:35.909> community<00:01:36.900> center<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.320> way<00:01:37.560> right

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
fourth community center on the way right

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
fourth community center on the way right
now<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> bunch<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.990> links<00:01:40.200> coming

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
now so there are a bunch of links coming

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.410 
now so there are a bunch of links coming

now gonna be two and three pretty soon
as<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:03.119> barracks<00:02:03.570> is

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
as we are going to see more barracks is

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.899 
as we are going to see more barracks is
coming<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.759> an

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
coming down here and that we do have an

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.490 
coming down here and that we do have an
overlord<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> bunch<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.960> observing<00:02:07.409> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
overlord with a bunch of observing is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.050 
overlord with a bunch of observing is
most<00:02:07.740> likely<00:02:07.979> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> drop<00:02:08.489> me<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.849> I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
most likely going to drop me here I

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.340 
most likely going to drop me here I
guess

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
guess

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.220 
guess
area<00:02:10.620> will<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.980> best<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.870> diversity<00:02:12.870> are

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
area will be the best as diversity are

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.040 
area will be the best as diversity are
covered<00:02:13.590> by<00:02:13.680> visitors<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.510> anyway<00:02:15.780> we'll<00:02:15.930> see

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
covered by visitors so anyway we'll see

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.330 
covered by visitors so anyway we'll see
what<00:02:16.170> he<00:02:16.230> does<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.590> these<00:02:16.740> overlords<00:02:17.250> as

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
what he does with these overlords as

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.370 
what he does with these overlords as
they<00:02:17.490> do<00:02:17.730> contain<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.150> lot<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> zerglings<00:02:18.960> army

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
they do contain a lot of zerglings army

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.850 
they do contain a lot of zerglings army
count<00:02:19.940> 196<00:02:20.940> over<00:02:21.270> 140<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.050> he<00:02:22.260> should<00:02:22.560> probably

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
count 196 over 140 so he should probably

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.200 
count 196 over 140 so he should probably
make<00:02:22.980> some<00:02:23.160> kind<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> move<00:02:23.520> some<00:02:23.820> sometime

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
make some kind of move some sometime

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.450 
make some kind of move some sometime
soon<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.690> think<00:02:25.590> that's<00:02:25.710> not<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.980> way<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.160> learn

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
soon I think that's not a way to learn

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.220 
soon I think that's not a way to learn
