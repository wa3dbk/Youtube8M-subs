00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.009
 look in this short teacher video 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.230
 in the context of ecology the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.010
 biotic and abiotic factors times 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.510
 more exactly 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.090
 both are about 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.950
 Location factors with one location 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.870
 in ecology, the sum is called 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.150
 the environmental conditions on one 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.070
 and interact with organism 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.320
 location factor is therefore a tiny one 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.019
 excerpt, so to speak, an aspect of the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.750
 locations next to organic or 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.250
 can be organic 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 Under Abiotic is understood 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.780
 Location factors because not living 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 environment of an organism the latin 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.910
 you can do it easily 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.260
 derive 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.520
 the prefix a or ab is too german 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 vecchio always has something to do with life 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.600
 So there the meaning away from life or 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.489
 just do not live 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.280
 this can now be further broken down 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.840
 as I have listed this time too 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.120
 The light factors include both the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 light intensity so how strong the sun 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.710
 shines as well as the lighting 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 rhythm and the lighting duration too 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.320
 Climate factors include temperature 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.850
 wind precipitation and humidity 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.189
 and to the soil factors too 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.450
 properties like ph value 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.270
 mineral content water absorption 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.040
 assets and so forth important to mention 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.979
 are of course also oxygen and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 carbon dioxide healed leaving the co2 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.409
 Mainly for planting 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.240
 meaning is 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.299
 you know photosynthesis predecessors 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.130
 need co2 and oxygen plays a 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.530
 vital role for animals 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.509
 especially for fish, the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.729
 recycle dissolved oxygen in the water 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.829
 and have massive problems if the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.900
 temperature in the lake rises because then too 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.049
 the gas solubility in the water decreases 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.770
 what we still see in the video for the Ecosystem 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.600
 will see 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.549
 in biotic factors, then 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.229
 standard factors of the living environment 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.850
 play both the individual 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.439
 same art as alien 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.229
 creatures matter 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.689
 Examples are predators like mice 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.730
 the buzzard but also competitors around 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.160
 resources 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.290
 especially food and about that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.540
 parasites or pathogens count 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.400
 Also station is in many textbooks 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.110
 that the abiotic factors 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.119
 mainly in plants in terms of 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.560
 Growth plays a role and the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.730
 biotic, however, mainly at 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.310
 are significant 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.230
 The market tends to be right 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.970
 there were so many exceptions that it 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.880
 just no rules but as I said 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.950
 my tendency is an example of 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.360
 Abiotic factor temperature is playing now 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.170
 verily for each animal one 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.120
 immense role 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.250
 There is also competition among them 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.390
 plant around sunbathing areas and many 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.730
 more resources 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.230
 I hope this video helped her 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.880
 if so, I would be very happy about you 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.890
 thumbs up and an abo happy 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.480
 You will also find on the left side 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.940
 even more videos from the field of 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.690
 ecology until the next video yours 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.690
 strive to spend
