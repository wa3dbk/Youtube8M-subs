00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.410 

transmission<00:02:25.860> shifts<00:02:26.370> pretty<00:02:26.549> smoothly<00:02:27.120> it's

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
transmission shifts pretty smoothly it's

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.410 
transmission shifts pretty smoothly it's
got<00:02:27.599> paddle<00:02:28.500> shifters<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.400> does<00:02:29.579> put<00:02:29.939> in<00:02:30.060> sport

got paddle shifters it does put in sport
mode<00:02:31.099> see<00:02:32.099> how<00:02:32.220> these

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.580 

so<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.659> little<00:02:36.840> bit<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.170> delayed<00:02:37.439> reaction

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
so a little bit of a delayed reaction

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.210 
so a little bit of a delayed reaction
but<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.159> is<00:02:38.280> an<00:02:38.400> automatic<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
but it is an automatic so

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.220 
but it is an automatic so
it's<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.790> fun<00:02:40.970> feature<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.540> can't<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:42.020> fun

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
