00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.810
 Well, together they still did not live well 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.910
 As you already know in 2016 it has been confirmed 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.500
 that we will have a new battlefield 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
 concretely it will surely be 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.380
 battlefield 5 although I still do not know 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.860
 know the name but for now we're going to 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.299
 call like this during this year have us 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.340
 a big one that comes from 2015 we will have 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.340
 butterfield hartheim and in 2016 as I say 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.560
 then battlefield 5 is a second 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.990
 talked the financial director blake 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.510
 george jÃ¼rgensen has talked about the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.890
 title has said that he has already seen 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.289
 with which, it seems, has already 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.510
 is in development and good according to 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:37.989
 commented then it will be the return of 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.120
 military- style battlefield that has 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.429
 had in the last deliveries and others 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.019
 although they would talk about him later according to 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.479
 has also commented the game will have to 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.789
 have more destruction with more 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.979
 content and more features of what 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.749
 that is already presupposed but good that 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.399
 greater destruction does not sound like something 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.190
 quite promising the truth we shall have 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.649
 know if they can still get there 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.420
 to a more higher style than seen already 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.640
 in butterfield 4 and so on it would be pretty 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.110
 awesome I do not know if they did not finish 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.390
 as I say renewing another and making a 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.670
 graphic engine and jumping or bringing 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.580
 giant as in which the fish then 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.240
 we have to update them from a 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.280
 way to get to the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.720
 neutral graphics but not knowing what 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.340
 that ends up happening and so on and 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.130
 adapting as I also say to the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.690
 new generation consoles and or 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.780
 true that good battlefield 4 as I say 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.830
 in play 4 because I already said that he had 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.110
 impressively that is the games 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.420
 You can see 60 frames running very well 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.649
 fluids and really August there's 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.110
 other games that is that I'm freaking 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.119
 that they go to 30 and really for being 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.800
 even smaller the truth that is 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.060
 incomprehensible on many occasions we 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.460
 they say they sacrifice the graphic engine 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.350
 for the frames and others but good 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.050
 battlefield 4 for example in consoles is 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.909
 an example of what can be done then 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.250
 that is not being because 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.860
 sacrifice nothing for the frames and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.470
 graphics and so on but I guess I guess 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.570
 will be his technicalities or is not he 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.640
 Senate pussy 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.080
 so good nothing else that this has been 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.310
 everything and nothing see you in the next 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.310
 video on the coast
