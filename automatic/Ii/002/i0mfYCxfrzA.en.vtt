presentation you ask the questions you
answered<00:03:43.590> them<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:44.150> feel<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> little<00:03:45.450> bit<00:03:45.660> did

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
answered them I feel a little bit did

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.570 
answered them I feel a little bit did
because<00:03:46.260> I've<00:03:46.470> actually<00:03:46.650> never<00:03:47.069> heard<00:03:47.430> of

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
because I've actually never heard of

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:59.420 
because I've actually never heard of
this<00:03:47.760> before<00:03:56.930> but<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.079> think<00:03:58.440> it's<00:03:59.250> really

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
this before but I think it's really

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.789 
this before but I think it's really
interesting<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.150> also<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.349> didn't<00:04:01.620> just

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
interesting and also you didn't just

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.620 
interesting and also you didn't just
dumb<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.099> down<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.519> actually<00:04:02.880> gave<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.209> facts

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
dumb it down you actually gave the facts

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.690 
dumb it down you actually gave the facts
which<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.079> really<00:04:04.410> good<00:04:04.620> but<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.130> get<00:04:05.310> them<00:04:05.489> in

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
which is really good but you get them in

dependency issues you can take an

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.129 
dependency issues you can take an
antidote<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:51.210> would<00:04:51.330> sober<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.750> up<00:04:51.780> your

of memory loss out of control stage so

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.790 
of memory loss out of control stage so
accidents<00:04:57.180> or<00:04:57.330> deaths<00:04:57.690> from<00:04:57.840> accidents<00:04:58.350> would

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
accidents or deaths from accidents would
