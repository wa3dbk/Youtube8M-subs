00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
versions of guess cheap so I'm gonna

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.359 
versions of guess cheap so I'm gonna
slow<00:01:58.290> mode<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.649> real<00:01:58.860> quick<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.250> sure

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
slow mode this real quick I'm not sure

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.700 
slow mode this real quick I'm not sure
if<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> Hydra<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.170> certainly

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
if this is a Hydra but this certainly

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
jet just took off it could be the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.930 
jet just took off it could be the
hydrometer<00:02:06.060> sure<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> was<00:02:06.810> sort<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.110> just

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
hydrometer sure but it was sort of just

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.999 
hydrometer sure but it was sort of just
it<00:02:08.940> didn't<00:02:09.479> require<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:10.110> run<00:02:10.560> strip<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it didn't require a run strip to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.140
