00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.319
 very good kids that as you are 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.870
 well means back to the channel in the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.670
 today's video let's review again the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.349
 trailer yesterday because there were so many 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.570
 things that escaped me you already know that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.209
 these people every frame of the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.860
 trailers that take account and never better 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.350
 said because there are so many pictures 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.910
 hidden and is mostly an image 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.290
 I think nobody has seen anyone 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 I have told you and we have to 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.240
 give many thanks to my friend 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.190
 manolo in knowing that he is always 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.600
 supporting me and we're talking about zombies 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.210
 italy and the truth that the flavor helped me 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.070
 a lot I found this image and the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 I really find it fascinating, so 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 let's start kids with him with the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.679
 trailer because there are several frames 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.410
 hidden first as they go 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.600
 passing the maps that if we see that yes yes 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.210
 do not know what if there is an ascension 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.179
 assign transitions in music 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 it is done as off so fast and that if 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.780
 you are going to frames because you give 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.329
 account that in each in each transition 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460
 there's just a moment where a frame 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.649
 are appearing images a kind of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.050
 experiment room and such 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.730
 the first one that appears is this that good 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.010
 Well here you see they are black and white 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.200
 it's like this 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.120
 these frames and it will be well as a 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.160
 experiment room a pipe over here 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.640
 up crossing the web above to the 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.560
 left a cable like that in a circular way 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.790
 well, that's basically nothing 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.440
 more than comment the stop like that a little 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.970
 stained with blood you see that they are 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.650
 experiments with zombies although here not 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.270
 it looks like he 's a zombie 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.920
 but basically I'm telling you so 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.840
 there are a few jars of 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.700
 experiments but good we follow the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.830
 second image that appears when I 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.930
 I continue as the parents are moving forward 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.460
 is an image quite similar to the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.050
 previous taking a little more to the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.170
 right above the pipeline is with 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 the cables and such are the legs of the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.550
 zombie with one foot also to the right 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.710
 is barefoot in the other one has the boot 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.590
 put but good they do not have much 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.470
 importance that we pass to the third 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.900
 where is the most the most relevant here 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.880
 As you can see, it's on top of the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.740
 zombie and good enough curious not a 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.630
 such wooden table with all the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.270
 principles then of the experiments 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.940
 the saw is mainly seen that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.310
 Let 's say he has cut off the head 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.200
 zombie I have seen many comments that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.220
 they say in other videos such but because 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.680
 I was going to have 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.270
 moored and you're supposed to take it off 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.120
 the brain because as we see the background 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.100
 has the brain is already dead I've seen 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.780
 also others who say maybe he was 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.210
 putting the brain all these images 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.550
 let's move on to the last one about 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.770
 the experiments is this is the fourth 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.300
 it would be if a little more to the right and such 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.610
 and this many without this supposedly 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.460
 refers to the experiments of 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.190
 doctor maxis that he did with the zombies and 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.350
 such in this one 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.870
 during this date refer to 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.090
 that but clear a lot 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.530
 zombie subject if he has no brain to what 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.870
 better I was putting the brain to 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.940
 create visit them 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.500
 authentic paranoia but good those 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.769
 four images I leave there because there are 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.470
 this is where the interesting comes the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.580
 red flasks we do not know why 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.170
 they were 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.540
 I guess most of you already 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.510
 you know they carry the numbers of the prisoners 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.790
 Madoff Prison alcatraz worth 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.610
 in a frac he jammed the one on the right 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.730
 we see that it has the numbering 481 and in 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.140
 the other one takes it to 386 and it turns out when 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.000
 we were doing the interest 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.890
 of madoff from deep we have that 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.840
 enter the final numbers the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.910
 codes so we have to introduce the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.730
 numbers and they were four numbers I think that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.950
 if the four characters and basically 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.390
 two of the numbers were these that 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.730
 correspond to the numbers of 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.030
 identification of the prisoners this already 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.310
 Well, this origin is related to us a little 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.690
 As a decent mox , he tries to give us 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.319
 let's say a a relationship when then 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.180
 we continue and such when the scene explodes 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.040
 from the giant that there are quite a few programs 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.349
 there are very hidden characteristics 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.269
 we do not see frames like this is like this 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.930
 ways that I have put good because it has 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.049
 called 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.930
 but they are not very important then 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:09.269
 There is a word to my eyes that is of the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.040
 backwards if we put it to the right puts tour 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.569
 missing a letter to the right as you see 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.879
 it's like a kind of text that is 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.600
 Hung could be pictures in English 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.919
 but it would be missing at the end of 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.600
 picture picture then I do not know this 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.919
 word I do not know well what what he wants 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.870
 to say practically can not 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.300
 decipher almost nothing because the letters 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.770
 that are clearly seen are vÃ­ctor and punto 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.030
 but well let's move on to what 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.370
 interesting is kids 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.650
 it turns out that when the giant goes to 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.590
 crush our characters there 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.979
 during any time that as you see 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.639
 here you see up on the right you are 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:50.349
 watching a kind of plane this 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.240
 plane is this plane people is the plane in 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.669
 the one that we ride in mode the beat 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.580
 to go touch the guns and to go to 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.430
 golden 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.669
 to golden bridge to san bridge 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.120
 francisco and cojones now there is the plane 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.560
 of madoff from deep is simply its this 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.900
 video because this month when I was 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.550
 escape a lot of frames in the the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.469
 video yesterday and I want to tell you what I want 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.150
 tell me your theories or the 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.770
 gÃ¼icho for example has made a theory 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.020
 very good that the whole story of 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.780
 zombies is like a cycle let's go on mouse 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.939
 the beat era was like a cycle the hour 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.560
 it did not happen it was like rattle all the time 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.180
 the same time as a kind of 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.770
 cycle and it may be that the history of 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.449
 zombies are not relating this 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.419
 moment with the story of zombies that 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.979
 is a cycle and that this map the end in 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.680
 the last one in the cee room can 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.719
 signal the end of our four 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.460
 original characters but not the 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.169
 story of zombies 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.259
 these are the frames that we are 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.759
 yesterday elder people escaped and most 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.460
 you had not seen each other and that's why 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:54.470
 the video so that tell the theories what 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.750
 what do you think about this new dlc 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.409
 good theories that we can relate 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.269
 all these images 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.819
 as I understand the trailer the 

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:07.149
 quarter of lc ya trailer good will be the 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.529
 next Tuesday so nothing I do not know if in 

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:10.479
 what is here the day after is the 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.039
 presentation of the Gothic is only in the 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.959
 same day or is a day before the 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.399
 Playful alcohol presentation but good 

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:16.809
 we do not know why percent have gone up one 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:18.099
 image that I have not started in the channel 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.719
 but he does not have a lot 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.969
 importance of the advantages and such that I 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:24.759
 I think the minister most of you 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:26.169
 so nothing more people I hope has 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.149
 liked the video the frames these 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.469
 hidden these treyarch people like 

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:31.869
 I tell you in each frame of each 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.939
 trailer of each video account nothing more 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:37.199
 I hope you liked the video we'll see 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:37.199
 in the next the kids
