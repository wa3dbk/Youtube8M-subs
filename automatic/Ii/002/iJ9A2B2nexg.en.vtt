to to take that these cards all
represent<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.739> numeric<00:00:38.160> value<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.000> ace<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
represent a numeric value so in ace is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.130 
represent a numeric value so in ace is
one<00:00:39.690> jack<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.800> 11<00:00:41.219> queen<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.270> 12<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.809> king<00:00:43.020> is

one jack is 11 queen is 12 and a king is
13<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.100> numbers<00:00:44.489> between

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
13 and then all the numbers between

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
13 and then all the numbers between
those<00:00:45.090> numbers<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.260> want<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> take<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
those numbers so you want to take that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.000 
those numbers so you want to take that
card<00:00:47.190> figure<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.300> number<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
card figure out what number it is then I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
card figure out what number it is then I
want<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> double<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.730> car<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
want you to double that car so for the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.790 
want you to double that car so for the
ace<00:00:52.160> we're<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.180> plus<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.800> so

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
ace we're going to do one plus one so

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.860 
ace we're going to do one plus one so
now<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.100> were<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.550> two<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> ask<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
now we were at two so then you ask the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.270 
now we were at two so then you ask the
person<00:00:58.260> you're<00:00:58.410> doing<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> trick<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.100> add

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
person you're doing the trick on to add

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.229 
person you're doing the trick on to add
3<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.020> number<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.949> one<00:01:02.760> plus<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.149> two

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
3 to the number so one plus one is two

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
3 to the number so one plus one is two
for<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> A's<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> add<00:01:05.100> tell

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
for the A's now you're going to add tell

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.510 
for the A's now you're going to add tell
them<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.729> add<00:01:05.820> three<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.200> five

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
them to add three so they now is at five

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.910 
them to add three so they now is at five
next<00:01:08.520> you're<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> tell<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.740> push<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
next you're going to tell the push you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.770 
next you're going to tell the push you
into<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> trick<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.840> multiply<00:01:12.840> by<00:01:13.049> 5<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.909> y<00:01:15.450> 5

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
into the trick to multiply by 5 so y 5

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
into the trick to multiply by 5 so y 5
so<00:01:16.110> 5<00:01:16.140> times<00:01:16.350> 5<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.740> 25<00:01:17.360> now<00:01:18.360> we're<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
so 5 times 5 is 25 now we're going to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.969 
so 5 times 5 is 25 now we're going to
ask<00:01:18.869> him<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> look<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> suit<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> card

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
ask him to look at the suit of the card

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280 
ask him to look at the suit of the card
and<00:01:20.659> so<00:01:21.659> we're<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> tell<00:01:22.080> them<00:01:22.140> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and so we're going to tell them I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
and so we're going to tell them I
remember<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> number<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.490> down

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060

we're going to ask them to look for what
suit<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.080> diamond<00:02:02.530> you're<00:02:02.620> going<00:02:02.770> to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
suit is so the diamond you're going to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.220 
suit is so the diamond you're going to
add<00:02:02.980> one<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.490> number<00:02:03.640> if<00:02:04.450> it's<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.960> club

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
add one to that number if it's a club

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.719 
add one to that number if it's a club
you're<00:02:05.410> going<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.620> add<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:05.979> number<00:02:06.340> if

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
you're going to add to that number if

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.790 
you're going to add to that number if
it's<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.120> part<00:02:07.990> you're<00:02:08.080> going<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.289> add<00:02:08.380> 3<00:02:08.649> that

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
it's a part you're going to add 3 that

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.590 
it's a part you're going to add 3 that
number<00:02:08.830> if<00:02:09.429> it's<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.610> spade<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.090> add<00:02:10.179> 4<00:02:10.450> so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
number if it's a spade you can add 4 so

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.750 
number if it's a spade you can add 4 so
in<00:02:10.720> our<00:02:10.780> case<00:02:10.840> we're<00:02:11.200> going<00:02:11.230> take<00:02:11.440> 25<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.250> add

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
in our case we're going take 25 and add

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.940 
in our case we're going take 25 and add
1<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.270> because<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.720> dime<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.830> then

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
1 to it because it's a dime so then

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
take 26 and subtract 15 from that number

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.420 
take 26 and subtract 15 from that number
and<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.430> when<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.420> do<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:38.190> you're<00:02:39.190> going<00:02:39.340> to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
and so when you do that you're going to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.470 
and so when you do that you're going to
get<00:02:39.550> 11<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:41.200> 11<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.340> your<00:02:42.910> answer<00:02:43.360> it

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
get 11 now 11 is the your answer it

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.330 
get 11 now 11 is the your answer it
pretty<00:02:43.660> much<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.980> first<00:02:45.250> number<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
pretty much so the first number in the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.680 
pretty much so the first number in the
number<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:48.520> come<00:02:48.670> out<00:02:48.820> with<00:02:48.850> they<00:02:49.450> say

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
number that you come out with they say

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.270 
number that you come out with they say
for<00:02:49.870> example<00:02:49.989> 11<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.250> one<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.989> going<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.739> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
for example 11 so one is going to be the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.370 
for example 11 so one is going to be the
card<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.150> one<00:02:55.390> refers<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.840> ace<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.290> now

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
card it is so one refers to ace and now

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.340 
card it is so one refers to ace and now
you<00:02:56.470> know<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.709> cards<00:02:56.980> an<00:02:57.070> Ace<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:59.080> narrows

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
you know is cards an Ace so that narrows

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.259 
you know is cards an Ace so that narrows
down<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.770> four<00:02:59.980> cards<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.959> second<00:03:02.380> number<00:03:02.650> one

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
down to four cards the second number one

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.770 
down to four cards the second number one
first<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.900> suit<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.880> now<00:03:07.390> we<00:03:07.450> know<00:03:07.660> that

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
first to the suit so now we know that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.470 
first to the suit so now we know that
it's<00:03:08.080> an<00:03:08.230> ace<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.830> one<00:03:09.280> first<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.790> diamonds<00:03:10.299> so

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
it's an ace and one first of diamonds so

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.720 
it's an ace and one first of diamonds so
now<00:03:10.630> it's<00:03:10.959> an<00:03:11.019> eight<00:03:11.110> times<00:03:11.530> now<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.459> can<00:03:12.549> have

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
now it's an eight times now you can have

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.640
