adding<00:00:04.670> circles<00:00:05.120> to<00:00:05.300> your<00:00:05.420> design<00:00:05.720> couldn't

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
adding circles to your design couldn't

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:07.990 
adding circles to your design couldn't
be<00:00:06.230> easier<00:00:06.800> than<00:00:07.010> with<00:00:07.189> the<00:00:07.340> circle<00:00:07.700> scissor

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
be easier than with the circle scissor

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.089 
be easier than with the circle scissor
the<00:00:08.360> circle<00:00:09.080> scissor<00:00:09.290> will<00:00:09.530> cut<00:00:09.710> a<00:00:09.740> hundred

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
the circle scissor will cut a hundred

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.640 
the circle scissor will cut a hundred
and<00:00:10.400> twenty<00:00:10.760> different<00:00:11.179> size<00:00:11.389> circles<00:00:11.719> very

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
and twenty different size circles very

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.630 
and twenty different size circles very
easily<00:00:13.040> all<00:00:13.849> you<00:00:14.209> need<00:00:14.450> is<00:00:14.749> the<00:00:15.019> glass<00:00:15.320> mat<00:00:15.679> the

blade works it has a little tiny blade
on<00:00:25.670> it<00:00:25.700> and<00:00:26.120> as<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:26.780> can<00:00:27.020> see<00:00:27.200> it's<00:00:27.590> right<00:00:27.860> here

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
on it and as you can see it's right here

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.210 
on it and as you can see it's right here
has<00:00:29.240> a<00:00:29.270> little<00:00:29.660> tiny<00:00:29.840> blade<00:00:30.200> and<00:00:30.470> one<00:00:30.830> side<00:00:31.190> is

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
has a little tiny blade and one side is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.330 
has a little tiny blade and one side is
sharp<00:00:31.970> on<00:00:32.239> this<00:00:32.450> blade<00:00:32.780> that's<00:00:33.469> the<00:00:33.829> beveled

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
sharp on this blade that's the beveled

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.709 
sharp on this blade that's the beveled
edge<00:00:34.670> I'm<00:00:34.940> going<00:00:35.059> to<00:00:35.120> move<00:00:35.210> it<00:00:35.360> around<00:00:35.420> a

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
edge I'm going to move it around a

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.180 
edge I'm going to move it around a
little<00:00:35.749> bit<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.260> that<00:00:36.410> you<00:00:36.530> can<00:00:36.769> see<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.100> and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
little bit so that you can see it and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.169 
little bit so that you can see it and
hopefully<00:00:37.460> they'll<00:00:37.579> catch<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.030> light

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
hopefully they'll catch in the light

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.649 
hopefully they'll catch in the light
real<00:00:38.390> well<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.320> sharp<00:00:40.210> 45-degree<00:00:41.210> angle

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
real well the sharp 45-degree angle

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.509 
real well the sharp 45-degree angle
that's<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.050> beveled<00:00:42.379> angle<00:00:42.800> is<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.249> cutting

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
that's the beveled angle is the cutting

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.180 
that's the beveled angle is the cutting
edge<00:00:43.820> it's<00:00:44.780> important<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.409> hold<00:00:45.679> this<00:00:45.949> in<00:00:46.010> your

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
edge it's important to hold this in your

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.979 
edge it's important to hold this in your
hand<00:00:46.339> properly<00:00:47.059> because<00:00:47.300> that's<00:00:47.719> what's

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
hand properly because that's what's

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.559 
hand properly because that's what's
going<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.319> cut<00:00:48.679> if<00:00:49.339> for<00:00:49.640> some<00:00:49.670> reason<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.329> hold

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
going to cut if for some reason you hold

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.540 
going to cut if for some reason you hold
it<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.809> your<00:00:50.839> hand<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.469> it's<00:00:51.679> tearing<00:00:52.429> your

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
it in your hand and it's tearing your

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.270 
it in your hand and it's tearing your
paper<00:00:52.789> you<00:00:53.420> know<00:00:53.569> it's<00:00:53.749> because<00:00:54.230> it's<00:00:54.649> not<00:00:54.949> on

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
paper you know it's because it's not on

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.809 
paper you know it's because it's not on
the<00:00:55.519> cutting<00:00:56.120> edge<00:00:56.269> that<00:00:57.309> 45-degree<00:00:58.309> angle

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
the cutting edge that 45-degree angle

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:02.799 
the cutting edge that 45-degree angle
you<00:00:59.539> want<00:00:59.749> to<00:00:59.989> put<00:01:00.260> towards<00:01:00.949> your<00:01:01.489> wrist<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:02.690> if

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
you want to put towards your wrist so if

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.800 
you want to put towards your wrist so if
you're<00:01:02.989> right-handed<00:01:03.319> or<00:01:04.129> left-handed<00:01:04.810> you

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
you're right-handed or left-handed you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.959 
you're right-handed or left-handed you
still<00:01:06.140> want<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.500> 45-degree<00:01:07.340> angle<00:01:07.729> going

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
still want the 45-degree angle going

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.840 
still want the 45-degree angle going
towards<00:01:08.479> your<00:01:08.630> wrist<00:01:09.219> let's<00:01:10.219> look<00:01:10.490> at<00:01:10.670> the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
towards your wrist let's look at the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.350 
towards your wrist let's look at the
disc<00:01:11.149> right<00:01:11.420> here<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:12.680> disc<00:01:12.950> has<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.579> lot<00:01:14.149> of

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
disc right here the disc has a lot of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.209 
disc right here the disc has a lot of
holes<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.110> that's<00:01:15.290> because<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:16.009> will

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
holes on it and that's because this will

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.810 
holes on it and that's because this will
cut<00:01:16.399> 120<00:01:17.299> different<00:01:17.479> size<00:01:17.840> circle<00:01:18.380> each<00:01:19.130> hole

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
cut 120 different size circle each hole

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.480 
cut 120 different size circle each hole
is<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.750> millimeters<00:01:21.560> different<00:01:22.100> from<00:01:22.340> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
is just a millimeters different from the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.580 
is just a millimeters different from the
other<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.390> when<00:01:23.570> you're<00:01:23.719> working<00:01:23.899> with<00:01:24.350> this

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
other so when you're working with this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.130 
other so when you're working with this
you<00:01:25.189> want<00:01:25.369> to<00:01:25.490> move<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.939> around<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.659> decide

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
you want to move it around and decide

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.740 
you want to move it around and decide
which<00:01:27.680> is<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:27.950> size<00:01:28.369> circle<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.360> want<00:01:29.570> I

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
which is the size circle that you want I

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.600 
which is the size circle that you want I
simply<00:01:30.259> move<00:01:30.409> it<00:01:30.560> around<00:01:30.649> with<00:01:30.979> my<00:01:31.130> hand<00:01:31.430> to

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
simply move it around with my hand to

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.929 
simply move it around with my hand to
make<00:01:31.729> my<00:01:31.939> decision<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.930> once<00:01:33.170> I<00:01:33.350> have<00:01:33.619> that

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
make my decision and once I have that

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.700 
make my decision and once I have that
that<00:01:34.939> decided<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:35.689> look<00:01:36.109> to<00:01:36.350> make<00:01:36.530> sure<00:01:36.560> I

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
that decided I look to make sure I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.889 
that decided I look to make sure I
remember<00:01:37.159> what<00:01:37.340> number<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:38.030> was<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:38.479> cut

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
remember what number it was that I cut

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.270 
remember what number it was that I cut
because<00:01:39.229> that<00:01:39.380> will<00:01:39.469> be<00:01:39.560> important<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.070> little

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
because that will be important a little

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.789 
because that will be important a little
bit<00:01:40.399> down<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.700> road<00:01:40.909> here<00:01:41.270> as<00:01:41.560> you'll<00:01:42.560> notice

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
bit down the road here as you'll notice

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.490 
bit down the road here as you'll notice
the<00:01:43.399> circles<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.329> holes<00:01:44.570> themselves<00:01:44.810> have

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
the circles the holes themselves have

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.499 
the circles the holes themselves have
little<00:01:45.799> stems<00:01:46.219> that<00:01:46.579> stick<00:01:46.850> out<00:01:47.000> on<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.299> left

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
little stems that stick out on the left

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.749 
little stems that stick out on the left
and<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.840> right<00:01:48.049> that's<00:01:48.859> you<00:01:49.310> need<00:01:49.520> that

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
and the right that's you need that

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.719 
and the right that's you need that
because<00:01:50.030> this<00:01:50.479> pen<00:01:50.869> blade<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:52.100> blade<00:01:52.340> itself

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
because this pen blade the blade itself

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.230 
because this pen blade the blade itself
doesn't<00:01:53.090> sit<00:01:53.570> exactly<00:01:54.289> on<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:55.159> stem<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.850> comes

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
doesn't sit exactly on the stem it comes

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
that 90 degree angle which will keep you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.820

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
those different sizes that I mentioned

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.270 
those different sizes that I mentioned
before<00:03:39.330> 120<00:03:40.330> different<00:03:40.480> size<00:03:40.840> circles<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:41.560> want

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
before 120 different size circles I want

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.100 
before 120 different size circles I want
to<00:03:42.430> note<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.880> size<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.390> cut<00:03:43.750> first

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
to note the size that I cut first

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.060 
to note the size that I cut first
because<00:03:44.680> if<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:44.980> add<00:03:45.160> 5<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.060> size<00:03:46.510> I'm

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
because if I add 5 to that size I'm

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.490 
because if I add 5 to that size I'm
increasing<00:03:48.070> my<00:03:48.100> circle<00:03:48.700> by<00:03:48.880> 5<00:03:49.750> millimeters

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
increasing my circle by 5 millimeters

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.610 
increasing my circle by 5 millimeters
which<00:03:50.709> means<00:03:50.950> that<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.130> get<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.640> 1/8<00:03:52.209> inch<00:03:52.270> mat<00:03:53.200> so

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
which means that I get a 1/8 inch mat so

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.030 
which means that I get a 1/8 inch mat so
if<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.800> cut<00:03:54.040> my<00:03:54.070> photo<00:03:54.550> in<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.390> size<00:03:55.660> 70<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.650> then

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
if I cut my photo in a size 70 and then

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.260 
if I cut my photo in a size 70 and then
I<00:03:57.130> cut<00:03:57.370> my<00:03:57.550> cardstock<00:03:58.300> in<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:59.200> size<00:03:59.580> 75<00:04:00.580> I<00:04:01.000> get<00:04:01.239> a

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
I cut my cardstock in a size 75 I get a

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.010 
I cut my cardstock in a size 75 I get a
1/8<00:04:01.810> inch<00:04:01.840> mat<00:04:02.410> if<00:04:02.860> I<00:04:03.370> add<00:04:03.550> 10<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.570> number

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
1/8 inch mat if I add 10 to that number

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.190 
1/8 inch mat if I add 10 to that number
then<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.380> get<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.590> quarter<00:04:06.520> inch<00:04:06.730> mat<00:04:07.090> so<00:04:07.690> just<00:04:07.989> by

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
then I get a quarter inch mat so just by

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.500 
then I get a quarter inch mat so just by
changing<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:09.130> sizes<00:04:09.610> of<00:04:09.730> those<00:04:09.820> circles<00:04:10.330> I

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
changing the sizes of those circles I

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.080 
changing the sizes of those circles I
can<00:04:10.720> get<00:04:10.900> different<00:04:11.110> size<00:04:11.500> photo<00:04:11.980> mats<00:04:12.310> now

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
can get different size photo mats now

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.710 
can get different size photo mats now
I'm<00:04:13.360> just<00:04:13.739> going<00:04:14.739> larger<00:04:15.400> randomly<00:04:16.120> here<00:04:16.510> and

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
I'm just going larger randomly here and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.870 
I'm just going larger randomly here and
I'm<00:04:17.260> cutting<00:04:17.590> right<00:04:17.859> around<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.459> have<00:04:18.669> not

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
I'm cutting right around I have not

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.180 
I'm cutting right around I have not
picked<00:04:19.150> up<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.390> circle<00:04:19.930> scissor<00:04:20.190> because

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
picked up the circle scissor because

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.909 
picked up the circle scissor because
what<00:04:21.669> I've<00:04:21.820> done<00:04:22.090> as<00:04:22.450> I've<00:04:22.660> cut<00:04:22.930> each<00:04:23.140> time<00:04:23.560> is

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
what I've done as I've cut each time is

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.740 
what I've done as I've cut each time is
created<00:04:24.880> rings<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.950> circles

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
created rings of circles

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.960 
created rings of circles
you<00:04:27.840> can<00:04:28.050> see<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.040> can<00:04:29.250> do<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> lot<00:04:29.730> of

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
you can see that you can do a lot of

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.700 
you can see that you can do a lot of
different<00:04:30.330> things<00:04:30.510> just<00:04:30.990> by<00:04:31.140> leaving<00:04:31.590> that

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
different things just by leaving that

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.670 
different things just by leaving that
circle<00:04:32.130> scissor<00:04:32.340> right<00:04:32.640> in<00:04:32.790> place<00:04:33.440> but<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.500> want

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
circle scissor right in place but I want

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.530 
circle scissor right in place but I want
to<00:04:34.740> show<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:34.920> my<00:04:35.070> favorite<00:04:35.520> trick<00:04:35.790> if<00:04:36.330> you've

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
to show you my favorite trick if you've

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.680 
to show you my favorite trick if you've
ever<00:04:36.810> tried<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.440> cut<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.190> circle<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.880> half<00:04:38.910> it's

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
ever tried to cut a circle in half it's

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.620 
ever tried to cut a circle in half it's
hard<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.170> do<00:04:40.350> when<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.190> have<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.760> circle<00:04:42.360> and

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
hard to do when you have a circle and

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.750 
hard to do when you have a circle and
then<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.170> try<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.770> cut<00:04:44.010> down<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.370> center<00:04:44.490> even

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
then you try to cut down the center even

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.730 
then you try to cut down the center even
if<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.000> fold<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.450> in<00:04:45.570> half<00:04:45.780> first<00:04:46.050> you<00:04:46.560> don't

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
if you fold it in half first you don't

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.190 
if you fold it in half first you don't
ever<00:04:46.950> get<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.340> perfect<00:04:47.850> this<00:04:48.330> tool<00:04:48.750> will<00:04:49.020> help

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
ever get it perfect this tool will help

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.680 
ever get it perfect this tool will help
you<00:04:49.350> get<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.710> perfect<00:04:50.010> if<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:51.240> look<00:04:51.480> right

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
you get that perfect if you look right

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.780 
you get that perfect if you look right
here<00:04:51.990> in<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.200> center<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.680> have<00:04:53.190> some<00:04:53.520> lines

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
here in the center I have some lines

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.450 
here in the center I have some lines
that<00:04:54.090> dissect<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.050> center<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.800> circle<00:04:56.100> I

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
that dissect the center of the circle I

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.450 
that dissect the center of the circle I
just<00:04:57.270> take<00:04:57.540> this<00:04:57.750> line<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:58.170> I<00:04:58.860> line<00:04:59.160> it<00:04:59.370> up

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
just take this line and I line it up

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.420 
just take this line and I line it up
with<00:04:59.700> the<00:04:59.820> edge<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.360> my<00:05:00.390> paper<00:05:01.100> right<00:05:02.100> over

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
with the edge of my paper right over

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.659 
with the edge of my paper right over
here<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.060> once<00:05:04.020> I've<00:05:04.230> done<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.500> now<00:05:05.370> I'm

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
here and once I've done that now I'm

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.440 
here and once I've done that now I'm
splitting<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.330> circle<00:05:06.780> perfectly<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.650> half

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
splitting that circle perfectly in half

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.180 
splitting that circle perfectly in half
so<00:05:09.450> now<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:09.690> would<00:05:09.870> just<00:05:10.140> choose<00:05:10.530> whatever<00:05:10.800> size

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
so now I would just choose whatever size

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.540 
so now I would just choose whatever size
circle<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:11.669> want<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.970> cut<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.800> start<00:05:13.800> out<00:05:13.980> cutting

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
circle I want to cut I start out cutting

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.659 
circle I want to cut I start out cutting
on<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:15.090> glass<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.410> come<00:05:16.680> right<00:05:16.890> around<00:05:17.070> and

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
on the glass and I come right around and

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.210 
on the glass and I come right around and
then<00:05:17.820> hit<00:05:18.060> my<00:05:18.240> paper<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:19.050> cut<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:19.950> half

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
then hit my paper and cut that half

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.490 
then hit my paper and cut that half
circle<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.690> get<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.020> half<00:05:22.260> circle

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
circle and I get that half circle

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.490 
circle and I get that half circle
perfect<00:05:23.220> like<00:05:23.400> not<00:05:23.820> easy<00:05:24.030> let's<00:05:25.020> look<00:05:25.200> at<00:05:25.320> some

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
perfect like not easy let's look at some

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.250 
perfect like not easy let's look at some
pages<00:05:25.770> that<00:05:26.040> I've<00:05:26.190> made<00:05:26.430> over<00:05:26.810> here<00:05:27.810> we've

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.600 
pages that I've made over here we've
done<00:05:28.440> some<00:05:28.680> cute<00:05:28.890> things<00:05:28.919> with<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.430> half

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
done some cute things with the half

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.150 
done some cute things with the half
circles<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.240> full<00:05:30.450> circles<00:05:30.900> this<00:05:31.410> is<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.650> CD

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160
