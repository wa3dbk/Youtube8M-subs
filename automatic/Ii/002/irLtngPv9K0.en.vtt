it's not too bad just looks a different
shade<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.439> I<00:00:31.439> weld<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.940> whole

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
shade but I weld it in this whole

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.709 
shade but I weld it in this whole
section<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:36.000> through<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.450> got

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
section in here all up through here got

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.680 
section in here all up through here got
the<00:00:36.960> bank<00:00:37.230> hammered<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> bends<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.460> then

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
the bank hammered the bends and then

the bank hammered the bends and then
bent<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.100> edge<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.360> welded

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
bent the edge there and then welded

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.529 
bent the edge there and then welded
another<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.469> piece<00:00:43.710> down<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.579> that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
another little piece down here but that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.560 
another little piece down here but that
was<00:00:45.719> where<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> had<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> giant<00:00:46.410> rust<00:00:46.860> hole<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
was where I had a giant rust hole in the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.010 
was where I had a giant rust hole in the
curved<00:00:49.079> surface<00:00:50.210> same<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> other<00:00:51.600> side

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
curved surface same on the other side

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.920 
curved surface same on the other side
that<00:00:53.000> one<00:00:54.000> wasn't<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.449> big<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
that one wasn't as big you can see the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
that one wasn't as big you can see the
that<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> went<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.309> down

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that one kind of went up here and down

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.490 
that one kind of went up here and down
through<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.180> there<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> giant<00:01:00.930> rust<00:01:01.260> hole

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
through here there was a giant rust hole

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.000 
through here there was a giant rust hole
right<00:01:01.680> there

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
right there

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.359 
right there
got<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.180> patched<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.070> looks<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
got that all patched in and looks like I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.460 
got that all patched in and looks like I
got<00:01:05.750> most<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> angles<00:01:08.060> pretty<00:01:09.060> close<00:01:12.470> so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
got most of the angles pretty close so

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.899 
got most of the angles pretty close so
it's<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.830> too<00:01:14.070> bad<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.460> happy<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.470> I

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
it's not too bad I'm happy with it I

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's not too bad I'm happy with it I
tried<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.710> on<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> front<00:01:20.100> section<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
tried to on the front section here I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.649 
tried to on the front section here I
just<00:01:21.170> welded<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.799> rust<00:01:23.520> holes<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.299> then

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
just welded in some rust holes and then

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.080 
just welded in some rust holes and then
ground<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.080> down<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.310> top<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.909> whole

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
ground them down the top this whole

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.450 
ground them down the top this whole
section<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.780> rotted<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.130> wanted<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
section was rotted out so I wanted to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.840 
section was rotted out so I wanted to
have<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> put<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.920> new<00:01:31.920> piece<00:01:32.189> starting

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
have them to put a new piece starting

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.920 
have them to put a new piece starting
here<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.960> way<00:01:34.079> across<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:36.210> right<00:01:36.479> here

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
here all the way across to right here

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.550 
here all the way across to right here
and<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.619> spot<00:01:38.369> welded<00:01:38.759> some<00:01:38.939> crap<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.630> I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and then I spot welded some crap here I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.969 
and then I spot welded some crap here I
had<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.040> notch<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> holes<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> that's

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
had to notch out the holes but that's

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
had to notch out the holes but that's
got<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> most<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.090> ground<00:01:48.420> down

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
got that most of the way ground down

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.859 
got that most of the way ground down
just<00:01:49.619> got<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.460> bit<00:01:50.869> finer

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
just got to do a little bit finer

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
just got to do a little bit finer
sandpaper<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:56.310> worked<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.149> pretty

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
sandpaper on it and I worked out pretty

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
sandpaper on it and I worked out pretty
good<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> backside<00:01:59.780> I<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
good and on the backside I think I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.730 
good and on the backside I think I
showed<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> other<00:02:02.399> video<00:02:03.469> same<00:02:04.469> thing

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
showed you in the other video same thing

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.270 
showed you in the other video same thing
we<00:02:04.950> had<00:02:06.320> patched<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.619> backside<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.369> there

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
we had patched the backside of it there

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.059 
we had patched the backside of it there
you<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.270> see<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.569> strap<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:12.200> welded<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.800> there

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
you can see the strap I welded in there

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:24.120 
you can see the strap I welded in there
on<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> back<00:02:13.550> side<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.740> other<00:02:18.890> side

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.449 

and<00:02:25.130> over<00:02:25.520> on<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.940> side<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.240> welded<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:27.459> all

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
and over on this side I welded in all

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.840 
and over on this side I welded in all
that<00:02:28.989> section<00:02:29.989> there<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:31.280> already<00:02:31.520> turning

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
that section there it's already turning

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.470 
that section there it's already turning
chalky<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.690> got<00:02:32.870> done<00:02:33.050> after<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:34.120> welded<00:02:35.120> it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
chalky I just got done after I welded it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.140 
chalky I just got done after I welded it
it<00:02:35.600> was<00:02:35.720> all<00:02:35.840> rusty<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.620> sprayed<00:02:37.010> some<00:02:37.150> aslan

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
it was all rusty so I sprayed some aslan

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.670 
it was all rusty so I sprayed some aslan
it<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.600> eat<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.989> rust<00:02:39.230> off<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:41.500> once<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
it to eat the rust off it and once that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.880 
it to eat the rust off it and once that
stuff<00:02:42.920> dries<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.430> turns<00:02:43.670> all<00:02:43.850> chalky<00:02:44.720> white<00:02:44.959> so

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.130

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.240 
I'll just do a little bit of clean-up on
the<00:02:51.170> welds<00:02:51.790> ordered<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:52.940> some<00:02:53.950> acrylic<00:02:54.950> enamel

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
the welds ordered in some acrylic enamel

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.449 
the welds ordered in some acrylic enamel
paint<00:02:56.650> black<00:02:57.650> gloss<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:03:00.830> gonna<00:03:01.010> go<00:03:01.160> ahead

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
paint black gloss and I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.809 
paint black gloss and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:01.670> after<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.630> clean<00:03:03.380> these<00:03:03.500> welds<00:03:03.890> up<00:03:04.040> I'll

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
and after I clean these welds up I'll

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.910 
and after I clean these welds up I'll
smooth<00:03:05.300> out<00:03:05.510> any<00:03:05.660> little<00:03:05.900> dings<00:03:06.319> with<00:03:06.650> some

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
smooth out any little dings with some

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.820 
smooth out any little dings with some
body<00:03:07.310> filler<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.530> spray<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.650> with<00:03:09.680> some

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
body filler and spray it with some

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.640 
body filler and spray it with some
high-build<00:03:10.819> primer<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.080> smooth<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.530> out

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
high-build primer just to smooth it out

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.400 
high-build primer just to smooth it out
so<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.010> can<00:03:13.160> sand<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.580> down<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:14.200> make<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.320> look

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
so I can sand it down and make it look

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.090 
so I can sand it down and make it look
like<00:03:15.620> glass<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:17.380> spray<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.440> with<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.620> few<00:03:18.890> coats

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
like glass and spray it with a few coats

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.330 
like glass and spray it with a few coats
of<00:03:19.450> acrylic<00:03:20.450> enamel<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.230> then<00:03:22.070> I'm<00:03:22.190> going<00:03:22.310> to

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
of acrylic enamel and then I'm going to

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.000 
of acrylic enamel and then I'm going to
do<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.610> same<00:03:22.880> thing<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.690> inner<00:03:27.010> wheel

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
do the same thing on the inner wheel

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.569 
do the same thing on the inner wheel
wells<00:03:29.230> sand<00:03:30.230> them<00:03:30.440> down<00:03:30.470> do<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:30.950> same<00:03:31.250> thing

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
wells sand them down do the same thing

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.699 
wells sand them down do the same thing
so<00:03:31.910> everything<00:03:32.420> will<00:03:32.480> be<00:03:32.540> gloss<00:03:32.900> black<00:03:33.200> here

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
so everything will be gloss black here

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.410 
so everything will be gloss black here
and<00:03:33.860> then<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:34.610> think<00:03:34.820> what<00:03:34.940> I'm<00:03:35.030> going<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.180> do<00:03:35.299> is

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
and then I think what I'm going to do is

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.340 
and then I think what I'm going to do is
just<00:03:35.600> spray<00:03:36.070> I'll<00:03:37.070> do<00:03:37.250> gloss<00:03:37.549> black<00:03:37.850> in<00:03:38.350> this

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
just spray I'll do gloss black in this

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.430 
just spray I'll do gloss black in this
area<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:40.790> up<00:03:41.000> here<00:03:41.299> will<00:03:41.480> be<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.870> the

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
area and then up here will be the the
