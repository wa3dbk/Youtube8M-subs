side-to-side<00:00:11.230> slop<00:00:11.740> in<00:00:11.919> the<00:00:11.980> hangar<00:00:12.280> this<00:00:13.119> is

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
side-to-side slop in the hangar this is

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.060 
side-to-side slop in the hangar this is
important<00:00:13.659> because<00:00:13.719> especially<00:00:14.440> when<00:00:14.919> you're

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
important because especially when you're

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.130 
important because especially when you're
sliding<00:00:15.400> when<00:00:15.849> you're<00:00:16.030> going<00:00:16.570> sideways<00:00:16.960> and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
sliding when you're going sideways and

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.690 
sliding when you're going sideways and
putting<00:00:17.380> sideways<00:00:17.800> force<00:00:18.010> on<00:00:18.160> your<00:00:18.280> wheels<00:00:18.460> if

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
putting sideways force on your wheels if

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700 
putting sideways force on your wheels if
your<00:00:19.300> hangar<00:00:19.660> can<00:00:19.810> slot<00:00:20.110> back<00:00:20.290> and<00:00:20.470> forth

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
your hangar can slot back and forth

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.940 
your hangar can slot back and forth
that's<00:00:21.310> where<00:00:21.550> you<00:00:21.640> get<00:00:21.760> chatter<00:00:22.180> and<00:00:22.950> makes

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
that's where you get chatter and makes

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.710 
that's where you get chatter and makes
it<00:00:24.100> hard<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:24.550> feel<00:00:24.850> when<00:00:25.060> it's<00:00:25.180> gripping<00:00:25.570> or

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
it hard to feel when it's gripping or

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.070 
it hard to feel when it's gripping or
sliding<00:00:26.170> it<00:00:26.530> just<00:00:26.710> everything's<00:00:27.190> bad<00:00:27.340> so

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
sliding it just everything's bad so

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.820 
sliding it just everything's bad so
there<00:00:29.080> are<00:00:29.200> several<00:00:29.380> different<00:00:29.710> ways<00:00:29.770> that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
there are several different ways that

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.800 
there are several different ways that
this<00:00:30.340> is<00:00:30.460> being<00:00:30.610> done<00:00:30.730> today<00:00:31.240> which<00:00:31.780> is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
this is being done today which is

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.060 
this is being done today which is
exciting<00:00:32.349> because<00:00:32.439> that<00:00:32.619> wasn't<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:32.920> case

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
exciting because that wasn't the case

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.520 
exciting because that wasn't the case
just<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.399> few<00:00:33.430> years<00:00:33.730> ago<00:00:34.050> starting<00:00:35.050> with<00:00:35.199> of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
just a few years ago starting with of

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.110 
just a few years ago starting with of
course<00:00:35.769> the<00:00:35.980> traditional<00:00:36.460> bushing<00:00:36.909> seat

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
course the traditional bushing seat

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.209 
course the traditional bushing seat
truck<00:00:37.300> nothing<00:00:38.079> special<00:00:38.289> here<00:00:38.559> just<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.920> pivot

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
truck nothing special here just a pivot

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.160 
truck nothing special here just a pivot
and<00:00:39.399> a<00:00:39.429> round<00:00:40.030> bushing<00:00:40.329> seat<00:00:40.569> with<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.809> lip<00:00:41.019> on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
and a round bushing seat with a lip on

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.660 
and a round bushing seat with a lip on
it<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.469> hold<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.649> bushing<00:00:41.980> in<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.370> way<00:00:42.489> this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
it to hold the bushing in the way this

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.549 
it to hold the bushing in the way this
interfaces<00:00:43.300> with<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:43.480> bushing<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.109> simple

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
interfaces with the bushing is simple

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.279 
interfaces with the bushing is simple
obviously<00:00:45.120> bushing<00:00:46.120> goes<00:00:46.479> into<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.050> bushing

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
obviously bushing goes into the bushing

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.619 
obviously bushing goes into the bushing
seat<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.850> fits<00:00:51.850> hopefully<00:00:52.449> fairly

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
seat and it fits hopefully fairly

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.360 
seat and it fits hopefully fairly
tightly<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:55.889> when<00:00:56.889> you<00:00:56.979> load<00:00:57.159> it<00:00:57.280> up

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
tightly and then when you load it up

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.430 
tightly and then when you load it up
sideways<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:58.300> lip<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.929> bushing<00:00:59.199> seat

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
sideways the lip of the bushing seat

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.889 
sideways the lip of the bushing seat
bears<00:01:00.010> on<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.280> bushing<00:01:00.609> and<00:01:00.729> stops<00:01:01.659> it<00:01:01.870> from

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
bears on the bushing and stops it from

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.450 
bears on the bushing and stops it from
moving<00:01:02.260> back<00:01:02.679> and<00:01:02.829> forth<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:04.560> this<00:01:05.560> works<00:01:05.860> but

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
moving back and forth so this works but

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.550 
moving back and forth so this works but
it's<00:01:06.820> not<00:01:07.060> as<00:01:07.210> good<00:01:07.360> as<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.900> could<00:01:08.200> be<00:01:08.230> the

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
it's not as good as it could be the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.410 
it's not as good as it could be the
problems<00:01:08.920> with<00:01:09.070> this<00:01:09.280> are<00:01:09.490> basically<00:01:09.850> a

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
problems with this are basically a

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.810 
problems with this are basically a
bushing<00:01:11.260> is<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.950> very<00:01:12.280> small<00:01:12.520> piece<00:01:12.700> of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
bushing is a very small piece of

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.180 
bushing is a very small piece of
urethane<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.480> asking<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:13.960> do<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.680> job<00:01:14.950> of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
urethane and asking it to do the job of

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.950 
urethane and asking it to do the job of
providing<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.090> with<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.300> rebound<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.750> put

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
providing you with the rebound to put

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.870 
providing you with the rebound to put
you<00:01:17.050> back<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.320> center<00:01:17.620> and<00:01:17.890> resist<00:01:18.580> your<00:01:18.700> turn

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
you back to center and resist your turn

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.210 
you back to center and resist your turn
and<00:01:19.030> all<00:01:19.120> that<00:01:19.360> well<00:01:19.930> simultaneously<00:01:20.800> asking

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
and all that well simultaneously asking

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.300 
and all that well simultaneously asking
it<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.370> flex<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.970> another<00:01:22.180> direction<00:01:22.330> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it to flex in another direction to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.560 
it to flex in another direction to
eliminate<00:01:24.310> side-to-side<00:01:24.730> movement<00:01:25.150> is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
eliminate side-to-side movement is

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.630 
eliminate side-to-side movement is
really<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.380> lot<00:01:26.560> for<00:01:26.860> just<00:01:27.130> this<00:01:27.220> little<00:01:27.400> tiny

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
really a lot for just this little tiny

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.950 
really a lot for just this little tiny
piece<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.820> your<00:01:28.000> thing<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.240> do<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:28.570> as<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.780> result

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
piece of your thing to do so as a result

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.110 
piece of your thing to do so as a result
you<00:01:29.260> get<00:01:29.440> less<00:01:30.070> turn<00:01:30.310> from<00:01:30.490> your<00:01:30.580> bushing<00:01:30.940> your

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
you get less turn from your bushing your

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.210 
you get less turn from your bushing your
bushings<00:01:31.330> worked<00:01:31.540> out<00:01:31.660> faster<00:01:32.170> if<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.800> have<00:01:32.980> a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
bushings worked out faster if you have a

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.500 
bushings worked out faster if you have a
truck<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.640> out<00:01:33.760> and<00:01:33.850> sound<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.090> really<00:01:34.300> sharp

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
truck that out and sound a really sharp

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.970 
truck that out and sound a really sharp
lip<00:01:34.720> on<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:34.960> bushing<00:01:35.230> seat<00:01:35.440> you<00:01:35.590> can<00:01:35.740> cut<00:01:35.890> your

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
lip on the bushing seat you can cut your

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.940 
lip on the bushing seat you can cut your
bushings<00:01:36.280> up<00:01:36.430> over<00:01:36.670> time<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:38.230> decent

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
bushings up over time it's a decent

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.840 
bushings up over time it's a decent
solution<00:01:39.190> but<00:01:39.700> not<00:01:40.480> a<00:01:40.540> perfect<00:01:40.990> one<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
solution but not a perfect one so the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.850 
solution but not a perfect one so the
first<00:01:42.880> thing<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.630> people<00:01:44.230> try<00:01:44.500> to<00:01:44.530> do<00:01:44.710> to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
first thing that people try to do to

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.890 
first thing that people try to do to
eliminate<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.460> slop<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.030> not<00:01:46.390> make<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
eliminate this slop and not make the

floats in a plastic sleeve and so

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.759 
floats in a plastic sleeve and so
there's<00:03:08.660> still<00:03:08.930> just<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.290> little<00:03:09.319> bit<00:03:09.650> of

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
there's still just a little bit of

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.559 
there's still just a little bit of
back-and-forth<00:03:09.920> play<00:03:10.549> but<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:11.360> really

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
back-and-forth play but it's really

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.750 
back-and-forth play but it's really
pretty<00:03:11.900> good<00:03:12.080> but<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.099> important<00:03:13.459> part<00:03:13.580> with

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
pretty good but the important part with

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.220 
pretty good but the important part with
the<00:03:13.819> support<00:03:14.120> pin<00:03:14.299> is<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:14.989> allows<00:03:15.200> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
the support pin is that it allows the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.069 
the support pin is that it allows the
truck<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.799> move<00:03:15.980> up<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.370> down<00:03:16.459> as<00:03:16.849> well<00:03:17.540> so

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
truck to move up and down as well so

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.509 
truck to move up and down as well so
that<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.290> can<00:03:18.500> still<00:03:18.769> preload<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.220> bushing

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
that you can still preload the bushing

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.770 
that you can still preload the bushing
and<00:03:19.670> get<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.880> stability<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.420> need<00:03:20.600> out<00:03:20.750> of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
and get the stability you need out of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.310 
and get the stability you need out of
that<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.980> put<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:22.670> four<00:03:22.970> pin<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.870> know<00:03:23.989> pros

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
that so put this four pin you know pros

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.920 
that so put this four pin you know pros
include<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:25.760> fact<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.480> don't<00:03:26.630> have<00:03:26.810> to

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
you can change out so also a pretty good

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
come up with more ideas in the future

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.330 
come up with more ideas in the future
but<00:04:44.440> those<00:04:44.590> are<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.770> popular<00:04:45.040> ones<00:04:45.160> right<00:04:45.280> now

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
but those are the popular ones right now

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.940 
but those are the popular ones right now
and<00:04:45.580> that's<00:04:45.700> how<00:04:45.790> they<00:04:45.850> work

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
and that's how they work

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.950 
and that's how they work
