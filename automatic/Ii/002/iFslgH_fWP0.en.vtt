00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello today i would like to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.580
 more disassemble vysotsky battle for a long time 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.710
 I thought by example what song you can 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.059
 had it done so nowhere else in the clear 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.600
 not in the same song 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.609
 this fight does not go that is with the same 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.090
 number of repetitions of base elements 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.320
 wow, but the closest will be songs 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:38.480
 police report 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:42.440
 but to begin with it's sing to say we 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:48.270
 drank a little not lying 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.980
 vzashey Serge steal if the input is not washed down 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.840
 and 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.770
 training was from 3 4 5 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:01.450
 drank a second near the counter za daughters but 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.110
 it was still a color of opinion 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:11.180
 then shells baby mushrooms 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.190
 then I do not remember reached the point I was still drinking 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.729
 with the device do not eat 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:22.160
 but as glass I was well that is Austin 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:26.740
 lower husband when the stroller rolled up then 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.740
 we had 700 buried 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:36.800
 here for example now how this fight 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.800
 is played it is played as follows 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.520
 twitching thumb bass playing 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.550
 cap with index finger down 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.130
 another bass again glutly index 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:58.080
 finger down again another bass 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.720
 index finger down 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:06.000
 upstairs 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:10.320
 you run wilderness down that is 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.920
 you wrestle you galushko 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:18.300
 take you down masses 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.430
 glushko eraser show it all in 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.430
 slow pace then so here 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:03:09.650
 very clearly visible a little bit 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.569
 the fact is that this fight is not always 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.519
 played by this scheme would be more accurate to say 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.790
 he is always out of play 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.560
 this is a generalized scheme for this fight 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.579
 never pure it is so 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.500
 used because just differently it 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:31.730
 this accompaniment is not put on verses 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:35.000
 for each song you have to listen 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.970
 and look already individually that is 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.799
 you need to feel this fight is difficult 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.319
 explain but quite often even this 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.239
 the battle can be played at all ibiza and without 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.319
 elements or with a minimum amount 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:56.319
 using base dumplings that is how 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.319
 would a fight be like that 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:19.269
 yes what else would like to say that 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:25.680
 different increase the speed of this fight he 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:27.790
 can also say so change your 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.380
 that will seem a little different 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:36.400
 sounds like even in the song counter 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.930
 clicks will be won back very quickly then 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.660
 there is a pace can also be different 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:47.710
 e.g. counter click he repeated my 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:52.000
 it is necessary yes you laugh when you beat 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.140
 and price types to account for the road we run 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.340
 is visible 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:14.860
 And now he insists on me here for a leaf 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:16.570
 Canadians went to the concept exists 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.800
 many variations of this fight 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.840
 some songs are played by the way and 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.200
 without base elements in unchanged a 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.570
 stub such as morning 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.620
 gymnastics that is 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:34.900
 and your hands do not make you laugh 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.600
 grace and plastic 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.449
 that is, the minimum use as it were 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.479
 element of base 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:45.569
 Irma stub more items that is 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:49.050
 can each each song is separate 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:52.889
 case and for her this fight will be 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:06:00.589
 play a little differently so more 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:06.419
 just remind bass glushko masses galushko you 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:09.270
 down up masses galushko can play 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.419
 down up as soon as index 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.889
 finger 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:20.370
 vysotsky me playing so you can play you 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:22.830
 faith maza Glushko the middle finger 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.800
 in fact, in principle, no difference 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:29.940
 as it will be more convenient for someone like any other 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:35.160
 finger more adapted to work me 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:36.960
 in principle, no matter how to play 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.960
 In principle, everything that I would like 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.960
 I hope to tell you that I helped
