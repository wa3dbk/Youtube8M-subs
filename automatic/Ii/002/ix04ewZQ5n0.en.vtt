00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:11.049
 good to all and welcome to others 17 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.419
 this is the fifth time I am 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.960
 recording this video and in the end I'm going to 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.580
 explain why the fifth time ok in 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.910
 This video will teach them as 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.910
 enable what is the slow motion 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.710
 in help 7 the truth I do not know if it works 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.000
 for help 6 but it's worth it 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.340
 try it and ok the effective type that 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.230
 the camera is not officially activated 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.879
 slow we have well that the only 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.610
 device on which it is enabled 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.760
 the slow motion is the iphone 5 that's not 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.020
 then let's go directly to cydia 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.910
 obviously we have this right 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.260
 jailbreak because these are things that are not 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.270
 they come with the device but that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.370
 we want to enable us of that 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.100
 it is the duty to improve our 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.379
 device not ok right away let's go to 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.550
 search and we will write the following 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.739
 sl lyrics 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.379
 and we will appear in the first the 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.850
 first action that oil goes away this 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.240
 forgiveness script m 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.040
 do not do not pronounce it because obviously more 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.990
 I was telling you how to write ok 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.210
 here in the part where it gives me 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.610
 change me in it will seem to them 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.530
 the option to install in my case gives me 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.330
 very spicy to be installed after 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.970
 to install them this small will appear 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.970
 windows slope 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.700
 It was commented installed after 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.490
 install it obviously will ask them to do 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.400
 a sprint sprint and once we have 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.460
 here in the on the normal screen that 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.330
 You can obviously unlock it 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.799
 we will go to the camera and we also access 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.140
 was what I wanted to say in this part is 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.810
 I care about the audio to live the camera 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.290
 as you could see I managed to open the camera 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.729
 but every time he managed 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.850
 when I open the camera the video is improved 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:02.140
 and why was that once you edit the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.920
 video 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.300
 no matter how it was enabled in the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 slow motion right now I'm going to show you 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.730
 why did he do a screen calculation and 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.320
 before closing the camera application 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.000
 slow now and after demonstrating the photo no 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.070
 is not the video also made a video 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.620
 before making the video be before 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.540
 record be here and so they do not alight 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.030
 here is the image as you can see there 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.209
 there is a trade slow motion and it says 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.220
 not as you can see they do not see 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.930
 Well this had to record this before 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.060
 videos because as I told them every time 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.459
 recorded this one or the camera opened 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.260
 will cancel this is the recording 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.910
 so that's why I had to record 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.069
 several times video 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.480
 ok to agree what he said 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.320
 because I do not remember well because right now 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.320
 I think I go to videos 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.510
 It seems he was talking there but it's 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.280
 that all the audio sat me all the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.320
 audio I left and I forgot what 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.140
 I had said I 'm not editing the 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.570
 after several hours so I 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.730
 I forgot and it seems that it would have happened no 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.320
 already between videos and now I'm going to 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.760
 show an example of slow motion 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.260
 as I told you I was going to record here 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.030
 can edit as you can see is 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.160
 passing your hand over these little things 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.170
 blue your first and there you can determine 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.270
 the place where you want that you want 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.250
 in slow motion not if they have it paused 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.500
 to go a while they will expand what 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.840
 loose is going to make small or not like 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.030
 you can see there he continues to visit 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.500
 seeing how they are engaged in this case 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.900
 I'm putting I made a little 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.310
 demonstration with a car charger it 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.760
 for 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.610
 when I throw or I threw it and it fell and 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.319
 that's what I had to do that is the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.680
 slow motion example that I did not 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.739
 I know why it's fixing a little 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.239
 there's the damage I think there's no going to the 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.440
 reproduce not for you to see the 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.340
 slow motion example plays later 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.769
 reproduces the guys do not leave me is 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.480
 look bad in the reproduction or they were going 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.489
 to see the example with slow motion 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.989
 then I'll give you an example without 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.450
 slow motion and then after I go to 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.420
 put the two with slow motion and with 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.569
 normal camera but and you will see what the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.280
 difference and how the two of us look ok 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.049
 in this part he already removed the camera 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.170
 slow if there is not re-enabled 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:17.380
 matter there I'm going to take out the new one and 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.639
 those above because if the jobs 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.829
 like there's fast and the difference 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.090
 between the other ok but I'll show you 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.090
 the difference between the two 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.389
 Y 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.389
 two 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.199
 good guys that's all I hope you 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.740
 have liked it and if they liked it 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:41.490
 forget I like it and if it served them and this 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.710
 it goes more for the two of yesterday 6 I want that 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.320
 tell me if you have served this video 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.229
 to be able to put in the title how to put 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.370
 slow motion on yesterday 6 and 7 when guys 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.590
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.070
 this tutorial we'll see you in another tutorial 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.070
 goodbye
