00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
lot going on we had a really nice warm

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.520 
lot going on we had a really nice warm
up<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.690> first<00:02:10.720> one<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.320> season

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
up and it's the first one of the season

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.910 
up and it's the first one of the season
and<00:02:11.980> he<00:02:12.070> has<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.310> tendency<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.930> little

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and he has a tendency to just a little

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.300 
and he has a tendency to just a little
bit<00:02:15.130> sensory<00:02:15.790> overload<00:02:16.710> but<00:02:17.710> he<00:02:17.980> settled

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
bit sensory overload but he settled

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.950 
bit sensory overload but he settled
really<00:02:18.850> well<00:02:19.030> at<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.270> end<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.480> my<00:02:19.570> test<00:02:19.780> which

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
really well at the end of my test which

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.510 
really well at the end of my test which
I<00:02:20.080> was<00:02:20.200> really<00:02:20.290> happy<00:02:20.620> normally<00:02:21.280> when<00:02:21.430> he

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
I was really happy normally when he

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.500 
I was really happy normally when he
rattles<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.900> over<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:24.580> yeah<00:02:25.180> there<00:02:25.390> was

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
rattles it's over this yeah there was

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.360 
rattles it's over this yeah there was
some<00:02:25.540> great<00:02:26.050> moments<00:02:26.260> there<00:02:26.740> there<00:02:27.040> were<00:02:27.160> some

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
some great moments there there were some

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.920 
some great moments there there were some
good<00:02:27.520> moments<00:02:27.760> at<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.150> end<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.540> some<00:02:28.750> very

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
good moments at the end and some very

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.290 
good moments at the end and some very
not<00:02:29.230> good<00:02:29.530> moments<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.190> begin<00:02:30.460> with<00:02:30.670> what

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
not good moments to begin with what

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.840 
not good moments to begin with what
you're<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.810> sole<00:02:32.080> us<00:02:32.650> rider<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.250> cic

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
you're the sole us rider in the cic

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.790 
you're the sole us rider in the cic
because<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.690> think<00:02:34.990> mostly<00:02:35.230> other<00:02:35.350> riders<00:02:35.680> are

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
because I think mostly other riders are

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.410 
because I think mostly other riders are
chasing<00:02:36.010> Olympic<00:02:36.520> qualifications<00:02:37.090> what<00:02:37.240> made

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
chasing Olympic qualifications what made

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.300 
chasing Olympic qualifications what made
you<00:02:37.570> decide<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:38.020> do<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.410> one<00:02:38.710> so<00:02:38.890> early<00:02:39.190> and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
you decide to do this one so early and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.770 
you decide to do this one so early and
the<00:02:39.370> yeah<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:40.570> know<00:02:42.060> he<00:02:43.060> doesn't<00:02:43.270> need<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.570> do

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the yeah you know he doesn't need to do

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.050 
the yeah you know he doesn't need to do
any<00:02:43.930> more<00:02:44.020> intermediates<00:02:44.800> was<00:02:44.980> basically<00:02:45.460> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
any more intermediates was basically the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.180 
any more intermediates was basically the
we<00:02:46.720> finish<00:02:47.020> up<00:02:47.140> at<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.380> intermediate<00:02:47.710> here<00:02:48.100> in

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
we finish up at the intermediate here in

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.940 
we finish up at the intermediate here in
November<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.760> he<00:02:49.030> was<00:02:49.210> great<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.830> he'll<00:02:50.830> be

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
November and he was great and he'll be

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.490 
November and he was great and he'll be
11<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:51.550> year<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.150> just<00:02:52.360> kind<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.020> starting

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
11 this year and just kind of starting

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.729 
11 this year and just kind of starting
something<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:55.750> know<00:02:55.900> gave<00:02:56.230> him<00:02:56.470> a

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
something that you know gave him a

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.520 
something that you know gave him a
little<00:02:57.370> bit<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.550> something<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.940> look<00:02:58.180> at<00:02:58.420> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
little bit of something to look at and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.170 
little bit of something to look at and
the<00:02:59.530> bigger<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.040> jumps<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.400> better<00:03:00.580> he<00:03:00.910> has<00:03:01.150> a

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
the bigger the jumps the better he has a

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.960 
the bigger the jumps the better he has a
tendency<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:02.020> kind<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.380> run<00:03:02.650> through

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
tendency to just kind of run through

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.520 
tendency to just kind of run through
things<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.209> he<00:03:04.330> doesn't<00:03:04.690> respect<00:03:04.989> them<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
things if he doesn't respect them and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.000 
things if he doesn't respect them and
you<00:03:06.430> know<00:03:06.580> it's<00:03:06.790> kind<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:08.410> kind<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.830> see

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
you know it's kind of just kind of see

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.670 
you know it's kind of just kind of see

I<00:03:16.450> spent<00:03:16.900> two<00:03:17.110> weeks<00:03:17.140> on<00:03:17.500> Wellington<00:03:18.190> training

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
I spent two weeks on Wellington training

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.820 
I spent two weeks on Wellington training
with<00:03:18.730> Lauren<00:03:19.030> hawk<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.440> got<00:03:20.590> home<00:03:20.770> a

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
with Lauren hawk and I just got home a

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.530 
with Lauren hawk and I just got home a
couple<00:03:20.920> weeks<00:03:21.370> ago<00:03:21.520> so<00:03:22.000> it'll<00:03:22.390> be<00:03:22.420> interesting

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
couple weeks ago so it'll be interesting

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.790 
couple weeks ago so it'll be interesting
to<00:03:23.080> put<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.560> all<00:03:23.770> into<00:03:24.160> play<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.870> hopefully

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
to put that all into play and hopefully

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.620 
to put that all into play and hopefully
hopefully<00:03:27.070> we<00:03:27.220> learned<00:03:27.460> a<00:03:27.580> lot<00:03:27.760> what<00:03:28.330> did<00:03:28.480> she

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
hopefully we learned a lot what did she

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.950 
hopefully we learned a lot what did she
think<00:03:28.780> them<00:03:29.040> um<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.430> know<00:03:30.550> he's<00:03:30.940> kind<00:03:31.780> of

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
think them um you know he's kind of

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.320 
think them um you know he's kind of
unorthodox<00:03:32.350> sometimes<00:03:33.220> he's<00:03:33.580> not<00:03:33.790> really<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
unorthodox sometimes he's not really the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.610 
unorthodox sometimes he's not really the
