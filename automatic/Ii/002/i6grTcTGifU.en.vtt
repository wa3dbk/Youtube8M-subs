the<00:02:37.519> original<00:02:37.939> Galaxy<00:02:38.359> Note<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.349> get<00:02:39.470> an

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
the original Galaxy Note so you get an

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.860 
the original Galaxy Note so you get an
idea<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.280> kind<00:02:40.609> of<00:02:40.700> size<00:02:41.030> differences

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
idea of the kind of size differences

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.440 
idea of the kind of size differences
between<00:02:42.109> the<00:02:42.439> two<00:02:42.920> although<00:02:43.909> that's<00:02:44.180> about

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
between the two although that's about

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.960 
between the two although that's about
generation<00:02:45.349> zero<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.889> course<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.280> note<00:02:46.670> by

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
generation zero of course that note by

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.869 
generation zero of course that note by
now<00:02:47.150> um<00:02:48.019> so<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:48.889> a<00:02:48.980> decent<00:02:49.159> sized<00:02:49.489> phone<00:02:49.730> it

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
now um so it's a decent sized phone it

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.309 
now um so it's a decent sized phone it
has<00:02:49.909> there<00:02:50.150> all<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.480> access<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.079> everything

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
has there all the access to everything

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.319 
has there all the access to everything
you'd<00:02:51.620> expect<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:52.340> know<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.730> you've<00:02:52.909> got<00:02:53.060> full

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
you'd expect you know so you've got full

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.280 
you'd expect you know so you've got full

three gigs of RAM and a powerful

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.759 
three gigs of RAM and a powerful

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
the features of the phone itself first

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.740 
the features of the phone itself first
we<00:03:40.190> have<00:03:40.310> hotknot<00:03:40.699> which<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.239> screen<00:03:41.599> to

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
we have hotknot which is this screen to

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.330 
we have hotknot which is this screen to
screen<00:03:41.989> sharing<00:03:42.349> when<00:03:42.530> two<00:03:42.739> screens<00:03:43.069> are<00:03:43.220> put

screen sharing when two screens are put

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.780 
screen sharing when two screens are put
together<00:03:43.489> it's<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.569> very<00:03:45.400> quick<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.549> easy<00:03:46.579> way

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
together it's a very quick and easy way

of transferring files and staff gesture

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.710 
of transferring files and staff gesture
sensing<00:03:49.699> which<00:03:50.449> is<00:03:50.659> I<00:03:50.690> find<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.829> little<00:03:52.729> hit<00:03:53.569> or

sensing which is I find a little hit or

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.080 
sensing which is I find a little hit or
miss<00:03:53.750> mostly<00:03:54.530> miss<00:03:54.859> I<00:03:55.159> gotta<00:03:55.519> say<00:03:55.669> even<00:03:55.909> from

miss mostly miss I gotta say even from
things<00:03:56.659> like<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.930> Samsung<00:03:57.409> fall<00:03:58.099> NFC<00:03:58.729> which

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
things like the Samsung fall NFC which

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.680 
things like the Samsung fall NFC which
comes<00:04:00.440> off<00:04:00.769> as<00:04:01.430> default<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.299> have<00:04:02.329> to<00:04:02.510> switch

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
comes off as default you have to switch

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.259 
comes off as default you have to switch
that<00:04:02.840> on<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.250> then<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.430> have<00:04:04.669> things<00:04:05.120> like

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
that on and then you have things like

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.240 
that on and then you have things like
smart<00:04:05.659> wake<00:04:05.930> which<00:04:06.260> allows<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:06.949> set<00:04:07.129> up

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
smart wake which allows you to set up

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.420 
smart wake which allows you to set up
little<00:04:07.750> clever<00:04:08.750> clever<00:04:09.349> routines<00:04:09.949> so<00:04:10.280> for

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
little clever clever routines so for

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.420 
little clever clever routines so for
instance<00:04:10.669> if<00:04:10.849> I<00:04:10.970> want<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:12.040> get<00:04:13.040> straight<00:04:13.400> into

dormant screen I just hit a C and I get
in<00:04:19.220> that's<00:04:19.549> what<00:04:19.789> that<00:04:19.940> does<00:04:20.229> okay<00:04:21.229> just<00:04:21.440> to

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
in that's what that does okay just to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.010 
in that's what that does okay just to
demonstrate<00:04:21.739> how<00:04:22.219> hot<00:04:22.550> not<00:04:22.820> works<00:04:23.150> so<00:04:23.510> in<00:04:23.870> case

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
demonstrate how hot not works so in case

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.680 
demonstrate how hot not works so in case
you've<00:04:24.169> not<00:04:24.349> seen<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:24.940> ability<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.150> transfer

common<00:04:42.580> thing<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:42.910> do<00:04:43.060> is<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.360> transfer<00:04:44.050> images

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
common thing to do is to transfer images

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.370 

there<00:05:01.840> you<00:05:01.960> go

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
there you go

seconds<00:05:05.290> pretty<00:05:05.890> slick<00:05:06.280> eh<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:07.570> what<00:05:07.600> about

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
seconds pretty slick eh so what about

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.360 
seconds pretty slick eh so what about
this<00:05:08.020> raw<00:05:08.230> performance<00:05:08.410> let's<00:05:08.950> just<00:05:09.190> take<00:05:09.340> a

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
this raw performance let's just take a

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.250 
this raw performance let's just take a
quick<00:05:09.550> look<00:05:09.940> at<00:05:10.830> say<00:05:11.830> something<00:05:12.220> like<00:05:13.260> YouTube

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
quick look at say something like YouTube

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.200 
quick look at say something like YouTube
which<00:05:14.770> I've<00:05:14.890> got<00:05:15.100> queued<00:05:15.430> up<00:05:15.550> here<00:05:15.820> course<00:05:16.060> to

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
which I've got queued up here course to

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:24.600 
which I've got queued up here course to
try<00:05:16.420> and<00:05:16.450> save<00:05:17.320> time<00:05:22.500> so<00:05:23.500> here's<00:05:23.710> just<00:05:24.040> a

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
try and save time so here's just a

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.780 
try and save time so here's just a
standard<00:05:27.900> hi-def

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
standard hi-def

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.760 
standard hi-def
a<00:05:31.890> high-definition<00:05:33.660> video<00:05:34.660> as<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.440> see<00:05:35.620> it's

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
a high-definition video as you see it's

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.640 
a high-definition video as you see it's
pretty<00:05:36.130> clear<00:05:37.110> can't<00:05:38.110> see<00:05:38.290> any<00:05:38.410> glitches

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
pretty clear can't see any glitches

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.940 
pretty clear can't see any glitches
we'll<00:05:38.950> go<00:05:39.100> through<00:05:39.400> some<00:05:39.960> gaming<00:05:40.960> as<00:05:41.380> well<00:05:41.410> as

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
we'll go through some gaming as well as

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.280 
we'll go through some gaming as well as
see<00:05:42.160> what<00:05:42.340> we<00:05:42.460> can<00:05:42.610> do<00:05:42.760> with<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.150> asphalt<00:05:43.780> 8<00:05:44.700> as

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
see what we can do with the asphalt 8 as

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.710 
see what we can do with the asphalt 8 as
you<00:05:47.290> can<00:05:47.410> see<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.710> graphics<00:05:48.100> are<00:05:48.190> pretty

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
you can see the graphics are pretty

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.800 
you can see the graphics are pretty
efficient<00:05:50.070> it's<00:05:51.070> not<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.550> stutter<00:05:52.030> at<00:05:52.240> all<00:05:52.480> and

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
efficient it's not to stutter at all and

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:01.640 
efficient it's not to stutter at all and
we're<00:05:52.900> not<00:05:54.240> I'm<00:05:55.240> not<00:05:55.480> losing<00:05:55.840> any<00:05:56.940> horizon<00:05:57.940> or

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:12.770 

pretty<00:06:02.650> smooth<00:06:05.070> whoa<00:06:07.140> okay<00:06:08.400> including<00:06:09.400> flying

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.150 

so<00:06:13.780> if<00:06:13.870> we<00:06:13.990> run<00:06:14.170> around<00:06:14.290> the<00:06:14.590> phone<00:06:14.770> a<00:06:14.800> little

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
so if we run around the phone a little

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.470 
so if we run around the phone a little
bit<00:06:15.280> and<00:06:15.430> just<00:06:15.460> take<00:06:15.700> a<00:06:15.760> quick<00:06:15.970> look<00:06:16.180> we<00:06:16.360> can

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.480 
bit and just take a quick look we can

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.680 
bit and just take a quick look we can
see<00:06:16.630> volume<00:06:16.870> keys<00:06:17.490> power<00:06:18.490> key<00:06:18.880> button<00:06:19.270> here

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.450 
the fact that it is no microSD support
so<00:07:22.930> you<00:07:23.020> can't<00:07:23.230> expand<00:07:23.620> the<00:07:23.800> memory<00:07:24.010> and<00:07:24.370> you

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460 
so you can't expand the memory and you

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.060 
so you can't expand the memory and you
can't<00:07:24.850> remove<00:07:25.540> the<00:07:25.720> battery<00:07:26.140> so<00:07:26.890> that's
