the<00:00:16.289> past<00:00:16.529> you'll<00:00:17.220> remember<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:17.850> started<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the past you'll remember we started a

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.599 
the past you'll remember we started a
heavy<00:00:18.480> infusion<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> couple<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.410> weeks<00:00:19.590> ago<00:00:19.740> we

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
heavy infusion a couple of weeks ago we

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.890 
heavy infusion a couple of weeks ago we
had<00:00:20.789> twenty<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.330> thirty<00:00:21.570> different

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
had twenty to thirty different

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420 
had twenty to thirty different
ingredients<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.439> were<00:00:22.529> infusing<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> same

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
ingredients we were infusing at the same

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.630 
ingredients we were infusing at the same
time<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.390> hopes<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.619> idea<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.070> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
time the hopes was or the idea is that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.830 
time the hopes was or the idea is that
we're<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> build<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.330> library<00:00:27.539> of

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
we're going to build a library of

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
we're going to build a library of
flavors<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.859> draw<00:00:29.070> from<00:00:29.099> both<00:00:30.000> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
flavors that we can draw from both to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.759 
flavors that we can draw from both to
make<00:00:30.359> some<00:00:30.539> interest<00:00:30.840> interesting<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
make some interest interesting and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.580 
make some interest interesting and
intricate<00:00:32.009> tinctures<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.930> also<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.410> use

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
intricate tinctures and also to use

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.620 
intricate tinctures and also to use
those<00:00:34.770> flavors<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> build<00:00:35.579> literally<00:00:36.210> drop<00:00:36.480> by

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
those flavors to build literally drop by

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.500 
those flavors to build literally drop by
drop<00:00:36.690> our<00:00:37.260> first<00:00:37.829> bitters<00:00:38.340> project<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.329> that's

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
drop our first bitters project so that's

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.580 
drop our first bitters project so that's
what<00:00:39.660> we're<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.050> doing<00:00:40.170> from<00:00:40.410> here

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
what we're going to be doing from here

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.819 
what we're going to be doing from here
on<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:41.870> with<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> being<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> dead<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> winter

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
on out with it being a dead of winter

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.040 
on out with it being a dead of winter
right<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:45.539> wanted<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> concentrate

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
right now I really wanted to concentrate

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
right now I really wanted to concentrate
on<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.100> dark<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> Hardy<00:00:48.030> kind<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
on some really dark and Hardy kind of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
on some really dark and Hardy kind of
flavors<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:49.800> bitter<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.430> know

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
flavors for a very first bitter you know

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.770 
flavors for a very first bitter you know
this<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> last<00:00:51.059> us<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.329> rest<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this is going to last us the rest of the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.209 
this is going to last us the rest of the
winter

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
winter

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.389 
winter
possibly<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.980> pulled<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
possibly so I just kind of pulled a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.920 
possibly so I just kind of pulled a
couple<00:00:56.520> ingredients<00:00:56.850> together<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> think

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
couple ingredients together that I think

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.220 
couple ingredients together that I think
kind<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.170> reflect<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.649> season<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.000> have

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
kind of reflect that season so we have

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.640 
kind of reflect that season so we have
is<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.640> star<00:01:03.239> nice<00:01:03.480> focused<00:01:04.350> bitters

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
is we have a star nice focused bitters

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.990 
is we have a star nice focused bitters
with<00:01:05.430> some<00:01:05.760> coffee<00:01:06.710> also<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.790> bit<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
with some coffee also a little bit of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.450 
with some coffee also a little bit of
clove<00:01:09.210> some<00:01:09.659> cinnamon<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:11.040> our<00:01:11.130> bittern

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
clove some cinnamon and for our bittern

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.070 
clove some cinnamon and for our bittern
agents<00:01:11.850> where<00:01:12.000> we're<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.450> using<00:01:12.750> is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
agents where we're going to be using is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:40.420 
agents where we're going to be using is
some<00:01:13.470> wormwood<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:16.040> brazilwood<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.310> well

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.550 

with<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.120> bit<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.300> experimentation<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
with a little bit of experimentation and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
with a little bit of experimentation and
rebalancing<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> bidders<00:01:45.050> I've<00:01:46.050> come<00:01:46.290> up

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
rebalancing of the bidders I've come up

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
rebalancing of the bidders I've come up
with<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> formula<00:01:47.010> that<00:01:47.040> turned<00:01:47.520> out<00:01:47.640> pretty

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
with a formula that turned out pretty

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.719 
with a formula that turned out pretty
good<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.240> pretty<00:01:48.479> happy<00:01:48.690> about<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:50.340> what

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
good I'm pretty happy about so what

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.130 
good I'm pretty happy about so what
we're<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:51.479> formula

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
we're going to do with that formula

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.200 
we're going to do with that formula
literally<00:01:52.830> record<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.369> drop<00:01:53.580> by<00:01:53.729> drop<00:01:53.790> is

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
literally record it drop by drop is

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.370 
literally record it drop by drop is
we're<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> extrapolate<00:01:55.260> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
we're going to extrapolate the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.990 
we're going to extrapolate the
information<00:01:55.830> from<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> map<00:01:56.340> into<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> bigger

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
information from the map into a bigger

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.510 
information from the map into a bigger
scale<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.140> way<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.860> use<00:01:59.040> more<00:01:59.340> than

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
scale so that way we can use more than

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.590 
scale so that way we can use more than
just<00:01:59.630> what's<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.320> tiny<00:02:02.240> very<00:02:03.240> small

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
just what's in this tiny very small

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.590 
just what's in this tiny very small
amount<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.880> use<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> much<00:02:06.420> higher

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
amount here so we can use a much higher

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.260 
amount here so we can use a much higher
volumes<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.440> so<00:02:08.070> here<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.580> our<00:02:08.880> very

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
volumes in there so here it is our very

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
volumes in there so here it is our very
first<00:02:09.390> batch<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> star<00:02:10.830> nice<00:02:11.039> bitters<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.670> I'm

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
first batch of star nice bitters and I'm

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.760 
first batch of star nice bitters and I'm
really<00:02:12.090> really<00:02:12.660> happy<00:02:12.870> how<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.350> turned<00:02:13.590> out

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
really really happy how this turned out

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
really really happy how this turned out
I<00:02:14.670> did<00:02:15.000> notice<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.360> once<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:15.840> everything

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
I did notice that once we put everything

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.890 
I did notice that once we put everything
together<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.790> very<00:02:18.150> very<00:02:18.360> hot<00:02:18.600> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
together that it was very very hot and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.800 
together that it was very very hot and
you<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> lot<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.239> alcohol<00:02:21.239> on<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.570> on

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
you know have a lot of alcohol on the on

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
you know have a lot of alcohol on the on
the<00:02:21.930> palate<00:02:22.320> but<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:23.400> really

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the palate but it's not really

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.340 
the palate but it's not really
surprising<00:02:23.730> considering<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.260> know

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
surprising considering we you know

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.009 
surprising considering we you know
extracted<00:02:25.860> everything<00:02:26.220> using<00:02:26.580> Everclear<00:02:27.330> so

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019
