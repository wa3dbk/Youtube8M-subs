environments you can also activate the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.350 
environments you can also activate the
LED<00:03:36.870> flashlight<00:03:37.500> manually<00:03:38.370> by<00:03:38.760> covering<00:03:39.210> the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
LED flashlight manually by covering the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:48.280 
LED flashlight manually by covering the
light<00:03:39.570> sensor<00:03:40.080> on<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.590> device<00:03:46.610> this<00:03:47.610> is<00:03:47.670> the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
light sensor on the device this is the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.010 
light sensor on the device this is the
360<00:03:49.290> degree<00:03:49.650> detection<00:03:50.490> area<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.600> RS

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
360 degree detection area of the RS

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.040 
360 degree detection area of the RS
pinpointer<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:53.130> offers<00:03:53.760> both<00:03:54.060> horizontal<00:03:55.020> and

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
pinpointer it offers both horizontal and

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.130 
pinpointer it offers both horizontal and
vertical<00:03:55.500> scanning<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.510> easily<00:03:57.840> use

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
vertical scanning so you can easily use

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.930 
vertical scanning so you can easily use
it<00:03:58.410> flat<00:03:58.920> on<00:03:59.190> any<00:03:59.520> surface<00:04:00.030> or<00:04:00.360> inside<00:04:01.260> holes

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
it flat on any surface or inside holes

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.780 
it flat on any surface or inside holes
in<00:04:02.940> addition<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:04.050> area<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.740> waterproof<00:04:05.250> and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
in addition this area is waterproof and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.560 
in addition this area is waterproof and
it<00:04:06.090> allows<00:04:06.390> for<00:04:06.420> use<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:07.800> shallow<00:04:08.160> water

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.380 

now<00:04:12.570> let's<00:04:13.140> take<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> look<00:04:13.770> at<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.340> RS<00:04:14.760> pinpoint

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
now let's take a look at the RS pinpoint

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.409 
now let's take a look at the RS pinpoint
errs<00:04:15.570> detection<00:04:16.500> depth<00:04:16.769> using<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.580> few<00:04:17.850> sample

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
errs detection depth using a few sample

00:04:18.419 --> 00:05:56.700 
errs detection depth using a few sample
metals

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.159 

now<00:05:57.710> we<00:05:58.280> will<00:05:58.460> demonstrate<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:59.330> use<00:05:59.569> of<00:05:59.870> the

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
now we will demonstrate the use of the

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.189 
now we will demonstrate the use of the
RS<00:06:00.530> pinpointer<00:06:01.310> in<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.789> soil<00:06:02.090> and<00:06:02.330> detect<00:06:02.990> a

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
RS pinpointer in the soil and detect a

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.800 
RS pinpointer in the soil and detect a
few<00:06:03.440> metals
