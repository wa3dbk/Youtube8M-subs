down<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.540> bottom<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:26.530> here<00:01:26.920> at<00:01:27.009> Jakes<00:01:27.220> rash

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
down to the bottom so here at Jakes rash

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.400 
down to the bottom so here at Jakes rash
there's<00:01:27.759> some<00:01:27.880> nice<00:01:28.000> rollers<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.290> know

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
there's some nice rollers and you know

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.740 
there's some nice rollers and you know
some<00:01:29.560> uphill<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.009> flats<00:01:30.280> but<00:01:30.970> it's<00:01:31.330> also<00:01:31.509> got

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
some uphill and flats but it's also got

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.999 
some uphill and flats but it's also got
that<00:01:31.900> good<00:01:32.080> speed<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.530> we're<00:01:32.680> probably<00:01:32.800> doing

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
that good speed so we're probably doing

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.100 
that good speed so we're probably doing
about<00:01:33.159> 80km<00:01:33.729> hour<00:01:33.940> here<00:01:34.240> compared<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.840> danger

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
about 80km hour here compared to danger

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.650 
about 80km hour here compared to danger
Bay<00:01:35.229> which<00:01:35.410> is<00:01:35.500> prob<00:01:35.619> about<00:01:35.830> 60<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:36.970> it's<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.509> lot

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
Bay which is prob about 60 so it's a lot

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.359 
Bay which is prob about 60 so it's a lot
faster<00:01:37.930> with<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.530> sweepers<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:39.039> everything

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
faster with the sweepers and everything

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.190 
faster with the sweepers and everything
so<00:01:39.520> it's<00:01:39.820> more<00:01:39.940> of<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.119> drafting<00:01:40.660> track<00:01:40.960> and

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
so it's more of a drafting track and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:58.280 
so it's more of a drafting track and
that<00:01:41.680> changes<00:01:42.039> a<00:01:42.070> strategy<00:01:42.550> quite<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.759> bit

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.680
