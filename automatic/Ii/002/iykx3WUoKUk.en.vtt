around<00:03:44.719> of<00:03:45.469> course<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:48.109> what<00:03:48.829> happened<00:03:49.129> do<00:03:49.250> is

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
around of course so what happened do is

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.490 
around of course so what happened do is
actually<00:03:50.450> I<00:03:50.480> would<00:03:50.689> start<00:03:50.930> off<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.379> would

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
actually I would start off and I would

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.520 
actually I would start off and I would
always<00:03:51.680> do<00:03:51.950> my<00:03:52.099> shoulders<00:03:53.109> in<00:03:54.109> a<00:03:54.260> smith

machine<00:03:54.969> reason<00:03:55.969> why<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.150> because<00:03:56.389> it

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
machine reason why is because it

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.899 
machine reason why is because it
controls<00:03:57.290> its<00:03:57.680> balance<00:03:58.159> down<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.730> you're

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
controls its balance down and you're

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.729 
controls its balance down and you're
less<00:03:59.480> prone<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.810> injury<00:03:59.930> because<00:04:00.560> it's

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
less prone to injury because it's

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.179 
less prone to injury because it's
balanced<00:04:01.689> at<00:04:02.689> the<00:04:02.870> same<00:04:03.109> place<00:04:03.439> every<00:04:03.799> single

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
balanced at the same place every single

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:17.439 
balanced at the same place every single
time<00:04:05.739> sweet<00:04:06.739> hold<00:04:06.949> this<00:04:16.239> okay

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
time sweet hold this okay

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.870 
time sweet hold this okay
go<00:04:17.870> ahead<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.109> have<00:04:18.199> a<00:04:18.229> seat<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:22.280> what<00:04:22.759> I<00:04:22.789> would

go ahead and have a seat so what I would

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.120 
go ahead and have a seat so what I would
do<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.479> imagine<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.289> cement<00:04:24.740> machine

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
do so imagine this is the cement machine

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.040 
do so imagine this is the cement machine
and<00:04:25.520> really<00:04:25.820> inside<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.509> rack

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
and really inside the rack

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.439 
and really inside the rack
Smith<00:04:27.800> machines<00:04:28.190> these<00:04:28.400> things<00:04:28.669> are<00:04:29.120> actually

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
Smith machines these things are actually

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.200 
Smith machines these things are actually
bounced<00:04:30.199> up<00:04:30.349> perfectly<00:04:30.919> so<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.880> only<00:04:32.000> thing

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
bounced up perfectly so the only thing

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.719 
bounced up perfectly so the only thing
you<00:04:32.300> have<00:04:32.509> to<00:04:32.690> worry<00:04:32.870> about<00:04:33.020> is<00:04:33.610> where<00:04:34.610> you

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
you have to worry about is where you

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.390 
you have to worry about is where you
have<00:04:34.909> the<00:04:35.120> CEPA<00:04:35.630> for<00:04:36.560> me<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:37.070> would<00:04:37.370> probably

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
have the CEPA for me I would probably

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.360 
have the CEPA for me I would probably
have<00:04:37.880> this<00:04:38.090> seats<00:04:38.389> before<00:04:39.050> second<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.889> would

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
have this seats before second I would

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.550 
have this seats before second I would
have<00:04:40.520> this<00:04:40.699> seat<00:04:41.000> up<00:04:41.650> further<00:04:43.120> yeah

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
have this seat up further yeah

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.279 
have this seat up further yeah
okay<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.830> little<00:04:46.039> more<00:04:46.659> all<00:04:47.659> right<00:04:47.810> now<00:04:48.139> go

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
okay a little more all right now go

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.140 
okay a little more all right now go
ahead<00:04:48.320> have<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.590> seat

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
so I would have it to where this bar is

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.860 
so I would have it to where this bar is
already<00:04:53.030> set<00:04:53.599> it's<00:04:54.289> already<00:04:54.620> balanced<00:04:55.870> you're

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
already set it's already balanced you're

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.570 
already set it's already balanced you're
less<00:04:57.110> prone<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.470> injury<00:04:57.590> like<00:04:58.070> this<00:04:58.340> then

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
less prone to injury like this then

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.629 
less prone to injury like this then
somebody<00:04:59.030> handing<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.139> this<00:05:00.370> Olympic<00:05:01.370> bar

go up
alright<00:05:12.259> so<00:05:12.469> imagine<00:05:12.949> this<00:05:13.070> like<00:05:13.310> a<00:05:13.520> machine

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
alright so imagine this like a machine

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.399 
alright so imagine this like a machine
all<00:05:14.360> right<00:05:14.539> you're<00:05:14.810> going<00:05:14.930> to<00:05:14.990> come<00:05:15.199> down

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
all right you're going to come down

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.260 
all right you're going to come down
that's<00:05:15.860> gonna<00:05:16.009> guide<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.490> guide<00:05:16.669> to<00:05:16.849> exactly

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
that's gonna guide it guide to exactly

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.860 
that's gonna guide it guide to exactly
where<00:05:17.479> you<00:05:17.570> need<00:05:17.599> to<00:05:17.840> be<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.500> what

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
I would actually come all the way down

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.610 
I would actually come all the way down
until<00:05:22.040> touch<00:05:23.040> almost<00:05:23.880> my<00:05:24.300> tractor<00:05:24.870> as<00:05:25.200> low<00:05:25.440> as

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
until touch almost my tractor as low as

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.080 
until touch almost my tractor as low as
possible<00:05:25.710> they<00:05:26.190> don't<00:05:26.220> push<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.790> weight<00:05:26.940> up

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
possible they don't push the weight up

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.800 
possible they don't push the weight up
okay<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.260> I<00:05:28.710> would<00:05:28.860> do<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.640> would<00:05:29.970> do<00:05:30.270> for<00:05:30.480> says

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
okay and I would do I would do for says

okay and I would do I would do for says
six<00:05:31.140> to<00:05:31.290> eight<00:05:31.440> like<00:05:31.650> this<00:05:31.920> I<00:05:32.070> would<00:05:32.190> start<00:05:32.430> off

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
six to eight like this I would start off

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.570 
six to eight like this I would start off
with<00:05:32.730> 225<00:05:33.180> work<00:05:33.630> my<00:05:33.780> way<00:05:33.930> up<00:05:34.010> my<00:05:35.010> second<00:05:35.370> set<00:05:35.550> of

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
with 225 work my way up my second set of

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.720 
with 225 work my way up my second set of
being<00:05:35.820> 315<00:05:36.450> then<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.750> go<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.220> 350<00:05:38.220> then<00:05:38.400> I'll<00:05:38.520> buy

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
being 315 then I go to 350 then I'll buy

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.490 
being 315 then I go to 350 then I'll buy
life<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.030> it<00:05:39.120> would<00:05:39.210> be<00:05:39.300> four<00:05:39.510> or<00:05:39.540> five<00:05:39.690> and

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
life so it would be four or five and

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.490 
life so it would be four or five and
that<00:05:40.650> which<00:05:40.830> is<00:05:40.920> 405<00:05:41.460> aquila<00:05:45.080> so<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.110> would<00:05:46.350> do

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
that which is 405 aquila so I would do

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.240 
that which is 405 aquila so I would do
four<00:05:46.800> sets<00:05:46.850> for<00:05:47.850> shoulders<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:48.830> you<00:05:49.830> know<00:05:49.920> for

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
for behind a net price then I will move
