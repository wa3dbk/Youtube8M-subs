that's<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> jack<00:01:14.760> motion<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
that's the jack motion so when you

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
that's the jack motion so when you
practice<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:17.040> sure<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.700> are

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
doing the full range of motion

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.469 
doing the full range of motion
and<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.159> ski<00:01:20.460> skipping<00:01:21.210> steps

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and you're not ski skipping steps

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.109 
and you're not ski skipping steps
because<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> skip<00:01:22.950> steps<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.670> movement<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
because if you skip steps the movement a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999 
because if you skip steps the movement a
little<00:01:24.270> wrong<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.259> doesn't<00:01:25.680> look<00:01:25.770> good
