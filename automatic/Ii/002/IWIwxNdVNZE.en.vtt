today and that was a little triplets in
the<00:01:59.630> middle<00:01:59.869> I<00:01:59.990> mean<00:02:00.140> they<00:02:00.229> won't<00:02:00.320> play<00:02:00.590> very

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159

listening<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.610> my<00:02:07.700> mp3<00:02:07.880> player<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.599> other<00:02:08.720> day

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
listening to my mp3 player the other day

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.059 
listening to my mp3 player the other day
and<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.170> think<00:02:09.380> there<00:02:09.500> are<00:02:09.530> three<00:02:09.769> blue

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
and I think there are three blue

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.009 
and I think there are three blue
students<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.670> use<00:02:10.880> exactly<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.110> same<00:02:12.700> riff

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
students that use exactly the same riff

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.080 
students that use exactly the same riff
I<00:02:15.160> thought<00:02:16.160> that's<00:02:16.310> quite<00:02:16.580> kind<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:16.940> useful

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
I thought that's quite kind of useful

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.970 
I thought that's quite kind of useful
Benny<00:02:17.450> I'll<00:02:18.170> play<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.560> I'll<00:02:18.650> play<00:02:18.799> by

where the one will look at sea for draw

00:02:48.400 --> 00:03:08.119 
where the one will look at sea for draw
three<00:02:49.400> drawer<00:02:49.810> full

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.089 

so<00:03:09.129> that<00:03:09.840> played<00:03:10.840> at<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.230> right<00:03:11.409> tune<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.010> the

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
so that played at the right tune and the

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.330 
so that played at the right tune and the
right<00:03:12.250> tempo<00:03:13.180> food<00:03:13.689> is<00:03:14.170> kind<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.680> effective<00:03:15.220> in

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
right tempo food is kind of effective in

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.839 
right tempo food is kind of effective in
quite<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.700> lot<00:03:15.879> please<00:03:17.099> but<00:03:18.099> there's<00:03:18.340> that's<00:03:18.700> a

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
quite a lot please but there's that's a

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.660 
quite a lot please but there's that's a
simple<00:03:19.180> version<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:19.840> for<00:03:20.370> full<00:03:21.370> draw<00:03:21.609> of

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
simple version so it's for full draw of

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.259 
simple version so it's for full draw of
three<00:03:22.090> drawer<00:03:22.359> full<00:03:23.079> blow<00:03:23.849> but<00:03:24.849> I<00:03:24.879> think<00:03:25.120> it's

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
three drawer full blow but I think it's

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.860 
three drawer full blow but I think it's
worth<00:03:25.329> putting<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.970> can<00:03:28.150> add<00:03:28.420> interest

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
it with arms and so for example if you

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:56.699 
it with arms and so for example if you
do<00:03:44.409> just<00:03:44.439> do<00:03:44.889> it<00:03:44.980> straight<00:03:55.409> sounds<00:03:56.409> like<00:03:56.500> that

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
do just do it straight sounds like that

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.729 
do just do it straight sounds like that
spinning<00:03:57.129> how<00:03:57.370> fast<00:03:57.670> he<00:03:57.849> play<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.450> if<00:03:59.349> you<00:03:59.590> add

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
in the four drawer Bend every other time

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:13.350 
in the four drawer Bend every other time
sounds<00:04:02.799> like

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.140 

before<00:04:14.080> example<00:04:14.500> or<00:04:15.460> you<00:04:15.610> can<00:04:15.790> put<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.060> in

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
before example or you can put it in

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.479 
before example or you can put it in
every<00:04:16.450> other<00:04:16.540> third<00:04:17.200> time<00:04:17.709> or<00:04:18.070> second<00:04:18.459> time

every other third time or second time

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.099 
every other third time or second time
we'll<00:04:18.790> just<00:04:18.910> drop<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.390> in<00:04:19.480> whenever<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.900> want

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
we'll just drop it in whenever you want

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.680 
we'll just drop it in whenever you want
just<00:04:20.940> makes<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.180> little<00:04:22.300> bit<00:04:22.450> more

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
just makes it a little bit more

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.550 
just makes it a little bit more
interesting<00:04:24.480> so<00:04:25.480> that's<00:04:25.630> about<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.050> really<00:04:26.260> so

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
interesting so that's about it really so

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.790 
interesting so that's about it really so
is<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:28.300> full<00:04:28.510> full<00:04:29.020> rift<00:04:29.260> would<00:04:29.440> be<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.590> suppose

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
is the full full rift would be I suppose

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:43.170 
is the full full rift would be I suppose
like<00:04:30.070> this<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.830> it's<00:04:41.950> for<00:04:42.190> draw<00:04:42.700> three

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
like this and so it's for draw three

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.130 
like this and so it's for draw three
drawer<00:04:43.510> for<00:04:44.020> drawer<00:04:45.090> slots<00:04:46.090> full<00:04:46.300> blaze<00:04:46.540> 420

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
drawer for drawer slots full blaze 420

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.020 
drawer for drawer slots full blaze 420
half<00:04:47.440> step<00:04:48.330> three<00:04:49.330> drawer<00:04:50.040> full<00:04:51.040> bleh<00:04:51.280> and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
half step three drawer full bleh and

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.820 
half step three drawer full bleh and
just<00:04:52.240> keep<00:04:52.390> their<00:04:52.630> now<00:04:52.810> only<00:04:53.110> over<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.710> over

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
just keep their now only over and over

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.330 
just keep their now only over and over
again<00:04:53.980> its<00:04:54.310> crew<00:04:54.520> reasonably<00:04:55.480> easy<00:04:55.630> practice

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
again its crew reasonably easy practice

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.100 
again its crew reasonably easy practice
but<00:04:57.340> anyway<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.730> hope<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.210> helps<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.900> had

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
but anyway I hope that helps I had

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.920 
but anyway I hope that helps I had
that's<00:04:59.290> probably<00:04:59.680> quite<00:04:59.890> round<00:05:00.100> because<00:05:00.930> that

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
that's probably quite round because that

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.130 
that's probably quite round because that
in<00:05:02.160> my<00:05:03.160> every<00:05:03.370> deal<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.669> very<00:05:03.940> good<00:05:04.870> luck<00:05:05.020> the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
in my every deal is very good luck the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.680 
in my every deal is very good luck the
