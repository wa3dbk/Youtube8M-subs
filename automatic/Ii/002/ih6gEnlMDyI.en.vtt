00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.920
 o paa other gamers who access the blog 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.529
 consoles of brazil games and a channel in 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.890
 youtube again they have more 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.250
 a video about the wonderful sony 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 to recent data transformers in the game 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.710
 What fun has this video provoked? 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.020
 you may already notice that it is a video 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.090
 shorter a simple video I want 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.000
 basically show you 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.620
 the last unlockable character in the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.980
 world tour module 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.800
 is about the character titled and x 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.289
 which in my view was simply something 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.520
 genial introduce a character like him 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.539
 in this game 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.229
 jack and chalk is not a specific icon he 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.750
 is the junction of classic icons of the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.900
 not just games 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 good how can you understand the way 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.560
 terrestrial 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.869
 my vehicle is the game car will surface 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.580
 a classic of the '90s from the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.979
 you saw how it looks and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.720
 also in aerial mode so it's already 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.520
 I selected this clue so that you 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.740
 can see all the options of 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.930
 gameplay with this vehicle since 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.280
 this track we have the three modalities 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.650
 starting the second lap I'll leave 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.860
 you hear a little of the sound of the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.860
 car 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.070
 He's not saying anything now just because 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.440
 I left 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:59.830
 but there is the narrator of the tonic and 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.830
 Turn around and turn water mode. 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.030
 is the knot is genius turned to and we have the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.550
 classic sound of that road had 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.310
 nostalgic of harvest and it turns 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.270
 in nothing less than a control 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.010
 dreamcast adapted from here to the top 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.630
 fei ta the right water 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.630
 with propellers and everything else 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.739
 The cool thing is that it makes the sounds 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.540
 dover thousand and we are also the 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.540
 listen carefully 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.240
 very cool, right? 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.000
 I do not see how cool the daee's narrator is 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.940
 That's why it's interesting. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.100
 disable the swimmer of this game here 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.190
 when we play with the character and 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.410
 jes since he has the right narrator 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.120
 so it gets a little annoying and now it comes in 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.480
 in air mode and now we can 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.310
 to think that the airplane is that good it is a 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.670
 jet aircraft of the game was same name 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.530
 afterburner is another classic of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.930
 old and tac also doing their 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.200
 blessing we do not just have the clue of the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.870
 burner but also the vehicle and that's it 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.270
 Guys now look how cool the way 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.470
