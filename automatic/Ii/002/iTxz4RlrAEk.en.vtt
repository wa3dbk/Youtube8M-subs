00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.490
 hi friends from youtube I bring you mine 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.740
 geo is complete with 181 games the 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.929
 link are in the video description 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.299
 we copy each link and paste it in 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.210
 our browser will get something like that 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.850
 as in this video we click where 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.700
 says download and with all the links 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.700
 remaining are 11 parts 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.900
 as I already have it I close my browser 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.900
 and I cancel the downloads 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.360
 already finished the downloads with the 11 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.520
 files in rar we select the first 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.160
 and we right click and extract 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.050
 active where you want now 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.370
 we have to wait for the end of 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.120
 decompression 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.120
 I will summarize it 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.170
 and decompression will be completed 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.559
 this folder we look for the ne file or 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.260
 rage x 5.0 and we do a shortcut 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.840
 to the desktop we select it by clicking 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.440
 right and send to desktop access 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.770
 direct and that would be all we close already 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.770
 to play 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.690
 if you look closely here says 181 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.690

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.050

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.380

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.380

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.890
 of life 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.099
