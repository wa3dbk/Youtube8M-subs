differently the same piece on the
brother<00:01:22.590> Opus<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.960> also<00:01:25.909> if<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.240> zoom<00:01:27.540> in

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.749 

over<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:34.220> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.990> paper<00:01:36.990> release<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.890> shaped

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
over here on the paper release is shaped

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.730 
over here on the paper release is shaped
slightly<00:01:39.420> different<00:01:39.869> than<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.380> paper

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
slightly different than the paper

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
slightly different than the paper
release<00:01:41.159> latch<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.259> brother<00:01:44.570> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
release latch on the the brother the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
release latch on the the brother the
brother<00:01:45.810> Opus<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.860> passed<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.399> same

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
brother Opus but it passed the same

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.039 
brother Opus but it passed the same
function<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.450> these<00:01:49.259> slight<00:01:50.070> differences

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
function so these slight differences

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.539 
function so these slight differences
can't<00:01:52.140> maybe<00:01:52.470> attribute<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> fact<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
can't maybe attribute to the fact that

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.600 
can't maybe attribute to the fact that
they<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.970> weren't<00:01:54.210> made<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.799> same<00:01:56.009> years

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
they just weren't made in the same years

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.010 
they just weren't made in the same years
but<00:01:57.590> for<00:01:58.590> all<00:01:58.680> intents<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.219> purposes<00:02:00.020> it's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
but for all intents and purposes it's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.880
