this<00:00:00.240> is<00:00:00.450> Healey<00:00:01.050> flyer<00:00:01.639> which<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.790> an<00:00:02.939> app

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
this is Healey flyer which is an app

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.550 
this is Healey flyer which is an app
that<00:00:03.480> I've<00:00:04.259> created<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:06.020> it's<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.200> helicopter

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
that I've created and it's a helicopter

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.860 
that I've created and it's a helicopter
game<00:00:08.340> slash<00:00:08.849> simulator<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:11.330> it<00:00:12.330> allows<00:00:12.599> you

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
game slash simulator and it allows you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
game slash simulator and it allows you
to<00:00:13.790> fly<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:15.389> RC<00:00:15.839> helicopter<00:00:16.650> using<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.250> iPhone

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
to fly an RC helicopter using the iPhone

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.320 
to fly an RC helicopter using the iPhone
or<00:00:18.270> iPod<00:00:18.600> Touch<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:20.119> there's<00:00:21.119> different

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
or iPod Touch and there's different

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.410 
or iPod Touch and there's different
difficulty<00:00:22.020> levels<00:00:22.939> we'll<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.150> choose<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
difficulty levels we'll just choose a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.830 
difficulty levels we'll just choose a
flying<00:00:24.810> field<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> easiest

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
flying field here this is the easiest

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.700 
flying field here this is the easiest
level<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> tilt<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:34.110> tilt<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
level and you use the tilt to tilt the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.530 
level and you use the tilt to tilt the
helicopter<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> throttle<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
helicopter this is the throttle on the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.069 
helicopter this is the throttle on the
left<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.489> throttle<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> has<00:00:42.899> no

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
left so if I throttle up so this has no

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.000 
left so if I throttle up so this has no
rudder<00:00:43.350> control<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.520> very<00:00:44.760> basic

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
rudder control this is just very basic

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.240 
rudder control this is just very basic
uses<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> tilt<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.879> tilt<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> helicopter<00:00:49.250> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
uses the tilt to tilt the helicopter and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.990 
uses the tilt to tilt the helicopter and
it<00:00:50.940> has<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> lot<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> stabilization<00:00:51.780> so

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
it has a lot of stabilization so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.700 
it has a lot of stabilization so
helicopter<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.390> reacting<00:00:54.930> slowly<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
helicopter is reacting slowly just to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.410 
helicopter is reacting slowly just to
help<00:00:55.860> beginners<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:59.210> they<00:01:00.210> don't<00:01:00.390> crash

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:19.550 

hooha<00:01:05.689> if<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.869> fly<00:01:07.080> too<00:01:07.159> far<00:01:08.159> away

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.950 

boom<00:01:20.780> little<00:01:21.780> crash<00:01:22.170> they're<00:01:23.540> cycling<00:01:24.540> real

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
boom little crash they're cycling real

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
boom little crash they're cycling real
rck<00:01:25.440> helicopter<00:01:26.010> crash<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> time

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
rck helicopter crash all the time

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.150 
rck helicopter crash all the time
alright<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.890> hit<00:01:29.100> options<00:01:30.770> I'm<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> go

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
alright if I hit options I'm going to go

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.420 
alright if I hit options I'm going to go
into<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.910> hard<00:01:33.150> mode<00:01:33.740> which<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.070> actually

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
into the hard mode which if you actually

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
into the hard mode which if you actually
fly<00:01:35.670> RC<00:01:36.060> helicopters<00:01:36.660> it's<00:01:37.290> probably<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> lot

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
fly RC helicopters it's probably a lot

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
fly RC helicopters it's probably a lot
easier<00:01:37.830> for<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.550> because<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.150> has<00:01:39.360> both

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
easier for you because this has both

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.320 
easier for you because this has both
stick<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.619> tilt<00:01:40.890> doesn't<00:01:41.820> matter<00:01:42.000> anymore

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
stick so the tilt doesn't matter anymore

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.870 
stick so the tilt doesn't matter anymore
now<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.280> using<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
now you're just going to be using the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.719 
now you're just going to be using the
two<00:01:45.060> sticks<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.590> an<00:01:47.430> RC

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
two sticks just like you would an RC

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.660 
two sticks just like you would an RC
helicopters<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.510> throttle<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.410> down

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
helicopters is throttle up and down

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.210 
helicopters is throttle up and down
rudder<00:01:50.670> left<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.450> MN<00:01:52.110> cyclic<00:01:52.649> which<00:01:53.009> is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
rudder left and right MN cyclic which is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.270 
rudder left and right MN cyclic which is
for<00:01:53.369> tilting<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> helicopter<00:01:57.920> there<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.070> go<00:01:59.190> I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
for tilting the helicopter there we go I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.800 
for tilting the helicopter there we go I
can<00:01:59.369> spin<00:01:59.700> around<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> little

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
can spin around so you have a little

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.889 
can spin around so you have a little
green<00:02:00.990> light<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.880> tells<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.390> where<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.630> front

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
green light it tells you where the front

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.510 
green light it tells you where the front
of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> helicopter<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.820> will<00:02:05.820> fly<00:02:06.030> by<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.520> you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
of the helicopter is will fly by and you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.970 
of the helicopter is will fly by and you
can<00:02:11.610> fly<00:02:11.790> upside<00:02:12.209> down<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.140> beginning<00:02:13.800> mode

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
can fly upside down and beginning mode

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.550 
can fly upside down and beginning mode
you<00:02:14.160> can't<00:02:14.370> fly<00:02:14.580> upside-down<00:02:14.910> because<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
you can't fly upside-down because it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.670 
you can't fly upside-down because it
limits<00:02:16.890> how<00:02:17.130> far<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.520> can<00:02:17.700> tilt<00:02:18.410> just<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.530> help

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
limits how far you can tilt just to help

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.280 
limits how far you can tilt just to help
you<00:02:19.830> out<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> beginning<00:02:21.170> there<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.440> go<00:02:24.290> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you out in the beginning there we go and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.070 
you out in the beginning there we go and
this<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:26.610> helicopter<00:02:27.239> that's<00:02:27.390> provided<00:02:27.930> they

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
this the helicopter that's provided they

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.680 
this the helicopter that's provided they
use<00:02:28.410> five<00:02:28.860> hundred<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:31.260> um<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:33.120> physics<00:02:33.540> are

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
use five hundred it um it's physics are

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.080 
use five hundred it um it's physics are
kind<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.290> scale<00:02:34.920> helicopter

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.289 

whoa<00:02:40.100> it's<00:02:41.100> physics<00:02:41.519> are<00:02:41.640> more<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.910> scale

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
whoa it's physics are more like a scale

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.570 
whoa it's physics are more like a scale
helicopter<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.049> it's<00:02:43.170> not<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.560> react<00:02:44.340> as

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
helicopter so it's not going to react as

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.840 
helicopter so it's not going to react as
quickly<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> stunt<00:02:47.070> RC<00:02:48.000> helicopter<00:02:48.630> or

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
quickly is like a stunt RC helicopter or

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.870 
quickly is like a stunt RC helicopter or
but<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.090> plan<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.480> adding<00:02:51.840> more<00:02:52.400> nimble<00:02:53.400> fast

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
but I plan on adding more nimble fast

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.220 
but I plan on adding more nimble fast
helicopters<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> future<00:02:56.180> so

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:09.940 

upside<00:03:01.230> down<00:03:01.260> flying<00:03:01.800> Oh

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.990 

so<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.220> app<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.580> $1.99<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:14.430> start<00:03:14.670> out<00:03:14.819> with

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
so this app is $1.99 to start out with

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.870 
so this app is $1.99 to start out with
and<00:03:15.920> it's<00:03:16.920> probably<00:03:17.099> going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.760> App

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
and it's probably going to be in the App

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.670 
and it's probably going to be in the App
Store<00:03:18.300> in<00:03:20.209> mid-august<00:03:21.290> because<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.380> just

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
Store in mid-august because I just

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.080 
Store in mid-august because I just
submitted<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.069> few<00:03:26.220> days<00:03:26.400> ago<00:03:26.580> middle

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
submitted it just a few days ago middle

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.890 
submitted it just a few days ago middle
of<00:03:27.209> July<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.200> might<00:03:28.980> take<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.190> while<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.900> get

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
of July and so might take a while to get

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.199 
of July and so might take a while to get
into<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.110> store<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.650> great<00:03:31.860> way<00:03:32.040> to

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
into the store but it's a great way to

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.570 
into the store but it's a great way to
learn<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.269> fly<00:03:33.630> an<00:03:33.930> RC<00:03:34.049> helicopter<00:03:34.769> or<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.430> you

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
learn to fly an RC helicopter or if you

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.160 
learn to fly an RC helicopter or if you
fly<00:03:35.819> RC<00:03:36.150> helicopters<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:36.810> good<00:03:36.959> way<00:03:37.110> to

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
fly RC helicopters it's good way to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.479 
fly RC helicopters it's good way to
practice<00:03:37.489> different<00:03:38.489> stunts<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:40.489> while

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
practice different stunts and while

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.930 
practice different stunts and while
you're<00:03:42.110> anywhere<00:03:43.110> with<00:03:43.380> your<00:03:43.560> iPhone<00:03:44.010> so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
you're anywhere with your iPhone so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.089 
you're anywhere with your iPhone so
here's<00:03:45.180> all<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.450> different<00:03:45.840> settings<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.830> I

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
here's all the different settings so I

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.100 
here's all the different settings so I
can<00:03:47.310> change<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:48.000> under<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.510> Advanced<00:03:48.720> Mode<00:03:49.019> I

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
can change in under the Advanced Mode I

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.979 
can change in under the Advanced Mode I
can<00:03:49.260> change<00:03:49.470> all<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.030> tilt<00:03:51.030> sensitivity

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
can change all the tilt sensitivity

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.089 
can change all the tilt sensitivity
forward<00:03:52.709> speed<00:03:53.010> thrust<00:03:54.440> speed<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.860> tail

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
forward speed thrust speed of the tail

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.380 
forward speed thrust speed of the tail
rotor<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.470> add<00:03:58.680> drift<00:03:59.430> which<00:04:00.000> makes<00:04:00.269> it

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
rotor and I can add drift which makes it

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.190 
rotor and I can add drift which makes it
a<00:04:00.480> which<00:04:01.230> acts<00:04:01.560> like<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:02.480> which<00:04:03.480> adds<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.870> tail

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
a which acts like a which adds the tail

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.880 
a which acts like a which adds the tail
rotor<00:04:04.470> thrust<00:04:05.310> which<00:04:05.760> makes<00:04:06.030> when<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:07.739> when

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
rotor thrust which makes when so when

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.099 
rotor thrust which makes when so when
you<00:04:07.980> take<00:04:08.190> off<00:04:08.400> your<00:04:08.820> helicopter<00:04:09.630> would<00:04:09.810> kind

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
you take off your helicopter would kind

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.240 
you take off your helicopter would kind
of<00:04:10.280> push<00:04:11.280> towards<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.730> left<00:04:12.230> so<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> box<00:04:13.620> put

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
of push towards the left so a box put

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.520 
of push towards the left so a box put
you<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.609> flying<00:04:15.090> box<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.109> can't<00:04:16.289> fly<00:04:16.470> too

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
you in a flying box so you can't fly too

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.029 
you in a flying box so you can't fly too
far<00:04:16.680> away<00:04:17.390> tilt<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:19.229> actually<00:04:19.530> limits<00:04:19.950> the

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
far away tilt that actually limits the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.060 
far away tilt that actually limits the
tilt<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:21.419> all<00:04:22.410> right<00:04:22.620> that's<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.640> aphelion

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
tilt so all right that's the aphelion

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.420 
tilt so all right that's the aphelion
look<00:04:26.070> for<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.430> on<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:27.210> App<00:04:27.539> Store<00:04:28.280> mid<00:04:29.280> up

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
look for it on the App Store mid up

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.770 
look for it on the App Store mid up
mid-august<00:04:29.970> or<00:04:30.630> beginning<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.680> September

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
mid-august or beginning of September

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.020 
mid-august or beginning of September
