00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 Famous dog Lassi 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:15.420
 Pu'tsu and to school every day in the village with a United Kingdom 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.910
 There was a clever dog going to meet her husband's feelings 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.910
 The name is Lassi 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.540
 A sheet of wooler sheet 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:40.970
 It 's like a good brother , 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 I am asked to give it by the rich Nordling duke because it is the most impressive dog in the village I guess 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.100
 But 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.990
 Upper Dad has always refused 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.240
 However, there is 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:59.810
 The work of the coal mine where my father worked is gone 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.810
 Now trouble in living in the top of the house 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:09.290
 So my father can not help 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:11.560
 Beneath it decided to get a Lassi to the field ring Duke 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.560
 Uu 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.600
 It seems that he was taken to a duke's villa in Scotland 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.520
 Sorrow thinking above 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.520
 Don't talk about food 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.090
 Duke who came to see state with granddaughter Priscilla 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.219
 Ask the breeding staff 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.219
 How is the condition of the dog 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.620
 It does not eat any food 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.659
 Also raise the Priscilla feast 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.050
 I do not eat 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.870
 Seems to have been separated from the place of good friends 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.870
 Priscilla thought sorry 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.330
 Pedigree lack of exercise's 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.710
 And the keepers are said to Duke 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.450
 Pulled out from the bottom 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.480
 At that time 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.819
 It seems like I shook my head a lot 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:28.260
 The collar ran out and it started running out 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.260
 Kohler or Tei 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:36.060
 c 9 will frantically chase 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.400
 Priscilla who saw this opened the other softly 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.400
 I missed Lassi .
