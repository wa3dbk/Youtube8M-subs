BlackBerry OS version 4.6 take a look at

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.600 
BlackBerry OS version 4.6 take a look at
the<00:00:33.270> keyboard<00:00:34.020> will<00:00:34.920> create<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> keyboard<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the keyboard will create a keyboard you

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.830 
the keyboard will create a keyboard you
can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.030> much<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
can see it's very much like that on a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.170 
can see it's very much like that on a
previous<00:00:37.500> curve<00:00:37.829> devices<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> keys

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
previous curve devices and that the keys

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.940 
previous curve devices and that the keys
all<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.600> spacing<00:00:40.170> between<00:00:40.320> them<00:00:40.680> unlike

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
all have spacing between them unlike

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.700 
all have spacing between them unlike
those<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> old<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.690> 8800<00:00:43.559> series

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
those on the old and the 8800 series

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.139 
those on the old and the 8800 series
devices<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> past<00:00:44.640> which<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:45.030> all

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
devices in the past which are all

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.020 
devices in the past which are all
buttered<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.930> against<00:00:46.260> each<00:00:46.350> other

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
buttered all right up against each other

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.100 
buttered all right up against each other
personally<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.149> find<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.510> keyboard<00:00:48.840> even

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
personally I find this keyboard even

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
personally I find this keyboard even
better<00:00:49.260> than<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> bold<00:00:50.239> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
better than the one on the bold the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.209 
better than the one on the bold the
trackball<00:00:51.840> seems<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.410> smaller<00:00:52.920> on

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
trackball seems a little bit smaller on

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.160 
trackball seems a little bit smaller on
the<00:00:53.300> 8900<00:00:54.300> series<00:00:54.629> though<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.050> also

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the 8900 series though and it's also

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
the 8900 series though and it's also
black<00:00:55.590> instead<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.010> white<00:00:56.180> not<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.300> much<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> fan

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
black instead of white not as much a fan

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
black instead of white not as much a fan
of<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.870> seems<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> little<00:00:58.289> bit<00:00:58.500> harder<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
of that seems a little bit harder to

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
of that seems a little bit harder to
press<00:00:59.039> down<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.340> little<00:01:00.210> less<00:01:00.420> convenient

it's actually plastic and I don't know
