fallout<00:01:57.640> 3<00:01:57.850> glitches<00:01:58.299> I<00:01:58.450> feel<00:01:58.810> like<00:01:58.990> this<00:01:59.140> is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
fallout 3 glitches I feel like this is

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.070 
fallout 3 glitches I feel like this is
way<00:01:59.799> more<00:01:59.830> glitch<00:02:00.460> here<00:02:00.700> than<00:02:00.909> fallout<00:02:01.630> 3<00:02:01.900> do

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
way more glitch here than fallout 3 do

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
way more glitch here than fallout 3 do
you<00:02:02.140> think<00:02:02.320> it's<00:02:02.409> because<00:02:02.560> they<00:02:02.650> pushed<00:02:02.950> it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
you think it's because they pushed it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.620 
you think it's because they pushed it
out<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.400> door<00:02:03.520> quickie<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:04.270> could<00:02:04.479> be

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
out the door quickie that could be

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.930 
out the door quickie that could be
because<00:02:04.960> it's<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.470> vast<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.220> they're<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:06.610> made

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
because it's so vast and they're so made

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.729 
because it's so vast and they're so made
much<00:02:07.240> dialogue<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:08.080> actually<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.470> mind

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
much dialogue it actually is mind

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.680 
much dialogue it actually is mind
boggling<00:02:09.280> months<00:02:09.790> in<00:02:10.030> this<00:02:10.119> studio<00:02:10.390> just

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
boggling months in this studio just

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.110 
boggling months in this studio just
recording<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.350> dialogue<00:02:12.160> let<00:02:12.610> alone<00:02:12.790> writing

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
recording the dialogue let alone writing

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.820 
recording the dialogue let alone writing
the<00:02:13.360> dialogue<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.989> just<00:02:14.260> think<00:02:14.410> when<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.590> build

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the dialogue I just think when you build

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.250 
the dialogue I just think when you build
a<00:02:15.040> system<00:02:15.370> that's<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:15.940> rich<00:02:16.180> with<00:02:16.480> detail<00:02:16.750> and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
a system that's so rich with detail and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.590 
a system that's so rich with detail and
gameplay<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.190> there's<00:02:18.700> bound<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.150> be<00:02:19.239> flaws

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
gameplay that there's bound to be flaws

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.780 
gameplay that there's bound to be flaws
you<00:02:20.049> can't<00:02:20.410> get<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.860> perfected<00:02:21.250> because<00:02:21.640> it

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
you can't get it perfected because it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.520 
you can't get it perfected because it
would<00:02:21.880> take<00:02:22.060> another<00:02:22.420> two<00:02:22.870> three<00:02:23.260> years

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
would take another two three years

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.259 
would take another two three years
development<00:02:24.190> I'm<00:02:24.400> one<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> disappointing

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
development I'm one of the disappointing

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.550 
development I'm one of the disappointing
things<00:02:25.420> for<00:02:25.630> me<00:02:25.750> as<00:02:25.900> they<00:02:26.049> built<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.500> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
things for me as they built it on the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.759 
things for me as they built it on the
same<00:02:26.890> engine<00:02:27.310> yeah<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.030> fallout<00:02:28.360> 3<00:02:28.630> did<00:02:28.930> look

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
same engine yeah but fallout 3 did look

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.100 
same engine yeah but fallout 3 did look
great<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.489> for<00:02:30.730> what<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.000> they<00:02:31.540> look<00:02:31.690> good

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
great like for what it is they look good

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.830 
great like for what it is they look good
it's<00:02:32.260> like<00:02:32.440> huge<00:02:32.860> yes<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.519> look<00:02:33.700> good<00:02:33.940> but

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
it's like huge yes and look good but

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.870 
it's like huge yes and look good but

that's<00:03:59.270> ever<00:03:59.510> existed<00:03:59.690> now<00:04:00.350> I<00:04:00.380> find<00:04:00.800> follow

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
that's ever existed now I find follow

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.800 
that's ever existed now I find follow
challenging<00:04:01.910> enough<00:04:02.120> as<00:04:02.239> it<00:04:02.360> is<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:02.630> this

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
challenging enough as it is so this

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.240 
challenging enough as it is so this
doesn't<00:04:03.020> really<00:04:03.170> interest<00:04:03.530> me<00:04:03.650> things<00:04:04.130> like

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
doesn't really interest me things like

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.760 
doesn't really interest me things like
health<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:05.510> don't<00:04:05.720> get<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.989> immediately<00:04:06.410> it

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
health you don't get it immediately it

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.890 
health you don't get it immediately it
comes<00:04:07.070> back<00:04:07.310> over<00:04:07.580> time<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:08.300> it's<00:04:08.630> like<00:04:08.750> these

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
comes back over time so it's like these

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.930 
comes back over time so it's like these
little<00:04:09.380> things<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.770> they<00:04:10.010> put<00:04:10.370> into<00:04:10.640> the

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.060 
just seemed a little bit funnier than
fallout<00:06:19.850> 3<00:06:20.270> but<00:06:20.630> it<00:06:21.169> also<00:06:21.350> took<00:06:21.560> a<00:06:21.830> lot<00:06:22.010> of

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
fallout 3 but it also took a lot of

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.060 
fallout 3 but it also took a lot of
those<00:06:22.930> defects<00:06:23.930> from<00:06:24.260> fallout<00:06:24.650> 3

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
that we had to restart the game because

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.760 
that we had to restart the game because
