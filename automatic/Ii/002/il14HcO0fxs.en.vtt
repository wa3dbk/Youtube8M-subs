00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.950 
you could see since my last video
there's<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.190> been<00:00:47.460> much<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.329> it's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
there's not been much going on it's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
there's not been much going on it's
still<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> same<00:00:49.500> old<00:00:49.890> same<00:00:50.129> old<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.670> they're

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
still the same old same old and they're

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
still the same old same old and they're
still<00:00:51.059> giving<00:00:51.480> me<00:00:51.600> preseason<00:00:52.140> storylines<00:00:52.710> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
still giving me preseason storylines so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100 
still giving me preseason storylines so
let's<00:00:53.039> get<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.090> draft<00:00:54.719> class<00:00:55.079> this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
let's get on to the draft class this

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.860 
let's get on to the draft class this
year<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> surprising<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
year which is kind of surprising if you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.470 
year which is kind of surprising if you
look<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.520> consensus<00:01:00.180> number

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
look at it because the consensus number

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.810 
look at it because the consensus number
one<00:01:00.629> overall<00:01:00.809> pick<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.219> none<00:01:02.789> other

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
one overall pick as of now is none other

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.020 
one overall pick as of now is none other
than<00:01:03.059> Texas<00:01:03.570> anims<00:01:03.930> Jake<00:01:04.320> Matthews<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
than Texas anims Jake Matthews and the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.840 
than Texas anims Jake Matthews and the
thing<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:07.080> completely<00:01:07.920> blew<00:01:08.430> me

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
thing that I just completely blew me

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.750 
thing that I just completely blew me
away<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.479> how<00:01:10.170> Taylor<00:01:10.770> Martinez<00:01:11.310> is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
away was how Taylor Martinez is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.219 
away was how Taylor Martinez is
considered<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.840> top<00:01:13.200> 10<00:01:13.619> pick<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.479> if<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.990> go

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
considered a top 10 pick and if you go

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.890 
considered a top 10 pick and if you go
down<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.580> mock<00:01:17.970> draft<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.630> now

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
down and look at a mock draft right now

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.340 
down and look at a mock draft right now
if<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.310> being<00:01:20.670> generous<00:01:21.299> Taylor<00:01:21.780> Martinez

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
if it's being generous Taylor Martinez

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.160 
if it's being generous Taylor Martinez
would<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.280> maybe<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.759> fourth<00:01:24.060> round<00:01:24.420> or

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
would go and maybe the fourth round or

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.020 
would go and maybe the fourth round or
maybe<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.619> third<00:01:25.830> round<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.790> being

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
maybe the third round if it's being

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
maybe the third round if it's being
generous<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.470> can't<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:28.770> talk<00:01:29.100> right

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
generous and you can't really talk right

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.890 
generous and you can't really talk right
now<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.180> season<00:01:30.540> hasn't<00:01:30.689> started

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
now because the season hasn't started

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.929 
now because the season hasn't started
yet<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> doc<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:32.009> him<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> fact<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
yet but the doc on him is the fact that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.929 
yet but the doc on him is the fact that
he's<00:01:33.119> only<00:01:33.270> 6<00:01:33.630> foot<00:01:33.840> 1<00:01:34.079> he's<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.560> tiny<00:01:34.939> but

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
he's only 6 foot 1 he's really tiny but

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.780 
he's only 6 foot 1 he's really tiny but
as<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.810> go<00:01:36.930> down<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:37.619> Logan<00:01:38.159> Thomas<00:01:38.400> as

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
as you go down you see Logan Thomas as

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.410

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.330 
he is projected to be drafted but unless
if<00:01:43.750> he<00:01:43.840> has<00:01:43.960> an<00:01:44.140> amazing<00:01:44.259> year<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.130> year<00:01:45.189> I

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
if he has an amazing year this year I

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.310
