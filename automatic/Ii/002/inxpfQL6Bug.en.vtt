00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.100
 well my name is my tomato today in the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.730
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.030
 use the advance there is of woman this 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.440
 is a program that does maintenance to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.999
 our team 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.520
 the version that I will use is going 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.110
 systemcare version 5.2 has to be 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.760
 professional or what should be 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.830
 patched 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.830
 so that it gives us all the utilities 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.170
 finish 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.380
 then we go here to tools 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.840
 here in tools we are going to scan 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.970
 cloned files 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.350
 we click there 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.830
 and we select the unit that we want 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.870
 clean in this case I'm going to use t 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.970
 to see everything that I have repeated 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.140
 music videos photos everything you have 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.740
 repeated here here is showing us 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.870
 avi file types mpg 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.870
 you have to give it in safe mode 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.800
 erase everything that is here the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.909
 Word files that are repeated 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.340
 bmp jpg p 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.730
 and after everything is already selected 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 we give next 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.789
 here it will appear 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.039
 all the files that we have cloned 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.039
 or repeated in our our team 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.070
 until now we carry 3000 4000 miren 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.940
 the number of repeated files that 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.940
 we have 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.980
 we see 4,399 duplicate files 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.640
 we give some time for him to finish 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 good here 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.090
 already here it is ending and we are going 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.870
 five thousand 349 files repeated 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.960
 of a quantity 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.960
 disk space that was being occupied 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:17.220
 once finished and we already see the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:21.140
 amount of files we proceed to give 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.200
 click on see results 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.480
 espn 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.080
 Here he shows us everything we have 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.080
 repeated 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.659
 so for example we can see this 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.650
 video tutorial that weighs 183 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:38.989
 these two times it 's in this folder and 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.870
 this one repeated in this folder the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.440
 safe mode allows us to guess which of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.170
 we both want to eliminate if 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.090
 that is up because it is below this 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.410
 joe arroyo song the we have two 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:03:00.070
 Sometimes it tells us in which direction 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.070
 why route is the file repeated 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.790
 we can see everything we have repeated 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.790
 pdf 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.799
 Here we can see by size the quantity 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.269
 of space and we can also see the 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.230
 number of files repeated if you 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.420
 we click on the next button let's go 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.359
 to see the amount of spaces my disk 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:28.430
 hard I was practically stuck I have 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:31.680
 free space I simply have 6.42 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.930
 gigabytes of free space 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.510
 and let's see how much how much space 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.230
 we release now that we do the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.230
 process 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.910
 repeat 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:49.180
 then the only limitation of the mode 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.610
 sure is that we have to eliminate one 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.069
 one the files if we do not choose new ones 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.049
 sure he removes all the files 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.109
 the advantage in a safe way is that we can 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.840
 eliminate deciding which of the two 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.129
 repeated files we can delete if 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.519
 which is in one direction or must be 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.420
 to be in another one here, it's up to us one for 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.870
 one 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.599
 go giving to the file we can after 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.060
 select it we can click on which one 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.039
 of the two if the top one good job 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.440
 many times we find files that 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.750
 they are up to 4 and 5 times repeated in 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.680
 our team this is a procedure 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.440
 quite 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.660
 the long 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.610
 but it's enough space that we're going to 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.610
 release in our team 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.940
 well and giving click and enter click and 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.360
 enter to make the process more more 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.360
 fast 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.080
 and here we see for example a file that 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.380
 is four times repeated in our 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.530
 team 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.530
 and each one weighs 5.98 megs 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.539
 once that has finished that already 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.699
 we have finished cleaning the 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:12.030
 files we are going to give you a clean 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.560
 I strongly advise that this be done 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.949
 you just have to click here on 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.949
 having 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.650
 Here we find the amount of 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.780
 problems that we have malware a 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.030
 registry deep cleaning the 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.780
 system optimization all 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.780
 he found errors 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.310
 hard drive cleanups and we give to 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.310
 repair 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.699
 because we do this because the archives 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.680
 occupied a space and according to the reggae ti 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.850
 those files will no longer appear 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.520
 so we have to make a 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.380
 cleaning to update the 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.009
 licorice bases here we see that we have 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:57.259
 works 13.9 and we had previously six 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:59.770
 points 3.5 we achieved almost 67 gb in 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.770
 space 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.169
 but everyone remember that they have to 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.239
 have the avÃ¡nzit file 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:13.080
 interprofessional 

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:17.370
 licensed with the one I have with him 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.050
 with material so they can have this 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.250
 utility if they do not have it like that they will not 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.250
 work that is very good 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.470
