00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 hello everyone started and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.450
 we found the ones point out analysis of the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.150
 minecraft snap 15w of 33 is a new 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.220
 option with regard to the future 1.9 in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 the future version of pc mix and I'm going 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.890
 to put the challenge of 500 light guys 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.180
 We will overcome this challenge as always 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 We thank you very much for your 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.809
 hand up your comment in the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 video and good we start with said 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.770
 analysis let's go to it the first change 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.750
 against this snapshot and it's pretty 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 striking is with respect to the new 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.570
 positions that they have implemented on 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.640
 this because functions that we have for 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.179
 here they are called linier and in fact those that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.100
 well there it is that in Spanish it means 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.390
 persistent and persistent are possible 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.949
 as I already say because when 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.510
 strips are like splash functions but 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.379
 with another texture we put here I'm going to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.749
 catch others that even another guy I'm going to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.089
 take regeneration for example up 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.190
 that this regeneration script 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.749
 when the strips the effect stays in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.309
 the zone we go through here and this generated by 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:10.110
 example if I take one more mode or lower 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.479
 a mod spam and take for example a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.800
 pig with a piglet is worth or if 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.200
 has the secret for here for the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.909
 piglet is going to take the speed effect 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.149
 As you can see the effect does not last long 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.130
 the effect after a while is removed and say that 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.689
 the range and duration of the effect 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.700
 on the ground you can modify the + 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.500
 maker will be able to modify how much 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.610
 distance will effect these functions to 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.710
 same as in the time that will be 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.329
 possible in effect on the ground a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.829
 example of these new positions is 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.190
 that there is a peace adventure map is a 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.990
 trap and to do this 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.640
 I am disparate in positions and in that 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.260
 zone and you start to go through the area 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.970
 in question and they start hurting 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.590
 they really seem good positions to me 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.180
 This part of the session will be a 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.680
 more spectrum for adventure but this what 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.730
 good that it has is that they can make 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.860
 the most maker because I said 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.630
 previously modify the duration of 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.910
 them and this is a good time in an area 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.710
 determined and such attack by going through what 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.360
 so much I really like it here 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.130
 would be the splash these are the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.930
 exploit all of life since there would be 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.300
 new lingerie that in Spanish 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.740
 means but persistent why that's better 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.450
 because they persist and in the area of ​​what 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.670
 we have pulled persistent I think it was 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.260
 persistent yes and to punish him 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.150
 we need a new object generates 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.010
 doing this is a bottle that is the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.320
 dragon break that is being breath of 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.810
 Spanish dragon the tenth translation 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.420
 What are we doing crazy packaging? 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.580
 when it releases the tension of the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.230
 particles this is the one you have to catch 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.670
 with him he picks them up and I have him here in 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.380
 my hand is made by the dragon 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.730
 break and with this dragon breath 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.560
 you can do the new functions that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.980
 you need a normal position for example 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.140
 is of hearts 2 and with power the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.450
 we would turn into splash 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.220
 and once you put the dragon break a 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.050
 Once you have become since Splice 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.000
 You can have the new position of the 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.270
 inder ins that are the permanent ones are 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.220
 that previously taught here we have it 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.510
 link hering owns an angel yes and is the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.740
 threw around here will be a while in this 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.140
 zone for example because it 's a new 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.280
 persistent position on the other hand the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.120
 Change injury with force position 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.010
 right now what we are seeing 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.600
 screen the previous version the version 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.730
 32 of the nation- and that of the week 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.989
 last is for you to see the change the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.209
 last week in the positions of 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.770
 force appeared the attack percentage 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.709
 when I applied this possible force 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.000
 gave him 130 percent more attack 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.550
 same goes with the level two ways by 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.120
 here 460 just like it also happens with 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.350
 the splash over 130,260 and well now 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.290
 I am in the station of this 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.420
 week the 33 and with more over here now what 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.940
 what it says is basically the damage 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.519
 directly mastretta attack mastretta 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.420
 attack more and is attack and more site 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.489
 attack as it is here totally 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.110
 different before they left percentage I did not 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.400
 what you put directly the 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.630
 extension of attack is to say if you 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.980
 you have a sword and you drink the potion 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.870
 of force is clear 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.670
 a master or attack with those pay for 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.620
 example on the other hand on the day not 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.970
 Analyze a change with the in gateway to 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.099
 this portal that allows us to go to the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.390
 people to the citi and basically to change the 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.409
 texture like here the animation is 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.209
 totally different from seeing the 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.370
 materials and now so to speak more 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.879
 pretty and good guys up here the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.349
 analysis of these nations 15w 33 to today 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.730
 its effect the beta version has also 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.379
 left to fix because the version 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.670
 both versions both the time and the 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.200
 same what they see they focus on 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.970
 fix some important fixes like 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.290
 the version but good if you liked 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.610
 the video as I said at the beginning 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.900
 video thank you very much for sharing it
