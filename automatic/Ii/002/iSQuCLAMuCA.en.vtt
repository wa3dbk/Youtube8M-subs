00:00:05.290 --> 00:01:02.660
Why the LEICA M9 is the best LEICA camera
for the professional photographer.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:10.340
The LEICA M9, a camera that carries the folklore
of Leica M video cameras in to the electronic

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.340
age.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.340
It is the tiniest full-format digital unit
camera the globe has actually ever before

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.340
seen.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.440
In short: it is a modern device for all who
demand the greatest standards in image top

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.229
quality and passion independence of composition.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.200
The combination of a very high-resolution
image sensor, the superior efficiency of M

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.380
lenses, and innovative handling of the caught
digital info makes sure the most effective

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.380
imaging lead to all photo circumstances.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.380
The 18-megapixel CCD picture sensor, particularly
designed and grown for this video camera,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.780
enables the capture of the complete 35-mm
film style without any sort of concessions.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.729
All M lenses placed on the M9 or M9-P offer
the very same angle of view they had when

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:44.729
making use of movie material.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.790
This means that the high resolution and one-of-a-kind
imaging high quality of the now-digital M9

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.330
and M9-P are qualified of fully making use
of the enormous potentials of M lenses.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.659
Or, in various other words: when it come to
the M9 and M9-P, it wasn't a concern of modifying

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.640
the lenses to match the image sensor, yet
instead vice versa.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.800
This results in pictures particularly abundant
thoroughly.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800
Natural.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800
Authentic.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.802
Without concession.
