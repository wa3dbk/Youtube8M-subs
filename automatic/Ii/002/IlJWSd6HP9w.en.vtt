is powerful and God is Almighty but do
you<00:00:25.990> really<00:00:26.230> believe<00:00:26.650> that<00:00:26.680> in<00:00:27.039> your<00:00:27.160> heart<00:00:27.460> of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
you really believe that in your heart of

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.300 
you really believe that in your heart of
hearts<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:29.050> know<00:00:29.170> I<00:00:29.199> think<00:00:29.440> that<00:00:29.710> many<00:00:29.980> of<00:00:30.160> us

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
hearts you know I think that many of us

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.760 
hearts you know I think that many of us
at<00:00:30.610> least<00:00:30.670> pay<00:00:31.360> lip<00:00:31.690> service<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:32.140> these<00:00:32.439> things

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
at least pay lip service to these things

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.580 
at least pay lip service to these things
about<00:00:33.070> God<00:00:33.399> in<00:00:33.789> our<00:00:34.449> minds<00:00:34.899> we<00:00:35.079> do<00:00:35.260> believe

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
about God in our minds we do believe

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.670 
about God in our minds we do believe
that<00:00:35.800> he<00:00:36.190> is<00:00:36.309> all<00:00:36.550> these<00:00:36.789> things<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:38.469> then<00:00:38.649> I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
that he is all these things but then I

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.529 
that he is all these things but then I
think<00:00:39.039> something<00:00:39.399> else<00:00:39.519> happens<00:00:40.089> with<00:00:40.179> many

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
think something else happens with many

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.360 
think something else happens with many
of<00:00:40.719> us<00:00:40.899> particularly<00:00:41.379> when<00:00:41.679> difficulties

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
of us particularly when difficulties

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.849 
of us particularly when difficulties
come<00:00:42.429> up<00:00:42.909> you<00:00:43.749> know<00:00:43.780> when<00:00:44.050> you're<00:00:44.199> challenged

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
in some really significant way maybe

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.410 
in some really significant way maybe
you've<00:00:47.589> lost<00:00:47.829> your<00:00:48.129> job<00:00:48.399> and<00:00:48.429> you<00:00:48.789> you<00:00:49.239> don't

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
you've lost your job and you you don't

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.610

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
faithfully but you pray with so much

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.340 
faithfully but you pray with so much
anxiety<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:03.579> with<00:01:03.760> so<00:01:04.570> little<00:01:04.900> expectation

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
anxiety and with so little expectation

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.240 
anxiety and with so little expectation
that<00:01:06.040> God<00:01:06.220> is<00:01:06.369> going<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.729> help<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:08.220> well<00:01:09.220> I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
that God is going to help you well I

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.010 
that God is going to help you well I
wonder<00:01:09.670> if<00:01:09.790> some<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.180> us<00:01:10.299> when<00:01:10.510> we<00:01:10.659> do<00:01:10.840> those

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
wonder if some of us when we do those

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.530 
wonder if some of us when we do those
things<00:01:11.080> if<00:01:11.620> we<00:01:11.830> aren't<00:01:12.250> really<00:01:12.540> developing

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
things if we aren't really developing

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.120 
things if we aren't really developing
kind<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:13.930> God<00:01:14.200> as<00:01:14.470> a<00:01:14.500> split<00:01:14.950> personality

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
kind of God as a split personality

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.310 
kind of God as a split personality
here's<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.120> God<00:01:16.300> we<00:01:16.480> learned<00:01:16.720> about<00:01:16.870> in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
here's the God we learned about in

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.770 
here's the God we learned about in
Sunday<00:01:18.310> school<00:01:18.340> maybe<00:01:18.910> but<00:01:19.210> here's<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.600> God

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
Sunday school maybe but here's the God

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.770 
Sunday school maybe but here's the God
we<00:01:20.050> wonder<00:01:20.650> about<00:01:20.830> in<00:01:21.130> our<00:01:21.250> own<00:01:21.400> minds<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.210> we

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
we wonder about in our own minds and we

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.140 
we wonder about in our own minds and we
develop<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.320> shadow<00:01:23.650> image<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.250> God<00:01:24.430> if<00:01:24.730> you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
develop a shadow image of God if you

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.600 
develop a shadow image of God if you
will<00:01:25.540> that<00:01:25.870> really<00:01:26.320> introduces<00:01:27.040> a<00:01:27.070> lot<00:01:27.250> of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
will that really introduces a lot of

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.800 
will that really introduces a lot of
doubt<00:01:27.910> in<00:01:28.270> in<00:01:29.050> this<00:01:29.230> portrait<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.920> God

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
doubt in in this portrait of God

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.880 
doubt in in this portrait of God
you<00:01:31.810> know<00:01:31.900> scripture<00:01:32.380> talks<00:01:32.650> about

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
you know scripture talks about

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.890 
you know scripture talks about
magnifying<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.000> Lord<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.510> remember

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
magnifying the Lord and I remember

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.590 
magnifying the Lord and I remember
hearing<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.380> phrase<00:01:35.620> and<00:01:35.890> thinking<00:01:36.310> well

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
hearing that phrase and thinking well

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.450 
hearing that phrase and thinking well
how<00:01:37.600> can<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:37.840> magnify<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.710> biggest<00:01:39.250> guy<00:01:39.430> in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
how can you magnify the biggest guy in

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.970 
how can you magnify the biggest guy in
the<00:01:39.640> universe<00:01:40.120> I<00:01:40.360> mean<00:01:40.470> he's<00:01:41.470> already<00:01:41.710> the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
the universe I mean he's already the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.580 
the universe I mean he's already the
biggest<00:01:42.430> person<00:01:43.120> that<00:01:43.660> I<00:01:43.690> know<00:01:43.900> how<00:01:44.350> could<00:01:44.530> I

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
biggest person that I know how could I

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.920 
biggest person that I know how could I
possibly<00:01:44.860> make<00:01:45.370> him<00:01:45.520> any<00:01:45.670> bigger<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.780> then<00:01:46.900> I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
possibly make him any bigger and then I

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.450 
possibly make him any bigger and then I
thought<00:01:47.230> well<00:01:47.410> maybe<00:01:47.440> what<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.950> Bible<00:01:48.340> is

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
thought well maybe what the Bible is

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.060 
thought well maybe what the Bible is
talking<00:01:48.730> about<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:49.690> that<00:01:49.900> I<00:01:50.140> should<00:01:50.800> hold

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
talking about is just that I should hold

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.850 
talking about is just that I should hold
a<00:01:51.280> magnifying<00:01:51.909> glass<00:01:52.030> up<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.630> God<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.170> look

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
a magnifying glass up to God and look

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.090 
a magnifying glass up to God and look
more<00:01:54.040> clearly<00:01:54.700> at<00:01:54.909> who<00:01:55.300> he<00:01:55.480> is<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.770> know<00:01:56.800> what

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
more clearly at who he is you know what

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.960 
more clearly at who he is you know what

you know I think as we do this as we

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.160 
you know I think as we do this as we
hold<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.890> magnifying<00:02:11.610> glass<00:02:11.819> close<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.959> God

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
our picture of him grows bigger and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.570 
our picture of him grows bigger and
stronger<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.390> clearer<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:20.069> we<00:02:20.310> begin

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
stronger and clearer and then we begin

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.000 
stronger and clearer and then we begin

and we began to act and think and and do
things<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.010> way<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.220> reflects<00:02:26.940> this

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
things in a way that reflects this

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.870 
things in a way that reflects this
larger<00:02:27.720> understanding<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.590> God<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.160> then<00:02:29.850> God

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
larger understanding of God and then God

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.240 
larger understanding of God and then God
makes<00:02:30.420> us<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.170> magnifying<00:02:31.709> glass

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
makes us like a little magnifying glass

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.790 
makes us like a little magnifying glass
so<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.670> other<00:02:32.880> people<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.480> come<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.380> see<00:02:34.410> God

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
so that other people can come to see God

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.940
