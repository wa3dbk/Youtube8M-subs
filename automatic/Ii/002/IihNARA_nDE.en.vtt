00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.710
 hello today we are going to learn how to recycle 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.969
 our cutlery cookware 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.950
 of wood to create this effect and that 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.500
 they look pretty and totally 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.590
 originals I hope you like the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.779
 materials that we will need are the 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.480
 wooden cutlery or utensils 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.000
 kitchen we're going to recycle tape 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.680
 painter a brochita to help us 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.430
 Remove excess paint and 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.230
 colors that we are going to use paint 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.800
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.380
 place the painter's tape and depending 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.750
 of how we want it to be in our 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.390
 case this is going to go all this in color 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.640
 here we would finish the cut we have done 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.580
 a bit like you see diagonally and this 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.590
 I would have lines, you have to 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.989
 paste the painter's tape well 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.949
 that there is no loophole for the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.949
 paint does not enter inside 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.350
 Well, we have our list ready 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.760
 mark you can submerge the paint and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.530
 then remove the excess with a 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 brochita as I do not have left 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.040
 enough paint to cover 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.300
 until the brand I'm going to help from a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.760
 roller to paint it worth 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.760
 then we immerse ourselves 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.200
 we extend this 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.490
 always removing the excess and we will go 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.610
 painting 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.600
 little by little until you cover up the brand 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.600
 as I said 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.450
 As you can see we are doing the same in 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.250
 the other covered very important that we 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.110
 go past the last mark is worth it because if 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.110
 you are not going to paint the upper area 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.469
 when we have them completely 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.280
 covered in paint the area that 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.799
 we want to paint 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.950
 let's let it dry as you see in a 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.970
 straight surface without touching the area 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.700
 graffiti 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.450
 once it is dry, as you can see we have 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.920
 removed the painter's tape and that would be 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.380
 the end result is pretty 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.080
 original and striking above all to the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.820
 time to present our dishes if you 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.170
