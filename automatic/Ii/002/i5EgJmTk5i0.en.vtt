 emilie simon shaw mansour you own a mythical house this 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.410
 overhead induces so alongside cherbourg life so how do you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.339
 known mythical and why have chosen it as a builder 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.460
 well I work in real estate so the nuisances do not know when 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.249
 even a bit 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.619
 and for 100 ml I know a little the builders the advantage of meetic this 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.559
 that I like very much it is an economy that could make to build oneself 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:29.869
 part of the house 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.600
 so that's why I went to see mystic 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.280
 and m of a sudden we worked with the track the benefit on all of this 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.580
 that we want what we propose was really impeccable matched 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.770
 totally what we were looking for 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.559
 so how did your passion go and your advisor is small 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.710
 the best of the world that is to say that 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.250
 from the first appointments they explained everything to us it was a 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.270
 poet our craft how they combine to be placed and who do not do them 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.930
 different posts he explained to us how the Italians found a 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.790
 little ground how was going to be all the construction and they did not we 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 never abandoned that is to say that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.810
 or the mysteries of signing the contract 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.500
 until the end even after handing over the keys we always had someone 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.240
 was going on just pass a little net and immediately he 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.080
 was here 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.350
 it's true it's a privileged relationship 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.460
 how much time has elapsed between the signing of the contract the receipt of 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.470
 keys of your house 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.530
 four months using early construction started early January 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
 we had our house in late April exactly what we had been told 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.410
 and how long did it take to pass and who defines its interior 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.740
 well we went into the house% at the end of September on the 30th of September so he 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.929
 it took us five months to rebuild everything 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.699
 we did not work weekends and evenings and we had taken a fortnight of 

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:45.689
 vacation my mate and me job for armand ferland the biggest 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.290
 so it was very fast that in nine months we had our house all 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.380
 ready paint iron that had more than put the building back to settle 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.910
 did you call the free help a team a little bit at all 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.110
 everything is extremely well explained the Libyan rebels gave a little 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.939
 book 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.499
 so inside that like comics everything is explained by 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.009
 report to what finally the order forms to the bursts course how to ask 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.549
 tiling that adds must indeed do and what makes that we could not 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.650
 not to do everything in ten years it appeared a step and we absolutely 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.799
 need no technician 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.629
 what would you say to a friend who wish to appeal to the housing solution 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.479
 Of type 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.039
 it's the best solution that is not already passionate for wide yoga 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.749
 that is to say with the small budget we could not do a concert of 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.859
 build like that 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.519
 there we had a case we did our job even the advantage is that it 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.969
 lasts a short time this perco we knew what is a German group after we have 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.569
 a house 9 serpa works before 15 years we are really quiet 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.109
 and f it totally changes life 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.599

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.819
