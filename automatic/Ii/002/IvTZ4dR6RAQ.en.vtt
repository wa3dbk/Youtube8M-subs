be coming out with a pedal system it's a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.410 
be coming out with a pedal system it's a
good<00:00:19.650> question<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.100> know<00:00:20.189> when<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.760> design

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
good question you know when we design

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.700 
good question you know when we design
products<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.810> linear<00:00:22.080> systems<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
products of linear systems we like to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.980 
products of linear systems we like to
make<00:00:22.830> sure<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.220> good<00:00:23.550> innovations<00:00:24.480> in

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
make sure we have good innovations in

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.439 
make sure we have good innovations in
case<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.710> talked<00:00:25.890> about<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.250> air<00:00:26.369> pro<00:00:26.580> maxi

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
case we talked about the air pro maxi

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
case we talked about the air pro maxi
it's<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.080> great<00:00:28.230> example<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.830> innovation<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it's a great example of innovation I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's a great example of innovation I
think<00:00:30.260> when<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> time<00:00:31.560> comes<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.270> can

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
think when the time comes that we can

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.060 
think when the time comes that we can
come<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.719> truly<00:00:34.020> innovative<00:00:34.440> pedal

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
come up with a truly innovative pedal

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.650 
come up with a truly innovative pedal
drive<00:00:35.250> system<00:00:35.610> then<00:00:35.910> we'll<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.390> ready<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
drive system then we'll be ready to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.530 
drive system then we'll be ready to
launch<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> works<00:00:38.360> over<00:00:39.360> here

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
launch that so in the works over here

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.380 
launch that so in the works over here
maybe<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.649> mean<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> mean<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.000> receive<00:00:42.239> that

message however you want to hey you know
I<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.550> say<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.969> its<00:00:45.360> innovation<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.170> key<00:00:46.200> we

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
I can say it's its innovation is key we

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
I can say it's its innovation is key we
gotta<00:00:46.710> find<00:00:46.980> something<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.550> truly<00:00:47.850> different

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
gotta find something is truly different

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
what's out in the market and I don't

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.960 
what's out in the market and I don't
know<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.309> we're<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.579> yet<00:00:50.640> all<00:00:51.030> right<00:00:51.180> there

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
know if we're there yet all right there

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.990 
know if we're there yet all right there
all<00:00:53.480> right<00:00:53.630> from<00:00:53.810> Robert<00:00:54.170> Smith<00:00:54.700> why<00:00:55.700> is<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
all right from Robert Smith why is the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.240 
all right from Robert Smith why is the
air<00:00:56.150> probe<00:00:56.510> max<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.880> expensive<00:01:00.160> you<00:01:01.160> know<00:01:01.220> a

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
air probe max so expensive you know a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.530 
air probe max so expensive you know a
couple<00:01:01.310> things<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.850> are<00:01:01.910> important<00:01:02.270> with<00:01:02.390> it

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
couple things that are important with it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.990 
couple things that are important with it
with<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.810> air<00:01:03.290> promax<00:01:03.740> I<00:01:04.040> think<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
with the air promax I think that the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.330 
with the air promax I think that the
first<00:01:05.690> thing<00:01:05.840> is<00:01:06.050> it's<00:01:06.230> made<00:01:06.500> in<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.680> u.s.<00:01:07.070> we

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
first thing is it's made in the u.s. we

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.260 
first thing is it's made in the u.s. we
wanted<00:01:07.910> to<00:01:07.940> stay<00:01:08.240> in<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.780> US<00:01:09.110> was<00:01:09.290> all<00:01:09.530> us

light<00:01:54.320> weight<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.890> it's<00:01:55.729> anodized<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:56.810> that's

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
light weight and it's anodized so that's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.110 
light weight and it's anodized so that's
one<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.650> it's<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.040> more<00:01:58.310> expensive<00:01:58.580> coating

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
one of the it's a more expensive coating

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.460 
one of the it's a more expensive coating
but<00:01:59.240> they<00:01:59.330> get<00:01:59.480> into<00:01:59.600> more<00:01:59.780> durable<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:00.350> we

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
but they get into more durable so we

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.380 
but they get into more durable so we
