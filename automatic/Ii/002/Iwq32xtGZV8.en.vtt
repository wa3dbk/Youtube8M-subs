00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 mitch d.it today 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.069
 we will try to upgrade the jelly bean to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.100
 samsung galaxy s ii is a guide that i 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.700
 I'm doing it for those who 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.970
 they are not experts in the field like 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.040
 well you know our portal music.it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.830
 also offers less user guides 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.779
 experts especially I dedicate myself to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 this thing because at the beginning I too 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.150
 I knew I learned everything by myself and 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.640
 so I want to share my knowledge 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.079
 together 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.210
 I'll explain to you first of all what 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.899
 you will have to do before updating the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.150
 phone 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.850
 you will have to download the firmware that 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.420
 you will find in the link below the video I will 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.440
 I will write firmware will put the link 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.780
 download if you see here 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.850
 Meanwhile we park audine we park 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.920
 a way of saying yes there is hide 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.809
 but I like to say so 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.600
 what we must do we must 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.820
 first download the firmware and this 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.860
 I already said it then download a 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.520
 program to decompress files 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.289
 this means that we must say 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:24.229
 unzip the downloaded firmware 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:29.929
 firmware that we say is not accepted 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:33.860
 as well as that is in zip file zip file that 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:37.130
 you can decompress with be one free 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:43.490
 this is its symbol 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 let's see if it focuses well here 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.040
 here once you have downloaded this program 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.600
 very simple giving a right click vi 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.430
 from the possibility tells me extract year 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.369
 extract and a file like this will appear 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.969
 the white page 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.560
 done this we open audine audine between 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.750
 the other remind you available at 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.360
 always download from a link below 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.820
 this too will be decompressed one 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.150
 once unloaded once unpacked yes 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:21.890
 will open alone or dean is the tool let's say 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.620
 by now it is renowned for this type of 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.049
 operations operations among others not 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.880
 official even if the firmware is the one 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:33.260
 Italian 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:37.640
 well first of all here 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.440
 we will have to select part pda and one 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.269
 once we had unzipped the file 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.290
 it appears as you see here at this point 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.629
 md5 important that there is this md5 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.849
 just see selected md5 files e 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.120
 he opens it, I already had it 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.739
 done here is the green because I have 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.580
 previously installed a kernel 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.560
 modified this let's say I'll explain 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.060
 later in another video what it is 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.810
 so the phone will be all white 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.280
 phone what you will need to do 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.420
 by pressing key for high volume key 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.550
 home and ignition lock release button 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.900
 turning them off you will need to hold them down 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.890
 all three 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.590
 at the same time in the order 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.379
 indicated and must be kept pressed 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.330
 a bit to get into recovery mode 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.510
 once you cover them mod 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.159
 go down with the volume keys and 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.049
 select wipe data factory reset 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:48.440
 select yes the phone will come 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:52.459
 fully formatted once done 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.390
 this pressed the low key volume 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.000
 rom and power button and is 3 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.459
 networks in this mode called 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.480
 selected mode downloading 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.720
 will select want 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.640
 ap would be high volume and here is the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.189
 downloading mod 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.080
 done this you will have to connect the 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:17.690
 cable on the phone here it is 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.739
 this is done the phone will come 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.120
 recognized and will appear right here 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.670
 this writing here 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.620
 make sure that it is activated again 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.530
 only auto reboot and make the set 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:37.730
 time and not departments shawn and then press 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:41.480
 start the phone starts to install 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.350
 the firmware you see essential that you 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.820
 appear nand wright start and once 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.530
 When this writing appeared, you could stay 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.450
 really quiet that even the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.600
 phone will begin to overwrite the 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.320
 firmware 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.500
 I recommend you not to leave it at all 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.710
 the cable because you risk ruining it 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.290
 the phone is really a thing 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.950
 also known during updates 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.630
 it is forbidden to remove the cable and for this reason 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.700
 reason I also advise you to use a 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.260
 laptop because if it should 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:21.050
 go away the current you still have a 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.360
 quite good time for autonomy 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.340
 if instead it happens on a fixed PC they are 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.550
 really trouble trouble that it obviously is 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.610
 possible to remedy but if you are gods 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.970
 amateurs in quotation marks of the world 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.010
 android will not be so simple 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.260
 however you will find the guide on the channel 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.640
 always made by me in case you have 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:50.140
 accidentally disconnected the flat cable 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:55.310
 we await the end of the 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:58.360
 we are missing here 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.169
 really a little at the end 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.630
 installation 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.250
 in the meantime also a lg 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:09.449
 optimus chic and has nothing to do with it 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:12.180
 but we leave the phone here 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:18.110
 has disconnected wait for it to be written 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:20.099
 removed to make sure you can 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.349
 remove 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:30.029
 here it is now it will begin 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:38.960
 application optimization and everything 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:49.620
 how much brand 3 but the phone is anyway 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:51.569
 branded only wanted me to say that 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:56.610
 Mobbing is really beautiful 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:07:02.039
 what is that even if you are inexperienced 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:06.300
 once you understand how it really works 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:09.110
 will fascinate you a lot and I'm sure that 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.270
 you will look forward to always trying 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:15.389
 new roms 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:20.310
 meanwhile we await the poggio 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:22.699
 phone the optimization I had 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.699
 said before 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:37.170
 here is s updated 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:47.160
 we ignore all these things 

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:49.830
 momentarily for the end here 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.210
 qua samsung galaxy s2 updated 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.210
 greetings to all bye
