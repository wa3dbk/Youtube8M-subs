00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.700
 we open our iTunes with our 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.790
 devices connected to our 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.640
 computer so that it detects us 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.309
 let's go to the top where we get 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.300
 the name of our device we 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.790
 will appear in the tab where we get the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.400
 features of our device 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.220
 we go to the photos tab to 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.040
 you will leave the option unchecked 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.079

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.079
 unfold the wallpaper menu 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.680
 the folder that contains the photos that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.560
 want to move to their devices 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.450
 and look for the folder that contains the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.290
