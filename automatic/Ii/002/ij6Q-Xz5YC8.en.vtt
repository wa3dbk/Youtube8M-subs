00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:53.640 
going the other side of the shed there
this<00:00:45.379> is<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.680> beginning

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.280 

you

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:11.650 

tie<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.350> string<00:01:04.280> all<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.340> way<00:01:08.180> down<00:01:09.180> there

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
I've moved the posts up to the string so

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.140 
I've moved the posts up to the string so
they<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.850> even<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> bottom<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> I've

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
they are all even on the bottom and I've

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.370 
they are all even on the bottom and I've
made<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> hole<00:01:27.510> through<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> wood<00:01:28.380> there

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.580 

this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.619> roughing<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.160> in<00:01:38.240> basically<00:01:39.240> I'm

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
this is roughing it in basically I'm

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.420 
this is roughing it in basically I'm
setting<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.979> poles<00:01:41.250> where<00:01:42.590> they're<00:01:43.590> close<00:01:44.190> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
setting the poles where they're close to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310 
setting the poles where they're close to
their<00:01:44.550> homes<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> fine-tune

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
their homes and I'm going to fine-tune

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.880 
their homes and I'm going to fine-tune
it<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.369> doing<00:01:50.580> it

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
it now and the way I'm doing it

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.110 
it now and the way I'm doing it
hopefully<00:01:52.890> would<00:01:53.220> become<00:01:53.490> apparent<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.930> go
