now<00:06:22.449> real<00:06:23.259> quick<00:06:23.500> I<00:06:23.740> might<00:06:24.340> put<00:06:24.669> on<00:06:24.819> the<00:06:24.969> update

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330

video<00:06:25.719> but<00:06:26.319> I<00:06:26.349> fixed<00:06:26.770> the<00:06:26.979> knife<00:06:27.159> so<00:06:27.550> now<00:06:27.699> it

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
video but I fixed the knife so now it

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.430 
video but I fixed the knife so now it
looks<00:06:27.909> like<00:06:28.090> it's<00:06:28.240> on<00:06:28.419> the<00:06:28.599> guns<00:06:28.810> to<00:06:28.960> pay<00:06:29.289> me

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
looks like it's on the guns to pay me

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.190 
looks like it's on the guns to pay me
off<00:06:29.589> the<00:06:29.770> gun<00:06:29.949> you<00:06:30.550> can't<00:06:30.760> see<00:06:30.969> it

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
off the gun you can't see it

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.960 
off the gun you can't see it
but<00:06:31.290> I<00:06:31.350> fixed<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.920> reload<00:06:32.280> system<00:06:32.670> so<00:06:32.850> you<00:06:32.940> can

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
but I fixed the reload system so you can

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.110 
but I fixed the reload system so you can
be<00:06:33.180> more<00:06:33.330> careless<00:06:33.600> about<00:06:33.870> it<00:06:34.430> the<00:06:35.430> outside

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
be more careless about it the outside

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.550 
be more careless about it the outside
will<00:06:36.300> still<00:06:36.540> probably<00:06:36.720> mess<00:06:36.990> up<00:06:37.200> on<00:06:37.380> you

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
will still probably mess up on you

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.940 
will still probably mess up on you
though<00:06:37.730> I<00:06:38.730> made<00:06:39.210> the<00:06:39.390> handle<00:06:40.260> thicker<00:06:40.470> so<00:06:40.830> now

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
though I made the handle thicker so now

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.890 
though I made the handle thicker so now
won't<00:06:41.190> break<00:06:41.430> every<00:06:41.670> three<00:06:41.820> seconds<00:06:42.210> and<00:06:42.450> i

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
won't break every three seconds and i

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.460 
won't break every three seconds and i
also<00:06:43.020> put<00:06:43.320> some<00:06:43.380> detail<00:06:43.860> on<00:06:44.130> the<00:06:44.490> iron<00:06:45.180> sights
