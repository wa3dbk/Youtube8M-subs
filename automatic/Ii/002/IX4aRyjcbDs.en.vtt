00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
only need to go to nine which is the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130 
only need to go to nine which is the
good<00:01:05.070> thing<00:01:05.309> once<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> ninth<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.899> you

good thing once you get the ninth as you

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
good thing once you get the ninth as you

can see you will get the SpecOps goblin

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
can see you will get the SpecOps goblin
now<00:01:09.630> i<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:10.409> about<00:01:10.649> watchdogs<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.700> can't

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
now i think about watchdogs is you can't

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
now i think about watchdogs is you can't
just<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.270> any<00:01:12.479> single<00:01:13.049> shop<00:01:13.259> and<00:01:13.500> add

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
just go to any single shop and add

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.980 
just go to any single shop and add
attachments<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.759> guns<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.600> actually

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
attachments to the guns you actually

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.170 
attachments to the guns you actually
have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.469> buy<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.399> attachments<00:01:18.000> on

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
have to buy them with the attachments on

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
have to buy them with the attachments on
or<00:01:18.439> find<00:01:19.439> them<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.369> i<00:01:20.399> said<00:01:20.579> this<00:01:20.700> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
or find them but like i said this is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.639 
or find them but like i said this is
probably<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.210> best<00:01:21.420> gun<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> game<00:01:21.840> mainly

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
probably the best gun in the game mainly

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.770 
probably the best gun in the game mainly
because<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.250> silenced<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.509> rifle

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because it's silenced and it's a rifle

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.569 
because it's silenced and it's a rifle
and<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.829> pretty<00:01:26.009> sure<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.490> only

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
and I'm pretty sure this is the only

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.520 
and I'm pretty sure this is the only
silenced<00:01:27.270> rifle<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> game<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
silenced rifle in the game and it's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
silenced rifle in the game and it's
really<00:01:28.829> good<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> effective<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.030> killing

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
really good and effective for killing

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
really good and effective for killing
people<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.799> video<00:01:31.979> I'm

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
people as you can see in this video I'm

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.399 
people as you can see in this video I'm
actually<00:01:32.460> doing<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.000> gag<00:01:33.240> hideout<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
actually doing a gag hideout and I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.080 
actually doing a gag hideout and I
managed<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> entire<00:01:35.520> gang<00:01:35.850> hideout

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
managed to do the entire gang hideout

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.179 
managed to do the entire gang hideout
without<00:01:36.539> learning<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.049> single<00:01:37.439> guard<00:01:37.649> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
without learning a single guard and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.789 
without learning a single guard and
killing<00:01:38.789> everybody<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.539> stealth<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.469> this<00:01:40.649> is

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
killing everybody in stealth now this is

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
killing everybody in stealth now this is
particularly<00:01:41.189> hard<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> silenced

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
particularly hard to do with a silenced

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.959 
particularly hard to do with a silenced
pistol<00:01:43.039> really<00:01:44.039> because<00:01:44.280> pistols<00:01:44.729> don't

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
pistol really because pistols don't
