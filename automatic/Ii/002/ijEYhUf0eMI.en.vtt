00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.330
 hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.710
 video review for des android dotcom 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.269
 a few days ago we introduced you in 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.540
 our blog 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.910
 the solution that samsung had prepared 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.609
 to be able to take out the video signal from 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.189
 our galaxy terminals towards the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.130
 televisions all this was done thanks 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.050
 to the mhl chips and through a 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.960
 connector 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.890
 traditional cable to hdmi output and 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.149
 good standard for the most demanding 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.860
 samsung has also prepared the product 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.769
 we bring you today it is called all 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.320
 share cast danielle and what it allows us 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.680
 is to remove the screen from our terminal 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.940
 to a television wirelessly to 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.820
 through a wifi 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.860
 ok will allow us to take the screen 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.899
 complete not only the content of ln a 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.089
 Valid line is a standard that is 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.760
 you can use with any television that 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.350
 supports this standard but this access 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.820
 takes a step further by giving us the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.149
 possibility of removing the screen 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.580
 being able to play video games watching 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.500
 videos on youtube or browsing with 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.619
 our browser or doing any 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.420
 another activity with the terminal and everything 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.220
 it wirelessly without having 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.560
 cables because the first 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.060
 solution that we presented to you was a bit 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.520
 cumbersome if we wanted to be with the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.090
 phone in the hand is worth it this is the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.079
 box in which it is presented 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.079
 if we open it 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.600
 well we will see the content well 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.830
 we will come back with a hdmi cable and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.570
 hdmi 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.150
 OK 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.470
 power adapter because you need 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.220
 of an adapter of an adaptation of 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.620
 current feeds us through hdmi 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.940
 instructions and values this as you see 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.630
 although you see that the box is quite 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.630
 wide the device is not so much 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.500
 all right 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.740
 it only has an hdmi connection and the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.210
 micro usb connection for the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.000
 food that takes us very well in 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.450
 the video and the reset button that also 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.270
 it helps us connect or match the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.310
 devices very simple installation 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.890
 only from the average h our 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.890
 TV feed and automatically 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.480
 the device will be put into operation 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.150
 well something that they have done well since 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.010
 samsung is that all all the new 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.310
 samsung terminal generation well 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.810
 be the note 2 or the s 3 already come 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.850
 prepared to use this device and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.500
 from the system itself we can 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.720
 bond and share that signal of 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.960
 video we have used it and we 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.940
 it seems that it is an accessory very very very 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.590
 recommendable 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.320
 since it offers us a great 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.930
 functionality since we not only share 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.780
 multimedia but the full screen and 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.720
 doing it wirelessly is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.690
 great 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.370
 We only advise from here and nothing 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.730
 we keep seeing in the next climb 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.730
 reviews
