so<00:00:00.719> we<00:00:00.900> have<00:00:00.989> seen<00:00:01.260> how<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> b0<00:00:02.010> fueled<00:00:02.520> gradient

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
so we have seen how a b0 fueled gradient

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.030 
so we have seen how a b0 fueled gradient
can<00:00:03.449> be<00:00:03.570> used<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.959> spatially<00:00:04.529> encode<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
can be used to spatially encode the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.190

together with a frequency selective RF

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.330 
together with a frequency selective RF
pulse<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.840> can<00:00:13.019> select<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.530> particular<00:00:13.650> slice

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
pulse we can select a particular slice

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.910 
pulse we can select a particular slice
of<00:00:14.549> spins<00:00:17.510> we<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.660> use<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.020> same<00:00:19.289> idea<00:00:19.320> to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
of spins we can use this same idea to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
of spins we can use this same idea to
spatially<00:00:20.640> encode<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> signal<00:00:21.510> from<00:00:21.930> within

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
spatially encode the signal from within

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.490 
spatially encode the signal from within
this<00:00:22.439> slice<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:23.100> spins<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.000> each<00:00:24.150> direction<00:00:24.500> if

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
this slice of spins in each direction if

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.800 
this slice of spins in each direction if
we<00:00:26.010> were<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.279> detect<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> signal<00:00:27.119> while<00:00:27.660> at

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
we were to detect the signal while at

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
we were to detect the signal while at
the<00:00:27.900> same<00:00:27.930> time<00:00:28.140> apply<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> field<00:00:29.429> gradient

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the same time apply a field gradient

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.150 
the same time apply a field gradient
along<00:00:30.689> one<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> directions<00:00:31.470> within<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
along one of the directions within the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.850 
along one of the directions within the
plane<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> slice<00:00:33.230> then<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.350> would<00:00:34.500> expect

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
plane of the slice then we would expect

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.220 
plane of the slice then we would expect
that<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.190> signal<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.120> encoded<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that the signal will be encoded as a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.270 
that the signal will be encoded as a
function<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.829> position<00:00:38.070> along<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.090> gradient

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
function of position along that gradient

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.220 
function of position along that gradient
this<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> known<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.850> frequency<00:00:42.149> encoding<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
this is known as frequency encoding and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.740 
this is known as frequency encoding and
the<00:00:43.290> frequency<00:00:44.219> encoding<00:00:44.670> gradient<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.329> also

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the frequency encoding gradient is also

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.130 
the frequency encoding gradient is also
known<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> read<00:00:46.590> gradient<00:00:48.140> this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
known as the read gradient this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
known as the read gradient this
spatially<00:00:49.739> encoded<00:00:50.129> signal<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:51.090> therefore

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
spatially encoded signal will therefore

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
spatially encoded signal will therefore
consist<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.590> projection<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> signal

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
consist of a projection of the signal

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.029 
consist of a projection of the signal
from<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> spins<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.469> are<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> same

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
from all the spins that are in the same

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
from all the spins that are in the same
position<00:00:56.340> along<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> read<00:00:57.660> gradient

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
position along the read gradient

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.189 
position along the read gradient
direction<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.120> Fourier<00:01:00.420> transform<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
direction so if a Fourier transform is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
direction so if a Fourier transform is
applied<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.250> result<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.850> projection

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
applied the result will be a projection

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.750 
applied the result will be a projection
of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> shape<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.439> object<00:01:04.650> against<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.100 
direction of that gradient this is best
illustrated<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.500> an<00:01:10.650> example<00:01:11.930> we<00:01:12.930> have

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
illustrated with an example we have

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
illustrated with an example we have
three<00:01:13.380> samples<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.100> water<00:01:14.310> arranged<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
three samples of water arranged in the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.929 
three samples of water arranged in the
magnet<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.990> fuel<00:01:16.799> gradient<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.400> applied<00:01:17.520> along

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
magnet a fuel gradient is applied along

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.749 
magnet a fuel gradient is applied along
the<00:01:18.180> horizontal<00:01:18.360> direction<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:20.250> frequency

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the horizontal direction the frequency

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.520 
the horizontal direction the frequency
of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> spins<00:01:21.299> within<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> samples<00:01:22.290> are

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
of the spins within the samples are

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
of the spins within the samples are
therefore<00:01:23.040> different<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:24.240> encoded<00:01:24.810> with

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
therefore different and are encoded with

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.350 
therefore different and are encoded with
increasing<00:01:25.530> frequency<00:01:25.680> from<00:01:26.670> left<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> right

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
increasing frequency from left to right

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.810 
increasing frequency from left to right
so<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.290> signal<00:01:28.650> from<00:01:28.860> each<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> samples

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
so the signal from each of the samples

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.730 
so the signal from each of the samples
will<00:01:30.180> occur<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.600> different<00:01:30.900> frequencies<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
will occur at different frequencies and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
will occur at different frequencies and
within<00:01:32.369> each<00:01:32.579> sample<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.360> shape<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
within each sample the shape of the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.780 
within each sample the shape of the
signal<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> projection<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> spin

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
signal will be a projection of the spin

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.749 
signal will be a projection of the spin
density<00:01:36.479> against<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> horizontal<00:01:38.220> axis<00:01:38.549> as

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
density against the horizontal axis as

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.359 
density against the horizontal axis as
shown<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.860> can<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
shown here you can see that the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.950 
shown here you can see that the
projection<00:01:41.909> reflects<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> shape<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
projection reflects the shape of the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490 
projection reflects the shape of the
object<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:44.270> we<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.420> change<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.020> direction<00:01:46.049> of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
object if we now change the direction of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
object if we now change the direction of
the<00:01:46.619> gradient<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> vertical<00:01:47.759> axis<00:01:48.149> then

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the gradient to the vertical axis then

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.719 
the gradient to the vertical axis then
again<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.530> signal<00:01:49.920> will<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> projection

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
again the signal will be a projection

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.590 
again the signal will be a projection
against<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.600> axis<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.530> looks<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.860> this

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
against this axis which looks like this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.480 
against this axis which looks like this
the<00:01:54.600> projection<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> sum<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the projection is the sum of all the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.760 
the projection is the sum of all the
signals<00:01:56.909> at<00:01:57.180> each<00:01:57.360> point<00:01:57.689> along<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> gradient

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
signals at each point along the gradient

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.910 
signals at each point along the gradient
direction<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:01.020> large<00:02:01.229> sphere<00:02:01.680> and

then Fourier transform this signal then
the<00:04:57.820> result<00:04:58.300> will<00:04:58.479> be<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.630> spatial<00:04:59.260> profile<00:04:59.830> of

direction<00:05:02.500> at<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:03.070> point<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.810> if<00:05:07.990> we

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
direction at that point so if we

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.260 
direction at that point so if we
transform<00:05:08.830> along<00:05:09.310> each<00:05:09.610> point<00:05:09.970> of<00:05:10.120> the

transform along each point of the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.510 
transform along each point of the
projection<00:05:10.950> then<00:05:11.950> we<00:05:12.100> build<00:05:12.370> a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520

two-dimensional<00:05:13.330> map<00:05:13.570> of<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.320> spins<00:05:14.590> showing

two-dimensional map of the spins showing

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.580 
two-dimensional map of the spins showing

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
the intensity of the signal from each

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.300 
the intensity of the signal from each
position<00:05:18.010> in<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.340> slice<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:20.530> represents<00:05:21.190> an

image of the slice of water molecules in
two<00:05:24.430> dimensions<00:05:25.919> so<00:05:26.919> we<00:05:27.070> now<00:05:27.220> have<00:05:27.460> spatial

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
two dimensions so we now have spatial
