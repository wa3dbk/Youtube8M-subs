and when you get up there if you switch
fine<00:01:50.990> but<00:01:51.200> now<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.560> he<00:01:51.680> he<00:01:52.550> started<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.360> go

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
fine but now that he he started to to go

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.310 
fine but now that he he started to to go
back<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:53.930> forth<00:01:54.140> righty<00:01:54.470> lefty<00:01:54.770> righty<00:01:55.160> lefty

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
back and forth righty lefty righty lefty

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.290 
back and forth righty lefty righty lefty
and<00:01:57.320> obviously<00:01:58.009> then<00:01:58.460> did<00:01:58.670> he<00:01:58.759> after<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> while

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
and obviously then did he after a while

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.910 
and obviously then did he after a while
but<00:01:59.600> this<00:01:59.990> isn't<00:02:00.350> funny<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:02.500> see<00:02:03.500> them<00:02:03.680> keep

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
but this isn't funny I see them keep

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.130 
but this isn't funny I see them keep
motioning<00:02:04.580> with<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.880> number<00:02:05.240> one<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:05.900> get

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
motioning with the number one so you get

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.719 
motioning with the number one so you get
the<00:02:06.290> feeling<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.710> somebody<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:07.400> there<00:02:07.580> is

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
the feeling that somebody in there is

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:08.570 
the feeling that somebody in there is
saying

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
saying

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.570 
saying
he<00:02:08.970> has<00:02:09.180> to<00:02:09.390> throw<00:02:09.680> that<00:02:10.680> leap<00:02:10.950> maybe<00:02:11.220> he's<00:02:11.430> got

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
he has to throw that leap maybe he's got

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.640 
he has to throw that leap maybe he's got
to<00:02:11.760> stay<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.240> there<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.630> at<00:02:12.720> least<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:13.290> pitch

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
to stay in there for at least one pitch

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.790 
to stay in there for at least one pitch
once<00:02:13.950> he's<00:02:14.160> gotten<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> box<00:02:14.970> or<00:02:15.530> once<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
once he's gotten in the box or once the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.380 
once he's gotten in the box or once the
pitcher<00:02:17.130> gets<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.610> rubber<00:02:17.850> he's<00:02:18.090> got<00:02:18.270> to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
pitcher gets on the rubber he's got to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.240 
pitcher gets on the rubber he's got to
throw<00:02:18.540> one<00:02:18.750> pitch<00:02:18.990> from<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.380> side<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:20.010> no

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
throw one pitch from that side I have no

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.010 
throw one pitch from that side I have no
idea<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:20.970> I've<00:02:21.090> never<00:02:21.390> come<00:02:21.690> across<00:02:21.780> this

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
idea because I've never come across this

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.850 
idea because I've never come across this
in<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.500> life

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.310 

when<00:02:25.460> he<00:02:25.550> was<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.700> college<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.420> at<00:02:26.690> Creighton

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
when he was in college it at Creighton

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.710 
when he was in college it at Creighton
he<00:02:27.740> struck<00:02:28.070> out<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> batter<00:02:28.340> with<00:02:28.700> both<00:02:29.150> arms<00:02:29.450> in

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
he struck out a batter with both arms in

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.370 
he struck out a batter with both arms in
the<00:02:29.870> same<00:02:30.140> game<00:02:30.970> 39<00:02:31.970> times<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:32.930> he's<00:02:33.110> used

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
the same game 39 times and so he's used

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.730 
the same game 39 times and so he's used
to<00:02:33.470> doing<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:36.200> grew<00:02:36.380> out<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.650> he

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
to doing that and that grew out that he

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.550 
to doing that and that grew out that he
wears<00:02:36.920> six<00:02:37.490> fingers<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.480> webs

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
wears six fingers to webs

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.590 
wears six fingers to webs
so<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.310> he<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.520> switch<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.090> right<00:02:42.209> board

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
so that he can switch to the right board

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.050 
so that he can switch to the right board
the<00:02:42.720> left<00:02:42.930> hand

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
the left hand

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.030 
the left hand
and<00:02:45.209> now<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.810> looks<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.200> if<00:02:46.230> Enriquez<00:02:46.830> says

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
and now it looks as if Enriquez says

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
and now it looks as if Enriquez says
enough<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.580> enough<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.970> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> step<00:02:48.360> in

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
enough is enough I'm going to step in

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.900 
enough is enough I'm going to step in
there<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.930> I'll<00:02:49.050> bat<00:02:49.260> right-handed<00:02:49.910> turned

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
there and I'll bat right-handed turned

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.339 
there and I'll bat right-handed turned
into<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.180> 20<00:02:51.540> minute<00:02:51.810> at<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:54.020> breaking<00:02:55.020> ball

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
into a 20 minute at that breaking ball

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.100 
into a 20 minute at that breaking ball
swung<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.310> missed<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.540> going<00:02:58.050> to

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
swung on and missed and that is going to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.470 
swung on and missed and that is going to
do<00:02:58.290> it
