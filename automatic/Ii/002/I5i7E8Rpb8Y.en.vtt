gluten-free so I'm thinking there's no

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.320 
gluten-free so I'm thinking there's no
sauce<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.310> here<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.640> just<00:02:19.820> make<00:02:20.060> your<00:02:20.240> own

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.420 
sauce in here you just make your own
sauce<00:02:20.630> or<00:02:20.990> something<00:02:21.620> like<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:21.920> which<00:02:22.220> is

sauce or something like that which is
pretty<00:02:22.970> cool<00:02:23.240> considering<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.900> duel<00:02:24.080> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
pretty cool considering the duel is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.980 
pretty cool considering the duel is

already ready to go you're looking at

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.310 
already ready to go you're looking at
only<00:02:27.520> 20<00:02:28.520> calories<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:29.180> here<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.080> it's

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
only 20 calories in here so it's

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.160 
only 20 calories in here so it's
something<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.370> really<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.630> go<00:02:32.840> and

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
of these are going to be pretty much the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.070 
of these are going to be pretty much the

all<00:04:05.510> three<00:04:05.930> actually<00:04:06.440> sometimes<00:04:06.680> you're<00:04:06.980> in

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
all three actually sometimes you're in

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.970 
all three actually sometimes you're in
casein<00:04:07.580> so<00:04:07.940> that<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:09.080> get<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.380> best<00:04:09.410> types<00:04:09.860> of

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
casein so that you get the best types of

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.170 
casein so that you get the best types of
protein<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.450> fact<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.990> does<00:04:12.290> have

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
protein and the fact that it does have

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.930 
protein and the fact that it does have
you<00:04:14.180> know<00:04:14.540> an<00:04:14.720> isolate<00:04:15.310> gives<00:04:16.310> it<00:04:16.520> the<00:04:16.730> ability

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
you know an isolate gives it the ability

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.550 
you know an isolate gives it the ability
to<00:04:17.660> be<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.530> pure<00:04:18.919> form<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.460> protein<00:04:20.020> so<00:04:21.020> this

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
to be a pure form of protein so this

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.640 
to be a pure form of protein so this
you're<00:04:21.770> looking<00:04:22.040> at

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
you're looking at

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.810 
you're looking at

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
grams of fat 21 grams of carbs so

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.120 
grams of fat 21 grams of carbs so
overall<00:04:30.690> it's<00:04:30.900> actually<00:04:31.259> really<00:04:31.830> well

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
overall it's actually really well

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.879 
overall it's actually really well
balanced<00:04:32.639> you<00:04:33.539> know<00:04:33.630> not<00:04:33.900> like<00:04:34.139> 20<00:04:34.500> grams<00:04:34.680> of

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
balanced you know not like 20 grams of

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.850 
balanced you know not like 20 grams of
fat<00:04:35.100> but<00:04:35.820> more<00:04:36.810> than<00:04:36.990> your<00:04:37.110> average<00:04:37.259> protein

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860

fat but more than your average protein
bar<00:04:38.039> that<00:04:38.070> usually<00:04:38.520> has<00:04:38.699> like<00:04:38.940> about<00:04:39.150> 15<00:04:39.360> or<00:04:39.750> so

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
bar that usually has like about 15 or so

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.920 
bar that usually has like about 15 or so
and<00:04:40.350> they're<00:04:40.620> really<00:04:40.770> small<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.340> mean<00:04:41.610> if<00:04:42.120> you

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
and they're really small I mean if you

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.180 
and they're really small I mean if you
look<00:04:43.110> at<00:04:43.229> that<00:04:44.030> that's<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.509> know<00:04:45.660> about<00:04:46.560> it's

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
look at that that's you know about it's

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.710 
look at that that's you know about it's
about<00:04:47.250> three<00:04:47.669> inches<00:04:48.000> or<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.539> you<00:04:48.600> could

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
about three inches or so so you could

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.930 
about three inches or so so you could
easily<00:04:49.350> eat<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:49.740> in<00:04:50.009> like<00:04:50.220> two<00:04:50.820> or<00:04:50.910> three

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
easily eat this in like two or three

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.110 
easily eat this in like two or three
bites<00:04:51.380> if<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:53.100> are<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:53.400> know<00:04:53.520> trying<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.880> bulk

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
bites if you are you know trying to bulk

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.430 
bites if you are you know trying to bulk
and<00:04:54.360> we're<00:04:54.570> always<00:04:54.720> trying<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.169> get<00:04:55.289> that

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
and we're always trying to get that

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.310 
and we're always trying to get that
protein<00:04:55.770> at<00:04:56.070> extra<00:04:56.340> calories<00:04:56.729> in<00:04:56.910> so<00:04:57.870> all<00:04:58.260> of

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
protein at extra calories in so all of

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.100 
protein at extra calories in so all of
these<00:04:58.590> are<00:04:58.770> about<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.100> same<00:04:59.340> as<00:04:59.639> far<00:05:00.270> as<00:05:00.449> you

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
these are about the same as far as you

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.860 
these are about the same as far as you
know<00:05:01.229> protein<00:05:02.100> 20<00:05:02.430> grams<00:05:02.639> calories<00:05:03.240> ranging

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
know protein 20 grams calories ranging

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.520 
know protein 20 grams calories ranging
probably<00:05:04.260> from<00:05:04.440> 172<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.430> 200<00:05:06.000> calories<00:05:06.470> so<00:05:07.470> I'm

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
probably from 172 to 200 calories so I'm

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.080 
probably from 172 to 200 calories so I'm
thinking<00:05:07.860> what<00:05:07.979> I'll<00:05:08.070> do<00:05:08.250> is<00:05:08.370> as<00:05:08.550> I<00:05:08.699> take<00:05:08.940> them

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
thinking what I'll do is as I take them

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.080 
thinking what I'll do is as I take them
I'll<00:05:09.210> try<00:05:09.449> to<00:05:09.479> remind<00:05:10.470> myself<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:11.010> record<00:05:11.850> a

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
I'll try to remind myself to record a

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.080 
I'll try to remind myself to record a
