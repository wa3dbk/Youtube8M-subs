sometimes<00:04:34.290> can<00:04:34.470> forget<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.860> levels<00:04:35.310> I

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
sometimes can forget the levels I

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.820 
sometimes can forget the levels I
obviously<00:04:36.120> know<00:04:36.419> I'm<00:04:36.990> not<00:04:37.140> bragging<00:04:37.560> but<00:04:37.590> I'd

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
obviously know I'm not bragging but I'd

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.770 
obviously know I'm not bragging but I'd
like<00:04:38.010> but<00:04:38.700> compared<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.150> other<00:04:39.330> people

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
like but compared to other people

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.870 
like but compared to other people
something<00:04:40.560> like<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.919> figure<00:04:41.310> yeah<00:04:41.700> that

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
something like this figure yeah that

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.450 
something like this figure yeah that
level<00:04:42.210> in<00:04:42.330> there<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.800> like<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:44.040> level<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.400> I

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
level in there and like a level that I

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.909 
level in there and like a level that I
think<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:44.880> will<00:04:45.000> forget<00:04:45.300> in<00:04:45.630> inspired<00:04:46.500> to

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
think it will forget in inspired to
