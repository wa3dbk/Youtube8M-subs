00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 later today he had two themes of which 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.760
 talk 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.139
 I have reached the conclusions but not 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.240
 I can talk about what I think of the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.000
 character and see in the circular 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.030
 miserable or I can talk about toasters 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.590
 so evidently from saavedra 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.500
 I really like it now 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.790
 the toasts are the host is like 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.890
 the culmination of domestic electronics 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.390
 but they are only inside the box 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.370
 because the moment you open it is 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.580
 how to open Pandora's box and 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.830
 unleash hell in your kitchen and if not 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.830
 you believe what you have to see is 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.810
 I am very unhappy I have a 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.220
 toaster not because the old one is 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.540
 spoil or because you have to give 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.920
 button continuously so that 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.430
 heat the toast and then there was that 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.950
 take it out with a fork and dance 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.410
 same as we got the toaster 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.230
 with the valuable idea of ​​thinking that 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.340
 we wanted toast once and that 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.340
 all in roses and flowers 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.250
 I opened the box and I read the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.630
 instruction manual should you give me 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.610
 a Nobel for that reason only if you know 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.869
 someone who have gone the manual of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.030
 instructions for an appliance or 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.250
 of any electronic device in its 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.060
 life before trying to make it work 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.980
 the device that tells me already because we 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.330
 we will probably have a coffee 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.560
 it sounds like he was reading me the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.240
 instructions and well he has a 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.950
 button of the frost to frustrate a 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.410
 choose button to register and a 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.910
 cantile button then for your mission 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.160
 2020 a sexy either to take it from 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.840
 walk or to place bread when 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.530
 that I spend being above but not because 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.750
 in total that has a sexy roulette 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.390
 from 1 to 7 and in the manual 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.170
 instructions says os juro 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 says that normal tricked words that 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.640
 put 3 by 3 number in between 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.470
 well very cold and very hot or very 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.729
 tempting and very total fairy is that what 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.959
 placed number 3 and I think I've got 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.959
 I 've got this 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.599
 do not 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.890
 the only conclusion that I have drawn from 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.260
 this then has been that the toasters 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.180
 they only have two modalities that are or 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.720
 that the term whore shit or forge the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.720
 unique ring 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.560
 and a real friend if I went to frodo 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.830
 this image would replace insurance in my 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.830
 nightmares 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.549
 and mine is normal, it's good because it's 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.829
 who sees on the internet toasters that 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.760

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.760
 toast of mishima hospitals what 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.859

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.560
