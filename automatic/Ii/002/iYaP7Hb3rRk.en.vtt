00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.650 
so now we let our batter cook here until
it<00:03:06.010> pops<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.459> warm<00:03:06.730> light<00:03:06.970> down<00:03:07.209> there<00:03:07.420> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
it pops to the warm light down there and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.270 
it pops to the warm light down there and
then<00:03:08.019> we'll<00:03:08.320> try<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.530> see<00:03:08.830> whether<00:03:09.040> it's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
then we'll try to see whether it's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.970 
then we'll try to see whether it's
cooked<00:03:09.549> through<00:03:09.640> if<00:03:10.480> not<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.320> could<00:03:11.500> press<00:03:11.769> it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
cooked through if not you could press it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.640 
cooked through if not you could press it
again<00:03:12.400> by<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.450> way<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.230> want<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.470> make<00:03:14.620> a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
again by the way if you want to make a

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.530 
again by the way if you want to make a
two<00:03:14.950> layer<00:03:15.190> cake<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.850> could<00:03:16.030> divide<00:03:16.330> our

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
two layer cake you could divide our

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.840 
two layer cake you could divide our
batter<00:03:16.810> into<00:03:17.110> two<00:03:17.380> portions<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:18.070> just<00:03:18.610> cook

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
batter into two portions and just cook

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.680 
batter into two portions and just cook
it<00:03:18.880> separately<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.549> it's<00:03:21.700> been<00:03:21.850> about<00:03:21.970> 45

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
it separately so it's been about 45

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.660 
it separately so it's been about 45
minutes<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.530> whole<00:03:23.709> house<00:03:23.920> now<00:03:24.220> smells

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
minutes and the whole house now smells

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.199 
minutes and the whole house now smells
like<00:03:24.880> cinnamon<00:03:25.269> smells<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.200> good<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.970> can<00:03:27.970> see

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
like cinnamon smells so good I can see

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.750 
like cinnamon smells so good I can see
that<00:03:28.390> it's<00:03:28.600> puffed<00:03:28.930> up<00:03:29.200> quite<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.709> bit<00:03:30.070> that's

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
that it's puffed up quite a bit that's

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.940 
that it's puffed up quite a bit that's
good<00:03:31.180> what<00:03:31.660> I've<00:03:31.810> been<00:03:31.930> doing<00:03:32.380> is<00:03:32.590> that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
good what I've been doing is that

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.670 
good what I've been doing is that
whenever<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.640> pops<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.000> warm<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.690> try<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.049> press

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
whenever it pops to warm I try to press

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.940 
whenever it pops to warm I try to press
it<00:03:35.860> back<00:03:36.040> go<00:03:36.880> back<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.209> cook<00:03:37.480> but<00:03:38.230> sometimes<00:03:38.680> it

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
it back go back to cook but sometimes it

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.860 
it back go back to cook but sometimes it
might<00:03:39.160> not<00:03:39.370> let<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.090> we<00:03:40.269> usually<00:03:40.390> have<00:03:40.720> to

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
might not let you so we usually have to

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.539 
might not let you so we usually have to
wait<00:03:41.049> for<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.320> few<00:03:41.380> minutes<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.070> then<00:03:42.310> try

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
wait for a few minutes and then try

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.310 
wait for a few minutes and then try
press<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:43.000> again<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.750> will<00:03:43.900> let<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.140> go

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320
