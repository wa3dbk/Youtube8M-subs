base<00:02:18.190> camp<00:02:18.390> type<00:02:19.390> applications<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.560> can

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
base camp type applications and you can

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.250 
base camp type applications and you can
cut<00:02:20.890> larger<00:02:21.459> larger<00:02:22.450> wood<00:02:22.780> with<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.110> I'd<00:02:23.230> say

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
cut larger larger wood with it I'd say

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.170 
cut larger larger wood with it I'd say
pretty<00:02:23.769> easily<00:02:24.040> cut<00:02:24.370> six<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.849> eight<00:02:24.970> inch
