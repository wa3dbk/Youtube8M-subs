00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.170
 usually enough for 3-4 months from strength 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.029
 for half a year and everything fails 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.640
 either the speed is small or not at all 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.800

 so here it is put everything and further we already 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.459
 I immediately decided to open the folder 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.920
 here I have already downloaded a file 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.250

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:30.440
 we see that the reading speed is here 19 72 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.720
 megabyte per second and write speed 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.470
