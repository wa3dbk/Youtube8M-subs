00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.550
 friends today showed them one that many 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.550
 we want this function to be 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.110
 integrated into the game in a normal way and 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.690
 because this function will allow us to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.749
 aim the sava cannon and aim the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.870
 Valkyrie cannon also to target the 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.060
 truck from which another pound of the coursing 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.010
 in a manual way here we can see how 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.500
 is focused however see as you already 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.690
 we can move it and let's say we 're going to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 can point well left right 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.850
 up and opposite this is going to be 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.280
 terrific hopefully and this function the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.310
 will integrate because they will actually give it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.700
 a degree of general apartment al sabah 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.579
 85 of the salary equal incredible and we're going to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.610
 move to the mara of the form let's say that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.960
 wider we attack to the left 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.090
 we are because attacking nothing but us 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 we have to fit very well because of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.380
 suddenly the controls like that if you 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.989
 is working but let's say that this 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.180
 functionality is but incredible 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.090
 truth gives you a major attack point to 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.200
 this Saturday you finally have a more range 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.280
 broad you have the ability to attack 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.399
 in a high range go on a horizon 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 wider there and then now we go with 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.360
 the hydra that leads also has this 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.179
 functionality we will be able to move is 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.299
 machine gun that has and can equal 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.250
 this work I do not know why they do not put it 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.030
 in a normal way in the game if this 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.460
 it would be totally believable would it be very 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.200
 extraordinary and the truth maybe if 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.549
 would come revolutionary and little also to 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.530
 the left-right gameplay that 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.819
 let's comment 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.079
 stabilize x more stable suit than 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.880
 we can make it older than the book 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.069
 because this one if the product stabilizes 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.189
 almost does not move and here we can be 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:56.299
 firing in a phenomenal way osa 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.770
 it's totally human that it extended the range 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.289
 of vision that you have with this 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.079
 ability to target not annually the 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.750
 arms the truth that if that's a last 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.390
 would like to have integrated it into the game 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.369
 is a mode that makes this more dynamic 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.680
 vehicle that makes more dynamic and leads 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.290
 because we are not only linked 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.609
 to a machine gun that is fixed and that 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.930
 we have to point to the one that have to 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.359
 we have to balance the plane that 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.790
 we have to point it towards where 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.769
 we want to shoot here not here 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.170
 It is totally independently 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.470
 Machine gun can be moved completely 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.299
 this we go that is something that should 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.850
 take into consideration us of rockstar 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.630
 because it's a personality is always 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.700
 well let's say it's a good idea to 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.720
 the gta trinity of the currency of 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.549
 casinos and then basically it's very simple 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.040
 is to be able to aim for the dora shrapnel 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.350
 where you want or be the same 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.810
 they can put nothing else 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.280
 and 180 degrees forward so you do not 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.850
 let's apply backwards because it 's 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.800
 be a bit logical but let's say 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.740
 that why they are not going to do it is to say 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.960
 if it is let's say in a good source a 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.000
 great aspiration I know that many 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.890
 They must remember that like it 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.360
 inspired to act as referee 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.970
 before there are lots that are transformed 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.740
 animals and trade companies did it to 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.360
 through these modes and while 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.880
 we hope here also take in 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.250
 consideration some of these and that the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.310
 integrate the game because it would be let's say 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.980
 that give it more dynamism would be 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.840
 an athlete of brains and gave them these 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.720
 aircraft are helicopters and 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.310
 aircraft would be much more lethal and now 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.230
 yes that they hold them confessed and they 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.720
 they face one of these because they no longer 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.970
 let's not say that they would have the possibility 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.970
 to get away so easily because the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.550
 enemy because I could basically aim 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.530
 the ones where you are and 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.570
 eliminate them an easier way here 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.530
 we are identifying the patrols to the 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:58.390
 right and in the middle is not Spanish 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.390
 tell us a more adverse homeland two 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.920
 friends 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.530
 but 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.880
 and already
