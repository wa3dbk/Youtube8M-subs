microphone stand this is it here you can
see<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.480> kind<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.539> spider<00:00:27.810> shaped<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
see that it's kind of spider shaped it

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.330 
see that it's kind of spider shaped it
is<00:00:28.619> made<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.640> heat<00:00:30.390> form<00:00:31.019> plastic<00:00:31.679> so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
is made out of the heat form plastic so

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.040 
is made out of the heat form plastic so
it's<00:00:32.550> very<00:00:32.730> sturdy<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.480> actually<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> lot

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it's very sturdy it was actually a lot

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
it's very sturdy it was actually a lot
more<00:00:34.760> rigid<00:00:35.760> than<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.000> expected<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:37.070> it's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
more rigid than I expected it to be it's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.549 
more rigid than I expected it to be it's
pretty<00:00:38.309> simple<00:00:38.700> idea<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
pretty simple idea so I'm just going to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.170 
pretty simple idea so I'm just going to
go<00:00:40.800> ahead<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> attach<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.520> mic<00:00:41.760> stand<00:00:42.030> so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
go ahead and attach to the mic stand so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540 
go ahead and attach to the mic stand so
you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.420> see<00:00:42.600> how<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> works<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you can see how it works the way that it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.270 
you can see how it works the way that it
attaches<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.120> take<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.570> clamp<00:00:46.500> part<00:00:46.829> apart

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
attaches you take the clamp part apart

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.549 
attaches you take the clamp part apart
into<00:00:47.550> two<00:00:47.730> pieces<00:00:47.969> wrap<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.020> around<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.379> mic

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
into two pieces wrap it around your mic

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.910 
into two pieces wrap it around your mic
stand<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:51.020> then<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.199> slide<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.620> together

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
stand and then just slide it together

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.229 
stand and then just slide it together
like<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.610> tighten<00:00:56.820> down<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
like so and you just tighten down this

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
like so and you just tighten down this
clamp<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> other<00:00:58.079> side<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.559> little<00:00:59.100> lower

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
clamp on the other side a little lower

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.510 
clamp on the other side a little lower
so<00:00:59.579> good<00:00:59.789> iPad<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.250> once

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
so good iPad in there and then once

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.200 
so good iPad in there and then once
you've<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:04.140> attached<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.729> iPad

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you've got it in or attached the iPad

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.109 
you've got it in or attached the iPad
just<00:01:06.479> slides<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.729> put<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
just slides in and then where you put it

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.109 
just slides in and then where you put it
lots<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> times<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> loosen<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.560> up

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
lots of times you have to loosen that up

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
lots of times you have to loosen that up
put<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.360> its<00:01:12.540> engineered<00:01:13.140> very<00:01:13.439> tightly<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
put it in its engineered very tightly so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.340 
put it in its engineered very tightly so
that<00:01:14.189> iPad<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:15.570> sure<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.020> tell<00:01:16.259> in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that iPad I'm sure if you can tell in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.219 
that iPad I'm sure if you can tell in
the<00:01:16.380> video<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.979> wraps<00:01:17.580> around<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.600> shape

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the video but it wraps around the shape

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.039 
the video but it wraps around the shape
of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> iPad<00:01:19.950> pretty<00:01:20.850> precisely<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> gets

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
of the iPad pretty precisely so it gets

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.100 
of the iPad pretty precisely so it gets
in<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.470> nice<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.580> tight<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.479> open<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:24.960> one

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
in there nice and tight it's open at one

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.130 
in there nice and tight it's open at one
end<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.420> basically<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> put<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.020> in

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
end so you basically have to put it in

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
end so you basically have to put it in
so<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.030> handles<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> bottom

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so that the handles are on the bottom

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.080 
so that the handles are on the bottom
obviously<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> doesn't<00:01:31.650> slip<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:32.090> but

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
obviously so the doesn't slip out but

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.120 
obviously so the doesn't slip out but
once<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.740> pretty<00:01:34.950> nice

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
once it's in it's a pretty nice

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.780 
once it's in it's a pretty nice
arrangement<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:36.350> use<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.799> display

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
arrangement you can use it to display

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.179 
arrangement you can use it to display
any<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.710> software<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.890> you'd<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.149 
any of the software that you'd like to
use<00:01:41.340> lime<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.329> stage<00:01:42.720> I've<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:43.829> been

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
use lime on stage I've actually been

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.399 
use lime on stage I've actually been
using<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:45.240> couple<00:01:45.509> weeks<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:45.960> because

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
using it for a couple weeks now because

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.980 
using it for a couple weeks now because
I<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> test<00:01:46.979> out<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> products<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.820> I'm

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
I like to test out the products that I'm

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.350 
I like to test out the products that I'm
reviewing<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.619> live<00:01:50.280> situations<00:01:50.939> before<00:01:51.149> I

actually<00:01:51.540> give<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.229> opinion<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.710> them<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:54.030> I've

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
actually give my opinion of them so I've

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.929 
actually give my opinion of them so I've
been<00:01:54.329> using<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.579> to<00:01:56.579> use<00:01:56.759> an

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
been using this one for to use an

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
been using this one for to use an
application<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.869> use<00:01:58.020> called<00:01:58.229> ion<00:01:58.469> song

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
application that I use called ion song

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.330 
application that I use called ion song
which<00:01:59.070> lets<00:01:59.340> me<00:01:59.960> display<00:02:00.960> lead<00:02:01.680> sheets<00:02:02.009> for

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
which lets me display lead sheets for

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.940 
which lets me display lead sheets for
the<00:02:02.430> guitar<00:02:02.729> music<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.210> I'm<00:02:03.329> playing<00:02:03.950> and

the guitar music that I'm playing and
it's<00:02:05.159> worked<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.520> well

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it's worked out really well

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.389 
it's worked out really well
the<00:02:07.140> only<00:02:07.290> thing<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.979> say<00:02:08.160> that

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the only thing when I have to say that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.020 
the only thing when I have to say that
the<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.090> clip<00:02:09.450> is

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
the I clip is

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.809 
the I clip is
to<00:02:10.300> fit<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.290> your<00:02:11.440> mic<00:02:11.650> stand<00:02:11.950> basically<00:02:12.640> one

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
to fit on your mic stand basically one

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.610 
to fit on your mic stand basically one
of<00:02:12.850> two<00:02:13.120> configurations<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.170> either<00:02:14.350> put

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
of two configurations you can either put

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.470 
of two configurations you can either put
it<00:02:14.740> if<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> boom<00:02:15.670> mic<00:02:15.940> stand<00:02:16.270> like

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
it if you have a boom mic stand like

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.380 
it if you have a boom mic stand like
this<00:02:16.630> one<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.020> can<00:02:17.170> put<00:02:17.319> it<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.680> upright

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
this one you can put it on the upright

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.390 
this one you can put it on the upright
so<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:19.690> underneath<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.530> boom<00:02:20.709> or<00:02:22.050> let<00:02:23.050> me

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
so it is underneath the boom or let me

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.620 
so it is underneath the boom or let me
take<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.520> apart<00:02:24.880> again<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.300> will<00:02:25.420> show

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
take this apart again and I will show

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.330 
take this apart again and I will show
you<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> other<00:02:26.050> way<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.830> put<00:02:27.220> this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
you the other way that you can put this

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:38.340 
you the other way that you can put this
on<00:02:27.489> here<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:37.180> other<00:02:37.330> way<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.569> they<00:02:37.870> suggest

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
on here the other way that they suggest

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.960 
on here the other way that they suggest
that<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.590> can<00:02:38.739> put<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.010> together<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.520> actually

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
that you can put it together is actually

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.720 
that you can put it together is actually
to<00:02:40.180> put<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:41.620> boom<00:02:41.860> section<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.550> mic

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
to put it on the boom section of the mic

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:56.660 
to put it on the boom section of the mic
stand<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.980> if<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.100> do<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.850> would<00:02:46.090> be

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:07.650 

like<00:02:57.670> this<00:03:05.100> now<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.160> only<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.120> only<00:03:07.150> drawback

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
like this now the only the only drawback

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.150 
like this now the only the only drawback
to<00:03:07.810> using<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> boom<00:03:08.560> section<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.100> the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
to using it on the boom section of the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.990 
to using it on the boom section of the
mic<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.569> can<00:03:10.870> only<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.580> iPad

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
mic is that you can only have the iPad

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.910 
mic is that you can only have the iPad
and<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.300> horizontal<00:03:13.630> configuration<00:03:14.110> because

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
and a horizontal configuration because

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.410 
and a horizontal configuration because
you<00:03:15.010> can<00:03:15.160> see<00:03:15.340> if<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.519> try<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.760> put<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.209> here

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
you can see if I try to put it in here

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.819 
you can see if I try to put it in here
it's<00:03:16.600> only<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.019> let<00:03:17.170> me<00:03:17.290> have<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.500> much

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
it's only and let me have that much

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.660 
it's only and let me have that much
range<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.220> motion<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.799> is<00:03:21.010> my<00:03:21.190> only<00:03:21.340> gripe

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
range of motion this is my only gripe

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.910 
range of motion this is my only gripe
about<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.299> clip<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.930> found<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:23.530> far<00:03:23.739> is

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
about the I clip that I found so far is

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.860 
about the I clip that I found so far is
that<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.370> would<00:03:24.640> think<00:03:24.820> kind<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.420> logically

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
that you would think kind of logically

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.289 
that you would think kind of logically
that<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:27.160> know<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.459> product<00:03:27.820> like<00:03:27.940> this<00:03:28.120> if

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
that you know on a product like this if

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.509 
that you know on a product like this if
you<00:03:28.390> wanted<00:03:28.750> if<00:03:29.560> you're<00:03:29.709> making<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.130> clip<00:03:30.310> for<00:03:30.489> a

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
you wanted if you're making a clip for a

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.120 
you wanted if you're making a clip for a
product<00:03:30.970> which<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.360> built<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.290> be<00:03:32.650> used<00:03:32.920> in

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
product which is built to be used in

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.759 
product which is built to be used in
both<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.600> horizontal<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.780> portrait<00:03:35.620> position

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
both a horizontal and portrait position

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.180 
both a horizontal and portrait position
that<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.940> would<00:03:37.090> be<00:03:37.590> you'd<00:03:38.590> be<00:03:38.709> able<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:38.980> just

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
that it would be you'd be able to just

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.300 
that it would be you'd be able to just
swivel<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:39.730> section<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.829> clip<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.160> that

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
swivel this section of the clip so that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.130 
swivel this section of the clip so that
you<00:03:42.400> can<00:03:42.609> turn<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.359> with<00:03:43.570> even<00:03:43.750> if<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.930> had<00:03:44.019> it

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
you can turn it with even if you had it

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.080 
you can turn it with even if you had it
down<00:03:44.260> here<00:03:44.590> I've<00:03:44.739> found<00:03:45.010> sometimes<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.940> would

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
down here I've found sometimes it would

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.140 
down here I've found sometimes it would
be<00:03:46.120> nice<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.420> just<00:03:46.750> be<00:03:46.840> able<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.170> turn<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
be nice to just be able to turn it and

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.039 
be nice to just be able to turn it and
look<00:03:49.150> at<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.390> in<00:03:49.450> different<00:03:49.510> directions

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
look at it in different directions

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.289 
look at it in different directions
depending<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.680> app<00:03:50.799> that<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.100> mean<00:03:51.310> but

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
depending on the app that I mean but

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.569 
depending on the app that I mean but
when<00:03:52.540> it's<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:53.470> order<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.920> actually<00:03:54.070> change

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
when it's in order to actually change

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.849 
when it's in order to actually change
that<00:03:54.910> what<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:55.810> have<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.350> is<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:56.829> to

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
that what you have to do is you have to

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.340 
that what you have to do is you have to
take<00:03:57.250> out<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.640> screw<00:03:58.000> completely<00:03:58.359> pull<00:03:59.200> that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
take out this screw completely pull that

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.050 
take out this screw completely pull that
piece<00:03:59.530> off<00:03:59.739> turn<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.579> put<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:00.880> back<00:04:01.000> down

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
piece off turn it and put it back down

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.289 
piece off turn it and put it back down
it's<00:04:01.510> not<00:04:01.690> just<00:04:01.989> a<00:04:02.079> simple<00:04:02.609> question<00:04:03.609> of<00:04:03.760> just

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
it's not just a simple question of just

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.580 
it's not just a simple question of just
turning<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:04.750> or<00:04:04.959> even<00:04:05.049> having<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.410> little

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
turning this or even having a little

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.229 
turning this or even having a little
button<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:05.950> possibly<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:06.670> could<00:04:06.850> push<00:04:07.060> in

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
button that possibly you could push in

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.740 
button that possibly you could push in
to<00:04:07.989> get<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.380> unlock<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:09.010> turn<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:10.540> that's

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
to get it to unlock and turn so that's

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.150 
to get it to unlock and turn so that's
pretty<00:04:10.930> much<00:04:11.079> my<00:04:11.290> only<00:04:11.470> gripe<00:04:11.650> better<00:04:11.890> than

concerned before I actually received it

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.770

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
it for a couple days I found that it was

on the upright of the mic stand
it's<00:04:50.259> a<00:04:50.440> it<00:04:51.160> seems<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.550> actually<00:04:51.850> add<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.060> the

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
it's a it seems to actually add to the

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
center of gravity of the mic stand so I

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.629 
center of gravity of the mic stand so I
haven't<00:04:55.030> been<00:04:55.120> an<00:04:55.240> all<00:04:55.360> concerned<00:04:55.750> about<00:04:55.840> it

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
haven't been an all concerned about it

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.150 
haven't been an all concerned about it
toppling<00:04:57.639> over<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:59.169> know<00:04:59.260> with<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.440> exception

toppling over you know with a exception

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.800 
toppling over you know with a exception
maybe<00:05:00.340> somebody<00:05:00.729> on<00:05:00.760> stage<00:05:01.090> completely

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
maybe somebody on stage completely

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.730 
maybe somebody on stage completely
running<00:05:02.020> into<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:02.530> knocking<00:05:02.800> over<00:05:02.949> I

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
running into it and knocking over I

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.779 
running into it and knocking over I
don't<00:05:05.740> see<00:05:05.889> much<00:05:06.039> of<00:05:06.100> an<00:05:06.280> issue<00:05:06.370> with<00:05:06.639> it

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
don't see much of an issue with it

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.340 
don't see much of an issue with it
certainly<00:05:07.570> better<00:05:07.780> than<00:05:07.960> what<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.110> was<00:05:08.199> doing

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
certainly better than what I was doing

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.320 
certainly better than what I was doing
before<00:05:08.680> which<00:05:09.160> was<00:05:09.280> just<00:05:09.520> resting<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:10.060> on<00:05:10.270> a

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
before which was just resting it on a

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.950 
before which was just resting it on a
music<00:05:11.320> stand<00:05:11.530> which<00:05:12.400> was<00:05:12.639> not<00:05:13.419> ideal<00:05:13.449> either

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
music stand which was not ideal either

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.379 
music stand which was not ideal either
but<00:05:14.289> it's<00:05:14.800> great<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.460> be<00:05:15.610> able<00:05:15.699> to<00:05:15.820> have<00:05:16.000> access

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
but it's great to be able to have access

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.650 
but it's great to be able to have access
to<00:05:16.570> all<00:05:16.720> of<00:05:16.840> my<00:05:16.930> apps<00:05:18.240> you<00:05:19.240> know<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:19.509> said

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
to all of my apps you know like I said

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.570 
to all of my apps you know like I said
I'm<00:05:19.870> using<00:05:19.960> it<00:05:20.229> for<00:05:20.259> lead<00:05:20.949> sheets<00:05:21.250> in<00:05:21.460> this

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
I'm using it for lead sheets in this

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.820 
I'm using it for lead sheets in this
particular<00:05:22.030> application<00:05:22.630> that<00:05:22.660> very<00:05:23.620> easily

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
particular application that very easily

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.480 
particular application that very easily
I<00:05:24.039> could<00:05:24.160> imagine<00:05:24.550> using<00:05:24.910> it<00:05:25.180> for<00:05:26.400> you<00:05:27.400> know

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
I could imagine using it for you know

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.250 
I could imagine using it for you know
program<00:05:27.820> like<00:05:27.970> studio<00:05:28.389> track<00:05:28.750> that<00:05:28.990> would<00:05:29.080> let

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
program like studio track that would let

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.740 
program like studio track that would let
you<00:05:29.410> record<00:05:32.099> the<00:05:33.099> amps<00:05:33.520> like<00:05:33.760> you<00:05:34.300> know<00:05:34.389> I<00:05:34.419> can

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
you record the amps like you know I can

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.360 
you record the amps like you know I can
multimedia<00:05:35.500> actually<00:05:35.860> makes<00:05:36.130> their

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
multimedia actually makes their

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.719 
multimedia actually makes their
AmpliTube<00:05:36.880> application<00:05:38.729> which

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
AmpliTube application which

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.450 
AmpliTube application which
unfortunately<00:05:40.720> again<00:05:41.440> it<00:05:41.979> requires<00:05:42.159> a

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
unfortunately again it requires a

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.659 
unfortunately again it requires a
horizontal<00:05:43.090> display<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:45.130> would<00:05:45.490> not<00:05:45.610> be

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
horizontal display so it would not be

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.490 
horizontal display so it would not be
easy<00:05:45.970> for<00:05:46.240> me<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.389> switch<00:05:46.659> back<00:05:46.870> and<00:05:46.900> forth<00:05:47.110> but

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
easy for me to switch back and forth but

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.580 
easy for me to switch back and forth but
this<00:05:47.590> would<00:05:47.800> be<00:05:47.830> a<00:05:47.949> great<00:05:48.250> opportunity<00:05:49.150> to

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
this would be a great opportunity to

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.750 
this would be a great opportunity to
attach<00:05:50.590> something<00:05:50.860> like<00:05:51.370> this<00:05:51.520> right<00:05:51.729> in

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
attach something like this right in

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.850 
attach something like this right in
