into<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.309> guide<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> let's<00:00:40.500> start<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.920> guide

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
into the guide so let's start this guide

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.040 
into the guide so let's start this guide
with<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.460> runes<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> pretty<00:00:42.750> much<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
with the runes it's the pretty much the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
with the runes it's the pretty much the
most<00:00:43.140> standard<00:00:43.829> rune<00:00:44.010> page<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.489> game

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
most standard rune page in the game

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.209 
most standard rune page in the game
right<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.210> AP<00:00:45.809> mid<00:00:46.230> laners<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.010> not

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
right now for AP mid laners it's not

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.250 
right now for AP mid laners it's not
just<00:00:47.579> used<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.030> Victor<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.629> page<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.230> be

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
just used on Victor this page can be

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.189 
just used on Victor this page can be
used<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.770> isere<00:00:50.219> anivia<00:00:50.879> other<00:00:51.480> champions<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
used on isere anivia other champions and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.990 
used on isere anivia other champions and
so<00:00:52.829> let's<00:00:52.980> go<00:00:53.100> through<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> we've<00:00:53.520> got<00:00:53.550> AP

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
so let's go through it we've got AP

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910 
so let's go through it we've got AP
quints<00:00:54.420> magic<00:00:54.840> pen<00:00:55.020> Reds<00:00:55.320> health<00:00:55.680> per<00:00:55.890> level

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
quints magic pen Reds health per level

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.849 
quints magic pen Reds health per level
yellows<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.430> CDR<00:00:57.120> level<00:00:57.510> blues<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.440> only<00:00:58.680> two

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
yellows and CDR level blues the only two

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.229 
yellows and CDR level blues the only two
things<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> fully<00:00:59.820> explain

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
things I'm going to fully explain

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.270 
things I'm going to fully explain
because<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.710> others<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.039> fairly

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
because the others are fairly

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.670 
because the others are fairly
self-explanatory<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> health<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> CDR

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
self-explanatory are the health and CDR

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
self-explanatory are the health and CDR
the<00:01:05.309> reason<00:01:05.610> why<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:06.030> health<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.600> CDR<00:01:07.140> is

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the reason why you go health and CDR is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.469 
the reason why you go health and CDR is
because<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:07.890> both<00:01:08.130> basically<00:01:08.640> help<00:01:09.240> each

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
because they both basically help each

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.870 
because they both basically help each
other<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.409> don't<00:01:10.650> need<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> go<00:01:11.100> magic<00:01:11.520> resist

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
other you don't need to go magic resist

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.310 
other you don't need to go magic resist
if<00:01:12.000> you're<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.299> health<00:01:12.600> per<00:01:12.780> level<00:01:12.810> because

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
if you're going health per level because

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
if you're going health per level because
the<00:01:13.470> health<00:01:13.680> per<00:01:13.890> level<00:01:13.939> counters<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> AP

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the health per level counters the AP

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.690 
the health per level counters the AP
mage<00:01:15.659> you're<00:01:15.900> most<00:01:16.110> likely<00:01:16.380> against<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
mage you're most likely against and the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
mage you're most likely against and the
CD<00:01:18.060> upper<00:01:18.390> level<00:01:18.720> basically<00:01:19.500> gets<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
CD upper level basically gets you to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.249 
CD upper level basically gets you to
that<00:01:20.130> forty<00:01:20.580> percent<00:01:20.880> mark<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.140> know

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that forty percent mark that you know

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
that forty percent mark that you know
most<00:01:22.470> mid<00:01:22.740> laners<00:01:23.040> want<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.640> because

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
most mid laners want to be at because

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
most mid laners want to be at because
the<00:01:24.420> current<00:01:24.600> item<00:01:24.869> build<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.409> only<00:01:25.560> tend<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the current item build you only tend to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.830 
the current item build you only tend to
build<00:01:26.220> about<00:01:26.369> twenty<00:01:26.759> percent<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.479> item

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
build about twenty percent in one item

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
build about twenty percent in one item
and<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.740> masteries<00:01:29.189> cover<00:01:29.460> about<00:01:29.640> 5%

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and then your masteries cover about 5%

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
and then your masteries cover about 5%
so<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> remaining<00:01:31.409> 15<00:01:31.860> odd<00:01:31.979> percent<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
so the remaining 15 odd percent is

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.149 
so the remaining 15 odd percent is
covered<00:01:32.880> by<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.030> nine<00:01:33.420> CDR<00:01:34.049> per<00:01:34.229> level<00:01:34.409> anyway

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
covered by the nine CDR per level anyway

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.480 
covered by the nine CDR per level anyway
those<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.850> runes<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.270> Victor<00:01:37.280> now<00:01:38.280> let's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
those are the runes for Victor now let's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.800 
those are the runes for Victor now let's
move<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> masteries<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
move on to the masteries now the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.480 
move on to the masteries now the
masteries<00:01:40.229> again<00:01:40.470> you'll<00:01:40.650> most<00:01:40.920> likely<00:01:41.040> won't

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
masteries again you'll most likely won't

this<00:03:17.859> is<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.310> simply<00:03:18.760> think<00:03:18.970> Luden's<00:03:19.420> echo<00:03:19.690> is

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
this is I simply think Luden's echo is

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.319 
this is I simply think Luden's echo is
an<00:03:19.930> okay<00:03:20.320> item<00:03:20.709> on<00:03:20.829> Victor<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.400> all<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.030> items

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
an okay item on Victor and all the items

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.630 
an okay item on Victor and all the items
i'm<00:03:22.510> showing<00:03:22.870> here<00:03:23.140> are<00:03:23.320> simply<00:03:23.950> better<00:03:24.220> on

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
i'm showing here are simply better on

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.810 
i'm showing here are simply better on
Victor<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:26.079> build<00:03:26.290> lutens<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:26.859> him<00:03:27.070> but

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
Victor you can build lutens on him but

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.059 
Victor you can build lutens on him but
personally<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.239> think<00:03:28.299> there's<00:03:28.630> no<00:03:28.690> point

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
personally I think there's no point

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.370 
personally I think there's no point
looking<00:03:30.069> into<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.790> skill<00:03:31.239> order<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.959> Victor

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
looking into the skill order of Victor

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.259 
looking into the skill order of Victor
so<00:03:32.590> how<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:32.829> level<00:03:33.280> up<00:03:33.370> your<00:03:33.430> abilities<00:03:34.030> in

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
so how you level up your abilities in

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.660 
so how you level up your abilities in
which<00:03:34.480> order<00:03:34.750> it's<00:03:35.140> fairly<00:03:35.440> basic<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.280> taking

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
which order it's fairly basic so taking

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.699 
which order it's fairly basic so taking
ultimate<00:03:37.150> whenever<00:03:37.420> possible<00:03:37.690> then<00:03:38.260> taking

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
ultimate whenever possible then taking

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.160 
ultimate whenever possible then taking
your<00:03:38.859> e<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.370> laser<00:03:39.609> then<00:03:40.150> your<00:03:40.359> cue<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.930> auto

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170

your e the laser then your cue the auto
attack<00:03:41.590> buff<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.130> then<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.579> w<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.090> stun<00:03:43.690> AoE

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.410 
attack buff and then the w the stun AoE
this<00:03:44.980> will<00:03:45.160> allow<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.579> have<00:03:45.850> great<00:03:46.150> wave

clay great poke and then eventually have
