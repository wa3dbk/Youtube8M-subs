know<00:01:28.439> some<00:01:28.710> people<00:01:28.740> did<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.060> could<00:01:30.180> cite

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
know some people did and you could cite

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
know some people did and you could cite
people<00:01:30.659> from<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> fair<00:01:31.049> distance<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.619> just

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
people from a fair distance and just

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.580 
people from a fair distance and just
dominate<00:01:32.549> everyone<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.659> gun<00:01:33.930> but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
dominate everyone with this gun but

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.740 
dominate everyone with this gun but
since<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.159> I've<00:01:35.400> noticed<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.909> no<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.479> uses

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
since then I've noticed that no one uses

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
since then I've noticed that no one uses
it<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.200> didn't<00:01:37.380> realize<00:01:37.680> why<00:01:37.979> until<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it and I didn't realize why until I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.160 
it and I didn't realize why until I
started<00:01:38.820> playing<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.689> apparently

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
started playing it because apparently

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
started playing it because apparently
they<00:01:40.860> patch<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.400> thing<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.909> nerfed<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> into

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
they patch this thing and nerfed it into

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.380 
they patch this thing and nerfed it into
oblivion<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.770> increase<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.759> recoil<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
oblivion they increase the recoil I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
oblivion they increase the recoil I
believe<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.020> actually<00:01:46.320> sure<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.740> that's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
believe I'm not actually sure if that's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.760 
believe I'm not actually sure if that's
correct<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:49.350> reduce

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
correct but I do know that they reduce

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
correct but I do know that they reduce
the<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.340> magazine<00:01:50.759> size<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.840> 26<00:01:52.500> i

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the the magazine size down to 26 i

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
the the magazine size down to 26 i
believe<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.310> 31<00:01:53.909> before<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> patch

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
believe it was at 31 before the patch

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.170 
believe it was at 31 before the patch
and<00:01:54.899> now<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.409> done<00:01:55.500> down<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> 26<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> five

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and now it's done down to 26 and five

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.999 
and now it's done down to 26 and five
bullets<00:01:57.600> doesn't<00:01:57.899> seem<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> lot<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:58.710> when

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
bullets doesn't seem like a lot but when

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.830 
bullets doesn't seem like a lot but when
you<00:01:59.130> were<00:01:59.219> using<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.670> highest<00:02:00.000> RPM<00:02:00.390> weapon<00:02:00.750> in

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you were using the highest RPM weapon in

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.139 
you were using the highest RPM weapon in
the<00:02:00.930> game<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.799> trust<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:03.090> of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the game that trust me that is a lot of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.160 
the game that trust me that is a lot of
bullets<00:02:03.540> there<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> situations

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
bullets there was a lot of situations

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
bullets there was a lot of situations
where<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.250> had<00:02:05.369> five<00:02:05.610> extra<00:02:05.969> bullets<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
where if I had five extra bullets the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.760 
where if I had five extra bullets the
target<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.869> died<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.320> because<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
target would have died but because I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
target would have died but because I
didn't<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.310> died<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.209> very<00:02:09.479> embarrassing<00:02:10.200> death

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
didn't I died a very embarrassing death

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.180 
didn't I died a very embarrassing death
where<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.739> try

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
where I try

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.730 
where I try
to<00:02:11.280> reload<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.600> since<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.080> patch<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.530> have

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
to reload so since the patch you have

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.280 
to reload so since the patch you have
probably<00:02:14.100> noticed<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.700> hardly<00:02:15.300> anyone<00:02:15.840> uses

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
probably noticed that hardly anyone uses

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.290 
probably noticed that hardly anyone uses
weapon<00:02:16.830> now<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.370> my<00:02:17.460> opinion<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.060> for

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
weapon now and in my opinion that is for

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.570 
weapon now and in my opinion that is for
good<00:02:18.450> reason<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.440> would<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.860> assumed<00:02:20.250> that

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
good reason you would have assumed that

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.280 
good reason you would have assumed that
dice<00:02:21.030> would<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.480> nerfed<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.080> point

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
dice would have nerfed it to the point

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.480 
dice would have nerfed it to the point
where<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.530> was<00:02:22.620> more<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:22.980> line<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.460> other

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
where it was more in line with the other

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.030 
where it was more in line with the other
weapons<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.210> think<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.170> I'm<00:02:25.230> assuming<00:02:25.830> most

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
weapons I think and I'm assuming most

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.470 
weapons I think and I'm assuming most
people<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.580> because<00:02:26.850> no<00:02:26.970> one<00:02:27.120> uses<00:02:27.270> it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
people have because no one uses it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.990 
people have because no one uses it
anymore<00:02:27.660> they<00:02:28.230> nerfed<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.710> too<00:02:28.980> much<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.640> now

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
anymore they nerfed it too much and now

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.090 
anymore they nerfed it too much and now
it's<00:02:30.330> almost<00:02:30.690> useless<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.950> probably

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
it's almost useless and you probably

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.250 
it's almost useless and you probably
remember<00:02:32.340> when<00:02:33.000> trying<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.570> level<00:02:33.840> up<00:02:34.050> this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
remember when trying to level up this

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.280 
remember when trying to level up this
weapon<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.010> iron<00:02:35.250> sights<00:02:35.700> are<00:02:35.940> abysmal<00:02:36.540> there

was<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> lot<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.770> vacations<00:02:38.310> where<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:39.000> would<00:02:39.510> be

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
was a lot of vacations where I would be

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.540 
was a lot of vacations where I would be
going<00:02:39.750> for<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> medium<00:02:40.440> range<00:02:40.770> target<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.430> know

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
going for a medium range target you know

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.950 
going for a medium range target you know
he's<00:02:41.730> off<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> distance<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.480> little<00:02:42.510> bit<00:02:42.780> I

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
he's off in the distance a little bit I

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.080 
he's off in the distance a little bit I
would<00:02:43.410> line<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.620> my<00:02:43.800> shot<00:02:44.040> pull<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.820> trigger

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
would line up my shot pull the trigger

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.060 
would line up my shot pull the trigger
and<00:02:45.360> then<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.840> recoil<00:02:46.260> would<00:02:46.440> happen<00:02:46.770> the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
and then the recoil would happen the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.470 
and then the recoil would happen the
iron<00:02:47.250> sights<00:02:47.550> would<00:02:47.790> happen<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:48.420> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
iron sights would happen and then I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.910 
iron sights would happen and then I
would<00:02:48.630> lose<00:02:48.720> my<00:02:48.780> target<00:02:49.260> I'd<00:02:49.350> have<00:02:49.470> no<00:02:49.620> idea

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
would lose my target I'd have no idea

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.560 
would lose my target I'd have no idea
where<00:02:50.040> they<00:02:50.130> went<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.790> I'd<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.150> zoom<00:02:51.510> back

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
where they went so I'd have to zoom back

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.350 
where they went so I'd have to zoom back
out<00:02:52.040> reassess<00:02:53.040> where<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:53.520> were<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.000> then

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
out reassess where they were and then

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.910 
out reassess where they were and then
zoom<00:02:54.690> back<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.230> try<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.440> take<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.770> out

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
zoom back in to try to take them out

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.850 
zoom back in to try to take them out
that<00:02:56.490> got<00:02:56.760> me<00:02:56.940> killed<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:57.810> often<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.320> was<00:02:58.470> it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
that got me killed so often it was it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.110 
that got me killed so often it was it
was<00:02:59.040> what<00:02:59.280> probably<00:02:59.670> one<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.030> most

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
was what probably one of the most

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.380 
was what probably one of the most
frustrating<00:03:00.390> aspects<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:02.370> weapon<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.210> not

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
frustrating aspects of the weapon so not

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.540 
frustrating aspects of the weapon so not
only<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.320> iron<00:03:04.530> sights<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.340> thing

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
only is the iron sights on this thing

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.700 
only is the iron sights on this thing
god<00:03:05.850> awful<00:03:06.300> but<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.570> recoil<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.350> just

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
god awful but the recoil is just

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.950 
god awful but the recoil is just
unbelievable<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.880> kicks<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.330> mule<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
unbelievable it kicks like a mule and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.940 
unbelievable it kicks like a mule and
you<00:03:10.080> would<00:03:10.200> assume<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.680> would<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.920> a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
you would assume that it would have a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.590 
you would assume that it would have a
lot<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.220> recoil<00:03:11.460> because<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.000> does<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.360> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
lot of recoil because it does have the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.260 
lot of recoil because it does have the
highest<00:03:13.190> RPM<00:03:14.190> for<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.610> assault<00:03:14.850> rifles<00:03:15.150> and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
highest RPM for the assault rifles and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.550 
highest RPM for the assault rifles and
probably<00:03:15.480> when<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.690> highest<00:03:15.810> rpms<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
probably when the highest rpms in the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.140 
probably when the highest rpms in the
game<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:16.860> i<00:03:16.950> remember<00:03:17.130> right<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:18.000> would

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
game if i remember right and that would

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.420 
game if i remember right and that would
come<00:03:18.420> with<00:03:18.630> some<00:03:19.350> sort<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.739> disadvantage<00:03:20.250> for

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
come with some sort of disadvantage for

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.720 
come with some sort of disadvantage for
you<00:03:20.580> but<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:21.510> bad<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.430> trying<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.550> stay

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
you but it's so bad that trying to stay

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.760 
you but it's so bad that trying to stay
on<00:03:23.910> target<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> very<00:03:25.020> very<00:03:25.440> challenging

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
on target is a very very challenging

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.490 
on target is a very very challenging
endeavor<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.850> for<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.750> most<00:03:27.900> part<00:03:28.020> it's<00:03:28.350> up

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
endeavor and for the most part it's up

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.050 
endeavor and for the most part it's up
it's<00:03:28.770> pretty<00:03:29.010> much<00:03:29.130> dumb<00:03:29.430> luck<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:29.940> you're

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
it's pretty much dumb luck if you're

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.930 
it's pretty much dumb luck if you're
able<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.600> go<00:03:31.500> full<00:03:31.739> auto<00:03:31.950> or<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.610> know<00:03:32.700> burst

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
able to go full auto or you know burst

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.060 
able to go full auto or you know burst
fire<00:03:33.180> someone<00:03:33.600> down<00:03:33.810> at<00:03:34.110> medium<00:03:34.530> range<00:03:34.560> to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
fire someone down at medium range to

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.100 
fire someone down at medium range to
stay<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.340> target<00:03:35.550> that's<00:03:36.150> how<00:03:36.300> bad<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.870> iron

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
stay on target that's how bad the iron

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.780 
stay on target that's how bad the iron
are<00:03:37.440> not<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.709> iron<00:03:37.920> sights<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.400> recoil

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
are not the iron sights but the recoil

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.449 
are not the iron sights but the recoil
is<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:39.360> this<00:03:39.780> gun<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.110> kicks<00:03:40.650> everywhere<00:03:41.190> it's

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
is on this gun it kicks everywhere it's

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.310 
is on this gun it kicks everywhere it's
extremely<00:03:42.390> difficult<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.810> stay<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:43.110> target

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
extremely difficult to stay on target

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.160 
extremely difficult to stay on target
and<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.800> found<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.970> made<00:03:45.330> for<00:03:45.630> some<00:03:45.690> very

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
and I found that it made for some very

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.770 
and I found that it made for some very
very<00:03:46.650> interesting<00:03:46.980> gameplay<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:48.660> if<00:03:48.750> that

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
very interesting gameplay and if that

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.630 
very interesting gameplay and if that
wasn't<00:03:49.230> enough<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.739> top<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.070> all<00:03:50.190> off<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
wasn't enough to top it all off the

wasn't enough to top it all off the
famas<00:03:50.940> has<00:03:51.239> one<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.080> longest<00:03:52.410> reload

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
famas has one of the longest reload

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.490 
famas has one of the longest reload
times<00:03:53.580> out<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.030> any<00:03:54.420> weapon<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.110> game<00:03:55.260> if

times out of any weapon in the game if

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.810 
times out of any weapon in the game if

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
you go through all of your rounds in

your magazine it is going to take you a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.390 
your magazine it is going to take you a
staggering<00:03:59.690> 3.9<00:04:00.690> seconds<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.920> reload<00:04:02.220> that's

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
staggering 3.9 seconds to reload that's

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.310 
staggering 3.9 seconds to reload that's
almost<00:04:02.580> four<00:04:02.910> seconds<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.870> you're<00:04:04.080> just

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
almost four seconds that you're just

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.890 
almost four seconds that you're just
standing<00:04:04.620> there<00:04:04.800> reloading<00:04:05.519> waiting<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.810> get

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
standing there reloading waiting to get

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.199 
standing there reloading waiting to get
back<00:04:07.080> into<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.440> action<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.280> very<00:04:08.880> long

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
back into the action that is a very long

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.940 
back into the action that is a very long
time<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.630> there<00:04:09.900> was<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.050> lot<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.380> occasions

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
time and there was a lot of occasions

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.740 
time and there was a lot of occasions
where<00:04:11.130> I'm<00:04:11.250> just<00:04:11.489> sitting<00:04:11.760> back<00:04:11.940> trying<00:04:12.660> to

where I'm just sitting back trying to

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.750 
where I'm just sitting back trying to

while I got my pants down and you're

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.060 
while I got my pants down and you're
gonna<00:04:18.419> have<00:04:18.630> your<00:04:18.780> pants<00:04:19.080> down<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.229> lot<00:04:19.560> when

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
gonna have your pants down a lot when

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.950 
gonna have your pants down a lot when
you're<00:04:20.190> using<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.580> weapon<00:04:20.760> because<00:04:21.180> you're

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
you're using this weapon because you're

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.270 
you're using this weapon because you're
constantly<00:04:22.169> reloading<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.160> you're

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
constantly reloading and you're

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.950 
constantly reloading and you're
constantly<00:04:23.669> taking<00:04:23.820> four<00:04:24.330> seconds<00:04:24.780> out<00:04:24.870> of

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
constantly taking four seconds out of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.590 
constantly taking four seconds out of
your<00:04:25.080> day<00:04:25.289> just<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.250> reload<00:04:26.640> this<00:04:26.820> bad<00:04:27.030> boy<00:04:27.270> and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
your day just to reload this bad boy and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.750 
your day just to reload this bad boy and
it's<00:04:28.050> it's<00:04:28.260> really<00:04:28.530> it's<00:04:28.830> really<00:04:29.070> really<00:04:29.580> bad

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
it's it's really it's really really bad

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.000 
it's it's really it's really really bad
so<00:04:30.600> now<00:04:30.780> you're<00:04:30.870> probably<00:04:31.050> thinking<00:04:31.289> of<00:04:31.919> that

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
so now you're probably thinking of that

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.920 
so now you're probably thinking of that
if<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.250> weapon<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.669> so<00:04:32.940> terrible<00:04:33.570> then<00:04:33.630> how

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
if this weapon is so terrible then how

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.540 
if this weapon is so terrible then how
in<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.169> world<00:04:34.200> were<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:34.979> getting<00:04:35.280> first

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
in the world were you getting first

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.219 
in the world were you getting first
place<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.660> first<00:04:36.840> thing<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.110> might

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
place and the first thing that might

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.750 
place and the first thing that might
come<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.500> mind<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:37.919> that<00:04:38.190> my<00:04:38.310> allies<00:04:38.640> are

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
come to mind is that my allies are

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.980 
come to mind is that my allies are
terrible<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.150> enemies<00:04:39.419> are<00:04:39.450> terrible<00:04:39.840> and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
terrible the enemies are terrible and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.050 
terrible the enemies are terrible and
that<00:04:40.590> automatically<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.400> just<00:04:41.520> gonna<00:04:41.610> push<00:04:41.850> me

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
that automatically is just gonna push me

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.640 
that automatically is just gonna push me
up<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.360> top<00:04:42.510> no<00:04:42.750> matter<00:04:42.870> what<00:04:43.260> weapon<00:04:43.530> i'm

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
up to the top no matter what weapon i'm

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.460 
up to the top no matter what weapon i'm
using<00:04:43.979> and<00:04:44.130> night<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:45.030> might<00:04:45.419> be<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:46.140> small

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
using and night that might be a small

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.050 
using and night that might be a small
part<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.890> but<00:04:47.070> what<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.220> think<00:04:47.550> happened<00:04:47.700> is

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
part of it but what I think happened is

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.870 
part of it but what I think happened is
that<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.300> use<00:04:48.630> my<00:04:48.810> brain<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:50.130> moved<00:04:50.430> around

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
that I use my brain and I moved around

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.350 
that I use my brain and I moved around
the<00:04:51.419> map<00:04:51.950> cautiously<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:53.070> was<00:04:53.430> not<00:04:53.729> being<00:04:54.150> all

the map cautiously I was not being all
Rambo<00:04:54.840> there<00:04:55.110> were<00:04:55.229> occasions<00:04:55.680> where<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:55.890> were

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
Rambo there were occasions where I were

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.980 
Rambo there were occasions where I were
but<00:04:56.850> I<00:04:56.880> wasn't<00:04:57.120> just<00:04:57.300> running<00:04:57.690> out<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:57.900> the

was I was trying to be a little stealthy

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.620

I<00:05:04.350> was<00:05:04.650> trying<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.220> get<00:05:05.520> into<00:05:05.729> engagements

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
I was trying to get into engagements

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.839 
I was trying to get into engagements
where<00:05:07.140> I<00:05:07.200> was<00:05:07.470> up<00:05:07.650> close<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:08.130> personal<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:08.640> I

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
where I was up close and personal and I

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.120 
where I was up close and personal and I
didn't<00:05:09.180> have<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.630> aim<00:05:09.870> down<00:05:10.110> sight<00:05:10.470> or<00:05:10.860> if<00:05:11.039> I

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
didn't have to aim down sight or if I

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.010 
didn't have to aim down sight or if I
did<00:05:11.280> have<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.580> aim<00:05:11.700> down<00:05:11.880> sight<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.360> was<00:05:12.780> close

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
did have to aim down sight I was close

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.570 
did have to aim down sight I was close
enough<00:05:13.260> where<00:05:13.470> I<00:05:13.530> wouldn't<00:05:13.860> lose<00:05:14.039> the<00:05:14.190> target

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
enough where I wouldn't lose the target

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.790 
enough where I wouldn't lose the target
but<00:05:14.940> for<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.180> most<00:05:15.300> part<00:05:15.419> I<00:05:15.720> was<00:05:16.110> hip<00:05:16.530> firing

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
but for the most part I was hip firing

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.950 
but for the most part I was hip firing
because<00:05:17.220> if<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.430> could<00:05:17.610> hipfire<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.240> wouldn't

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
because if I could hipfire I wouldn't

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.630 
because if I could hipfire I wouldn't
lose<00:05:19.110> my<00:05:19.320> target<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:19.919> knew<00:05:20.099> that<00:05:20.400> with<00:05:20.550> the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
lose my target and I knew that with the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.180 
lose my target and I knew that with the
high<00:05:20.820> rpm<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.510> enemy<00:05:21.840> was<00:05:21.930> going<00:05:22.229> to<00:05:22.380> fall<00:05:22.680> so

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
high rpm the enemy was going to fall so

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.350 
high rpm the enemy was going to fall so
for<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.430> most<00:05:23.550> part<00:05:23.760> that's<00:05:24.000> what<00:05:24.150> I<00:05:24.180> was

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
for the most part that's what I was

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.640 
for the most part that's what I was
doing<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:24.780> you're<00:05:24.930> going<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.140> see<00:05:25.349> in<00:05:25.530> this

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
doing and you're going to see in this

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.740 
doing and you're going to see in this
video<00:05:25.830> if<00:05:26.220> there<00:05:26.729> is<00:05:26.880> a<00:05:26.910> target<00:05:27.150> off<00:05:27.450> in<00:05:27.690> the

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
video if there is a target off in the

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.540 
video if there is a target off in the
distance<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:28.289> won't<00:05:28.560> even<00:05:28.650> go<00:05:29.010> for<00:05:29.250> them<00:05:29.400> i'll

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
distance I won't even go for them i'll

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.279 
distance I won't even go for them i'll
probably<00:05:29.760> spot<00:05:30.240> them<00:05:30.479> but<00:05:30.900> i<00:05:30.930> won't<00:05:31.110> even

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
probably spot them but i won't even

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.140 
probably spot them but i won't even
shoot<00:05:31.560> at<00:05:31.680> them<00:05:31.800> because<00:05:32.039> if<00:05:32.370> i<00:05:32.460> know<00:05:32.520> i<00:05:32.729> go<00:05:33.000> for

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
shoot at them because if i know i go for

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.150 
shoot at them because if i know i go for
the<00:05:33.270> engagement<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:33.960> it's<00:05:34.320> it's<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.710> gunfight

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
the engagement and it's it's a gunfight

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.339 
the engagement and it's it's a gunfight
they're<00:05:35.789> gonna<00:05:35.970> win<00:05:36.270> nine<00:05:36.630> out<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.870> ten<00:05:37.169> i

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
they're gonna win nine out of ten i

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.050 
they're gonna win nine out of ten i
might<00:05:37.590> get<00:05:37.740> lucky<00:05:37.950> on<00:05:38.130> occasion<00:05:38.640> and<00:05:38.789> I<00:05:38.849> did

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
might get lucky on occasion and I did

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.180 
might get lucky on occasion and I did
get<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.240> lucky<00:05:39.570> sometimes<00:05:40.530> but<00:05:40.800> for<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.039> most

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
get a lucky sometimes but for the most

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.550 
get a lucky sometimes but for the most
part<00:05:41.340> they<00:05:42.210> would<00:05:42.450> just<00:05:42.690> wipe<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.289> floor<00:05:43.530> with

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
part they would just wipe the floor with

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.890 
part they would just wipe the floor with
me<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.130> I<00:05:44.220> would<00:05:44.490> just<00:05:44.580> move<00:05:44.789> on<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.000> spawn<00:05:45.390> so

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
me and I would just move on and spawn so

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.750 
me and I would just move on and spawn so
what<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.140> would<00:05:46.410> do<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.830> I<00:05:46.860> would<00:05:47.010> spot<00:05:47.370> them<00:05:47.580> i

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
what I would do is I would spot them i

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.279 
what I would do is I would spot them i
would<00:05:48.030> use<00:05:48.300> objectives<00:05:48.960> that<00:05:49.050> are<00:05:49.110> in<00:05:49.260> front

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
would use objectives that are in front

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.290 
would use objectives that are in front
of<00:05:49.560> me<00:05:49.710> try<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.130> flank<00:05:50.490> them<00:05:50.700> and<00:05:50.940> take<00:05:51.120> them

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
of me try to flank them and take them

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.969 
of me try to flank them and take them
out<00:05:51.450> and<00:05:51.479> for<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:51.990> most<00:05:52.110> part<00:05:52.229> that<00:05:52.590> was<00:05:52.770> a

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
out and for the most part that was a

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.370 
out and for the most part that was a
very<00:05:53.310> effective<00:05:53.789> way<00:05:53.970> at<00:05:54.419> using<00:05:54.990> this<00:05:55.200> weapon

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
very effective way at using this weapon

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.010 
very effective way at using this weapon
and<00:05:55.770> it<00:05:56.130> was<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.340> lot<00:05:56.910> of<00:05:56.940> fun<00:05:57.419> you're<00:05:57.630> gonna<00:05:57.720> see

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
and it was a lot of fun you're gonna see

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.550 
and it was a lot of fun you're gonna see
on<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.830> operation<00:05:59.430> Metro<00:05:59.820> clip<00:06:00.479> i<00:06:00.599> used<00:06:01.020> the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
on the operation Metro clip i used the

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.010 
on the operation Metro clip i used the
mini-map<00:06:02.070> to<00:06:02.370> my<00:06:02.550> advantage<00:06:02.880> every<00:06:03.780> single

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
mini-map to my advantage every single

mini-map to my advantage every single
time<00:06:04.380> that<00:06:04.410> I<00:06:04.590> could<00:06:04.890> if<00:06:05.160> I<00:06:05.550> saw<00:06:05.760> enemy<00:06:06.180> on<00:06:06.270> the

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
time that I could if I saw enemy on the

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.820 
time that I could if I saw enemy on the
mini-map<00:06:06.539> I<00:06:06.810> would<00:06:06.990> wait<00:06:07.200> for<00:06:07.410> them<00:06:07.530> to<00:06:07.560> round

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
mini-map I would wait for them to round

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.350 
mini-map I would wait for them to round
the<00:06:07.950> corner<00:06:08.220> I<00:06:08.340> usually<00:06:08.490> wouldn't<00:06:08.970> go<00:06:09.150> out

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
the corner I usually wouldn't go out

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.300 
the corner I usually wouldn't go out

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
excel and try to not use the aspects

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.140 
excel and try to not use the aspects
that<00:06:33.930> are<00:06:34.200> terrible<00:06:35.040> about<00:06:35.340> it<00:06:35.400> and

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
that are terrible about it and

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.280 
that are terrible about it and
essentially<00:06:36.450> that's<00:06:36.690> what<00:06:36.810> i<00:06:36.930> would<00:06:37.080> do<00:06:37.260> to

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
essentially that's what i would do to

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.620 
essentially that's what i would do to
get<00:06:37.770> first<00:06:38.040> place<00:06:38.310> on<00:06:38.610> a<00:06:38.670> couple<00:06:39.300> of<00:06:39.480> these

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
get first place on a couple of these

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.780 
get first place on a couple of these
matches<00:06:40.110> it<00:06:40.290> did<00:06:40.560> take<00:06:40.800> some<00:06:40.830> adjustment<00:06:41.370> but

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
matches it did take some adjustment but

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.580 
matches it did take some adjustment but
once<00:06:42.030> I<00:06:42.150> got<00:06:42.270> used<00:06:42.330> to<00:06:42.630> it<00:06:42.660> it<00:06:42.900> was<00:06:43.020> an<00:06:43.110> absolute

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
once I got used to it it was an absolute

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.830 
once I got used to it it was an absolute
blast<00:06:43.800> I<00:06:44.130> wouldn't<00:06:44.700> recommend<00:06:45.030> this<00:06:45.360> weapon

if i was going to improve upon this

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.180 
if i was going to improve upon this
setup<00:07:09.300> I<00:07:09.510> would<00:07:09.870> slap<00:07:10.169> on<00:07:10.380> any<00:07:10.650> scope<00:07:10.919> and<00:07:11.100> I

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
setup I would slap on any scope and I

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.280 
setup I would slap on any scope and I
really<00:07:11.580> mean<00:07:11.820> any<00:07:12.180> scope<00:07:12.570> I<00:07:12.750> would<00:07:12.930> also<00:07:13.080> use

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
really mean any scope I would also use

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.520 
really mean any scope I would also use
the<00:07:14.190> fore<00:07:14.460> grip<00:07:14.669> and<00:07:14.910> the<00:07:15.660> flash<00:07:15.960> suppressor

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
the fore grip and the flash suppressor

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.170 
the fore grip and the flash suppressor
to<00:07:16.770> reduce<00:07:17.040> that<00:07:17.220> recoil<00:07:17.610> like<00:07:17.850> I<00:07:18.000> said

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
to reduce that recoil like I said

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.180 
to reduce that recoil like I said
earlier<00:07:18.210> the<00:07:18.900> recoil<00:07:19.440> it<00:07:19.650> just<00:07:19.830> kicks<00:07:20.070> all

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
earlier the recoil it just kicks all

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.680 
earlier the recoil it just kicks all
over<00:07:20.430> the<00:07:20.490> place<00:07:20.700> and<00:07:20.940> if<00:07:21.270> you<00:07:21.360> can<00:07:21.510> reduce

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 
over the place and if you can reduce

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.510 
over the place and if you can reduce
that<00:07:22.020> just<00:07:22.410> a<00:07:22.500> little<00:07:22.710> bit<00:07:22.860> it's<00:07:23.280> going<00:07:23.460> to

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 
that just a little bit it's going to

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.190 
that just a little bit it's going to
make<00:07:23.669> your<00:07:23.880> experience<00:07:24.120> a<00:07:24.600> lot<00:07:24.930> more

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
make your experience a lot more

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.470 
make your experience a lot more
enjoyable<00:07:25.530> I<00:07:25.890> really<00:07:26.430> wouldn't<00:07:26.669> go<00:07:26.880> with<00:07:27.240> the

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:27.480 
enjoyable I really wouldn't go with the

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.150 
enjoyable I really wouldn't go with the
heavy<00:07:27.750> barrel<00:07:27.960> because<00:07:28.230> in<00:07:28.590> my<00:07:28.710> opinion<00:07:28.800> you

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
heavy barrel because in my opinion you

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.560 
heavy barrel because in my opinion you
really<00:07:29.430> shouldn't<00:07:29.669> be<00:07:29.790> going<00:07:29.910> for<00:07:30.270> a<00:07:30.300> longer

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
really shouldn't be going for a longer

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.820 
really shouldn't be going for a longer
shot<00:07:30.870> so<00:07:31.110> you<00:07:31.169> should<00:07:31.320> probably<00:07:31.350> just<00:07:31.710> be

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830 
shot so you should probably just be

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.010 
shot so you should probably just be
staying<00:07:32.040> up<00:07:32.190> close<00:07:32.430> so<00:07:33.030> i<00:07:33.060> think<00:07:33.480> that<00:07:33.870> the

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
staying up close so i think that the

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.570 
staying up close so i think that the
flash<00:07:34.260> suppressor<00:07:34.770> and<00:07:34.890> the<00:07:35.010> foregrip<00:07:35.370> is<00:07:35.550> a

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 
flash suppressor and the foregrip is a

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.730 
flash suppressor and the foregrip is a
good<00:07:35.880> complement<00:07:36.450> to<00:07:36.510> the<00:07:36.630> famas<00:07:36.990> but<00:07:37.590> thats

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
good complement to the famas but thats

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.380 
good complement to the famas but thats
