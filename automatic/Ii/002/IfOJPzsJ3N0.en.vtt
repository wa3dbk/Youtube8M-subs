that<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.070> catch<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> be

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that you can catch here is going to be

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.080 
that you can catch here is going to be
level<00:01:43.320> 6<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.799> could<00:01:44.009> either<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.369> males<00:01:44.729> females

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
level 6 it could either be males females

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.990 
level 6 it could either be males females
just<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.750> any<00:01:46.049> Pokemon<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.850> what<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> would

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
just like any Pokemon and what I would

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 
just like any Pokemon and what I would
recommend<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.170> use<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.380> low<00:01:49.740> leveled

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
recommend is to use a low leveled

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280 
recommend is to use a low leveled
Pokemon<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.240> weaken<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
Pokemon so you can just weaken it a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
Pokemon so you can just weaken it a
little<00:01:52.500> bit<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:52.770> catching<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.579> weakened

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
little bit because catching a weakened

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
little bit because catching a weakened
Pokemon<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.420> always<00:01:54.810> easier<00:01:55.200> than<00:01:55.439> catching<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
Pokemon is always easier than catching a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
Pokemon is always easier than catching a
pokemon<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.430> has<00:01:56.549> full<00:01:56.700> health<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.210> we're

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
pokemon that has full health so we're

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.749 
pokemon that has full health so we're
just<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.340> bit<00:01:59.579> we're

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
just going to do that a little bit we're

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.249 
just going to do that a little bit we're
gonna<00:01:59.850> I'm<00:02:00.149> gonna<00:02:00.210> spam<00:02:00.570> some<00:02:00.750> quick<00:02:00.960> attacks
