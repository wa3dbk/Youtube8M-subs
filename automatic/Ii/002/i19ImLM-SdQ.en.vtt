00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.810
 Good afternoon, dear friends today 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.700
 would like to show you the bag from 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.000
 producer file ivan tactical 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.360
 it's called a tactical rush map file 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.859
 6 The map abbreviation stands for 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.570
 Mobile operations at each month b bag 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 this 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.060
 interesting in the first place because it can 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.400
 have multiple wearing options one 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.640
 one of them is just like ordinary shoulder 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.200
 bag and the second option is she can 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.440
 be used to attach to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.879
 main purchase additional volume 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.559
 that 's what attracted me to this stuff 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.719
 because I wanted 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.840
 some kind of universally not very big 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.890
 compact bag for some small 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.739
 tasks and I stopped the election on her 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.500
 because products from other manufacturers 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.070
 I was not satisfied with both the price and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.379
 its functionality seems to me that in 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.120
 This bag is laid very huge 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.979
 potential in terms of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.260
 functionality and now I'll tell you everything 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.750
 I 'll start with the bag inspection 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.750
 front panel we have here 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.939
 here 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.159
 set this area for attaching packs 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.640
 patch is installed here from my group 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.340
 of blood 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.310
 this is the first positive please be 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.740
 very attentive if you choose 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.490
 such a patch so as not to be mistaken and not 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.820
 put neither your blood type so 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.820
 be careful 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.650
 Further, and here we have all Rashid and I pray 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.689
 fixings there is one that still 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.360
 logo 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.880
 file field of the way new 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.880
 option logo 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 511 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.710
 front pocket is we have a 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.000
 organizer 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.799
 great everything is perfectly organized here 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.380
 there are two pockets for pens one big 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.009
 pocket for example under my flashlight it 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.090
 ball fair there are two more of these small 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.980
 pockets on the bottom have a paracord motorboat 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.440
 fits quietly and there is still 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.989
 such two large volumes calmly 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.180
 put some multitulle let's say in 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.860
 case 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.390
 only when opening you have to be 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.709
 careful that this matter does not fall out 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.160
 there is still such a big one 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.489
 pocket 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.290
 deep and two carbine bag 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.090
 designed for both left-handers and 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.090
 right handers so here everything is symmetrical 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.400
 so the main department we have here is 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.720
 organization it opens to its full length 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:54.359
 and here everything is very interesting and good 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.760
 organized we have here so here 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.780
 pocket bag in which no problem 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.370
 fits this from the quarter I flask 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.040
 next we have two pockets one on 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:13.510
 the grid is another simple always bistro 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:16.180
 put the hard drive always cable in 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.769
 The bundle includes such fastenings. 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.200
 this I will tell a little later for what 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.000
 they are needed 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.000
 This is one of the advantages of this bag. 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.500
 it closes all things on the wave of likes 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.540
 and kei very good quality lightning 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.240
 with accessories here problems in general 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.410
 no and 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:43.550
 as you have already noticed all the lightning 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:48.620
 threw such a hood checks from moisture 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:52.570
 mole handle on the side of this handle there 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.850
 two eyes I put them in makeup loki 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.280
 then tell you why I did it 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.130
 we have these side panels 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.240
 Molly mounts and here I already hung 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.970
 fastening elements 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.400
 This mate Fasteks for 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.940
 fixing just the bags in quality 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.520
 additional volume to the backpack 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.650
 at the back we have here 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.390
 such a pocket on wave 2 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:27.560
 the tablet fits right in here 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:31.430
 besides here we have two such 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.160
 here are little carabiner but I don't know for 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.340
 what is it done here are these two little girls 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.680
 here maybe if anyone knows write 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.530
 in the comments because I have not found 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.530
 why do we need these two devices 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.919
 The design of this pocket has a very 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:59.409
 an interesting such system ie lightning 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:05.389
 we are in a state 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:08.270
 form such cavities here it is necessary for 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.210
 so that you can both the left side 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:17.360
 so on the right they reach for the lightning 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:19.310
 one left-handed and right-handed grip on the 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.180
 for carrying that is strap with us 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.750
 mounted such a pocket this pocket 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.770
 It has 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.469
 velcro patch field and 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.300
 pain system inside pocket here we have 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:36.469
 such a screed on it can be fixed 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:40.729
 smartphone besides here still such 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:43.069
 cable exit hole behind 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.169
 we have pockets through this 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:47.599
 space that is here you can probably 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.599
 something to insert some kind of flashlight or 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:55.250
 something like that 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:57.710
 well this space is a pass-through on the very 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:03.949
 straps mounted Fasteks Fasteks has 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:07.639
 the hood of such a bag comes off 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:11.419
 made of nylon density is 1050 d 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:14.210
 in my opinion optimally what else 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.240
 there is something interesting behind the handle 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.800
 pocket padded with soft material 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.020
 it is convenient to wear glasses here for example 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.870
 some shots like arguing with me 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:28.629
 can any communicator phones 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.629
 also wear it is not scratched 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.370
 further down the bag we have nothing 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.200
 spaces not involved in any way 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.200
 only one water outlet 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.990
 the strap itself is rearranged as for 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.070
 right handed so for left handed 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:59.110
 it's all done very quickly and there is more 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.110
 Here is such a soft pad for the shoulder 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:07.930
 what's interesting is that in the middle 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:12.340
 bags there is such a hidden stealth pocket 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:14.960
 for hidden here everything is velcro sheathed and 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.870
 pocket on fork too here 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.280
 there is such a loop for a photo and 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:25.790
 screenshots of emergency sharp opening 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:31.640
 that's the whole look of the bag bag 6 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:33.860
 liters in volume has the following 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.240
 I will devote part of the review just the same 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:41.300
 against this bag on the body and in the way 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.530
 and generally wear stay on channel 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.530
 it will be interesting
