and<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:01.980> exactly<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.699> we've<00:01:02.820> done<00:01:03.000> with

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and that's exactly what we've done with

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.660 
and that's exactly what we've done with
the<00:01:03.210> par<00:01:03.390> 200<00:01:03.930> keeping<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> gist

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
the par 200 keeping with a gist
principle<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.510> basically<00:01:07.020> divided<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> par

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
principle we basically divided the par

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.030 
principle we basically divided the par

where you can select your transmitter
what<00:01:24.090> you'll<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.420> hearing<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.830> allow<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
what you'll be hearing and allow you to

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.210 
what you'll be hearing and allow you to
go<00:01:26.670> into<00:01:26.820> split<00:01:27.270> mode<00:01:27.740> which<00:01:28.740> allows<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
go into split mode which allows the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.969 
go into split mode which allows the
pilot<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.119> com1<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.409> copilot<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
pilot to be on com1 and the copilot to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.850 
pilot to be on com1 and the copilot to
be<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.189> com2<00:01:33.020> you'll<00:01:34.020> notice<00:01:34.409> when<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> went

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
be on com2 you'll notice when I went

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.789 
be on com2 you'll notice when I went
into<00:01:34.979> split<00:01:35.310> mode<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.909> lights<00:01:36.240> change

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
into split mode these lights change

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
into split mode these lights change
because<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:38.850> split<00:01:39.240> mode

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
because when you go into split mode

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.960 
because when you go into split mode
either<00:01:40.320> pilot<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.280> hear<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> other

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
either pilot can hear what the other

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
either pilot can hear what the other
pilot<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.570> hearing<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.740> normally<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> don't

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
pilot is hearing so normally you don't

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.249 
pilot is hearing so normally you don't
want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.820> intercom<00:01:45.210> capability<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.110> we

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
want to have intercom capability so we

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
want to have intercom capability so we
turn<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> inter<00:01:46.770> come<00:01:46.979> off<00:01:47.130> however<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
turn the inter come off however if the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.520 
turn the inter come off however if the
pilot<00:01:48.630> says<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.869> want<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> talk<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.409> the
