00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.919
 in the silence of your soul 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.919
 hide the most beautiful secrets of your heart 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.230
 in the silence of nature 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.310
 Diaz whispers through the birds and other creatures 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.770
 silent 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.190
 with a friend 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.910
 wonderful conversations are discovered that the word would be unable to 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.900
 verbalize 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.420
 at work quiet and quiet 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420
 the gifts of the people become visible 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.000
 between noises and hurry 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 silence can be the best weapon you have available to approach God and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.000
 yourself 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.260
 silence is not the absence of departures 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.910
 is a quiet state in which you can verbalize more clearly than 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.070
 to yourself 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 what moves inside 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.360
 the word 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.360
 When it is clear and sincere, it brings us closer to others 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.890
 it helps us to get to know 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 it shows us what others think and live 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.060
 the silence 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.300
 is the largest communication operator we can get with a human being 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.780
 loneliness is not silence 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.780
 Silence is not loneliness 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 life is shared gandola 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.740
 the silence 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.450
 it is shared being next to the one who suffers 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.080
 the one who loves 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 the one who leads the polls simple musical chord 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.370
 offers the sacred chest of your silence 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.999
 share from what you are 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.829
 from what you live 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.829
 from what you cry and from where you rejoice 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.629
 speechless 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.629
 I just know what you are 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.579
 silence is the biggest communication operator 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.309
