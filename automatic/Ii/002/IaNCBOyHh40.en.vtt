the<00:06:16.539> system<00:06:16.930> is<00:06:17.229> that<00:06:17.289> online<00:06:17.650> and<00:06:18.129> I<00:06:18.189> can<00:06:18.370> use

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
the system is that online and I can use

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.999 
the system is that online and I can use
the<00:06:20.319> realize<00:06:20.649> again<00:06:22.529> take<00:06:23.529> a<00:06:23.559> peek<00:06:23.830> inside
