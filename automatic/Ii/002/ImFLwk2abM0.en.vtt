it's<00:00:06.930> really<00:00:07.200> good<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.590> document<00:00:08.160> how<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> piece

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
it's really good to document how a piece

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.390 
it's really good to document how a piece
goes<00:00:09.360> together<00:00:09.600> that<00:00:10.230> way<00:00:10.379> when<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:10.980> go<00:00:11.160> back

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
goes together that way when you go back

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
goes together that way when you go back
to<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.730> piece<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.240> start<00:00:12.330> building<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.930> back

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
to the piece and start building it back

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.709 
to the piece and start building it back
up<00:00:13.139> it's<00:00:13.860> really<00:00:14.100> easy<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.580> see<00:00:14.879> how<00:00:15.240> joints

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
up it's really easy to see how joints

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.140 
up it's really easy to see how joints
connect<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.440> how<00:00:16.529> fabric<00:00:17.010> goes<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:18.000> it's
