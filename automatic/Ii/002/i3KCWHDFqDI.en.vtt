for two years tiny baby turtles we weigh
and<00:01:47.280> measure<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.700> every<00:01:48.000> month<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.390> order<00:01:48.510> to

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
and measure them every month in order to

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.910 
and measure them every month in order to
make<00:01:48.810> sure<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> they're<00:01:49.260> growing<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.800> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
make sure that they're growing and that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.580 
make sure that they're growing and that
they're<00:01:50.070> healthy<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:52.020> couple<00:01:52.470> months

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
they're healthy and then a couple months

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.260 
they're healthy and then a couple months
before<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.070> release<00:01:53.340> them<00:01:53.490> into<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> wild<00:01:53.820> we

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
before we release them into the wild we

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
before we release them into the wild we
take<00:01:54.509> them<00:01:54.690> into<00:01:54.840> an<00:01:55.020> outdoor<00:01:55.200> holding<00:01:55.710> area

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
take them into an outdoor holding area

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.730 
take them into an outdoor holding area
so<00:01:56.340> they<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.820> used<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.180> being<00:01:57.450> outside<00:01:57.740> we

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
so they can get used to being outside we

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.560 
so they can get used to being outside we
feed<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.100> live<00:01:59.400> food<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.970> earthworms<00:02:00.210> so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
feed them live food like earthworms so

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.940 
feed them live food like earthworms so
they<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:00.960> used<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.229> catching<00:02:01.619> moving

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
they can get used to catching moving

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
they can get used to catching moving
prey<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:02.970> after<00:02:03.300> we<00:02:03.420> release<00:02:03.690> them<00:02:03.869> into

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
prey and then after we release them into

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
prey and then after we release them into
a<00:02:04.170> safe<00:02:04.470> place<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> wild<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.909> monitor<00:02:06.330> them

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
a safe place in the wild we monitor them

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.050 
a safe place in the wild we monitor them
to<00:02:06.750> determine<00:02:07.020> their<00:02:07.259> survival<00:02:07.710> rates<00:02:08.060> thanks

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
to determine their survival rates thanks

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.790 
to determine their survival rates thanks
