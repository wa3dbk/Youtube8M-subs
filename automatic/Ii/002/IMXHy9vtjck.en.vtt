00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
strong thing I just see it as an issue

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.709 
strong thing I just see it as an issue
that<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:32.669> left<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.090> doesn't<00:00:33.360> want<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> deal

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.380 
that the left just doesn't want to deal
with<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.230> am<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.829> wrong<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.210> want

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
with it all am I wrong I think we want

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.549 
with it all am I wrong I think we want
to<00:00:36.450> deal<00:00:36.719> with<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.200> mean<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:37.380> know

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to deal with it I mean I don't know

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410

anyone on left too supportive of drones
I<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> problem<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.620> we've<00:00:40.860> convinced

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I think the problem is we've convinced

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.709 
I think the problem is we've convinced
ourselves<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.790> Obama's<00:00:42.300> drones<00:00:42.540> are

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
ourselves that Obama's drones are

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.180 
ourselves that Obama's drones are
somehow<00:00:42.899> softer<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.649> kinder<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.129> gentler

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
somehow softer and kinder and gentler

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
somehow softer and kinder and gentler
than<00:00:44.489> bushes<00:00:45.030> drones<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.809> true<00:00:46.110> oh<00:00:46.469> yeah

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
than bushes drones is that true oh yeah

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.319 
than bushes drones is that true oh yeah
they're<00:00:47.219> much<00:00:47.370> warmer<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.760> fuzzier<00:00:47.820> no<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
they're much warmer and fuzzier no I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.389 
they're much warmer and fuzzier no I
mean<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.660> mean<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.110> truth<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.410> we've<00:00:49.920> simply

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
mean I mean the truth is we've simply

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.850 
mean I mean the truth is we've simply
refused<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> polled<00:00:51.809> President<00:00:52.680> Obama

the<00:01:05.070> left<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.369> upset<00:01:05.670> about<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.060> they

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the left was upset about it and they

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.060 
the left was upset about it and they
pinned<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.540> Bush<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.320> moment<00:01:07.590> Obama<00:01:07.799> comes

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
pinned it on Bush the moment Obama comes

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.590 
pinned it on Bush the moment Obama comes
into<00:01:08.130> office<00:01:08.280> suddenly<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.390> much<00:01:09.540> of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
into office suddenly it's not as much of

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120 
into office suddenly it's not as much of
a<00:01:09.720> priority<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.350> okay<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.680> you're<00:01:10.950> basically

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
a priority just okay so you're basically

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.210 
a priority just okay so you're basically
saying<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.659> crew<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.140> hypocritical<00:01:13.860> on

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

saying that your crew is hypocritical on
the<00:01:14.340> issue<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.970> saying<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.390> crew<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the issue I'm saying my crew is a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.660 
the issue I'm saying my crew is a
contradiction<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.220> part<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
contradiction here I think all part of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.770 
contradiction here I think all part of
all<00:01:17.850> parties<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.360> these<00:01:18.509> types<00:01:18.689> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
all parties have these types of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
all parties have these types of
contradictions<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> left<00:01:20.400> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
contradictions but right now the left is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.480 
contradictions but right now the left is
absolutely<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.600> holding<00:01:22.020> Obama<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:23.250> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
absolutely not holding Obama is that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.310 
absolutely not holding Obama is that
because<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:24.270> feel<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> greater<00:01:24.990> good<00:01:25.259> is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
because they feel the greater good is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.190 
because they feel the greater good is
served<00:01:25.799> by<00:01:26.189> having<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> president<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:28.049> the

served by having the president do the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.130 
served by having the president do the
other<00:01:28.409> things<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> please<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.509> left<00:01:30.750> is

other things that please the left is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
other things that please the left is
that<00:01:31.409> why<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> argument

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that why I think that's the argument

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.910 
that why I think that's the argument
they<00:01:33.390> give<00:01:33.659> whenever<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.110> talk<00:01:34.259> about<00:01:34.680> drones

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
they give whenever I talk about drones

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.469 
they give whenever I talk about drones
even<00:01:35.189> during<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> presidential<00:01:35.790> campaign<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the other part of it is i think people

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440 
the other part of it is i think people
have<00:01:52.950> convinced<00:01:53.460> themselves<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.909> obama<00:01:54.329> is
