collage just my favorite app to like
collage<00:01:55.290> photos<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.070> I've<00:01:56.159> symbol<00:01:56.579> gram

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
collage photos and then I've symbol gram

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.630

so with symbol Graham you can just take
photos<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.149> put<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.540> symbol<00:02:00.899> over<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> or

photos and put like a symbol over it or
like<00:02:01.649> you'll<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> guess<00:02:03.570> I'll<00:02:03.689> just

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
like you'll see so I guess I'll just

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.639

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.940 

so<00:02:12.160> then<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.520> just<00:02:12.670> put<00:02:13.120> like<00:02:13.300> different

so then you can just put like different
stuff<00:02:14.950> over<00:02:15.400> them<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.820> then<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.210> they<00:02:17.020> have
