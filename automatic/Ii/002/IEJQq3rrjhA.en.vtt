00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
been addicted to it ever since

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.460 
been addicted to it ever since
when<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.170> first<00:02:02.530> handled<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.460> chainsaw<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.869> had

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
when I first handled the chainsaw I had

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.729 
when I first handled the chainsaw I had
to<00:02:05.619> drive<00:02:05.860> home<00:02:06.660> your<00:02:07.660> hands<00:02:08.080> hurt<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:08.500> much

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
to drive home your hands hurt so much

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.620 
to drive home your hands hurt so much
I'd<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.280> hold<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.670> wheel<00:02:09.820> with<00:02:10.090> one<00:02:10.300> hand

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
I'd have to hold the wheel with one hand

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.850 
I'd have to hold the wheel with one hand
for<00:02:10.750> five<00:02:11.140> minutes

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
for five minutes

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.040 
for five minutes
then<00:02:12.310> use<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.700> other<00:02:12.730> hand<00:02:13.180> rest<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.780> one

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
then use the other hand rest that one

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.600 
then use the other hand rest that one
for<00:02:14.320> five<00:02:14.530> minutes<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.070> keep<00:02:15.280> switching

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
for five minutes and keep switching

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.970 
for five minutes and keep switching
hands<00:02:16.239> because<00:02:16.810> until<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.380> build<00:02:17.590> up<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
hands because until you build up the
