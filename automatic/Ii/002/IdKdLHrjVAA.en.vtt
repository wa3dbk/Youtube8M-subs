information stuff this my why isn't just
used<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.700> Wi-Fi<00:01:15.060> tethering<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.200> also

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
used for Wi-Fi tethering you can also

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.050 
used for Wi-Fi tethering you can also
use<00:01:16.439> USB<00:01:17.009> tethering<00:01:17.400> which<00:01:17.610> means<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> can

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
use USB tethering which means you can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
use USB tethering which means you can
connect<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.479> itunes<00:01:18.930> without<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.680> cable<00:01:20.009> but

you can all we do that if you have iOS 5
you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.920> also<00:01:23.040> use<00:01:23.130> Bluetooth<00:01:23.640> tethering<00:01:23.880> so

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you can also use Bluetooth tethering so

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.050 
you can also use Bluetooth tethering so
that<00:01:24.390> means<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.750> connect<00:01:24.990> bluetooth<00:01:25.409> and

that means you can connect bluetooth and
my<00:01:27.060> Y<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> man<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.140> configure<00:01:28.439> it

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
my Y on the man you can configure it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.120 
my Y on the man you can configure it
down<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.729> yet<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> Wi-Fi<00:01:30.420> sharing<00:01:30.689> settings

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
down here yet the Wi-Fi sharing settings

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.170 
down here yet the Wi-Fi sharing settings
it's<00:01:32.130> extremely<00:01:32.490> simple<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.939> set<00:01:33.150> up

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it's extremely simple to set up

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
it's extremely simple to set up
basically<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.960> need<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.320> turn<00:01:34.680> on
