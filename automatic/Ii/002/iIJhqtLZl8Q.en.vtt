00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.490 

and<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.310> cpu<00:02:16.700> heatsink<00:02:16.730> comes<00:02:17.540> bundled<00:02:18.230> with

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and the cpu heatsink comes bundled with

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.650 
and the cpu heatsink comes bundled with
the<00:02:18.769> with<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:19.250> case<00:02:19.459> or<00:02:21.730> separately<00:02:22.730> okay<00:02:23.000> so

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
you can actually use the case with

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.440 
you can actually use the case with
another<00:02:25.190> heat<00:02:25.400> sink<00:02:25.610> as<00:02:25.700> well<00:02:25.849> if<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.120> want<00:02:26.300> it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
another heat sink as well if you want it

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:37.230 
another heat sink as well if you want it
right

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.030

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
so you can run these video cards

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.680 
so you can run these video cards
completely<00:02:39.670> passively<00:02:40.540> or<00:02:41.850> actually<00:02:42.850> any
