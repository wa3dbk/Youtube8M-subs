00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.390 
over here just because of her bed it's
really<00:05:24.060> big<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.570> I<00:05:25.530> want<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.830> use<00:05:25.979> it<00:05:26.159> but<00:05:26.340> I

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
really big and I want to use it but I

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.010 
really big and I want to use it but I
don't<00:05:26.550> really<00:05:26.729> have<00:05:27.000> another<00:05:27.360> place<00:05:27.630> for<00:05:27.900> it

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
don't really have another place for it

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.029 
don't really have another place for it
and<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.650> want<00:05:28.889> to<00:05:29.159> try<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:29.760> take<00:05:30.710> maybe<00:05:31.710> this

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
and I want to try and take maybe this

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.430 
and I want to try and take maybe this
side<00:05:32.310> off<00:05:32.550> or<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.000> side<00:05:33.240> over<00:05:33.599> there<00:05:33.870> just

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
side off or the side over there just

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.529 
side off or the side over there just
because<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.800> would<00:05:35.010> give<00:05:35.190> them<00:05:35.909> much<00:05:36.270> more

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
because I would give them much more

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.050 
because I would give them much more
space<00:05:37.139> it<00:05:37.440> would<00:05:37.530> really<00:05:37.650> open<00:05:37.889> up<00:05:38.250> my<00:05:38.820> doll

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060
