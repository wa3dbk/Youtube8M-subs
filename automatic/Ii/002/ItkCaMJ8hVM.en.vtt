council room or attendances can make

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.970 
council room or attendances can make
some<00:00:04.830> executive<00:00:05.580> decisions<00:00:06.029> about<00:00:06.150> his<00:00:06.420> army

he's<00:00:07.980> going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> choose<00:00:08.580> between<00:00:08.610> three

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
he's going to choose between three

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.080 
he's going to choose between three
entirely<00:00:09.900> different<00:00:10.260> units<00:00:10.559> based<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.400> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
entirely different units based on the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.700 
entirely different units based on the
Protoss<00:00:12.540> faction<00:00:12.990> from<00:00:13.139> which<00:00:13.259> they<00:00:13.440> came

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
Protoss faction from which they came

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.640 
Protoss faction from which they came
from<00:00:14.269> now<00:00:15.269> not<00:00:15.450> any<00:00:15.750> one<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> these<00:00:16.170> units<00:00:16.470> is

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
from now not any one of these units is

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.590 
from now not any one of these units is
better<00:00:16.859> than<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> other<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:18.390> what's

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
better than the other one but what's

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.660 
better than the other one but what's
different<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.199> how<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.529> enemy<00:00:20.010> or<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
different is how this enemy or how this

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.250 
different is how this enemy or how this
unit<00:00:21.000> engages<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.660> enemy<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
unit engages the enemy on the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.040 
unit engages the enemy on the
battlefield<00:00:23.150> so<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.449> three<00:00:24.810> different

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
battlefield so there are three different

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.109 
battlefield so there are three different
types<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.590> zealous<00:00:25.890> three<00:00:26.550> different<00:00:26.880> types

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
types of zealous three different types

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.519 
types of zealous three different types
of<00:00:27.269> stalkers<00:00:29.150> now<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> video<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> kind

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
of stalkers now I have a video to kind

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
of stalkers now I have a video to kind
of<00:00:31.650> illustrate<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.340> differences<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.969> how

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
of illustrate the differences of how

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
of illustrate the differences of how

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
these units engage the enemy so this is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
dune now this unit isn't necessarily

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.420 
dune now this unit isn't necessarily
better<00:01:28.570> than<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.930> one<00:01:29.080> you<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:29.230> saw<00:01:29.560> but

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
better than the one you just saw but

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.650 
better than the one you just saw but
because<00:01:30.760> of<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:31.030> weapon<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.510> they're

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
because of this weapon that they're

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.420 
because of this weapon that they're
carrying<00:01:31.870> now<00:01:32.140> they<00:01:32.350> engage<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.980> enemy<00:01:33.010> much

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
carrying now they engage the enemy much

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.790 
carrying now they engage the enemy much
differently<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.960> let's<00:01:35.140> take<00:01:35.260> a<00:01:35.290> look<00:01:35.530> at<00:01:35.650> how

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
differently so let's take a look at how

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.220 
differently so let's take a look at how
this<00:01:36.040> new<00:01:36.400> irons<00:01:36.910> elit<00:01:37.270> handles<00:01:37.870> that<00:01:37.960> same

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
this new irons elit handles that same

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:56.840 
this new irons elit handles that same
situation

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.020 

that<00:01:57.850> one<00:01:58.060> turned<00:01:58.210> out<00:01:58.330> much<00:01:58.510> different
