like<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:25.100> you<00:04:25.280> can<00:04:25.490> make<00:04:25.970> them<00:04:26.300> into<00:04:26.570> a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
like this you can make them into a

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.050 
like this you can make them into a
hamburger<00:04:26.960> or<00:04:27.620> any<00:04:28.190> shape<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.639> your<00:04:28.669> choice

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
but I choose to put them in skewers like

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.580 
but I choose to put them in skewers like
this<00:04:31.970> because<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.449> has<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.630> shape<00:04:32.990> off<00:04:33.289> on<00:04:33.440> their

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
this because it has a shape off on their

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.400 
this because it has a shape off on their
gas<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.789> now<00:04:34.970> all<00:04:35.180> we<00:04:35.330> have<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.660> do<00:04:35.840> is<00:04:36.110> grill
